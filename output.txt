Generations After The First Nuclear Test, Those Sickened Fight For Compensation. On August 6, 1945, a stone-faced President Harry Truman appeared on television and told Americans about the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima. <br /><br />The attack on Hiroshima marked the first time nuclear power was used in war, but the atomic bomb was actually tested a month earlier in the Jornada del Muerto desert of New Mexico. <br /><br />At least hundreds of New Mexicans were harmed by the test's fallout.  Radiation creeped into the grass their cows grazed, on the food they ate, and the water they drank. <br /><br />A program compensating victims of government-caused nuclear contamination has been in place since 1990, but it never included downwinders in New Mexico, the site of the very first nuclear test. <br /><br />This week, the Senate voted to broaden the bi-partisan legislation that could compensate people who have suffered health consequences of radiation testing.
