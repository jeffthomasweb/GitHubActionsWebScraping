      <title>Trump&apos;s Plan for Gaza: American intervention and mass relocation</title>

Trump offered no specifics for his plans sending Palestinians and Israelis scrambling to understand what he means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump&apos;s vague plan to &quot;Make Gaza Beautiful Again&quot; could signal the largest shift in US-Middle East policy in decades and could upend widespread hope for a Palestinian state alongside Israel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;</description>
