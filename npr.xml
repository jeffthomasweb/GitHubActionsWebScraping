      <title>&apos;Bring them home.&apos; Hostages&apos; families cry.</title>
      <description>It was a night of mourning on Tuesday, when Doug Emhoff, second gentlemen and the first Jewish spouse to a US president or Vice president, spoke at the Adas Israel Congregation in Washington DC.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emhoff was one of more than a thousand people attending a prayer vigil dedicated to six hostages recently killed by Hamas. Their bodies were recovered over the weekend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deaths of the six hostages comes as it&apos;s been more than 300 days since Hamas took more than 240 people hostage after it attacked Israel on October 7th.  As the days in captivity drag on, many have been killed, and their families live in agony. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of those family members is LeElle Slifer, who&apos;s cousin Carmel Gat was one of the six hostages killed.  She shares what her cousin meant to her and what her family wants from the Israeli government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</description>
