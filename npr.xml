      <title>Childhood Stamp Collection Opened a Reporter&apos;s Eyes to the World</title>
      <description>Clearing out a closet, attic or garage can be a chore. Old photographs, clothes and books can create clutter, or take up space that&apos;s sometimes needed for something else. But every so often, the heirlooms or mementos that you find retain some value: if that&apos;s emotional value, it can be hard to part with them. If it&apos;s financial, that can make it easier, as Willem Marx hoped it would be with his childhood stamp collection in London.</description>
