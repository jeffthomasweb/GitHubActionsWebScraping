      <title>Climate change is one reason for hotter oceans. But there are others</title>
      <description>Hurricane season is heating up: Hurricane Francine hit Louisiana last week and dumped rain across the South, and forecasters expect more stormy activity in the Atlantic in the next few weeks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A big factor in this stormy weather is our extremely warm oceans.
