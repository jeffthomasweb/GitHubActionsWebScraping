      <title>Biden&apos;s executive actions on immigration send mixed signals</title>
      <description>In early June, President Joe Biden severely restricted asylum requests from migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two weeks later, the President struck a more welcoming tone, saying he&apos;d protect hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Immigration has become a big issue, for both parties. Policy experts say Biden hopes that in a close election year, these executive actions will sway voters to his side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But will that strategy pay off and how will it affect migrants? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NPR&apos;s Adrian Florido speaks with immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd who is reporting from the San Diego border with Mexico.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for Consider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org. &lt;/a&gt;</description>
