      <title>A man let snakes bite him for years. He could be the key to a universal antivenom</title>
      <description>What&apos;s it like to get bit by a venomous snake? &quot;It&apos;s like a bee sting times a thousand,&quot; Tim Friede says. Tim would know. Over the past few decades, he&apos;s let himself be bitten over 200 times by all kinds of venomous snakes — black mambas, taipans, cobras, kraits and more. With time, he&apos;s gradually built immunity to multiple types of venom. Could scientists help him share that immunity with others? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Science reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/people/297147967/ari-daniel&quot;&gt;Ari Daniel&lt;/a&gt; joins Short Wave to explain how antivenom works, what scientists discovered and where the research may lead.
