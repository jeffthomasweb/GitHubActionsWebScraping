      <title>A Key Sticking Point in Gaza Ceasefire Talks</title>
      <description>Work continues towards finding a path to a ceasefire in Gaza. U.S. mediators continue to communicate optimism, while the two sides, Israel and Hamas, seem to downplay the idea that progress is being made on their remaining differences. We hear about one major sticking point. Control of a strip of land in southern Gaza called the Philadelphi Corridor.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the bodies of six Israeli hostages taken captive on October 7th were recovered this week. At funerals we hear friends and family express anger at the Israeli government for not doing enough to bring their loved ones home alive.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more coverage of all sides of this conflict, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/series/1205445976/middle-east-crisis&quot;&gt;npr.org/mideastupdates&lt;/a&gt;</description>
