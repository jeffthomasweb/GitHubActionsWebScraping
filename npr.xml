      <title>Who&apos;s sending Trump back to the White House and why?</title>
      <description>In the days leading up to election night, news outlets across the country were predicting a historically close race, one that could take days to call.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;But as election night progressed, it became clear former President Donald Trump was on a path to victory. So much so, that before anything was official, he thanked his supporters from his campaign headquarters in West Palm Beach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then, Wednesday morning at about 5:30, it became official when the Associated Press called Wisconsin for Trump. We&apos;re still awaiting final tallies, but it appears Trump is on track to win the popular vote for the first time.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump&apos;s agenda for a second term will be dissected over and over in the days ahead. Today, we break down how America sent him back to office --- how Trump won in 2024.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;Email us at considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;</description>
