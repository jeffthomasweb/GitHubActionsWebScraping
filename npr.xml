So he knows a lot about government and finance but he has never held elected office.

We learn more about the man who takes the job at a time of strained relations with the U.S.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the Palestinian city of Nablus, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is so renowned for it&apos;s soap that the process of making it has been listed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.
