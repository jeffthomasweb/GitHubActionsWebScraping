      <title>Investigating the Russia investigations. What&apos;s left to learn?</title>
      <description>The question of whether Russian interference in the 2016 election was a decisive reason Donald Trump won the presidency is one that has dogged Trump for the better part of a decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s also been the subject of numerous investigations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even though that question has been asked and answered, the current Trump administration is launching another investigation in an effort to reach a different conclusion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last month, Trump&apos;s Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, declassified documents and she leveled an unprecedented accusation: The Obama administration knowingly pushed the idea of Russian interference as false narrative to sabotage Trump&apos;s campaign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this week, Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized an investigation into the investigation of his 2016 campaign&apos;s relationship Russia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is there left to learn? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</description>
