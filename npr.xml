      <description>A hundred minutes — that&apos;s how long President Trump had the floor — literally — last night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hundred minutes he used to lay out his agenda, his grievances and what he argued are the accomplishments of his first six weeks in office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This all came during his &quot;joint address&quot; to Congress — the State of the Union that&apos;s not a State of the Union.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Trump returned to office in January, there&apos;s been little room left for democrats to make their case to the American people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Democratic moderates think they have an answer for Trump 2.0.
