      <title>White evangelical Christians are some of Israel&apos;s biggest supporters. Why?</title>
      <description>As war continues to rage in the Middle East, attention has been turned to how American Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians relate to the state of Israel.

But their political support for Israel is a major driver for U.S. policy — in part because Evangelicals make up an organized, dedicated constituency with the numbers to exert major influence on U.S. politics.</description>
