      <title>What we learned from Elian Gonzalez, 25 years later</title>
      <description>Twenty-five years ago, a boy named Elian Gonzalez appeared — remarkably alive — in the waters off the coast of Miami. Immediately, his fate became the subject of an international debate: Should he stay in the U.S.? Or should he be returned to Cuba, to live with his father? From our play cousins at Futuro Studios, this is part of their series &lt;em&gt;Chess Piece: The Elián González Story&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;We want to hear from you!
