      <title>A year after the strike is the UAW still winning?</title>
      <description>A year ago at this time, members of the United Auto Workers Union were feeling powerful and optimistic. The group&apos;s new President Shawn Fain had called a historic strike. For the first time, the Union walked out on ALL three big automakers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a bold move that by most measures worked. It ultimately brought Ford, GM and Stellantis much closer to the union&apos;s demands for historic raises and new job protections. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The strike&apos;s success had people predicting a bigger and more powerful union.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year on the union is still staring down some major challenges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>Exploding Pagers in Lebanon, Raising Tensions between Hezbollah and Israel</title>
      <description>Authorities in Lebanon are blaming Israel for an apparent attack in which pagers, used by Hezbollah in Lebanon, exploded simultaneously. At least nine people were killed, more than 2,700 were injured. Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese paramilitary group backed by Iran, had already been high and there were fears their frequent attacks on each other could escalate into all-out war. We hear about what this all could mean from our correspondent in the region.</description>
