      <title>What is the Future of the Israel-Iran War and Will the U.S. Get Involved?</title>
      <description>The war between Israel and Iran shows no signs of slowing down. There were traffic jams in Tehran with people fleeing after President Trump suggested on social media everyone there evacuate.

And we go to the neighboring countries in the region to see how people are reacting to missiles flying overhead.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more coverage of all sides of this conflict, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://npr.org/mideastupdates&quot;&gt;npr.org/mideastupdates &lt;/a&gt;</description>
