      <title>&apos;Zombie&apos; cells have scientists rethinking how we age — and what to do about it</title>
      <description>It’s no secret that stress isn’t good for you. But just how bad is it? Well, in the last few decades, scientists have linked psychological stress to changes in our DNA that look a lot like what happens on the molecular level as we age.
