      <title>Joe Biden pardons his son. Is that justice?</title>
      <description>Hunter Biden no longer has to worry about going to prison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&apos;s because his father President Joe Biden pardoned him with just weeks left in his presidency. The President&apos;s son was convicted in June on federal gun charges. Hunter Biden lied about his addiction to crack cocaine when he purchased a gun. And he pleaded guilty in September for failing to pay more than a million dollars in federal taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The younger Biden was due to be sentenced in both cases later this month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Biden has granted his son a sweeping pardon. What will that mean for his legacy... and for the future of presidential pardons? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
