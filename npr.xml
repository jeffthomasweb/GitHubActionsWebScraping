      <title>NASA prepares to head back to the moon.</title>
      <description>This time next year, if everything stays on schedule, NASA will send its first crewed mission to the moon, since the end of the Apollo program. Artemis II will be the first flight around the moon in more than 50 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its goal will be to test out the Orion capsule and all the other equipment, so that by 2026, Artemis III can put astronauts back ON the moon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Artemis program is aimed to kickstart a new, more &lt;em&gt;enduring&lt;/em&gt; era of space travel that leads to Mars.It&apos;s also intentionally more representative than Apollo was. The Artemis program will eventually put the first woman on the moon, as well as the first person of color.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s all as historic and high stakes as it gets, and also pretty daunting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NPR&apos;s Scott Detrow goes behind the scenes at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to see how the team is preparing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>Should the U.N. Security Council be Reformed?</title>
      <description>The Security Council is the United Nations&apos; most powerful body, with the ability to impose sanctions and authorize the use of force. There are five permanent members of the council: Russia, France, China, the U.S and Britain. And any one of those permanent members can veto council resolutions. The U.S. is proposing expanding the number of permanent members, including two permanent seats for African countries. We talk to the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. about the proposal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Seoul, South Korea is such a massive city, residents looking to experience nature can face a long journey to reach the countryside. As a result, the city&apos;s parks are catering to urban campers who want to sleep outdoors closer to home. We meet some of them.</description>
