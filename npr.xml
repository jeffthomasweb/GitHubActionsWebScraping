      <title>The European Union Decides to Rearm</title>
      <description>Leaders of the European Union have voted to approve a plan to dramatically increase defense spending. The move is a reaction to the U.S. reducing its support for Ukraine in the war against Russia&apos;s invasion. We go to Brussels to understand the ramifications.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And we hear what the series of recent developments in the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine could mean for peace talks with Russia.</description>

      <title>When it comes to the economy, it&apos;s all about uncertainty</title>
      <description>Like a lot of economists, Mark Zandi, with Moody&apos;s Analytics, thinks President Trump&apos;s across-the-board tariffs are a bad idea. Saying, &quot;Tariffs, broad-based tariffs, are a real problem for the economy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Zandi says – it&apos;s not just the tariffs themselves that are the problem, it&apos;s the uncertainty created by Trump&apos;s rollout. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump threatened 25% Tariffs on Canada and Mexico would start in February. They were paused at the 11th hour, only to eventually go into effect this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Thursday Trump announced the new tariffs would be paused for most products, but potentially only until April 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile tariffs on China snapped into place in February, and then doubled, to 20%.What happens next is anyone&apos;s guess. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Businesses have been optimistic about the economy under Trump. His chaotic tariff rollout threatens that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
