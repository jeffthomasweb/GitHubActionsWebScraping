      <title>Can Trump turn promises into policy?</title>
      <description>Donald Trump becomes the 47th President of the United States in just over a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout his campaign, Trump laid out a list. Things he plans to accomplish in a second term — some on day one. They include: closing the border...imposing tariffs... and ending the war between Russia and Ukraine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump also campaigned on bringing down food prices...in fact, he told NBC&apos;s Kristen Welker, it&apos;s the reason he won.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President-elect Trump has a long to-do list for his first days in office.  How much of it can he actually get done?  A lot says senior Trump advisor Jason Miller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>Will Sectarian Groups Get Along in a New Syria?</title>
      <description>As the future of Syria begins to emerge, one minority group is particularly fearful about how they&apos;ll be treated. The Alawites feel like they were mistreated by now-deposed dictator Bashar al-Assad, but because he was a member of that sect, they are also unfairly tied to him in the minds of other Syrians. We go to an Alawite neighborhood of Damascus to hear their concerns.</description>
