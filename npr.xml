It was unveiled in the spring of 2023, well before Donald Trump had won the republican presidential nomination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It outlined a suite of very conservative policies that would, for example, outlaw the mailing of abortion pills and abolish the department of education. It even suggests a return to the gold standard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It became a democratic talking point, so much so that Trump repeatedly distanced himself from the plan and the authors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now that Trump is in office, releasing his own detailed plans. A lot of them are strikingly similar to the ones laid out in Project 2025. And one of its chief architects is now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5193351/trump-russ-vought-omb-budget-director&quot;&gt;head of the critical Office of Management and Budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump disavowed Project 2025 during the campaign.
