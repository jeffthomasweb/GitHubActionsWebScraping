      <title>Hurricane Katrina helped change New Orleans&apos; public defender system</title>
      <description>In 2006, Ari Shapiro reported on how Hurricane Katrina made an already broken public defender system in New Orleans worse. The court system collapsed in the aftermath of the storm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katrina caused horrific destruction in New Orleans. It threw incarcerated people into a sort of purgatory - some were lost in prisons for more than a year.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the storm also cleared the way for changes that the city&apos;s public defender system had needed for decades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two decades later, Shapiro returns to New Orleans and finds a system vastly improved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
