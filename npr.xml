      <title>Tariffs are a tax. Are you already paying it?</title>
      <description>It&apos;s been over three months since President Trump announced very big across-the-board tariffs on imports from nearly every territory on Earth–including uninhabited islands. It&apos;s a move he said would revitalize the U.S. economy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since that splashy White House announcement, the tariff rates have been a wildly moving target. Ratcheted up - then back down - on China, specifically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overlaid with global product-specific tariffs on categories like automobiles and copper. Partially paused after the stock market tanked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through it all, the tariff rate has remained at or well-above 10 percent on nearly every good imported to the U.S. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if you&apos;ve listened to NPR&apos;s reporting since April, you&apos;ll have heard many voices make one particular prediction over and over again – that American consumers will pay the price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If American consumers are going to pay for the tariffs, the question is: when ?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
