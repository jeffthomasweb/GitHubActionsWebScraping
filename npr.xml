      <description>Measles is an extremely contagious disease. It&apos;s also extremely preventable. There&apos;s a vaccine.

Kennedy, Jr. has made a career spreading false information about vaccines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are this administration&apos;s views on vaccines, and what do they mean for what is already one of the worst U.S. measles outbreaks this century. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281452/trump-cabinet-picks-rfk-confirmation-hearing-help-committee&quot;&gt;publicly promised &lt;/a&gt;he would support vaccines.

      <title>Big Changes at the U.S. State Department</title>
      <description>The Trump administration is undertaking shifts in U.S. foreign policy and that has meant big shifts at the State Department, which is in charge of that policy. The changes have veteran diplomats worried.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the gutted aid agency USAID has been absorbed into the State Department.
