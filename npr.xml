      <title>Wild weather spreads across the U.S.</title>
      <description>In Washington, D.C., the federal government is closed – as are most of the schools in the area. That&apos;s because the first major snow storm in about three years barreled in Sunday night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the Southern U.S. is preparing for another storm that could paralyze parts of Texas, Arkansas and Northern Louisiana. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Southern California is preparing for &quot;life threatening, destructive gusts&quot; driving wildfires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&apos;s a lot of wild weather...so what&apos;s going on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;</description>
