      <title>More forever wars?</title>
      <description>The US is trying to broker an end to the war between Israel and Hamas. Ceasefire talks begin and end and begin again. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has traveled to the region 10 times in the past year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that&apos;s not the only war the US hopes to end. Russia and Ukraine have been fighting since 2014 when Russia first attacked. It launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, more than two and a half years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US and NATO have been supporting Ukraine&apos;s efforts to hold off Russia in a hope to preserve broader security and stability in Western Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next occupant of the White House looks certain to inherit two major conflicts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are these wars lasting so long with no end in sight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
