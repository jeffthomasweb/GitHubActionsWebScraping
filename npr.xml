      <title>Some Trump cabinet picks are accused of sexual misconduct. What&apos;s it mean for #MeToo?</title>
      <description>If you&apos;re tracking Donald Trump&apos;s cabinet picks, you may have noticed common threads among them: top jobs are going to people fiercely loyal to Trump, people with experience appearing on TV, but no experience directly relevant to the jobs they would be doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&apos;s another thing several share: being accused of sexual misconduct. Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth, HHS Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, Elon Musk, who Trump has picked to co-run the Department of Government Efficiency — all these men have faced some variation of accusations of sexual misconduct.  All have denied it, or claimed no memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donald Trump&apos;s first presidential win helped lay the groundwork for the #MeToo movement.
