      <title>Can Trump suspend habeas corpus?</title>
      <description>Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem got a pop quiz at a senate hearing this week. The question came from Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan, of New Hampshire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hassan asked Noem to to explain habeas corpus.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the record, habeas corpus is the legal principle, enshrined in the Constitution, that protects people from illegal detention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason that this bit of Latin is under discussion – is because the Trump administration says it&apos;s considering suspending habeas corpus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This core constitutional protection has been an obstacle to the President&apos;s mass deportation plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Habeas corpus is a principle that&apos;s hundreds of years older than America itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would it mean if the President suspended it? And could he, under the Constitution? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
