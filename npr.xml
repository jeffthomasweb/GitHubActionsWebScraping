      <title>Americans are protesting the Trump administration. Do they work?</title>
      <description>When you think of a successful protest movement, most Americans probably think of the American Civil Rights movement, and the March on Washington in 1963.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. standing behind a podium on the steps of the Lincoln memorial delivered his most famous speech and a line that would come to define the goals of the Civil Rights Movement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act just nine months after the March.  A year after that Johnson signed the National Voting Rights Act of 1965.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The quest for equality continues. In the decades since that bright summer day in August 1963, many other Americans have tried to use the model of protest to achieve their political goals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But do protests work?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>What Is the Relationship Between Russia and the U.S. Now?</title>
      <description>The sometimes cold and often frozen relationship between Russia and the U.S. has gotten a lot warmer since President Trump took office. And even though the American drive to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine may be faltering, the desire to do big business deals with the Kremlin has not. We go to Moscow to look at how the relationship between the two countries has changed, from the Russian perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CORRECTION: A previous version of the audio in this story misidentified Pete Hegseth as the secretary of state. He is the secretary of defense.</description>
