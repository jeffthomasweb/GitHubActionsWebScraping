      <title>Witnesses say Israel is using sniper drones in Gaza and they&apos;re shooting civilians</title>
      <description>Last week British surgeon Nizam Mamode testified in front of a committee in the U.K. Parliament. Dr. Mamode had recently returned from working at a hospital in Central Gaza. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He told parliamentary members what he witnessed, including drones that would come down and &quot;pick off civilians, children. And we had description after description. This is not, you know, an occasional thing. This was day after day after day.&quot;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For months, NPR has been collecting eyewitness accounts from Gaza that corroborate Dr. Mamode&apos;s testimony, saying the Israeli military has been using sniper drone technology and that they&apos;re not just shooting enemies, but also civilians.|&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
