      <title>A would-be assassin targets Trump. What it could mean for America.</title>
      <description>Shortly after 6pm on Saturday, a would-be assassin took aim at former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump and two others were injured and one person was killed before the Secret Service shot and killed the alleged gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crooks was a registered Republican but gave $15 to a progressive Political Action Committee in 2021. Law enforcement has yet to identify a motive or an ideology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in decades, a presidential candidate has been the target of an assassination plot. How might Saturday&apos;s events affect an already divided America?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin discusses what history can teach us about this moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
