      <title>Introducing &quot;A Good Guy&quot; from NPR</title>
      <description>Sergeant Joshua Abate says that he&apos;s not a rioter or an insurrectionist. Those closest to the active-duty Marine call him &quot;a good guy.&quot; But he was part of the mob that attacked the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. On the eve of a new presidential election, what does his case tell us, as the nation still grapples with the legacy of that day? As they look into the military&apos;s reckoning with extremism in the ranks, NPR&apos;s Tom Bowman and Lauren Hodges examine Abate&apos;s main line of defense: Don&apos;t focus on what he did; focus on his promising career as a Marine, instead. &lt;em&gt;Embedded&apos;s &lt;/em&gt;new two-part series &quot;A Good Guy&quot; drops Thursday, October 24. &lt;em&gt;To listen to this series sponsor-free and support NPR, sign up for Embedded+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.&lt;/em&gt;</description>
