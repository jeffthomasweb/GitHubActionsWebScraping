      <description>It&apos;s been 25 years since measles was officially &quot;eliminated&quot; from the United States. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&apos;s a technical term. In public health, it means measles has not had a steady twelve month spread. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now there are measles cases in several states The biggest number of cases are in West Texas where two kids have died. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quarter of a century after measles was officially eliminated in the US, the disease is once again spreading in West Texas, New Mexico and there are cases in several other states.
