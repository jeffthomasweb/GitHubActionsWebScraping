      <title>Can Syria avoid another slide into autocracy?</title>
      <description>The brutal regime of Bashar al Assad fell over the weekend with dizzying speed. Syrians within the country and around the world burst into celebration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the rebel group Hay&apos;at Tahrir al Sham, or HTS has to govern. They are designated a terrorist organization by the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And some worry that HTS could slide into its own kind of autocratic regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That fear is not unfounded. Across the Middle East and North Africa, many revolutions have overthrown autocrats, only for those countries to descend back into chaos or a more oppressive rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Syrian revolution began amid a wave of uprisings in the region that led to new, undemocratic regimes.
