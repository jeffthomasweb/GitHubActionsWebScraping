      <title>Pope Francis I has died. What happens now?</title>
      <description>On Monday morning in Rome Cardinal Kevin Farrell Camerlengo or Cardinal Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church announced the death of Pope Francis I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was followed some 17 hours later by the rite of ascertainment. A formal acknowledgement of Francis&apos; death...and the transfer of his body to his coffin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it&apos;s one a few of the many centuries-old rituals that will play out over the next several days as the church mourns Pope Francis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will be the mourning of the faithful as Francis&apos; body lies in St. Peter&apos;s Basilica. A funeral, where Francis will be remembered by his fellow priests, followers and world leaders. Then, the Conclave where the College of Cardinals will meet to choose his successor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pope Francis has died at 88. Now the church has to chart a course without his leadership. Who will be his successor, and what path will he choose? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
