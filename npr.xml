      <title>From Trump opponent to Trump loyalist: The evolution of Marco Rubio</title>
      <description>When compared to some of president-elect Trump&apos;s other cabinet picks, Senator Marco Rubio for Secretary of State is a pretty conventional choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&apos;s a veteran politician who served on the foreign relations and intelligence committees for over a decade, and he&apos;s been a loyal Trump backer throughout this year&apos;s campaign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when you look back at Marco Rubio during his 2016 presidential campaign, there&apos;s a striking contrast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he ran against Trump in 2016, Rubio called him a con artist, and described his style of leadership as dangerous. Now, he&apos;s going to work for him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marco Rubio&apos;s political evolution is indicative of how the Republican Party has remade itself around Donald Trump, and it gives some clues about how he may operate as the nation&apos;s top diplomat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at considerthis@npr.org.</description>
