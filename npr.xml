      <title>They want America to have more babies. Is this their moment?</title>
      <description>Billionaire Elon Musk told Fox News recently that falling birth rates keep him up at night. It&apos;s a drum he&apos;s been beating for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Musk is one of the world&apos;s most visible individuals to elevate this point of view. Vice President JD Vance also talks about wanting to increase birthrates in the U-S. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it&apos;s not just them. There are discussions across the political spectrum about birth rate decline and what it means for the economy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One response to this decline is a cause that&apos;s been taken up by the right, and it has a name – Pronatalism. Many of its advocates met up recently in Austin, Texas, at &quot;Natal Con.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pronatalists think they have a friendly audience in the White House.

      <title>War and Peace in Sudan&apos;s Capital</title>
      <description>Until very recently Sudan&apos;s capital, Khartoum, had spent nearly two years at war. A paramilitary group went to war with the Sudanese army, occupying the city until it was retaken by government forces in the last few weeks. This has meant massive life shifts for residents of Khartoum who have stayed in the city. One resident has been sending our correspondent regular voice notes telling him about what life is like. We hear what it means to have a war break out in your city and what it is like to finally be liberated.</description>
