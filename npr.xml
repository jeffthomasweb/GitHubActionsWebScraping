      <title>In Panama economic needs threaten to erase a way of life</title>
      <description>Panama has been looking for solutions to a long-term problem. Every time a ship passes through the Panama Canal, more than 50 million gallons of fresh water from Lake Gatun pour out into the ocean. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody ever thought Panama could run out of water. It is one of the rainiest countries in the world. But a couple years ago, a drought got so bad that the canal had to reduce traffic by more than a third - which had a huge impact on global shipping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Panama Canal needs more water.  Authorities have decided to get it by building a dam in a spot that would displace more than 2,000 people along the Rio Indio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
