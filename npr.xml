      <title>Will Assad Survive in Syria? And Will the Conflict Widen Into a Regional War?</title>
      <description>Rebels in Syria are making rapid advances against the government forces of President Bashar al-Assad.

We weigh the chances of his political survival.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in Lebanon, residents are watching as Syrian rebels get closer and closer to their border. There is concern that the fighting will spill over, threatening a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and perhaps becoming a regional war.</description>
