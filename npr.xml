Polar bears are the largest land carnivore in the world, weighing up to 800kg and growing up to 3 metres in length. 

The typical zoo enclosure for a polar bear is one-millionth the size of its range in the wild, which can reach 31,000 square miles (80,290 km²).

Polar bears live in Arctic regions in Canada, Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Norway, in temperatures as low as -46°C (-50.8°F)  

Dalian Forest Zoo contains over 3,000 animals. Attractions include Safari Area, Rain Forest Reptile Pavilion, Flamingo Pavilion, Little Animal Village, Wild Animal Range, Swan Lake, Fierce Beast Area, Happy Primate Garden and Elephant Pavilion.'/><p>These stunning photos include a polar bear in a Chinese zoo, a teen in Zambia facing an uncertain future, Mongolian kids watching TV in a tent, a chef prepping a bowl of good-for-you soup.</p><p>(Image credit: Zed Nelson)</p><img src='https://media.npr.org/include/images/tracking/npr-rss-pixel.png?story=g-s1-102502' />]]></content:encoded>
