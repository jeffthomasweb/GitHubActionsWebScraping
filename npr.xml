      <title>Toxicity is a good defense, until it isn&apos;t</title>
      <description>Imagine, you’re a toxic toad hanging around South America. No other animals are gonna mess with you, right? After all, you’re ~toxic~! So if anyone tries to eat you, they’ll be exposed to something called a cardiotonic steroid — and may die of a heart attack. Well, unfortunately, for you, some animals have developed adaptations to these toxic steroids. Evolutionary biologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mohammadi-lab.com/people.html&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;   &gt;Shabnam Mohammadi&lt;/a&gt; has spent her career studying how these adaptations work — and says even humans have used these toxins to their advantage since ancient Egypt. So today on Short Wave, we get a little… toxic (cue Brittney Spears). Host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/people/1082526815/regina-g-barber&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;   &gt;Regina G. Barber&lt;/a&gt; talks to Shabnam about how some predators can get away with eating toxic prey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curious about biology?
