      <title>Raising kids is costly; Tariffs will make it even more expensive</title>
      <description>When it comes to the cost of raising a child from infancy to the age of 17 in the United States – it&apos;s hard to settle on a precise figure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&apos;s one thing we do know – it&apos;s going to be expensive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By some estimates, raising a kid, who was born in 2015, could cost a middle class family close to $320,000 over 17 years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That money goes to childcare, healthcare, food, clothes, education, transportation, activities, toys, and &lt;em&gt;a lot more. &lt;/em&gt;All of those things will be affected – one way or another – by the Trump administration&apos;s tariff policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the companies that sell products geared at those raising kids – they&apos;re going to feel the pinch as well.  One CEO argues it could even mean certain products will become unavailable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being a parent in the U.S. is already expensive. Slapping tariffs on the products kids use could make it more so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
