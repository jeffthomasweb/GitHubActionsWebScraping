      <title>Advice for navigating a volatile economy</title>
      <description>The U.S. economy is in flux. And for millions of Americans, a new line item in their budget includes repaying federal student loans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making ends meet isn&apos;t just tough for student loan borrowers. Groceries cost a lot more now than they did in 2020. Tariff disputes make it difficult to plan future purchases and they can make it harder to find everyday items at affordable prices.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Housing — whether it&apos;s your mortgage or rent — remains expensive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the job market — well that&apos;s tough, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unpredictable inflation, added expenses, a volatile stock market – the health of the U.S. economy is anything but certain right now.

      <title>India&apos;s Relationship with the U.S.</title>
      <description>There&apos;s been a political backlash in India after the Trump administration deported dozens of Indian migrants who were in the U.S. without legal status. This comes after the U.S. had announced 26 percent tariffs on India, which are currently suspended. Those events have changed Indian&apos;s perceptions of what they had thought was a cozy relationship with the U.S. and have cause a headache for the Indian prime minister. We go to western India to hear what people think of the U.S. now.</description>
