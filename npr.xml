      <title>China Tries to Reboot Its Economy as Competitors Circle</title>
      <description>China has long been the world&apos;s factory, but it&apos;s economy is starting to face serious headwinds. Demand for Chinese goods has slumped, China is saddled with too much industrial capacity and heavy debt. And now a tariff war with the United States further darkens China&apos;s economic outlook. We have two reports on reactions to China&apos;s economic state. We hear how the Chinese government is encouraging business investment, but it&apos;s a hard pitch to sell in a communist state that hasn&apos;t always been kind to entrepreneurs. And how Vietnam, another communist country, seeks to capitalize on China&apos;s uncertain future and is experiencing a manufacturing boom.</description>
