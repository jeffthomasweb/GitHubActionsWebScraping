      <title>30 years since the end of apartheid, is South Africa still an emblem of democracy?</title>
      <description>Three decades ago, South Africa held its first democratic election, closing the door on the apartheid era.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Nelson Mandela was elected its first Black president.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, the country is still led by Mandela&apos;s political party - the African National Congress. But polls show that voters are growing increasingly dissatisfied with the party&apos;s leadership, and next month&apos;s national elections could lead to the ANC having to share power with opposition parties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirty years ago, South Africa became an emblem of a multiracial democracy.
