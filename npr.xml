      <title>TikTok executives know about app&apos;s effect on teens, lawsuit documents allege</title>
      <description>For the first time, internal TikTok communications have been made public that show a company unconcerned with the harms the app poses for American teenagers. This is despite its own research validating many child safety concerns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The confidential material was part of a more than two-year investigation into TikTok by 14 attorneys general that led to state officials suing the company on Tuesday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lawsuit  against the popular video sharing platform claims it was designed to keep young people hooked on the service.  Documents uncovered by Kentucky Public Radio show that the company&apos;s internal research may help support this accusation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at considerthis@npr.org.</description>
