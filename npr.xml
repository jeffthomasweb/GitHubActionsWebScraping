      <title>Trump says the U.S. will &apos;own&apos; Gaza — what that could mean for the Middle East</title>
      <description>The Gaza Strip – ground zero of Israel&apos;s war with Hamas – is only about twice the size of Washington, DC. It has about 25 miles of coastline along the Mediterranean Sea, with a population of about 2 million people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/g-s1-48181/trump-jordan-king-abdullah-white-house-gaza&quot;&gt;President Trump proposed &lt;/a&gt;relocating those people to other countries in the region, like Egypt and Jordan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump has said the Palestinians would not be allowed to return: UN officials and others say Trump&apos;s plan would amount to ethnic cleansing.  Despite domestic and international concerns that the U.S. is empire building, Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/g-s1-48181/trump-jordan-king-abdullah-white-house-gaza&quot;&gt;continues to double down&lt;/a&gt; on his plans for the U.S. to &quot;own&quot; Gaza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump says the U.S. is going to take over Gaza, though he offers few specifics. What could the proposal mean for Palestinians and the broader Middle East? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

We hear about what this could mean from NPR&apos;s White House correspondent. We also hear about how the U.S. relationship with NATO is expected to change under Trump.</description>
