      <title>Support is eroding. Can President Biden hang onto the nomination?</title>
      <description>On June 27th, long-simmering concerns about President Biden&apos;s age – and whether he&apos;s fit to serve a second term – exploded after a disastrous debate performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biden has been trying to clean up the mess ever since. First at a fiery rally in North Carolina. And some ten days after the debate in a one-on-one interview with ABC&apos;s George Stephanopoulos.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither event accomplished the goal of shoring up support for Biden, and now members of Congress are questioning whether the 46th President should remain the democratic nominee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evan Osnos, New Yorker staff writer and author of a biography on Joe Biden, weighs in on the Biden campaign at a crossroads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
