      <title>Jeff Goldblum was bullied growing up. It made him crave something &apos;finer&apos;</title>
      <description>Jeff Goldblum has a special brand of charisma — the kind that seeps its way into all of his roles. Whether it&apos;s in &lt;em&gt;The Fly&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt; or&lt;em&gt; Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; — or his newest show &lt;em&gt;KAOS&lt;/em&gt; — every character feels like a version of Jeff Goldblum himself. He also brings that Goldblumian charisma to &lt;em&gt;Wild Card&lt;/em&gt;, breaking into song as he reflects with Rachel about his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To listen sponsor-free, access bonus episodes and support the show, sign up for Wild Card+ at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/wildcard&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org/wildcard &lt;/a&gt;</description>
