      <title>The numbers were good, but feelings were bad: The US economy in 2024</title>
      <description>By most objective measures, the US economy is in good shape. Employers added about 2 million jobs this year. Unemployment is low. In much of the country, gasoline is now selling for less than $3 a gallon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; has called the United States&apos; performance &quot;the envy of the world.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even as the U.S. is outperforming most other countries, many Americans remain frustrated by the high cost of living. And that&apos;s fueled a lot of unhappiness, and a political comeback for President-elect Donald Trump. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump will soon take the reins of an economy that&apos;s bounced back strongly during the four years he was out of office. For many families, though, that rebound was overshadowed by soaring prices for food, housing, and other necessities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will his policies bring costs down? Or rekindle inflation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
