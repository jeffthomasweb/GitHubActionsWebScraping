      <title>Oscar-nominated Brazilian film sparks debate about country&apos;s past</title>
      <description>Brazilians are flocking to the theaters to see its Oscar-nominated film I Am Still Here. It tells the story of a family devastated by the military dictatorship that ruled from 1964. There has never been a truth commission to investigate abuses or prosecutions of those accused of wrongdoing during a two-decade-long rule. Advocates hope the film might lead to a better understanding of that dark past.</description>
