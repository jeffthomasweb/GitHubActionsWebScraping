      <title>Israel&apos;s changing story of an attack on rescue workers</title>
      <description>On March 23, the death toll in Gaza surpassed 50,000 people killed by Israeli fire in the war with Hamas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of 15 people who were killed the same day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were airstrikes across the territory, and in the south Israeli troops opened fire on a crew of emergency workers in ambulances and a firetruck. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, the Israeli military said the vehicles were &quot;advancing suspiciously&quot; toward troops, &quot;without headlights or emergency signals.&quot; It said the soldiers had eliminated a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A recording unearthed days later told a different story ultimately leading the Israel to conduct an investigation.  The results blamed an &quot;operational misunderstanding&quot; and cite professional failures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In more than 18 months of war – it&apos;s been rare for the Israeli Military to acknowledge failure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming up the story of what happened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;</description>
