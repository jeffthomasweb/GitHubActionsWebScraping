      <title>He left everything to flee war in Syria. What does the war&apos;s end mean for his future?</title>
      <description>When Syria&apos;s dictatorship fell in early December, celebrations broke out around the world - including nearly 6,000 miles away, in Toledo, Ohio. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&apos;s where Mohammed al-Refai, a refugee from Syria, lives now. NPR has followed his story for nearly a decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2015, millions of Syrians fled the civil war in their country. al-Refai got a visa to come to the U.S. His parents and siblings, who fled to Jordan, did not. So, he moved on his own to Toledo, where built a new life for himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He long dreamed of visiting his family and maybe, one day, returning to Syria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the Syrian civil war now over, we talked to al-Refai about what comes next. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
