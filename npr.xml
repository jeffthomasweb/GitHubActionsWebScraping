      <title>The &apos;Chinese Exclusion Era&apos; shows how Trump&apos;s mass deportation plan could unfold</title>
      <description>Donald Trump promises to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants once he returns to the White House. If he follows through, the scale of it would be unlike anything we&apos;ve seen in our lifetimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many supporters of Trump&apos;s mass deportation agenda say expelling unauthorized immigrants will help the US economy.
