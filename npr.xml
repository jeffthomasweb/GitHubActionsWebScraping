      <title>When Oscar got it wrong</title>
      <description>What do Babygirl, Singing in the Rain and Apocalypse Now have in common? They&apos;ve all been overlooked by Oscar voters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Oscar blunders fall into the category of snubs - others show a failure to recognize films that will endure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now sometimes, these critiques are a matter of movie taste. Sometimes, they&apos;re a broader matter of representation – raising questions about who the movie industry chooses to celebrate or ignore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Academy Awards have made some truly epic misses over their long history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two of NPR&apos;s film regulars dig into those times when the Oscars got things very wrong, and what that tells us about the art, culture and business of the movies.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;</description>
