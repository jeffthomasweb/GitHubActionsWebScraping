      <title>A Good Guy: 279 Hours</title>
      <description>&quot;Have you ever tried to overthrow the U.S. government?&quot; Marine Sgt. Joshua Abate was in the middle of a routine polygraph test to receive top-secret clearance when he made an extraordinary admission: He had followed the crowd that broke into the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. This admission leads to a different kind of January 6 story. Abate says he&apos;s not an insurrectionist. So why did it take him so long to talk openly about that day? &lt;em&gt;To listen to this series sponsor-free and support NPR, sign up for Embedded+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.&lt;/em&gt;</description>
