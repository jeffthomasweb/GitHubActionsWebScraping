      <title>Russia is Top of Mind at NATO summit</title>
      <description>Four years after World War II, leaders from Europe and North America formed an alliance largely aimed at deterring Soviet expansion — the North Atlantic Treaty Organization — NATO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventy-five years later the member states of that organization have come together in Washington to celebrate NATO and plan for its future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they did in 1949, the NATO allies believe Russia presents the largest security threat to their world order. The immediate threat is Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine, but the allies also worry about the future of America&apos;s leadership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight diplomats from the nations closest to Russia weigh in on the threat the country poses to them and the world order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>The Fate of the Israeli Hostages and the Future of Gaza</title>
      <description>The Israeli hostages taken during the October 7th attacks and held in Gaza are a major sticking point in cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas. A spokesperson for Hamas tells NPR not all those hostages are being held by his organization, some are being held by families in Gaza.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in Israel, what Gaza will look like after major combat operations end is the subject of fierce debate, with military and political leaders so far failing to agree.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more coverage of all sides of this conflict, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/series/1205445976/middle-east-crisis&quot;&gt;npr.org/mideastupdates&lt;/a&gt;</description>
