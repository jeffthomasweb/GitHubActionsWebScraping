      <description>Starting next season, a system of cameras will determine whether to award a first down rather than trot out a 10-yard chain. But humans will still decide where to spot the ball to begin with.</description>

      <title>China&apos;s Global Electric Vehicle Boom</title>

One of the markets where their cars are selling big is Brazil, where BYD is investing nearly a billion dollars in a factory.
