      <title>What happens when wildland fire reaches the city?</title>
      <description>&quot;Wildfire&quot; is the word we tend to use when we talk about what Los Angeles has been dealing with the past week. &lt;br&gt;But Lori Moore-Merrell, the U.S. Fire Administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency used a different word, when she spoke to NPR this morning.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She described a &quot;conflagration.&quot; Saying they&apos;re not wildland fires with trees burning.  They&apos;re structure to structure fire spread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They may have started at the suburban fringe, but they didn&apos;t stay there.
