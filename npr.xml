      <title>Return to the Motherland or Illegal Land Transfer? Depends on Who You Ask (Encore)</title>
      <description>In an episode we first posted in January, we go to the West African country of Ghana.

They even created settlements for the people who took them up on the offer, giving out free land. But our correspondent talks to locals who say their farm land was stolen to give to foreigners.</description>
