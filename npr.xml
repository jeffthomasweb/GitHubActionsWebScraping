      <title>Will Israel&apos;s Government Ratify the Gaza Ceasefire Deal?</title>
      <description>Just one day after the announcement of a deal between Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza, Israel&apos;s prime minister threatened to delay a cabinet vote to approve the deal. He later relented and scheduled a vote. To understand the politics behind the deal and how the U.S. will be involved in its implementation we hear from Aaron David Miller. He once represented the U.S. in peace negotiations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can find all our reporting on this conflict at &lt;a href=&quot;http://npr.org/mideastupdates&quot;&gt;npr.org/mideastupdates&lt;/a&gt;</description>
