      <title>Three years into his war on Ukraine, what does Putin really want?</title>
      <description>President Trump wants to make a deal with Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Putin says Russia wants to engage in peace talks, but Putin has also been ordering the most widespread and violent aerial attacks on Ukraine in years. This has led Trump to criticize Putin more and more in public — a step that&apos;s been rare over the course of Trump&apos;s two terms in office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years into his war on Ukraine, what does Putin really want? It&apos;s a question leaders around the world are trying to figure out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more, NPR&apos;s Scott Detrow speaks with Angela Stent, Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University, Senior Fellow at the Brookings institution — a nonpartisan policy organization in Washington DC — and author of the book &quot;Putin&apos;s World: Russia Against the West and With the Rest.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
