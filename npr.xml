      <title>&apos;He saved our lives.&apos; A former US hostage reflects on Carter&apos;s legacy</title>
      <description>Jimmy Carter&apos;s four years in the White House were largely defined by an event that took place halfway through his term.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On November 4th, 1979 Iranian college students took over the US Embassy in Tehran, and took 52 Americans hostage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the next 444 days, the Carter administration tried to secure the hostages&apos; release. In April, 1980 they even commissioned a rescue mission that ended in failure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Carter was trying to end the hostage crisis, he was also campaigning for a second term. A year to the day after the Americans were taken hostage, Ronald Reagan beat Carter in a landslide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hostage crisis played a key role in Carter&apos;s defeat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Iranian Hostage crisis helped doom Jimmy Carter&apos;s presidency, but for some of the people he helped free, he was a hero.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;</description>
