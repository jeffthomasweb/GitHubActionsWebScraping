      <title>How an obscure legal theory shaped the immunity decision and Trump&apos;s second term</title>
      <description>In Trump v. United States, the Supreme Court held that the president has &quot;absolute immunity from criminal prosecution&quot; for official acts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To reach that conclusion, the High Court grappled with this question: how much power a president should have?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And some legal scholars say the ruling draws on the unitary executive theory — which, in its most extreme interpretation, gives the president sole authority over the executive branch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But did it pave the way for Trump&apos;s second term and the constitutional questions it&apos;s raised: From the dismantling of federal agencies established by Congress to the deportation migrants to third party countries without due process?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
