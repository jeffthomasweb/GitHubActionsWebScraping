      <title>Were U.S. Strikes On Iran&apos;s Nuclear Program Successful?</title>
      <description>The U.S. entered Israel&apos;s war against Iran over the weekend, dropping bombs and firing missiles on three Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. We hear from some experts on whether they think the attacks were successful in damaging or destroying Iran&apos;s ability to make a nuclear weapon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long had sights on attacking Iran but until recently that ambition seemed to be sidelined by President Trump. Now Netanyahu&apos;s basking in the moment after the U.S. joined in on the war against Iran.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more coverage of all sides of this conflict, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://npr.org/mideastupdates&quot;&gt;npr.org/mideastupdates &lt;/a&gt;</description>
