      <title>Project 2025: Political winner or loser?</title>
      <description>Project 2025 - you&apos;ve probably heard about it. It&apos;s a roadmap from the conservative Heritage Foundation for the next Republican president.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s also been a major talking point for Democrats on the campaign trail. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has tried to disavow it and distance himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&apos;s because the plan has attracted negative attention over the ultra conservative policies it endorses like overhauling and eliminating some government agencies, firing thousands of civil servants and a mass deportation campaign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Project 2025 was created to help the next Republican President execute an extreme conservative agenda. Now it&apos;s also become an attack line for Democrats.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
