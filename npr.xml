      <title>Trump wants a Golden Dome missile defense shield. Is that realistic?</title>
      <description>Since last week, Israel has been attacking Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, along with many other targets around the country. Iran has fired hundreds of missiles in response. NPR correspondent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/people/279612138/geoff-brumfiel&quot;&gt;Geoff Brumfiel&lt;/a&gt; has been watching all of this very closely because Israel&apos;s missile defenses have been a focus of the Trump White House. This year, President Trump requested funding from Congress for a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4193417/secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-statement-on-golden-dome-for-america/&quot;&gt;Golden Dome for America&lt;/a&gt;&quot; — a missile defense system that would protect all of the United States. The idea comes from Israel&apos;s Iron Dome — a network of interceptor missiles stationed at points across the country. Iron Dome and related Israeli air defenses don&apos;t get every missile fired — including some launched in the past few days by Iran — but the Israeli military says it has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was built. Trying to get that kind of protection for America, though, might be a very different matter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more of science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel&apos;s reporting on this &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://npr.org/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5432607/israel-strikes-iran-nuclear-facilities-expand&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and find NPR&apos;s coverage of the Middle East &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/middle-east/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions about nuclear science?
