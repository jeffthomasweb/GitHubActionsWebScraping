      <title>How Netanyahu survived another tumultuous year</title>
      <description>At the start of this year Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was facing a crisis. Just a few months before, Hamas had breached Israel&apos;s border with Gaza, killing some 1200 people in Israel on October 7th.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the year ends, Netanyahu is spending some of it in a courtroom to fight corruption charges that have dogged him since 2019.  The Israeli Prime Minister has called the charges absurd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You might think that would be detrimental to his political career, but instead Netanyahu looks stronger than he has since the war began.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This — despite that trial, an international arrest warrant and a grinding war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
