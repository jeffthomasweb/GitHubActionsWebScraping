      <title>Trump threatens Russia over Ukraine. Will it make a difference?</title>
      <description>President Trump has made some big shifts in U.S. policy on Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine lately. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the course of two weeks, Trump halted and reinstated weapons to Ukraine and he began openly showing frustration with Russian president Vladimir Putin&apos;s continued military escalations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Trump has announced a deal with NATO to try to pressure Russia toward a ceasefire deal in just 50 days by threatening stiff tariffs and increased military aid to Ukraine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump seems to be taking a tougher stance against Russia, but will it make a difference, and will it last? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
