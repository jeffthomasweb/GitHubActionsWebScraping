      <title>Trump says no one cares about Epstein. Why won&apos;t his base let it go?</title>
      <description>One of the narratives at the heart of President Trump&apos;s political movement is this: American society is dominated by a shadowy group of elites, and those elites are deeply corrupt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing represented that theory more than the case of Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was a man most people had never heard of initially, with a private plane and a private island. Acquainted with the world&apos;s most powerful people: British royalty, U.S. presidents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man who ultimately died in jail...by suicide, according to authorities... before the case against him went to trial. Epstein&apos;s case and his death bred skepticism and conspiracy theories – especially among supporters of Donald Trump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, some of Trump&apos;s most ardent supporters are attacking his Justice Department&apos;s decision not to release all of the files related to the Epstein case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump says nobody cares about Epstein. But his base won&apos;t let it go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>The Downstream Effects of China&apos;s Rare Earth Mining</title>
      <description>China has nearly cornered the market in rare earth minerals, which are a necessary component to much of our technology today. But China sources some of those rare earths and other heavy metals from neighboring Myanmar. And the ramped up in production there is causing downstream environmental concerns in Thailand.
