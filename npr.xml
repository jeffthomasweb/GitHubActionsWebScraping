      <title>What&apos;s next in the case that symbolizes Trump&apos;s immigration crackdown?</title>
      <description>Kilmar Abrego Garcia: a name that&apos;s become near-synonymous with the Trump Administration&apos;s immigration crackdown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abrego Garcia was arrested by ICE agents on March 12th, as he was leaving his job in Baltimore. In the days and months that followed, the fate of the 29-year-old father of three was in the hands of the Trump administration and El Salvador&apos;s President. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time of his arrest the administration alleged he was an active member of the Salvadoran gang MS-13.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His family and his legal team deny this. He was deported to a supermax prison in El Salvador despite a protective order that he should remain in the U.S. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then – less than a month after his arrest, a federal judge and then the Supreme Court ruled the government should facilitate Abrego Garcia&apos;s return to the U.S.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now nearly three months after Abrego Garcia was sent to a prison in another country... he&apos;s back on US soil. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</description>
