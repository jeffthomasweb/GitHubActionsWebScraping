      <title>How Russia Sees Itself in the World</title>
      <description>Ever since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the majority of western countries have been working to marginalize Russia by imposing sanctions and moving away from dependence on Russian oil. This week NATO announced most member countries would dramatically increase defense spending, a move they said was meant to counter threats posed by Russia.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Russia is eager to show it still has many partners around the globe and quash talk of a possible economic recession at home. Our correspondent takes us to an international conference in Saint Petersburg where the Russian government is putting it&apos;s best face forward.</description>
