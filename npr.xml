      <title>Is Trump&apos;s immigration bet working?</title>
      <description>The White House&apos;s message on what&apos;s happening in Los Angeles is simple: this is what President Trump was elected to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is true that polls have found people trust the Republican Party more to handle immigration. A CBS poll taken last week found that 54% approve of Trump&apos;s deportation policies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump is making a big bet on how far Americans want him to go. He mobilized National Guard and active-duty troops that the mayor and governor say they don&apos;t need. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The administration says its immigration efforts are focused on criminals. But California Governor Gavin Newsom highlighted other people swept up in workplace raids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A U.S. citizen, nine months pregnant, was arrested; a 4-year-old girl, taken; families separated; friends, quite literally, disappearing.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump is doubling down in Los Angeles. We hear from a conservative immigration analyst who thinks it will work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
