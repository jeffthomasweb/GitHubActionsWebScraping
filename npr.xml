      <title>The long history of Russia&apos;s broken promises to Ukraine</title>
      <description>Representatives from Russia and Ukraine will be in meetings to try to hammer out details of a ceasefire on Monday. But peace is still a long way off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For starters it&apos;s only a partial ceasefire—no strikes on energy infrastructure. It&apos;s only for 30 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the Ukrainians and Russians aren&apos;t even meeting with each other. The U.S. will be a go-between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the biggest things working against a new agreement, is what happened after Ukraine&apos;s last agreement with Russia. And the ones before that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ukraine says it won&apos;t trust a promise from Russia. It needs security guarantees. To understand why, you&apos;ve got to go back to the birth of independent Ukraine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
