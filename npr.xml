      <title>Video game performers are on strike — and AI is the sticking point</title>
      <description>If you&apos;re not entrenched in the world of video games, you might not realize how much &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;actors have to do with modern gaming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They provide everything from lines of dialogue, to portraying heroes and villains, to performing stunts – all of this bringing video games characters to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the biggest game studios rely on voice and performance capture artists, and all this adds up to big bucks. The video game industry made close to $185 billion last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But video game performers whose human performances become computer data, are especially vulnerable to being replaced by generative AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is why they&apos;re now on strike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This&lt;/em&gt;, sign up for &lt;em&gt;Consider This&lt;/em&gt;+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at considerthis@npr.org.</description>
