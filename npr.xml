Dozens of people abruptly dismissed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The restructuring of the NSC as Secretary of State and National Security advisor Marco Rubio has characterized it — continues a trend in this second term for President Trump, of radical downsizing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Trump administration plans to cut thousands of intelligence and national security jobs across the government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US Government has long relied on scores of intelligence officials across the government to keep America safe.
