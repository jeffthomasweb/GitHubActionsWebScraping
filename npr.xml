      <title>Angry Houston residents still want answers after Hurricane Beryl power failure</title>
      <description>Devastating power outages and destruction in Houston left by Hurricane Beryl again underscored the city’s inability to sufficiently fortify itself against extreme weather events worsened by climate change. This was the lowest level hurricane, a Category One, and yet it knocked out power to millions and left the nation’s fourth largest city reeling. Past horrific hurricanes, including Ike in 2008 and Harvey in 2017, made crystal clear that the city needed to bolster its infrastructure including expanding flood-plain protections, burying more power lines underground, and hardening its power grid. But those city, state and corporate efforts have repeatedly fallen short.</description>

      <title>USA Gymnastics made a miraculous comeback — but is it actually safer for Olympians?</title>
      <description>In 2017, the Larry Nassar scandal rocked the Olympic community. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse against the former USA Gymnastics doctor underscored how vulnerable athletes are — particularly when they&apos;re minors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That year, Congress and the U.S. Olympic Committee had a solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S. Center for SafeSport was founded to investigate and respond to allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct. The goal was for predators like Larry Nassar to never harm young athletes again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, seven years later, SafeSport is facing scrutiny of its own — over whether it&apos;s made good on that promise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
