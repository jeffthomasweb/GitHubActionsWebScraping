      <title>Will Trump&apos;s next term make him richer?</title>
      <description>Just before Donald Trump took office the first time, he held a press conference, announcing that he would turn over control of his business empire to his sons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said he wanted to address concerns about conflicts of interest even though he maintained he didn&apos;t really have to. Saying, &quot;I could actually run my business. I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don&apos;t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump&apos;s second term may put that theory to the test. The former and future president hasn&apos;t yet announced any plan to wall himself off from his businesses while in office, and Trump&apos;s businesses like his many hotels and resorts could benefit substantially from his actions as President.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.npr.org/&quot;&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:considerthis@npr.org&quot;&gt;considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
