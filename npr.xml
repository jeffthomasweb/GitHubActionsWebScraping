      <title>Trump takes aim at trade deficits. Are they actually bad?</title>
      <description>Whatever you think of President Trump&apos;s tariffs, there&apos;s one point you have to concede: his interest in them is not a passing whim. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He noted that on Wednesday, in the Rose Garden, when he was announcing the latest, massive round of tariffs.  &quot;I&apos;ve been talking about this for 40 years,&quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The use of tariffs are a core belief for Donald Trump.  Trade deficits are bad, other countries take advantage of the U.S. and tariffs are the way to fix this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the Rose Garden announcement, markets have plunged, other countries have promised to retaliate, and members of his own party have spoken out against the tariffs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump&apos;s tariff plan is designed to eliminate U.S. trade deficits.
