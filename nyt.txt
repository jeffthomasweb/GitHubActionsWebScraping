   Autopilot is Tesla’s driver-assistance system, which includes features
   to steer, brake and accelerate vehicles automatically on highways — and
   is key to Elon Musk’s futuristic vision of self-driving cars.

   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating
   Autopilot in 2021, when it was involved in several accidents. Since
   then, the administration has ramped up pressure on Tesla to make
   changes.
   Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times

   It’s not the first time that Tesla has had to issue mass recalls. The
   automaker recalled 1.1 million cars in China and another 362,000 cars
   in the United States this year. Last year, it recalled 54,000 cars
   equipped with its Full Self‌ ‌-Driving software to disable a feature
   that sometimes let the vehicles roll through intersections.

   But this recall is the largest yet, including nearly all the cars that
   Tesla has manufactured in the United States since 2012.
   Philip Cheung for The New York Times

   Tesla said it planned to automatically update its vehicles via cellular
   networks to add more prominent features that would prompt drivers to
   keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road — reminders
   that the cars do not drive themselves, as some Tesla owners erroneously
   assume.
   Ian Clontz for The New York Times
