   Sex, a Hex and a Sick Child Offer Clues About the Mpox Epidemic

   In a remote Congolese town, a medical mystery led to the discovery of
   alarming changes in the mpox virus and, eventually, to a global health
   emergency.

   10 min read

    1. [594]The first mpox case in Kamituga, Democratic Republic of Congo,
       was diagnosed last year. More than 62,000 cases have been reported
       in Africa this year, three-quarters of them in Congo.
       Moses Sawasawa for The New York Times
    2. [595]Dr. Steeve Bilembo and Fidèle Kakemenge treated the first case
       in Kamituga. They quickly began investigating how the patient, a
       5-year-old boy, might have been infected.
       Moses Sawasawa for The New York Times
    3. [596]The infection map led them from a traditional healer to a
       businessman who had been cursed and a nightclub in Kamituga.
       Moses Sawasawa for The New York Times
    4. [597]Masila Kabesha recovering at Kamituga Reference Hospital last
       month. The virus is moving through the general population, and
       hitting children hard.
       Moses Sawasawa for The New York Times
    5. [598]The hospital has a small laboratory where mpox tests can
       undergo genetic analysis. Results arrive within an hour or two.
       Moses Sawasawa for The New York Times
    6. [599]Until a few weeks ago, no one in Congo was vaccinated; now
       about 50,000 people are.
