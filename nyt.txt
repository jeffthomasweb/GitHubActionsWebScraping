The Big Number: $40 Billion

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   Meta has already spent billions on developing artificial intelligence.
   On Wednesday, the company said it would spend as much as $40 billion
   this year, much of it going toward data centers, chip designs and
   research.

   Here’s what to know →
   Josie Norton

   Just before the announcement, Meta rolled out smart assistants across
   its platforms. The assistants are powered by the company’s A.I.
   language model, which can generate prose, conversations and images.

   It is the latest way Meta is trying to make good on the promise of its
   leader, Mark Zuckerberg, to introduce A.I. software “to billions of
   people in ways that will be useful and meaningful.”
   Carlos Barria/Reuters

   But despite Meta’s bullishness on the technology — and despite the 27
   percent increase in the company’s revenue and profit, its best ever in
   the first quarter — there were some caveats.

   Meta said it anticipated second-quarter revenue to be lower than
   analysts had expected. Those words of caution appeared to unsettle
   investors, who sank Meta’s stock by more than 16 percent in after-hours
   trading on Wednesday afternoon.
   Thibault Camus/Associated Press

   Zuckerberg urged patience, telling analysts that stock volatility was
   not uncommon at times when Meta was “scaling a new product” but not yet
   making money from it.

   But patience may be wearing thin, as the company continues to burn
   billions on his vision for the metaverse, the immersive virtual world
   that he unveiled more than two years ago and has had a rocky start.
   Brian Finke for The New York Times
