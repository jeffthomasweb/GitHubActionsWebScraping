What’s in Our Queue? Usher and More

   Elena Bergeron
   Elena BergeronWriting from N.Y.C.

   I’m an assistant editor for The New York Times, covering pop culture.
   Rather than relying on algorithms, I try to prioritize personal
   history, conversations with friends and chance in the art that I’m
   consuming. Here are five things I’m into right now →

   Song: ‘Climax’

   I’m a sucker for TikTok and Instagram accounts that break down singers’
   performances as if they were sports highlights — #vocalcoachreacts
   TikToks and IG accounts like @voceux.voceux and @theyhavetherange.
   Since Usher’s Super Bowl halftime show, I probably watch the clip of
   him singing “Climax” once a day, at least, because it’s such a flex
   that he does it lying down.

   Book: ‘The Candy House’

   I started the year reading two heavy offerings (“King: A Life” and “Let
   Us Descend”) and mentioned to my colleague Mike Wilson that I was
   looking for a tonal break. He recommended Jennifer Egan’s latest, about
   memory and social networking and a dozen other things. It bounces
   between forms and perspectives in a way that’s been invigorating.

   Music: 41

   It’s still cold and dreary outside, and I’ve been trying to stick to a
   gym routine, which means I need songs that can break up the drudgery,
   dahhhling (said in my Mariah Carey voice). The Brooklyn drill
   collective 41 has been making interesting, exuberant
   Jersey-house-inflected bangers like “Trick” and “Get Deady” that make
   me happy to move.

   Movie: ‘Little Odessa’

   Ever since a conversation with my best friend about writing personal
   narratives, I’ve been working my way through James Gray’s films,
   starting with his first — about a hit man for the Russian mob who
   visits his family in Brooklyn during a “business trip” — and watching
   all the hyper-specific touches he brings to a genre movie.

   TV: N.B.A. on TNT

   It’s the homestretch of the N.B.A. season, which means all the chaotic
   proclamations Charles Barkley and Shaq made about teams and players
   this season are about to be adjudicated. Games featuring the Milwaukee
   Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Lakers or Phoenix Suns all have
   the potential to spur a rant, prompt an apology or start a social media
   beef.
