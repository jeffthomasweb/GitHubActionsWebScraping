Hamas attack prompted scrutiny, but little backlash.

How to Grow Flowering Bulbs

   Tim McKeough
   Tim McKeoughReporting on home décor

   If you’re a minimalist, consider decorating for the holidays the way
   architect Elizabeth Roberts does: by growing flowering bulbs.

   Forcing bulbs is easy! Here’s how she does it →
   Stefano Ukmar for The New York Times

   Start with a bulb: Roberts prefers paperwhites or amaryllis.

   Then gather your equipment: a germination plate (a ceramic disk with a
   hole in the middle) and a glass vessel (as simple or ornate as you
   like, so long as it has room for the germination disk on top).
   Stefano Ukmar

   Fill the container with water. Then put the disk on top.

   And on top of that, the bulb! Make sure to guide its little starter
   roots through the hole in the disk and down into the water.
   Stefano Ukmar

   Now watch it grow: Check the bulb daily, topping up the water.

   Pretty soon, you’ll see flowers! But don’t forget to appreciate the
   roots, too. “That’s actually my favorite part,” Roberts said.
   Stefano Ukmar
