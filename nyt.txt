Tracking the Toll of Extreme Heat on Migrants Crossing the Border

   Reporting from Sunland Park, N.M.

   I spent the day in Sunland Park, N.M., with the local fire department,
   which has been responding to migrants with heat-related emergencies
   along the Southern border.

   The area, a popular spot for illegal border crossings, has had an
   unprecedented stretch of days at or above 100 degrees.

   Chief Medrano said that they have already responded to more
   heat-related emergencies this summer than they did all last summer.

What’s in Our Queue? The War on Drugs and More

   Ken Jaworowski
   Ken JaworowskiWriting and editing in New Jersey

   I’m an editor who works on features for The Times’s print edition.

   My debut novel, “Small Town Sins,” a thriller, is due out on Aug. 1.
   While writing it, I listened to hours of excellent music and savored
   many wonderful stories. Here are five of them →
   Magdalena Wosinska for The New York Times

   Music: The War on Drugs

   Though they’ve won a Grammy (in 2018, for best rock album), this band
   seems like an insider secret, with its smart yet unpretentious
   synth-jam tunes. My favorites are “Under the Pressure,” which clocks in
   at nearly nine minutes, and “Burning,” at almost six. I’m still not
   sure I like the band’s name. But I’m certain I like its sound.

   IFRAME: [129]about:blank

   Film: ‘Living’

   When I first learned of this 2022 remake of Akira Kurosawa’s 1952
   masterpiece, “Ikiru,” I cringed. Then I saw it, and my heart broke.
   Bill Nighy’s subtle performance and Kazuo Ishiguro’s gentle script err
   on the side of understatement as they tell the tale of a dying British
   bureaucrat and his final wish. See it and weep.

   IFRAME:
   [130]https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVo5kLt_-BU?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Radio: WXPN

   Traditional radio is in a sad state, particularly when it comes to
   indie music, but WXPN is a happy exception. This free,
   listener-supported station, which is available everywhere via app, web
   browser or smart speaker, has introduced me to artists like Neko Case,
   Lord Huron, Band of Horses and Best Coast. More discoveries await.

   [131]Listen live.

   Book: ‘The Collected Stories’

   William Trevor’s works have haunted me for years. In a few sentences,
   he can outline an entire life or evoke a well of emotion. Many of his
   stories center on the lonely, the damaged and the lost, yet these
   characters carry on, often using slight smiles to mask deep sadness.

   Film: ‘The Rider’

   The writer and director Chloé Zhao won praise and Oscars for
   “Nomadland.” Yet her previous film, “The Rider,” feels unjustly
   overlooked. It’s a quiet, poetic tale of a rodeo rider who must rethink
   his life after a terrible injury. I saw the film when it came out in
   2018 and still find myself encouraging others to watch it.
