Pressure Builds for Pause as Israel Readies ‘Next Stages of Combat’

   Israel said it briefly sent tanks into Gaza, while the European Council
   pledged more efforts to get aid into the blockaded Palestinian enclave.


   [527]

Israel’s Army Is Ready to Invade Gaza. Its Divided Government May Not Be.

   Since Hamas attacked, Israel has pounded Gaza with air strikes and its
   troops have gotten into position. But its leaders disagree about what
   to do next.

   6 min read

    1. As the death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continued to
       escalate, Israel raised fears of a ground invasion by briefly
       sending tanks into the enclave overnight.
       Yousef Masoud for The New York Times
    2. Israel’s military released video of what it called a limited ground
       raid in preparation for a broader invasion.
       Israel Defense Forces
    3. At the same time, Israeli airstrikes again pounded Gazan cities,
       including Khan Younis in the south. The Israeli military said it
       had carried out more than 250 strikes over the past day.
       Associated Press
    4. In southern Gaza, 43 Israeli airstrikes “in the past hours” killed
       481 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry.
       The Times cannot independently verify the figures.
       Yousef Masoud for The New York Times
    5. Just 74 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies had entered Gaza as
       of Thursday, far short of the 100 a day or more that the U.N. says
       the territory needs.
       Mohammed Abed/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
    6. Soldiers in Israel continued to patrol and assess damage in cities
       like Kibbutz Be’eri, which was devastated in the surprise attack by
       Hamas on Oct. 7.
       Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times
    7. In Israel, funerals continued for the more than 1,400 people killed
       in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.
       Petros Giannakouris/Associated Press
    8. Although Israel has not launched a full-scale ground invasion, it
       has amassed troops near the Gaza border, holding drills and making
       sporadic incursions into the strip.

   Movie: ‘Talk to Me’

   This Australian horror film is about teenagers experimenting with
   possession by spirits the same way others might try laughing gas. It
   has the elements of the best scary movies: a mixture of light and dark
   (it’s pretty funny), genuinely disturbing set pieces and a protagonist
   who makes terrible decisions.

   Video: Phoebe Bridgers’s ‘Tiny Desk (Home) Concert’

   I recently rediscovered this NPR performance, in which Bridgers
   delivers some of her most heart-rending lyrics as, inexplicably, she
   and her bandmates are digitally overlaid onto an image of the Oval
   Office. It ends with videos of fans screaming along to “I Know the
   End,” which is very cute and very 2020.

   Book: ‘The Happy Couple’

   I’ve come to accept that stories about intelligent people unable to
   communicate are among my favorites. This incisive second novel by the
   Irish writer Naoise Dolan delves into the complicated psyches of a
   soon-to-be-married couple and the people who love them. It’s a gorgeous
   book about messy, ill-defined relationships (and the often-thin line
   between self-consciousness and narcissism).

   Music: Oriental Brothers International Band

   I periodically turn to Igbo highlife, a Nigerian genre sung in the
   tribe’s language, for a shot of serotonin, and I’ve found myself
   returning to the Oriental Brothers as autumn settles in. Their songs’
   piercing guitar riffs and crackling production transport me back to
   childhood, when my father would play their cassettes.

   TV: ‘Poldark’

   This addictive, campy and frequently implausible period drama begins
   when Ross Poldark, a member of a prominent British family, returns from
   the Revolutionary War and starts thumbing his nose at propriety. I
   would have never thought I’d be so invested in the fortunes of an
   18th-century mine owner, but here we are.
