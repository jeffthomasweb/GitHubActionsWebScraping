What’s in Our Queue? ‘Rough Diamonds’ and More

   Matina Stevis-Gridneff
   Matina Stevis-GridneffWriting in Brussels

   I’m the New York Times bureau chief in Brussels, where I cover the
   European Union. I’ve had a peripatetic summer, split among Belgium, my
   native Greece and New York City.

   Here are five things I’ve been watching, listening to and more →
   Netflix

   TV: ‘Rough Diamonds’

   This moody Netflix series centers on a torrid family saga, something we
   don’t get enough of these days. It’s set in the Belgian port city of
   Antwerp, capturing the grit and grandeur of the place, and focuses on
   the intersection of the city’s Orthodox Jewish community with the
   world’s diamond trade.

   IFRAME:
   [106]https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9T8hcU6TSE?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Art: ‘My Past Is a Foreign Country’

   On Chios, my father’s ancestral island, this allegorical exhibition by
   12 artists from Greece and other nearby countries took over Ottoman
   baths, a mosque and two splendidly restored buildings. It reflects on
   the region’s history and unique heritage as a fluid borderland between
   Turkey and Greece, East and West.
   Byron Smith for The New York Times

   Fiction: ‘The Shadow King’

   I am nostalgic for the Horn of Africa, where I spent five years as a
   correspondent before moving to Brussels, and Maaza Mengiste’s
   historical novel about war and women has struck a chord. It’s an
   especially poignant read at a time when Ethiopia is going through
   convulsions of conflict and lasting peace feels elusive.

   Nonfiction: ‘Strangers to Ourselves’

   This partly autobiographical treatment of the forces unleashed by
   mental-health diagnoses is by Rachel Aviv, my favorite New Yorker
   writer. As speech borrowed from psychiatry and psychology seeps deeper
   into our day-to-day vocabulary, I see this book as vital in critically
   assessing psychiatric matters.

   Art: Royal Museum for Central Africa

   This museum just outside Brussels is an apt metaphor for Belgium’s
   brutal colonial past in central Africa, and its flawed, belated attempt
   to reckon with it. Once the site of a human zoo where people from
   today’s Democratic Republic of Congo were on display, the museum is now
   home to art and artifacts from central Africa.
