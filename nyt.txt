   The Kentucky Derby, the longest continuously held sporting event in the
   United States, is marking its 150th anniversary beneath the iconic twin
   spires on Saturday, and sky-high prices did not deter the hat-wearing

   The mood at Churchill Downs is a lot more festive than last year, when
   12 horses died surrounding the event, casting a shadow on the sport’s
   biggest stage. A federal agency now regulates the sport, and a uniform
   antidoping program is in place for the first time.

   The Derby entrants have been under a microscope, wearing sensors to
   detect changes in their gaits and receiving extensive prerace exams.
   The racetrack has been manicured with state-of-the-art equipment and
   analyzed by an army of experts.
