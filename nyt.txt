What’s in Our Queue? Chinese Cinema and More

   Vivian Wang
   Vivian WangWriting in Beijing

   I’m a China correspondent for The Times. I often find my next book or
   movie through online rabbit holes.

   Here are five things I’ve been reading, watching and listening to →
   Jiamei Spring Pictures

   Film: ‘Have a Nice Day’

   This Chinese film is about greed, crime and hopelessness in a gritty
   city far from the shining lights of Beijing or Shanghai. But the
   bleakness and implicit social commentary are channeled through simple,
   almost crude animation, dark humor and a great soundtrack, making it
   feel, paradoxically, almost like a romp.

   IFRAME:
   [98]https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpXrwYr_1cM?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Podcast: ‘Wind of Change’

   The premise of this one-off series is a mystery about whether the
   C.I.A. secretly wrote one of the world’s biggest power ballads. But the
   answer (in my opinion) isn’t so important; what’s more fascinating is
   the journey, an eye-opening yet lighthearted history of soft power.

   IFRAME: [99]about:blank

   Book: ‘Divorcing’

   Parts of this book by Susan Taubes — about, well, a woman divorcing her
   husband — feel like fever dreams. (In the opening pages, the narrator
   watches? recounts? hallucinates? herself getting decapitated.) The
   formal inventiveness is just part of how the novel wanders through the
   psyche of a woman experiencing personal and historical trauma. It is
   often baffling, always captivating.

   TV: ‘Single’s Inferno’

   The idea of a wholesome reality dating show might sound oxymoronic or
   boring, but this South Korean one pulls it off. Even though there’s
   little of the sexual explicitness of other shows — everyone is
   unfailingly polite, and hand-holding is about as steamy as it gets —
   both seasons are still totally addictive (and very visually pleasing).

   IFRAME:
   [100]https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-QI4XU_Tys?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Instagram: @visuals_china

   This daily digest of archival photos of China has some great historical
   shots, but I especially love the photos of ordinary people just living
   their lives: middle school students discoing in the 1980s, workers
   napping in public parks.

   They’re intimate and humanizing — welcome attributes when so much
   conversation about China right now is about geopolitics.
