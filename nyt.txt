   Trump Describes a U.S. in Distress and Says He Is the Solution
     * Former President Trump repeatedly denounced illegal immigration as
       he talked about a country he said was beset by problems.
     * Earlier, Mr. Trump recounted the attempt on his life to the
       Republican convention crowd. “I’m not supposed to be here tonight,”
       he said.

   If the goal tonight was to soften Trump’s image and unite the country,
   it wasn’t a success. If the goal was to fire up his base and show he is
   unbowed by the attempt on his life — he achieved that.
   Edward Wong

   Trump boasted that the U.S. would build an anti-missile defense system
   like the one Israel has. He had gotten the Republican Party to put this
   into its platform earlier. The Pentagon has not requested that such a
   system be built.
   Jess Bidgood

   Trump has complained about the Biden administration tonight. But he
   hasn’t talked about Biden’s current political predicament, with many
   members of his party urging him to get out of the race.

   The message of the first half of this speech seemed to be “I have been
   changed.” The message of the second half — assuming we’re in it — seems
   to be “I have not been changed all that much.”

   Trump is now praising Viktor Orban, the strongman leader of Hungary.
   Orban, who has been criticized for undermining democratic institutions
   in his country, is often cited favorably by Trump at rallies.
   Edward Wong
   Edward Wong
   Trump is now painting a portrait of the U.S. at odds with the lived
   reality. He says there is an “invasion” of migrants from across the
   globe. And he says the crime rate is going up. Federal data shows that
   the crime rate has plummeted nationwide.
   Jonathan Weisman

   Trump pointed to a chart that shows the lowest level of illegal
   immigration in history toward the end of his term. His policies
   certainly had an impact, but that was also the height of Covid.
   Jess Bidgood
   Jess Bidgood
   Trump is now showing the chart that was on screen when shots rang out
   at his rally last weekend — the chart he says saved his life. “Last
   time they put up that chart, I never really got to look at it,” Trump
   says.
