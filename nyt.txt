The Big Number: 4.9 Percent

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the Business news of the week

   What recession? Any lingering concerns about an economic slowdown in
   the United States were at least momentarily quieted as new data showed
   that the nation’s economy grew at a 4.9 percent annualized rate in the
   third quarter.

   Here’s what kept the economy growing →
   Josie Norton

   That pace of growth — the fastest since late 2021 — has been made
   possible in part by slowing inflation and a robust job market, which
   have kept consumers spending even as wage growth weakened.

   They have used their disposable income on vacations, dining out and,
   according to one home goods shop owner, candles — lots of candles. And
   that, in turn, fueled job growth in service industries like hotels and
   restaurants.
   Kent Nishimura for The New York Times

   But the rebound may not last.

   In the last three months of the year, Americans are resuming student
   loan payments, seeing their stockpiled savings dwindle and refinancing
   their debts at higher costs, a result of the Federal Reserve’s campaign
   to slow the economy by raising interest rates.
   Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock

   Still, as Britain and the eurozone see storm clouds gathering on the
   horizon, the United States remains a “global outlier” for its economic
   activity, said Andrew Hunter, deputy U.S. economist for the analysis
   firm Capital Economics.

   And as time goes on, many economists are realizing that while they may
   have been too optimistic on the Fed’s efforts to subdue inflation, they
   were too pessimistic on growth.
