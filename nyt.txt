Big Ticket: New York City’s Top Sales in January

   Vivian Marino
   Vivian MarinoReporting on real estate

   The new year got off to a robust start with a contract signed for a
   duplex penthouse in the heart of Billionaires’ Row in Midtown, and the
   more modest potential sale of Joan Didion’s former apartment.

   Here’s more on big ticket residential sales →

   Writer’s Pad Under Contract

   Didion’s estate has finally gone into contract on her apartment at 30
   East 71st Street, more than three years after her death. It has four
   bedrooms, plus a library, home office and staff quarters. The sale
   price and buyer aren’t yet known, but the most recent asking price was
   nearly $5.8 million. The co-op was first listed a year ago for $7.5
   million.

   Built Big for Billionaires

   The Midtown penthouse, with seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms and two
   powder rooms, will likely land in the Top 5 list of New York City’s
   biggest residential sales ever. The supertall condo tower, between
   Broadway and Seventh Avenue, is among the latest from Extell
   Development. Neither the purchase price nor the buyer is known since
   the sale hasn’t officially closed yet.
   Katherine Marks for The New York Times

   Park Avenue Penthouse Closes

   The investment banker John Thain, who once served as president of
   Goldman Sachs and the chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange,
   sold the Upper East Side duplex penthouse he shared with his wife,
   Carmen, for $28 million. The buyers were Kevin and Hampton Luzak. He is
   a money manager and she is a philanthropist.
