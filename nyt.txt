With George Santos Ouster, a Chaotic Congress Makes History Again

   A Republican-led House managed to purge a serial fabulist from its
   ranks, but the expulsion threatened to make it even harder for the
   G.O.P. to govern.

   [557]JUSTICE O’CONNOR’S HISTORIC DECISIONS ›
   Casey v. Planned Parenthood (1992)
   The court reaffirmed its decision in Roe v. Wade – the constitutional
   right to abortion – but for the first time, the justices crafted a
   standard for state abortion regulations, asking whether a regulation
   had the purpose or effect of imposing an “undue burden” on a woman
   seeking an abortion.
   Grutter v. Bollinger (2003)
   The court upheld an admissions policy at the University of Michigan Law
   School, finding that the school’s narrowly tailored use of race in
   admissions did not unduly harm nonminority applicants and furthered a
   compelling interest in the educational benefits of a diverse student
   body.
   McConnell v. F.E.C. (2004)
   The court upheld the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law, affirming
   the spending restrictions laid out in a yearslong effort at reforming
   how money is raised and spent in political campaigns. Justices O’Connor
   and John Paul Stevens wrote the opinion.
