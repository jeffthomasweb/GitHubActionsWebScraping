   Our investigation found that at crucial points, Netanyahu dragged out
   cease-fire talks to prevent his coalition’s collapse. At a tense
   meeting in April 2024, he opted to continue the war after a key ally
   threatened to bring down the government.

   In the war’s first moments, Netanyahu complained he hadn’t been warned
   of the attack. “I don’t see anything in the intelligence,” he said in a
   call. But we found he was warned repeatedly of a looming threat, just
   not specifically one from Gaza.

   Netanyahu’s team later ordered archivists to alter the official record
   of that call. Then they leaked a sensitive document, circumventing
   Israel’s military censorship system, in order to discredit Netanyahu’s
   critics, including families of hostages.

   Fearing it would divide his coalition, Netanyahu also refused to
   finalize a clear postwar plan for Gaza, leading to an aimless
   battlefield strategy that killed tens of thousands and stained Israel’s
   reputation — and still allowed Hamas to survive.
