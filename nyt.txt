   Trump Adds Tariff Exemptions for Smartphones, Computers and Other
   Electronics

   Some electronic products got a reprieve for now from at least some of

   The Bees Are Disappearing Again

   10 min read
   [574]Ivan Penn

   Ivan Penn

   North American honeybee colonies have long faced challenges, but this
   year has been unusually difficult. In addition to climate change, new
   issues emerged downstream from the rapid changes in American government
   →
   [575]Ivan Penn

   Ivan Penn

   Honeybees have been under threat for almost 20 years because of a
   mysterious condition called colony collapse disorder. Elon Musk and
   DOGE proposed cuts to the Department of Agriculture, where researchers
   study ways to protect bees.
   [576]Ivan Penn

   Ivan Penn

   I talked to Nancy and Keith Budke, migratory beekeepers who brave the
   care of thousands of hives by moving their bees from state to state to
   pollinate plants. Their trip begins in North Dakota, then to Texas and
   eventually California.
   [577]Ivan Penn

   Ivan Penn

   It’s a treacherous journey, and getting there has increasingly proven
   difficult. Annual loss rates among all beekeepers have been increasing
   over the last decade, exacerbated by significant colony collapses in
   commercial operations.
   [578]Ivan Penn

   Ivan Penn

   These threats to the bees coincide with trade wars that could make it
   harder for farmers to sell their crops abroad — coupled with a lack of
   colonies, farming could become more expensive and difficult, driving up
   prices for many staples.
