   Every few years, golden retriever fans gather at the Guisachan House to
   celebrate Sir Dudley Marjoribanks, who developed the breed.

   [587]We joined the big meet-up — and savored the group shot of 488 very
   good dogs.
   Roddy Mackay for The New York Times

   Paris

   Monuments like Notre-Dame and the Eiffel Tower need no introduction.

   [588]So our guide presented a different side of the French capital,
   including under-the-radar spots in the Montmartre neighborhood.
   Joann Pai for The New York Times

   The Dolomites

   Amid a trail-running boom, Italy’s Dolomite mountains have emerged as a
   top destination.

   [589]They serve up a challenge — but they also offer sun-dappled paths
   through larch forests and a lullaby of cowbells each evening.
   Francesco Guerra for The New York Times

   London

   Running from east to west, the new Elizabeth line brings an additional
   1.5 million people within 45 minutes of London’s busiest districts.

   Visitors can leave the city’s often tourist-clogged core to explore
   fascinating outer-London destinations.

   [590]We highlighted four areas: Southall, Romford, Custom House and
   Woolwich.
   Jeremie Souteyrat for The New York Times

   Tokyo

   The Japanese capital is a top post-pandemic destination.

   [591]Our guide encouraged visitors to explore beyond highly trafficked
   neighborhoods and think of the city as a warren of concealed gems.
   Andrew Faulk for The New York Times

   Mongolia

   Over the past decade, millennials have been seeking out remote places.

   [592]What better destination than Mongolia, where the government has
   invested in digital marketing, social media and excellent Wi-Fi.
