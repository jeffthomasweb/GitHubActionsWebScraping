Oscars Prep: Rolling Out the Red Carpet

   Amir Hamja

   Amir Hamja

   Reporting from Los Angeles, Calif.
   March 8, 2024

   This is my first year covering the Academy Awards, which are on Sunday.
   I arrived in Los Angeles on Tuesday and spent the week documenting
   preparations.

   Inside and outside the Dolby Theater are hundreds of people working
   behind the scenes to ready the space and perfect the lighting.

   Following last year’s surprise of a champagne-hued rug, the Academy has
   brought back the traditional red carpet.

   Details are meticulously prepared, down to the hand-painted texture on
   the wall where the celebrities will pose.

   Jimmy Kimmel returns to host the big event, which begins with a
   red-carpet pre-show at 6:30 p.m. Eastern.
