What’s in Our Queue? ‘BoJack Horseman’ and More

   Eric Kim
   Eric KimWriting from New York City

   I’m a food columnist for The New York Times Magazine. I also write
   about cooking and develop recipes. There’s nothing like animated
   television, A.S.M.R. videos and K-pop harmonies to refuel my creative
   stores.

   Here are five things I’ve recently relished →

   TV: ‘BoJack Horseman’

   To call Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s arsenic-sweet Netflix show a “comfort
   watch” might seem concerning. But the writing is so sharp and funny
   that I actually enjoy playing it in the background while I cook dinner
   or develop recipes. I’ve binged all six seasons multiple times and
   return to the show whenever I need multiple hits of instant
   gratification.

   IFRAME:
   [622]https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1eJMig5Ik4?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Book: ‘Open Book’

   The first CD I bought as a preteen was Jessica Simpson’s “Sweet
   Kisses.” As a longtime fan, I delighted in the concise storytelling in
   her memoir, “Open Book.” The narrative also outlines her experience
   with addiction, which she writes about plainly and with grace. Most
   urgently, she sets the record straight on the whole “Chicken of the
   Sea” debacle.

   Music Video: ‘Cosmic’

   The K-pop band Red Velvet’s latest single, “Cosmic,” proves that five
   is the ideal number of vocalists for a girl group. Each voice is
   pristinely deployed (i.e., no one sings for longer than a few seconds).
   The choreography matches this sonic egalitarianism: Like the best
   10-year-long friendships, Irene, Seulgi, Wendy, Joy and Yeri take turns
   sharing the center.

   [623]https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyG21rXCxlY?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Social Media: Cute Animal Videos

   My queues and feeds are just a series of viral animal videos: say, a
   baby elephant napping with its mother; an owl father meeting his
   newborn owlets for the first time; a drove of donkeys closing their
   eyes while a man sings “Country Road” to them. For a hit of serotonin
   in the morning, there’s nothing better.

   [624]Watch some videos here.

   Video: A.S.M.R. Crumbl Cookie Reviews

   As an insomniac, I rely on A.S.M.R. videos to fall asleep every night,
   and my latest obsession is a popular genre where YouTubers taste and
   review Crumbl Cookies. I love watching people eat these elaborate,
   sometimes stale, stodgy and underbaked cookies. Are they too sweet? Too
   rich? Too much? Probably. But they make the best eating sounds.
