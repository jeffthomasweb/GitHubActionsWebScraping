The Big Number: $50 Billion

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   Elon Musk became one of the world’s richest men in part because of the
   pay package — to the tune of $50 billion — he was given as chief
   executive of Tesla. But a judge’s decision has struck at the heart of
   his vast wealth.

   Here’s what to know →
   Allie Sullberg

   On Tuesday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court
   of Chancery voided the record pay promised to Musk, writing that he had
   effectively overseen his own compensation plan in a “deeply flawed
   process.”

   A group of shareholders filed a lawsuit after Musk reached the pay deal
   in 2018, accusing Tesla of giving investors misleading information when
   the company asked them to approve the package.
   Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters

   Now, Musk is threatening to incorporate Tesla in another state, like
   Texas, which he thinks could be more hospitable to his business. But
   he’s beholden to his shareholders, who could resist the change if they
   see it as an effort to diminish their power.

   In the meantime, Tesla’s board of directors has to figure out a new
   compensation plan that can pass legal muster and satisfy their
   mercurial leader.
   Godofredo A. Vásquez/Associated Press

   Whatever happens to Musk’s compensation, the legal battle has raised a
   larger question about executive pay: How much is too much?

   Sarah Anderson, global economy project director at the progressive
   research group Institute for Policy Studies, said McCormick’s ruling
   had established “that there is such a thing as excessive compensation.”

       Lawyers for Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, could try to appeal
       the decision, but legal experts said the chances of success were
       slim.
