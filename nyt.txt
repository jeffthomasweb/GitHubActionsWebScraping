Talking About Trump With Migrants in Texas

   Edgar Sandoval Gabriel V. Cárdenas

   Edgar Sandoval and Gabriel V. Cárdenas

   Jan. 23, 2025

   We visited a Brownsville shelter on Monday, where migrants who had just
   crossed the border watched clips of Trump’s inauguration. “I feel so
   lucky that we made it here before Biden left office,” said Yeitzi
   Fernandez, who came from Venezuela with her 12-year-old son.

   “If I could talk to Trump,” said Alex Escalona, a 21-year-old from
   Venezuela, “I would tell him that I want to work and live here. I’m not
   here to hurt anyone.”

   Erik Silva, 31, of Venezuela, said he received a court date for his
   asylum case in September 2026. “I want Trump to know that I support
   him,” he said. “I’m escaping a leftist country. I support his
   right-wing views.”

   Guillermo Estrada, 40, of Venezuela, tried to translate Trump’s speech
   for others at the shelter. “He’s saying he will send back those who
   entered the country illegally. That’s not us,” Estrada said.

   Victor Maldonado, who runs the shelter, said he had recently seen
   trucks from Immigration and Customs Enforcement nearby. “We don’t know
   if they can come in and pick up people who don’t have work permits,” he
   said.

   Martin Gomez, 45, of Colombia, was near the border on Monday when Trump
   disabled CBP One, an app allowing migrants to schedule appointments to
   enter the U.S. About 100 people had arrived at the shelter in the days
   before. Then “that was it,” Maldonado said.
