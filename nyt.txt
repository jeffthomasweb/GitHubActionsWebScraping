A Belmont in Saratoga

   Victor J. Blue Melissa Hoppert

   Victor J. Blue and Melissa Hoppert

   June 7, 2024
   (BUTTON)

   The Belmont Stakes is being held in upstate New York for the first time
   while Belmont Park undergoes a makeover. Sierra Leone, the morning-line
   favorite, enjoys the scenery at the bucolic Oklahoma track.

   A tractor passes by Saratoga Race Course's iconic grandstand, which was
   unveiled in 1892. A small army grooms the dirt racetrack throughout the
   day.

   Fans arrive early to try to secure picnic tables in the serene backyard
   that flanks the paddock, where the horses are saddled.

   The Kentucky Derby winner, Mystik Dan, enjoys a snack as the big race
   approaches. He is looking to add a second Triple Crown victory to his
   résumé after finishing second in the Preakness.

   Saratoga is known colloquially as the Spa, and here even the horses
   receive pedicures.

   Old-fashioned odds boards add to Saratoga's charm.

   The Belmont will be run at 6:41 p.m. on Saturday. Need a winner? When
   in doubt, bet on the gray.
