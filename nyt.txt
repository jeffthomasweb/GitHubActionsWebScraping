The Big Number: $31.5 Billion

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the Business news of the week

   It’s no smoke and mirrors: The rise of vaping is a big reason British
   American Tobacco, the parent company of Camel and Lucky Strike, said it
   would write down the value of its brands by 25 billion pounds, or $31.5
   billion.

   Here’s what’s behind the move →
   Josie Norton

   The cigarette giant’s sales in the United States have slipped, the
   company said this week, partly because of what it called “illicit”
   vapes.

   As smokers — especially younger ‌ones — shift to vapes and
   e-cigarettes, Tadeu Marroco, British American Tobacco’s chief
   executive, estimated that half the company’s sales would come from
   these products by 2035.
   Taylor Glascock

   Some 10 percent of the world’s one billion smokers have been reaching
   for vapes, many of which come in eye-grabbing pastel colors and eggy
   shapes that some young smokers have likened to toys or fashion
   accessories.

   The write-down may sting at the moment, Mr. Marroco said, but the
   popularity of vapes offers a “vast” opportunity for growth, too.
   OK McCausland for The New York Times

   In the near term, though, there are other troubles afoot for British
   American Tobacco: Inflation and slowing economic conditions, the
   company said, have pushed smokers to trade down to cheaper brands.

   While the company said it expected revenue to grow, the multibillion‌
   ‌dollar write-down was too grim for traders in London to ignore, and
   the company’s shares fell on Wednesday to their lowest in more than a
   decade.
