   Vivian Marino
   Vivian MarinoReporting on real estate

   One of Brooklyn’s most expensive homes, a fully renovated, 1870s row
   house on the corner of Sidney Place and Joralemon Street in Brooklyn
   Heights, is now under contract.

   Here’s more on big ticket real estate →
   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   Interior of 1 Sidney Place, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn

   The buyers are Emily Weiss, the founder of the beauty brand Glossier,
   and Will Gaybrick, a top executive at Stripe, a payment-processing
   provider.

   The pair reportedly paid around $22 million, just below the $22.5
   million price tag. The building is five stories high, with five
   bedrooms, five full baths and three half-baths. It also comes with a
   rooftop terrace.

   Home for a Novelist

   The British author Lee Child, best known for his Jack Reacher crime
   series, bought a fully renovated and restored brownstone on the Upper
   West Side. The price was $17 million.

   The late-1880s house is a block from Central Park on West 88th Street.
   It’s 20 feet wide and six stories high and includes a penthouse with a
   terrace.

   25 West 88th Street

   There’s also a landscaped rear garden, a balcony off the primary
   bedroom suite and a fourth-floor terrace.

   Around 8,000 square feet inside, the home has six bedrooms, six full
   baths, a yoga studio and a media room. On the lower level is a
   recreation room and wine cellar. Child, whose real name is James Dover
   Grant, has written dozens of novels and short stories.

   Another New Writing Pad

   The author Ron Chernow, known for his historical biographies, bought an
   apartment at the Dakota, at 1 West 72nd Street, paying almost $5
   million. The unit has two bedrooms, two full baths, and a library and
   den, each of which could be converted into additional bedrooms. The
   home exudes Old World charm, including 13-foot ceilings and three
   fireplaces.

   TriBeCa Estate Sale

   The longtime home of the French architect Thierry W. Despont, a TriBeCa
   townhouse that he bought three decades ago and meticulously restored,
   has finally sold.

   The price was $14.5 million, a big drop from the nearly $25 million he
   sought in 2021, two years before his death. The house, at 182 Franklin
   Street, is five stories high.
   VHT for Douglas Elliman

   182 Franklin Street

   There are four bedrooms, four full baths, and two half-baths, a media
   room, solarium and a swimming pool. The 10,000-square-foot home also
   came with air rights to build a sixth floor.

   Mr. Despont was known for refurbishing the Statue of Liberty and for
   his work on the homes of high-profile clients like Bill Gates and
   Calvin Klein.

   Upper West Side Mansion

   A double-width townhouse on the Upper West Side is on the market for
   $85 million. Neighbors had complained that they suffered countless days
   of construction-related noise, dust and fumes.

   The house, at 48-50 West 69th Street, between Central Park West and
   Columbus Avenue, is a combination of two 1890s row houses.
   ADRIAN Guat for Jim St. André

   48-50 West 69th Street

   It is 41.5 feet wide and six stories high. Total square footage is
   around 20,000 feet, which includes five bedrooms, eight baths and three
   powder rooms.

   There are many hotel-like amenities. Among them, a 55-foot indoor pool
   on the ground level, a Jacuzzi, fitness center and yoga space. Alas,
   the owners, the French businessman Pierre Bastid, and the jazz singer
   Malou Beauvoir, never moved in and didn’t get to enjoy any of it.
   ADRIAN Guat for Jim St. André
