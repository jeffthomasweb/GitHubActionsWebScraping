   ‘Completely Dry’: How Los Angeles Firefighters Ran Out of Water

Tracking the L.A. Wildfires Up Close

   I set out for Pacific Palisades Tuesday morning to photograph the Santa
   Ana winds. But within the day, the community was overrun by the
   Palisades fire. Soon two more major fires sparked.

   All I could hear were wind and crackling fire. Heat radiated as homes
   were engulfed around me. At times the dense smoke made it hard to see
   in front of me.

   The fire jumped from building to building, causing them to collapse
   like falling dominoes.  The wind whipped the flames faster than
   firefighters could respond.

   In some evacuation zones, residents chose to stay and fight the flames
   on their own. One volunteer tried to remove vegetation surrounding a
   local church.

   On Wednesday, I visited the Los Angeles Equestrian Center, where
   evacuees brought large animals for safety. I met Caitlin Allen as she
   comforted her horse Vintage.

   At the Eaton fire in Altadena, Danny Henley sifted though the remains
   of his home. The police stood nearby, guarding the neighborhood from
   looters.

   Despite my training, it’s still overwhelming to see this level of
   destruction so close to my home in Los Angeles County.
