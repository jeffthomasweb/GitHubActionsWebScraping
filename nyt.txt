   Planned Parenthood Is in Crisis

   The health care provider ​is working to shore up affiliate clinics that
   are in dire financial straits. Patients report failed abortions and
   misplaced IUDs.

   Four Takeaways From Our Investigation Into Planned Parenthood

   Katie Benner

   Planned Parenthood receives billions in donations, yet some clinics are
   so short of cash that care has suffered. I reviewed documents and
   talked with current and former executives, consultants and staff to
   figure out why →
   [583]Katie Benner

   Katie Benner

   Patients and staff recount chronic understaffing, a lack of basic
   supplies and salaries so low that full-time clinic workers often
   qualify for Medicaid and federal food assistance. Turnover at some
   clinics has hit 50 percent a year.
   [584]Katie Benner

   Katie Benner

   The national office, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, receives
   most of the donations, even though it doesn’t provide health care. It
   funds legal, political and public opinion work that supports abortion
   rights.
   [585]Katie Benner

   Katie Benner

   The clinics are run by 49 independent affiliates. Tensions grew over
   how to fund struggling clinics, buffeted for years by political
   headwinds that hurt their ability to raise enough money to cover
   procedures that patients can’t afford.
   [586]Katie Benner

   Katie Benner

   Planned Parenthood prioritized the abortion fight over overhauling its
   funding and organizational structure. Employees kept quiet because they
   feared giving fuel to abortion opponents. “We’re afraid of damaging the
   mission.”
   [587]Katie Benner

   Katie Benner

   Though synonymous with abortion, the organization provides basic health
   care to millions, is one of the few health care providers with a
   presence in all 50 states. With clinics in distress, it may have to
   make hard choices.
