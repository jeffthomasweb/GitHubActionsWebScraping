What’s in Our Queue? ‘Paatal Lok’ and More

   Sameer Yasir
   Sameer YasirWriting from New Delhi

   I am a reporter for The Times covering India and South Asia.

   Clean air is a luxury, I realized, after relocating to New Delhi.

   After shutting the doors and turning on air purifiers, here are five
   things I’ve been reading, watching and listening to →
   Amazon Prime

   TV: ‘Paatal Lok’

   In this gritty Prime Video drama, a disillusioned police officer
   investigates a failed assassination attempt on a journalist, a pursuit
   that leads him to India’s heart of darkness and the lives of four
   criminals, including one who loves dogs but attacks humans with a
   hammer.

   IFRAME:
   [559]https://www.youtube.com/embed/6iCH_4vJmFs?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Book: ‘The Light at the End of the World’

   I am hooked on Siddhartha Deb’s new novel, “The Light at the End of the
   World.” Its four novella-length sections connect India’s two previous
   centuries with its about-to-collapse future, even as the country
   endlessly tries to free itself.

   TV: ‘Scoop’

   Years ago, I read “Behind Bars in Byculla,” written by a reporter sent
   to prison on false charges — not unusual in India — for murdering
   another reporter. “Scoop,” streaming on Netflix, is a stunning
   retelling of that real-life crime involving police, media and criminal
   gangs in Mumbai.

   IFRAME:
   [560]https://www.youtube.com/embed/o84-SXX020Q?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Book: ‘Stringer’

   When Anjan Sundaram’s book “Stringer: A Reporter’s Journey in the
   Congo” was published, I wasn’t a journalist, but it helped me make the
   transition. Part memoir, part reportage, with terrific storytelling
   that reminds me of V.S. Naipaul, “Stringer” tries to address endless
   brutalities in the African country. I am reading it for the third time.

   Podcast: ‘Stolen’

   I fell in love with long-form podcasts like “Stolen: Surviving St.
   Michael’s.” In this eight-part series by Spotify, Connie Walker
   investigates the abuse her father and many other Indigenous people
   experienced as children at a residential school in Canada.
