   Former F.B.I. Director Comey Indicted After Pressure From Trump

   The indictment of James Comey is a culmination of President Trump’s
   push for retribution over the investigation of his 2016 campaign for
   possible Russia ties.


   Analysis

   Trump Gets the Retribution He Sought, and Shatters Justice Dept. Norms

   The indictment trampled the department’s tradition of keeping a
   distance from politics and the White House, and raised the prospect of
   more arbitrary charges.

   Amazon to Pay $2.5 Billion to Settle Claims It Tricked Prime Customers

   The Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon, saying its subscription
   service lured in millions of people and made it hard to cancel. They
   reached a deal today, one of the largest in F.T.C. history →
   [573]Karen Weise

   Karen Weise

   For example, the F.T.C. documented that when someone wanted to buy an
   item, an orange button blaring “Get FREE Same-Day Delivery” would
   enroll the customer in a paid Prime subscription.
   [574]Karen Weise

   Karen Weise

   The company didn’t admit or deny wrongdoing, but agreed to pay up to
   $2.5 billion in penalties and payments to customers. The settlement
   does not fundamentally change its customer interactions.
   [575]Karen Weise

   Karen Weise

   Analysts who follow the company said the settlement lets Amazon avoid
   bad headlines in a jury trial, which had begun in Seattle, and move on
   with business ahead of the holiday shopping season.

   Trump Wades Into Bailout Politics in Offering a Lifeline to Argentina

   5 min read

   Alan Rappeport

   I cover the Treasury Department, the I.M.F. and the World Bank. This
   week, the Trump administration chose to make a move that could come
   with political and economic peril: bailing out Argentina.
   [579]Alan Rappeport

   Alan Rappeport

   Argentina has lurched from economic crisis to economic crisis in recent
   decades. The country’s latest reform efforts are faltering and its
   president, Javier Milei, has seen his political fortunes fade.
   [580]Alan Rappeport

   Alan Rappeport

   Trump has a personal fondness for Milei and wants to prop him up. The
   Treasury Department is planning to give Argentina a $20 billion loan in
   hopes that it will help Milei’s party in legislative elections next
   month.
   [581]Alan Rappeport

   Alan Rappeport

   But bailouts are not popular in the U.S., and some critics argue that
   Trump is flouting his own “America First” agenda in favor of “Making
   Argentina Great Again.”
   [582]Alan Rappeport

   Alan Rappeport

   Trump and his Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, insist that Argentina
   is a crucial ally that gives the U.S. a foothold in Latin America,
   where it is competing with China for influence.
