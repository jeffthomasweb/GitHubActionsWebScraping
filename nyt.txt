   [577]Why We Did This Story
   [578]Patrick Healy

   Patrick Healy
   Assistant Managing Editor

   This story, about a classified Navy SEAL mission in North Korea in 2019
   intended to help Americans in high-level nuclear talks, has never been
   told. National security reporting like this is in the public interest →
   [579]Patrick Healy

   Patrick Healy
   Assistant Managing Editor

   These missions often remain shielded by secrecy laws, leaving most
   Americans with no way to know about major actions that influence
   national security and may have an impact on their lives.
   [580]Patrick Healy

   Patrick Healy
   Assistant Managing Editor

   The Times proceeds cautiously when reporting on classified military
   operations. We withheld some sensitive information that could affect
   future Special Operations and intelligence missions.
   [581]Patrick Healy

   Patrick Healy
   Assistant Managing Editor

   The reporters interviewed two dozen current and former U.S. officials
   familiar with the mission. Officials said they were discussing
   classified details because the mission highlights a problem that
   plagues Special Operations.
   [582]Patrick Healy

   Patrick Healy
   Assistant Managing Editor

   That problem is that these missions require extreme care and precision
   but are exceptionally vulnerable to failure. Some are big successes;
   others go wrong. There is often little public accountability.
