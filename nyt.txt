       for treatment early Thursday. They had crossed from Gaza into
       Egypt.

    7. Hamas is willing to release about 50 hostages, all women and
       children, if the right conditions are met, including a release by
       Israel of a similar number of women and children being held
       prisoner, said an official briefed on the talks.
       Amit Elkayam for The New York Times
    8. Israeli soldiers searched for human remains among the debris in

What’s in Our Queue? ‘Local Valley’ and More

   Ernesto Londoño
   Ernesto LondoñoWriting from St. Paul, Minn.

   I’m a national correspondent for The New York Times based in St. Paul,
   Minn.

   I’ve been consuming audiobooks, reality TV and YouTube videos about
   breathwork. Here are five things I’ve enjoyed recently →

   Album: ‘Local Valley’

   This sublime 2021 album by the Swedish singer-songwriter José González
   has become my go-to on days when I’m feeling sad. My favorite songs are
   “El Invento,” in Spanish, and “En Stund På Jorden,” in Swedish.

   IFRAME: [604]about:blank

   Audiobook: ‘Uncultured’

   This memoir by Daniella Mestyanek Young chronicles a childhood spent in
   a religious cult whose leaders sexually abused minors. Her escape was a
   career in the Army, which the author came to see as cultlike. It’s a
   dark story that forced me to think more expansively about what
   constitutes a cult.

   IFRAME: [605]about:blank

   Podcast: ‘Havana Syndrome’

   I devoured this spy thriller from Vice World News narrated by the
   journalists Jon Lee Anderson and Adam Entous. It’s a riveting look at
   the mysterious ailments that crippled American spies and diplomats
   starting in 2016.

   IFRAME: [606]about:blank

   TV: ‘For the Love of Dilfs’

   This over-the-top, clutch-those-pearls-girl matchmaking reality show is
   fittingly hosted by the adult film actress known as Stormy Daniels. The
   drama and steamy scenes get old quickly, but I kept watching mainly
   because it provides an intimate and revealing look at a woman who
   became an unexpected protagonist of the Trump era.

   YouTube: Breathe With Sandy

   I love doing breath work — a practice of altering the way we breathe,
   often by alternating periods of hyperventilation with breath retentions
   — in the morning. That’s how I discovered the Breathe With Sandy
   YouTube channel, which blends the creator’s calm demeanor with
   excellent music and gorgeous vistas.
