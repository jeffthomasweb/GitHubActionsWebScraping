   You already [606]know Donald Trump. He is [607]unfit to lead.
   [608]Watch him.
   Listen to [609]those who know him [610]best. He tried to [611]subvert
   an election and remains a [612]threat to democracy. He helped overturn
   Roe, with terrible [613]consequences. Mr. Trump’s [614]corruption and
   [615]lawlessness go [616]beyond [617]elections: It’s his whole
   [618]ethos. He [619]lies without [620]limit. If he’s re-elected, the
   G.O.P. won’t [621]restrain him. Mr. Trump will use the [622]government
   to go after [623]opponents. He will pursue a [624]cruel policy of mass
   [625]deportations. He will wreak havoc on the [626]poor, the
   [627]middle class and [628]employers. Another Trump term will damage
   the [629]climate, shatter [630]alliances and strengthen [631]autocrats.
   Americans should demand [632]better. Vote.
