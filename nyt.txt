Generals Accuse Mercenary Leader of Attempted Coup as Moscow Tightens
Security

     * Russia’s main security agency moved against Yevgeny Prigozhin,
       whose private army has been critical to its war effort in Ukraine.
     * Mr. Prigozhin accused the Russian military of attacking his forces
       and pledged that his fighters would retaliate.

   Moscow’s mayor said security had been increased in Moscow in a post on
   his Telegram channel. That includes more security on roads and the
   possibility that events in the city would be limited, he said.

   State-run media in China — Moscow's most important diplomatic partner —
   is so far mute about the reports of an attempted armed rebellion in

   The current standoff marks a stunning collapse in Prigozhin’s
   relationship with Putin. Just a month ago, the Russian president issued
   a statement congratulating Prigozhin’s “Wagner assault units.”

   Prigozhin has issued a new voice recording on the Telegram messaging
   platform. He says his fighters are approaching the city of
   Rostov-on-Don, which is in southern Russia, near Ukraine, and adds: “We
   are going farther. We will go to the end.”
