   Trump-Kennedy 2024? Donald Trump, at Least, Is Intrigued by the Idea

   The former president has repeatedly asked advisers in recent weeks
   about the idea of selecting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his No. 2, sources
   said.


The Big Number: $2.5 Billion

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   When Trump Media began public trading in late March, its market value
   soared. But the company’s fortunes on Wall Street have taken a turn:
   This past week, its share price slipped to around $42, erasing more
   than $2.5 billion.

   Here’s the latest →
   Josie Norton

   Many investors are lining up to bet on Trump Media’s collapse via a
   practice known as “shorting.”

   That method involves borrowing shares of a company and selling them
   into the market to buy them back later at a lower price, before
   returning the shares to the lender and pocketing the difference.
   Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters

   It is just the latest rough patch for Trump Media, the parent company
   of Truth Social — the digital platform that has become Donald J.
   Trump’s main outlet for reaching his supporters and attacking his
   critics — whose path to the stock exchange has been full of twists and
   turns over nearly three years.
   Will Oliver/EPA, via Shutterstock

   Many of these challenges arose during the company’s efforts to complete
   a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, to help
   take it public. That process involved a Securities and Exchange
   Commission investigation, an $18 million penalty and a lawsuit
   involving two early founders of the social media company that made its
   way to Delaware Chancery Court.
   Nic Antaya for The New York Times

   Based on its trading pattern so far, Trump Media looks a lot like a
   meme stock. Those stocks — shares of companies whose investors may be
   influenced by the whims of social media — are volatile by nature.

   Mr. Trump, however, the presumptive Republican nominee for president,
   may have larger worries on his mind. He recently had to post bonds in
   two separate cases, amounting to well over $200 million.
