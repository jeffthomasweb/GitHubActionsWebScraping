   Biden Makes Case for 2nd Term While Lashing Out at ‘Predecessor’

   President Kicks Off Rematch With Trump, Criticizing His ‘Lies’
     * At the State of the Union address, President Biden argued for
       Ukraine aid, promised to defend reproductive rights and promoted
       his economic record.
     * He also repeatedly criticized Donald Trump, without naming him,
       saying he would threaten democracy were he to return to the Oval
       Office.


   [554]

   The White House guest list for the address underscored some of the
   Biden administration’s biggest accomplishments.

   That was an aggressive ending by Biden as he took on the age issue and
   tried to turn it to his advantage. Republicans hoping for a major
   stumble will be disappointed, though he did misspeak a few times.
   Democrats will be encouraged by this performance.
   Lisa Lerer

   The president was energetic, feisty with his Republican opponents and
   loose. He both laid out a contrast with Trump and delivered some ideas
   for what he would try to do with a second term. I’ve already heard from
   some Biden allies who are very happy with this performance.
   Lisa Lerer

   And this was a new line that Biden has been using on the age issue
   getting some prime time in this speech. “The issue facing our nation
   isn’t how old we are, it’s how old our ideas are.”

   “I know you didn’t want to hear anymore Lindsey,” Biden said to Lindsey
   Graham, clearly relishing the give and take from the rostrum with
   Republicans.

   Rashida Tlaib, the the only Palestinian American in Congress, cried as
   Biden described the suffering of the people in Gaza, and her
   colleagues, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, comforted her.

   Biden is delivering a feisty, confrontational and loud speech,
   demonstrating energy in part through volume and defiance in a clear
   effort to dispel concerns about his age.
   Lisa Lerer
   Lisa Lerer
   If you want clues into Biden’s general election message, pay attention
   to what was at the top of the speech, before Americans start turning
   the channel: democracy, abortion rights, pandemic comeback and
   infrastructure.
   Jim Tankersley
   Jim Tankersley
   Between the heckling from Republicans, the rowdy cheers from Democrats
   and President Biden’s verve for sparring with the crowd, this is a
   raucous speech.
