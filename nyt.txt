   Who Are the Favorites to Win Eurovision?

   7 min read
   [579]Alex Marshall

   Alex Marshall

   Eurovision is the oddest, and most popular, singing event in the world.
   Pop stars represent countries, performing acts ranging from sublime to
   ridiculous, while fans cast votes that often are based on politics as
   much as quality. Who could win? →
   [580]Alex Marshall

   Alex Marshall

   This is serious business for gambling firms, and many believe there’s
   only one likely winner: Kaj, a comedy trio representing Sweden with a
   song about saunas.
   [581]Alex Marshall

   Alex Marshall

   Kaj has everything: a catchy chorus, semi-naked dancers and an
   accordion. Accordions always help. But for spectacle, there’s better —
   Luxembourg’s act spends three minutes pretending to be a toy doll.
   [582]Alex Marshall

   Alex Marshall

   Elsewhere, Poland’s entry — who is 52! — sings with a digital dragon.
   And Norway’s boyish act has so much fire onstage you fear he’ll set
   alight his slick hair.
   [583]Alex Marshall

   Alex Marshall

   Who’s my choice? Finland! Its representative is Erika Vikman singing
   “Ich Komme,” a sex-positive ode with a performance that includes
   spurting fireworks. Sadly, she will not win. My favorite always comes
   second!
