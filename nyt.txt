   The Hard Truth of Weight-Loss Drugs: You Probably Need Them Forever

   4 min read
   [652]Dani Blum

   Dani Blum

   Most Americans don’t want to stay on weight-loss drugs long-term, and
   stop taking them within a year. But research has repeatedly shown that
   quitting means gaining back the weight.
   [653]Dani Blum

   Dani Blum

   Medical authorities like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for
   one, have suggested that the drugs are a temporary bridge, not a
   long-term tool.
   [654]Dani Blum

   Dani Blum

   But weight-loss drugs really are forever drugs. Stop taking them, and
   you’ll almost always gain back the weight you lost.
   [655]Dani Blum

   Dani Blum

   This month, a study showed that the average person who used weight-loss
   drugs returned to their starting weight around a year and a half after
   stopping them.
   [656]Dani Blum

   Dani Blum

   Doctors are caught in a de facto experiment, trying to modulate between
   patients’ desires to go off the drugs and the reality that they will
   probably gain weight when they do.
