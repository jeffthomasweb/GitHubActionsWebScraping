Powerful Earthquake Shakes Morocco, Killing More Than 2,000

     * The quake, centered in the mountains outside of Marrakesh, was the
       strongest to hit the area in a century. “It felt like a plane fell
       on me,” one survivor said.
     * Scenes of devastation unfolded across the country as emergency
       teams raced to prevent more deaths in the hardest-hit rural areas.

How to Choose Paint Colors

   Tim McKeough
   Tim McKeoughReporting on home décor

   Everyone knows it’s easy to transform a room with paint. But finding
   the right color can be difficult. Unless you’re a pro like Brigette
   Romanek.

   Here’s how she chose the new color for her bedroom →
   Michael Tyrone Delaney for The New York Times

   Assess the situation. What kind of vibe are you going for? “I want it
   to feel more layered, and like a cocoon,” Romanek said of her bedroom.

   Then start collecting chips! Try Benjamin Moore or Sherwin-Williams if
   you want thousands of options; companies like Farrow & Ball and Clare
   offer an edited selection.
   Michael Tyrone Delaney

   Tape the chips up. It’s the only way to tell what those colors will
   look like in the room.

   Narrow your choices and throw some paint on the wall: “I like to do
   really large samples” — about four-by-four feet each.
   Michael Tyrone Delaney

   Pick your favorite — but only after you’ve lived with the samples for
   several days. “You have to see them in different types of light,”
   Romanek said.

   Finish the job. Make sure to allow plenty of time for each coat to dry.
   Then move in and relax!
