What’s in Our Queue? ‘Armchair Expert’ and More

   Jonathan Abrams
   Jonathan AbramsWriting from Charlotte, N.C.

   I’m a reporter for the Culture desk at The New York Times.

   Here are five things I’ve recently watched, read and listened to that
   have left me feeling curious and motivated →
   Michael Friberg for The New York Times

   Podcast: ‘Armchair Expert’

   Disclaimer: I was once a guest on this podcast hosted by Dax Shepard
   and Monica Padman. But I was a fan long before then. Shepard and Padman
   make their A-list guests like Barack Obama, Bill Gates and Shepard’s
   wife, the actress Kristen Bell, feel immediately welcomed and
   vulnerable in exploring all of life’s messiness.

   Music: Melvin Crispell III

   My wife introduced to me to the soulful ballads of this Charlotte-based
   singer, who won Season 9 of BET’s gospel competition “Sunday Best.” A
   two-time Grammy nominee for best gospel performance, he is also the son
   of the gospel artist Melvin Crispell Jr. For a quick primer on the
   younger Crispell’s talents, check out “Wonderful Is Your Name.”

   Book: ‘Why We Love Baseball’

   I’m a lifetime baseball enthusiast (go, Dodgers!). When my sons showed
   little interest in the sport, I joined a 35-and-over league and pulled
   my hamstring in our first game. Joe Posnanski is baseball’s greatest
   modern-day storyteller, and his passion and expertise leap through
   every page of this book on why baseball became America’s national
   pastime.

   Video: Yoga With Adriene

   I’ve been an avid follower of “Yoga With Adriene” for years. Her
   gentle, step-by-step guidance throughout her 30-day instructional
   videos is perfect, whether you’re a yoga novice or a sun-salutation
   veteran. Adriene Mishler, with frequent guest appearances by her dog,
   Benji, helps me start my days feeling refreshed and full of gratitude.

   Television: ‘The Wire’

   There’s no bad time to rewatch “The Wire,” something I make a point of
   doing every few years. I’ve heard all about how some can’t get into the
   show after consuming the first couple of episodes. Force yourself, if
   you have to. The reward is a show that unveils institutional failure in
   a way never done before. (I’m the author of an oral history of the
   series.)
