The Big Number: $68,789

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   Bitcoin has not yet reached its previous record high — $68,789.63 — but
   investors are watching as it gets tantalizingly close. On Friday
   morning, its price hovered around $62,000.

   Here’s what’s behind the increase →
   George Wylesol

   The comeback is a reversal of fortune from more than a year ago, when
   the value of cryptocurrency cratered as Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange,
   FTX, collapsed almost overnight.

   Many investors lost billions, and intensified government scrutiny of
   the industry fueled doubts about its existence. Some wondered anew: If
   digital currency isn’t backed by another asset, is it really worth
   anything?
   Seth Wenig/Associated Press

   Recently, a new financial product tied to Bitcoin has generated renewed
   enthusiasm among investors. In January, the Securities and Exchange
   Commission authorized nearly a dozen financial firms to offer
   exchange-traded funds that track Bitcoin’s price.

   An E.T.F. is essentially a basket of assets broken up into shares,
   allowing investors to buy shares in the basket rather than owning the
   assets directly.
   Samuel Aranda for The New York Times

   The price of Bitcoin immediately shot up after the S.E.C. approvals and
   has continued to climb since.

   But courts are still considering larger questions about whether digital
   currencies should be treated like stocks and bonds — and subject to the
   same rules — and weighing in on lawsuits that may determine the future
   of crypto companies in the United States. Those decisions could bring
   an end to investors’ euphoria.
