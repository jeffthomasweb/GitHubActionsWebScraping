Israel Tells U.N. That All of Northern Gaza Should Be Evacuated

     * The U.N. said that moving the approximately 1.1 million people
       affected within the 24-hour deadline given by Israel’s military
       would have dire consequences.
     * Retaliating for a deadly weekend attack by Hamas terrorists, Israel
       is pummeling Gaza and has cut off vital supplies to the coastal
       territory.


   [62]

As Israel Prepares for War in Gaza, Debate Is Over How and How Long

   The country’s new unity government agrees that Hamas must be destroyed
   so it can never attack Israel again, but there is little appetite for a
   reoccupation.

   7 min read

    1. Six days of Israeli bombardment of Gaza have left more than 1,500
       Palestinians dead, more than 6,000 injured and 300,000 people
       homeless, according to the Gazan Health Ministry.
       Associated Press
    2. The strikes, a response to a deadly Hamas incursion on Saturday
       that killed over 1,200 Israelis, come even as Hamas is believed to
       be holding about 150 hostages in the Gaza Strip.
       Yousef Masoud for The New York Times
    3. The largest medical complex in the Gaza Strip, Al Shifa Hospital,
       has seen a nonstop stream of dead and wounded, as well as displaced
       Palestinians looking for safety.
       Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times
    4. Injured Palestinians were transported to the Al Shifa hospital
       complex after bombs were dropped on the Al Shati refugee camp west
       of Gaza City.
       Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times
    5. Israel has responded forcefully to Saturday's attacks, firing a
       wave of airstrikes and sealing off the territory in Gaza.
       By The Associated Press
    6. While in Tel Aviv to meet with senior Israeli officials, Secretary
       of State Antony J. Blinken also visited a donation center and heard
       from Israeli citizens who shared personal stories and asked the
       United States for help.
    7. In Israel, officials continued to assess the damage five days after
       devastating attacks by Hamas. In Sderot, Israeli police examined
       the site of a rocket attack.
       Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times
    8. Weapons were distributed at the Ayelet Hashachar kibbutz in
       northern Israel near the Lebanese border. Thousands of reservists
       have been called into service.
       Jalaa Marey/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
    9. A damaged house in Duhaira, a village in southern Lebanon. Najib
       Mikati, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, said on Thursday that
       he was concerned about clashes with Israel on his nation’s southern
       border. “Lebanon is in the eye of the storm,” he said.
