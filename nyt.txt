   The iPhone has long been the world’s most expensive smartphone, but the
   Justice Department filed a lawsuit arguing that Apple has commanded top
   dollar through unfair monopoly practices.
   Tripp Mickle
   Tripp Mickle
   In an 88-page lawsuit, the government argued that Apple had violated
   antitrust laws to keep people reliant on their iPhones and less likely
   to switch to lower-priced devices.
   Tripp Mickle

   The government says Apple does this with a number of techniques,
   including making messages from rival smartphones show up in green
   bubbles, suggesting that they might be inferior.

   Apple also prevents banks and companies like Paypal from using
   tap-to-pay at checkout. As a result, Apple Pay is the only option.

   Apple plans to file a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the law
   allows it to adopt policies that it believes make using an iPhone a
   better experience.
