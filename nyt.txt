   America’s Arctic Research Focus Shifts to Security

   4 min read
   [599]Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   Scientists who study the Arctic are used to major change. After all,
   the region is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the
   planet. But now they’re in for a political shift, too.
   [600]Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   Rather than prioritizing climate research, a recent government report
   emphasizes various kinds of national security, such as the military and
   energy production.
   [601]Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   The Trump administration has slashed federal funding for science,
   hitting climate-related fields especially hard. But with the shift
   toward security, polar research is becoming a government priority.
   [602]Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   In recent years, federal science agencies have stepped up their efforts
   to involve Indigenous communities in research. It’s unclear if these
   efforts would continue under a security-focused agenda.
   [603]Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   Sachi Kitajima Mulkey

   Heightening the uncertainty, a venerable Arctic research consortium
   that worked with Indigenous communities closed, and a planning document
   was scrubbed of language about Indigenous leadership.
