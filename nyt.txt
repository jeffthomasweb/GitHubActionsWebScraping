Flying Over the L.A. Fires

   Loren Elliott Emily Baumgaertner

   Loren Elliott and Emily Baumgaertner

   Jan. 10, 2025

   On Thursday afternoon we boarded a helicopter to get a view of the
   fires as they raged on. With the door open and the acrid wind whipping
   our gear, we rose up to 3,000 feet in the air.

   As we surveyed the flattened terrain, we could see blazing orange
   jewels dotting the ridges. Fire crews gathered around a roof here, a
   fence there. But mostly, everything was just gone.

   The inferno had torn down the cliffs, destroyed the scarps, hopped the
   Pacific Coast Highway and ignited almost every last structure until it
   reached the sand. It left a swelling sienna haze.

   Toward Eaton Canyon, there were neat grids of smoldering rubble and
   chimneys — just chimneys — where cul-de-sacs had been.

   From the east, the skyscrapers of the Los Angeles basin were painted
   blue against the horizon — ashy, cool-toned silhouettes of what
   remained.
