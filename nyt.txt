   New York, Long a City of Contradictions, Is Still Turning Up New Ones

   New York City has often set the political and cultural course of the

   California Promised Insurance Relief, but Delivered Loopholes

   13 min read
   [624]Jo Becker

   Jo Becker

   Nearly one-third of California’s 40 million residents live in or
   nestled against highly flammable, brushy or densely forested wildlands,
   more people than in any other state. I’m one of them.
   [625]Jo Becker

   Jo Becker

   I live up a steep canyon in unincorporated Los Angeles, and like many,
   I worry about losing my insurance coverage. Some of my neighbors are
   still rebuilding their homes after the Woolsey Fire in 2018.
   [626]Jo Becker

   Jo Becker

   In 2023, regulations were created to protect policies in risky areas
   like mine. I was relieved, even though it meant higher rates. Then, one
   by one, my neighbors began losing their insurance.
   [627]Jo Becker

   Jo Becker

   After evacuating twice due to the fires that devastated swaths of Los
   Angeles in January, I started investigating. My colleagues and I
   learned that the new regulations effectively rewarded companies that
   dumped risky policies.
   [628]Jo Becker

   Jo Becker

   And whether they will resume writing polices in neighborhoods like mine
