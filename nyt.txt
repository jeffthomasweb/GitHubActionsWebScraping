What’s in Our Queue? ‘Dear Ex’ and More

   John Liu
   John LiuWriting from Seoul

   I cover news in China and Taiwan with a focus on the technology sector
   for The Times. I stay connected with my homeland in Taiwan and explore
   the world through film, music and books.

   Here are five things I’ve been watching, reading and listening to →

   Movie: ‘Dear Ex’

   A widow struggles to reclaim her husband’s insurance money after
   discovering the benefactor has been changed to his male lover. Set in
   Taiwan, this emotionally gripping comedy navigates the complexities of
   love through its richly human characters, including the lead actors,
   Hsieh Ying-xuan and Roy Chiu.

   IFRAME:
   [625]https://www.youtube.com/embed/cZuDMECORFE?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Album: ‘Kinakaian’

   The singer Abao is a member of the Paiwan, an Indigenous group in
   Taiwan. Her album “Kinakaian,” which translates to “mother tongue,”
   quickly became a hit after its 2019 release. I was immediately hooked
   by its blend of electro and pop with traditional ballads, despite not
   understanding the lyrics.

   IFRAME: [626]about:blank

   Movie: ‘A City of Sadness’

   This 1989 masterpiece by Hou Hsiao-hsien explores one of Taiwan’s
   deepest collective traumas: the Feb. 28, 1947, massacre of thousands of
   Taiwanese by Chiang Kai-shek’s Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang
   government. It serves as a bitter reminder of the strides the country
   has made toward freedom and democracy.

   [627]https://www.youtube.com/embed/caU7X7LV-5E?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Book: ‘Assignment China’

   I’m embarking on a journey through post-World War II China, guided by
   the accounts and behind-the-scenes stories of China correspondents.
   Mike Chinoy, a former Beijing bureau chief at CNN, chronicles these
   journalists’ records of Tiananmen Square, Covid-19 and more in this
   collection of oral histories. It is a source of profound inspiration.

   TV: ‘Suits’

   “Suits” tops my list for a feel-good show after a long day. Witty,
   humorous and sexy are typical descriptors for the series, but it is the
   chemistry among the main characters that makes it so captivating. Plus,
   you get to learn all the legal jargon, in case you need it one day.
