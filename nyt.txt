The Big Number: 171

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   Boeing 737 Max 9s aren’t leaving the tarmac anytime soon. Since a
   portion of a Max 9 fuselage blew off midair during an Alaska Airlines
   from Oregon to California flight last week, 171 airliners have been
   grounded.

   Here’s what investigations are underway →
   Allie Sullberg

   The central question is whether the door panel from the Boeing 737 Max
   had been properly bolted onto body of the plane. In search of answers,
   two government agencies are conducting separate investigations.

   The Federal Aviation Administration is looking into whether Boeing
   failed to ensure that its Max 9 planes were safe to fly and
   manufactured to match the design the agency had approved.
   Lindsey Wasson/Associated Press

   The F.A.A. has ordered the inspection of all Max 9s in the United
   States. United Airlines and Alaska Airlines both said on Monday that
   they had found loose bolts or “loose hardware” on Max 9s in the process
   of those inspections.

   The same day, the National Transportation Safety Board — the other
   agency that has opened an inquiry — said it was possible that the bolts
   had never been installed onto the Max 9 before it took off.
   M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times

   The safety board is investigating a wider set of factors that may have
   contributed to the plane’s malfunction, including Boeing’s
   manufacturing process, any maintenance or installation work Boeing or
   Alaska Airlines carried out on the plane and potential gaps in the
   F.A.A.’s oversight.

   But ultimately, Boeing is in the hot seat again. A different 737 model,
   the Max 8, was involved in crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed
   hundreds.
   Stuart Isett for The New York Times

   Though travelers may be eager to rebook their flights and take to the
   air — hundreds of flights have been canceled since the grounding,
   affecting tens of thousands of customers — this latest episode
   involving Boeing airliners has undoubtedly frightened many.

   It has also spooked Wall Street: In the first trading session after the
   accident, Boeing’s share prices fell about 8 percent.
