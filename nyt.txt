U.A.W. Strike Could Have Significant Impact on U.S. Economy and Politics

   The union targeted Detroit’s Big Three automakers all at once.
   Prolonged walkouts could fuel inflation and affect the 2024
   presidential election.

Auto Workers Take to the Streets as Contract Negotiations Stagnate

   Nic Antaya Cydni Elledge

   Reporting from Wayne, Mich.

   Contract negotiations over pay, pensions and work hours at the three
   big Detroit automakers broke down on Thursday night. Horace Kyles, a
   third-generation Ford employee, said the strike was “a necessary evil.”

   The chief executive of General Motors, Mary Barra, said the company had
   “put a historic offer on the table” that included gross wage increases
   of more than 20 percent, better job security and “world-class health
   care.”

   Workers at three plants in the Midwest were on strike on Friday. The
   walkout included about 12,700 of the union’s 150,000 workers.

   “I just felt left behind like everybody else, you know,” said Justin
   Lowe, who has worked at Ford for three years. “We're working paycheck
   to paycheck.”

   Shawn Fain, the president of the United Automobile Workers union,
   joined workers at a Michigan plant as soon as the strike began on
   Thursday night. “It’s about them,” he said of the workers. “It’s about
   getting their share, and our share, of economic justice.”

The strike’s sticking points go to the heart of President Biden’s political
identity.
