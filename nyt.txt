   The G.O.P. Senator Who Can’t Stop Thinking About the Boy ICE Detained
   [45]Caroline Kitchener

   Caroline Kitchener

   You might remember Katie Britt from her response to the State of the
   Union address two years ago. Since then, she’s quietly become a very
   interesting figure in the Senate — at the center of the immigration
   debate.
   [46]Caroline Kitchener

   Caroline Kitchener

   I interviewed the senator five times over the course of several weeks
   and spent a few days with her at her home in Montgomery, Ala.
   [47]Caroline Kitchener

   Caroline Kitchener

   I got to see her react in real time to the photo of the 5-year-old boy
   detained by ICE as she tried to figure out what happened and how she
   should respond.
   [48]Caroline Kitchener

   Caroline Kitchener

   Britt, a mom and a Christian who cares deeply about the well-being of
   children, stands firmly behind President Trump. It was fascinating to
   watch her reckon with this moment of unprecedented ICE activity.
