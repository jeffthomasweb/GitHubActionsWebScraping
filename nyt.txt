   ‘You Love It or You Hate It’: Pumpkin Spice Lattes Divide Europe

   Views on the flavored drinks are split in a place where coffee culture
   goes back nearly a half-millennium and American culinary creations are
   often derided.

   Trump’s Son Is Poised to Profit From Pentagon Drone Proposal

   9 min read
   [641]Eric Lipton

   Eric Lipton

   Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, has entered the military
   weapons trade. He is serving as an adviser or investor to Pentagon
   contractors, including a start-up that sells drone parts to the Army.
   [642]Eric Lipton

   Eric Lipton

   The work has provoked questions about conflicts of interest. President
   Trump in June signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to
   buy U.S.-made drones. His son works with a company that sells them.
   [643]Eric Lipton

   Eric Lipton

   The war in Ukraine has demonstrated how important drones are in modern
   warfare. Sales are surging in the United States, and companies like
   Unusual Machines, which contracted with Mr. Trump, are working to build
   market share.
   [644]Eric Lipton

   Eric Lipton

   Spokesmen for Don Jr. and Unusual Machines both said the president’s
   son had not reached out to any federal officials and simply offered
   financial advice, as he was entitled to do as a businessman.
   [645]Eric Lipton

   Eric Lipton

   But presidential historians said they could see no direct parallels in
   modern U.S. history among adult children of former presidents to what
   Don Jr. is doing — working for a military contractor seeking to sell
   parts destined for the Pentagon.
   [646]Eric Lipton

   Eric Lipton

   This is just one of many conflicts of interest that have emerged in
   President Trump’s second term, including the family’s new
   cryptocurrency ventures, which have generated billions of dollars for
   the Trumps.
