The Big Number: 5.2%

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   While China’s economy may seem to be booming, the reality is more
   complicated. China reported that its economy grew 5.2 percent last
   year, but Western economists predict that growth this year will slow.

   Here’s what to know →
   Allie Sullberg

   In China, car production and factory construction are surging, and
   hotels and restaurants are bustling. But many of those factories are
   running at low capacity, while travelers and diners are picking cheaper
   hotels and dishes when they go out.

   The country is also facing high debt, a housing crisis and “secular
   stagnation” — what happens when excess savings and depressed demand
   lead to very little or no economic growth.
   Qilai Shen for The New York Times

   The latest gross domestic product data also points to social issues
   that have become economic ones for China.

   The country’s work force is shrinking and aging, raising worries about
   whether there will be enough working-age people to power the economy.
   In an effort to change this, Beijing is pushing women to have babies,
   offering them incentives like tax benefits and cash, and urging women
   to be “good wives and mothers.”
   Qilai Shen for The New York Times

   More urgent for some economists, though, is the threat of an imminent
   housing crash and the question of how to bolster confidence in China’s
   economy enough that households stop holding on to their savings and
   start spending again.

   That’s “the defining macroeconomic challenge of China for the next
   decade,” said Lawrence H. Summers, the former secretary of the U.S.
   Treasury.
