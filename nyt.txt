   Biden Faces Pressure on Immigration, and Not Just From Republicans

On the Border in Eagle Pass, Texas

   Kenny Holston

   Reporting from the banks of the Rio Grande

   Earlier this week, I saw a family of migrants wade across the frigid
   Rio Grande from Mexico into Eagle Pass, Texas, just as Speaker Mike
   Johnson held a press conference on the riverbank.

   The family was part of a surge of migrants crossing the border
   illegally in recent months in what members of Congress call a crisis.

   Speaker Johnson and more than 60 House Republicans traveled to the
   border to make their case for tighter border restrictions in exchange
   for aid to Ukraine.

   The border area that had been packed with migrants just days before sat
   empty during their visit. Surges of border crossings can be
   unpredictable and illegal crossings dip near the holidays. The news
   conference itself may have been a deterrent.

   Law enforcement officers on airboats help people in the river, shouting
   instructions in Spanish. The roaring boats also deter migrants from
   crossing.

   After asylum seekers turn themselves in to officers at the border, they
   are taken to immigration processing centers. From there, they are often
   released to private shelters and then make their way to other parts of
   the country.

   I watched the family board a bus that would take them to a processing
   center. There seemed to be a sense of relief that they had made it to
   the U.S., but also a sense of tension.

What’s in Our Queue? ‘High and Low’ and More

   Ian Austen
   Ian AustenWriting from Ottawa

   I’m a New York Times correspondent based in Ottawa, where I cover
   Canada, a job that often involves travel. Here are five things I’ve
   been watching, reading and listening to →

   Film: ‘High and Low’

   “High and Low” is not one of the samurai films most people associate
   with Akira Kurosawa. It’s a kidnapping thriller that also explores the
   social divides in 1960s Japan. The visually stunning black-and-white
   film features a novel and surprising solution for handling a plot
   device based on color.

   IFRAME:
   [600]https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Pa-Bmz1J14?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Book: ‘His Majesty’s Airship’

   This book could have been a nostalgic tale of something that captured
   the author’s imagination, unfairly done in by sinister forces. But S.C.
   Gwynne uses the aircraft R101 to tell a story of how Britain’s
   desperation to cling to its empire led to delusion. Explosive hydrogen,
   his writing reveals, was just one of airships’ many fatal flaws.

   Podcast: ‘Nuremberg: The Trial of the Nazi War Criminals’

   Canada’s vast size means that I’m often flying or driving for hours on
   end on assignment. The BBC’s wide array of dramas based on historical
   events often helps fill that time. This series about the Nazi war
   crimes tribunal, as well as another BBC series on the nuclear disaster
   in Fukushima, tell big events through personalties.

   IFRAME: [601]about:blank

   Art: Weljesi

   Like many Indigenous artists and artists in Atlantic Canada, Jerry
   Evans, who is Mi’kmaw, is best known as a printmaker. But his style is
   distinct. I saw this survey, which incorporated augmented reality and
   digital “living” portraits, at the Rooms in St. John’s, Newfoundland.
   It is expected to travel through Atlantic Canada starting in 2025.

   Book: ‘Crook Manifesto’

   In 1970s New York, the streets are filled with trash, the police
   department filled with corruption, but Colson Whitehead’s depiction of
   the city’s nadir is filled with humor. Since people have asked: It
   wasn’t a problem that I hadn’t first read “Harlem Shuffle,” which
   includes many of the same characters during the ’60s. But I am doing so
   now.

   At Luna Luna, three young women take a photo at Jean-Michel Basquiat’s
   white Ferris wheel. The artist’s black glyphs adorning each gondola
   symbolize some aspect of chaos or Americana or slapstick, while his
   anatomical drawings covering the wheel’s buttresses poke fun at the
   bodily thrill of the whirl. At Luna Luna, three young women take a
