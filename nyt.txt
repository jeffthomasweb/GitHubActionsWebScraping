On View: A Modern, Tragic Portrait of the Sea

   Yaniya Lee
   Yaniya LeeReporting for T Magazine

   The artist Wardell Milan is exhibiting his latest multimedia works at
   Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco.

   Here’s what he told me about the show’s contradictory storylines →
   Lucas Michael

   Milan was inspired to make “The Cruel Mediterranean Sea,” which depicts
   a group of people flailing in shallow waves, after listening to
   public-radio broadcasts about the tragic land and sea crossings that
   many refugees and other migrants embark on.

   “Some of these stories slightly demonize these individuals,” Milan
   says. “People escaping their homeland in search of a sanctuary.”

   In the work, are the crying woman’s arms raised in celebration or
   despair? Is the man below her laid out in exhaustion or has he died?

   “I wanted the piece to be open-ended,” Milan says, but also
   intentionally opaque. “Unless you have this experience, you don’t know
   what these people are living through,” he says.

   Narten

   “The show functions like an accordion,” says Milan. Some works — such
   as “Divine Feminine,” a series of small charcoal and oil pastel
   portraits of people in his queer community — “contract,” he explains.

   Others, he says, “expand.” They’re physically larger and engage with
   broader conversations about global conflicts, migration and systemic
   oppression.

   The exhibition’s title, “Modern Utopia,” is a bit of a misnomer; in
   several of the works, the subjects are “enjoying modern [comforts] but,
   at the same time, they’re being confronted by all of the struggles and
   stresses of the time that we live in,” Milan says.

   In “Bombs in Applesauce,” for instance, a group of children in a field
   of flowers are menaced by dronelike flying objects, and in “Lovers.
   Outside the World Is on Fire,” a couple’s embrace is set against a
   backdrop of chaos and destruction.

   Milan strives to act as a witness to these contrasting facets of
   contemporary life, in the way of the critics and essayists he admires.

   “Joan Didion, Hilton Als, James Baldwin and Audre Lorde have written
   about how the world affects them at a personal level or in their small
   community, and then they expanded [their view] to criticize and
   celebrate the world in its totality,” he says.

   Recently, Milan has been changing the way he makes work. “I’ve been
   thinking about how to take out what’s not needed,” he says, “completely
   distilling until I get to the most important idea.”

   In “Modern Utopia,” that distillation is most evident in the artist’s
   paintings of tulips, which are more delicate than, yet just as
   fragmented as, many of the narrative-driven works in the show. “They
   represent me,” Milan says of the flowers. “They’re stand-ins for my
   inner feelings.”

   [621]On View highlights works by Black artists, who have traditionally
   faced a disproportionately uphill battle in having their work exhibited
   by mainstream institutions.

   Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the city
   where Fraenkel Gallery is located; it is San Francisco, not New York.
