The Big Number: 18%

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the Business News of the week

   Americans traveling for their turkey feasts may be pleasantly surprised
   by the cost of their airline tickets. Surveys this month found that
   domestic flight prices for holiday travel were down as much as 18
   percent from a year ago.

   Here’s what could be behind the change →
   Josie Norton

   Airlines typically lower their fares when they’re trying to attract
   more customers. But a record number of passengers — nearly 30 million —
   are expected to take domestic flights this Thanksgiving.

   Still, airlines say they have noticed demand slowing outside of peak
   travel periods, and the competition is stiff on certain routes. Some
   airports have been so flooded with flights that carriers have cut fares
   to fill their planes.
   Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock

   The lower ticket prices may also tell a story about the industry’s
   pandemic recovery. High demand in the aftermath of pandemic lockdowns
   drove up airfares, as did weather and other disruptions along with
   shortages of trained pilots, parts and planes.

   But now the supply of tickets appears to be catching up and, on some
   routes, even overtaking demand.
   Andrew Kelly/Reuters

   Inflation-weary travelers will also catch a break when they arrive at
   their dinner tables.

   Compared with last Thanksgiving, when annual inflation was around 7.7
   percent, food price increases have moderated, though the cost of meat,
   fruits and vegetables all increased slightly in October from the month
   before.
