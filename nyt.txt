The Big Number: 2.7%

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   American workers are getting more done. According to the Bureau of
   Labor Statistics, productivity increased 2.7 percent in 2023. Over the
   past two quarters, it has been growing at more than double the rate
   from 2005 to 2019.

   Here’s how it could affect the economy →
   George Wylesol

   Productivity is usually measured as a simple ratio: the total amount of
   output an economy produces per hour worked by its labor force. When
   that ratio picks up, it can create a positive cascading effect.

   Gains in productivity mean that businesses can make more money per
   hour, reinvest it in their operations and, at least theoretically, pay
   workers more.
   Ruth Fremson/The New York Times

   A more productive business can also sell its goods and services at
   lower prices, making customers happier, too.

   And some economists say that the rise in worker productivity has helped
   officials at the Federal Reserve pull off what appears to be a “soft
   landing,” slowing down the economy with high interest rates without
   tipping it into a recession.
   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   Is all of this too good to be true? Maybe.

   Many economic models suggest that workers’ pay should rise roughly in
   proportion to their productivity — twice the pay for double the daily
   or hourly production — but jumps in productivity haven’t always
   resulted in big gains for workers. In some cases, shareholders and
   executives have seen the biggest financial benefits. And technology
   that increases productivity may complicate matters more.
   John Taggart for The New York Times
