What’s in Our Queue? ‘Ripley’ and More

   Alissa Wilkinson
   Alissa WilkinsonWriting from New York City

   I’m a movie critic at The New York Times, reviewing new releases and
   writing about broader film trends. I’m also culturally omnivorous: I
   love any art that expands my brain and grabs my imagination.

   Here are five things I’ve recently enjoyed watching, reading and
   listening to →
   Netflix, via Associated Press

   TV: ‘Ripley’

   Few things are juicier and more wicked than a new Patricia Highsmith
   adaptation, and thanks to an assignment to write about all the ways Tom
   Ripley has been portrayed onscreen, I got to watch the new Netflix
   series starring Andrew Scott ahead of its release. It’s arch and wry
   and gorgeous and a smart take on the character.

   Podcast: ‘Wiser Than Me’

   Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s podcast just came back for its second season, and
   I find it so nourishing and delightful (and cheeky, too). She
   interviews well-known women, all over 70 or so, about their lives. At
   the end of each episode, she calls her mother, the poet Judith Bowles,
   to debrief. It’s great.

   IFRAME: [606]about:blank

   Album: ‘Playing the Piano 12122020’

   In the midst of researching for a review of the wonderful documentary
   “Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus,” I listened to a solo piano concert that
   Sakamoto performed in December 2011, and now I’m listening to it every
   day. Calming, intricate, gentle — just beautiful.

   IFRAME: [607]about:blank

   Art: ‘Once Again … (Statues Never Die)’

   The piece in the Whitney Biennial that won’t leave me is this video
   installation by Isaac Julien. André Holland, as the Harlem Renaissance
   critic Alain Locke, and Danny Huston, as the philanthropist Albert
   Barnes, discuss African art, the ethics of collection and a whole lot
   more.

   [608]See more about the exhibit here.

   Book: ‘Splinters’

   I inhaled this memoir in two sittings. Leslie Jamison chronicles her
   life as a newly divorced single mother at the start of the pandemic —
   all of which sounds like a bummer. But it’s suffused with humor and
   longing and self-awareness in a way that’s rare and, I think,
   important.
