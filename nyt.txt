   Winchester, Ind.
   March 15, 2024

   I arrived in Winchester on Friday around noon, after at least three
   people were killed and dozens were injured by tornadoes in Indiana,
   Kentucky and Ohio overnight.

   Neighbors and volunteers came together to help people clean up debris
   and move their belongings. Some brought chain saws to help access the
   homes.

   The town of Winchester in Randolph County was badly hit by at least one
   of the tornadoes, which razed buildings and tore roofs off homes.

   In the nearby small town of Selma, Ind., half of all the structures
   were damaged, the Delaware County emergency management agency said.

   But even as neighbors helped one another out, the scale of destruction
   was hard to fathom.

The Big Number: $40 Billion

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   Investors have begun to swipe left on dating apps. Struggling to appeal
   to younger users and grow their subscription sales, Match Group and
   Bumble have lost more than $40 billion in market value since 2021.

   Here’s what’s behind the downturn →
   George Wylesol

   Millennials, previously blamed for killing department stores and casual
   dining chains like Applebee’s, may be partly responsible for the apps’
   slow decline.

   They were prime dating age when apps like Tinder arrived on the scene,
   but many of them have since gotten married and left the platforms.
   Drew Anthony Smith for The New York Times

   Now Gen Z-ers — one of whom recently told The New York Times that the
   idea of paying for a dating app subscription gives her the “ick” — make
   up the apps’ primary user base.

   But people in this age group say that they have more luck finding love
   elsewhere, like on TikTok or Snapchat, or that they aren’t looking for
   romantic connections at all.
   Georgia Canning for The New York Times

   As Match Group and Bumble have tried to stay relevant, both companies
   have changed their leadership and announced moves to revamp the
   platforms in an effort to capture the younger demographic. Bumble’s new
   chief executive, Lidiane Jones, said last month that the company would
   be adding “personalization and flexibility” to the app experience.
   Akhtar Soomro/Reuters

   But experts say investors are most eager to see the dating app
   companies convince young users to pay for the platforms.

   “Wall Street loves subscription models because it gives them the
   comfort of recurring revenues,” said Youssef Squali, an analyst at
   Truist Securities.
