Congress Passes Stopgap Measure to Avert a Shutdown

   [62]

Biden Signs Bill After Senate Backs Last-Ditch Plan

     * In a stunning turnabout, lawmakers approved a plan to keep the
       government running through mid-November.
     * Speaker Kevin McCarthy had pushed through the stopgap bill with
       Democratic votes. The Senate passed it hours later, and President
       Biden signed it shortly before the midnight deadline.
