The Big Number: $1,280

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   In the popular imagination, owning a car symbolizes freedom. The
   freedom to hit the road, roll down the windows, blast the radio — and
   pay a hefty sum for car insurance. In 2023, the average 12-month
   premium was $1,280.

   Here’s how it got so high →
   Dominic Kesterton

   That $1,280 is up from $1,072 in 2019, before the pandemic, according
   to the Insurance Information Institute.

   And the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the price of car
   insurance rose more than 22 percent over the year through April, the
   fastest since the 1970s.
   David Zalubowski/Associated Press

   One reason for the soaring prices is a matter of simple cause and
   effect: Cars are more expensive these days, so the cost of insuring
   them is higher, too.

   From there, it gets a bit more complicated. When insurers want to raise
   their costs, they first must appeal to state regulators and make a good
   case, usually relying on data from the past couple of years and
   projections for replacement costs and profits.

   But during the pandemic, when driving patterns were disrupted, insurers
   could no longer use the past to predict the future, and rates froze for
   months.

   When insurance companies finally did submit new filings to regulators
   to raise premiums, it was in the second half of 2021, as drivers were
   emerging from Covid lockdowns and getting into more car accidents. At
   the same time, state regulators were wading through a vast backlog of
   insurer filings, leaving insurers to temporarily absorb the higher
   costs.
   Micah Green for The New York Times

   Insurance premiums will probably keep rising. The backlog has begun to
   diminish, but insurers are still looking to increase prices to make up
   for those lost years.

   That could be bad news for interest rates, too: The spike in insurance
   premiums is a contributor to inflation, and until inflation comes down
   further, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates high.
   Pete Marovich for The New York Times
