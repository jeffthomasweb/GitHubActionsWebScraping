Stripping Away the Symbols of the Assad Regime

   Matthew Cassel Alessandro Pavone

   Matthew Cassel and Alessandro Pavone

   Damascus, Syria
   Dec. 12, 2024
   (BUTTON)

   Across Damascus, we saw the remnants of Bashar al-Assad’s rule being
   destroyed, as Syrians and rebel fighters tore down and stepped over
   posters.

   People celebrated around this bust of the ousted president’s father,
   Hafez al-Assad, near the headquarters of the family's Ba'ath party,
   which ruled Syria since 1971.

   We also saw the new rulers making their mark. Rebel fighters from Hayat
   Tahrir al-Sham, the main force that toppled Assad, now stand guard
   around the capital.

   People took pictures atop Syrian military tanks that have been
   destroyed or abandoned, and now litter the streets.

   As signs of the old regime came down, new symbols have come up around
   the Syrian capital. The flag of the former opposition against Assad,
   featuring three stars instead of two.

   We saw Syrians young and old out on the streets, waving the new flag in
   Umayyad Square, which has become the center of celebrations.

   Still, there are some fractions of the old guard visible, like this
   tattered flag.
