What’s in Our Queue? Kacey Musgraves and More

   Aurelien Breeden
   Aurelien BreedenWriting from Paris

   I’ve been a reporter at the Paris bureau of The New York Times for
   nearly a decade, covering French society, politics and more. Much of my
   cultural intake is dictated by what I can squeeze in between work and
   caring for two (soon to be three) adorable young daughters.

   Here are five things that I’ve been enjoying recently →
   Charles Sykes/Invision, via Associated Press

   Album: ‘Deeper Well’

   “Do we have any say in this mess?” Kacey Musgraves asks on “The
   Architect,” one of the songs from her new album. I ponder those words
   as my 3-year-old draws on her hands, glues erasers to a chair and slaps
   dozens of multicolored stickers onto the floor.

   Video Game: ‘Caesar III’

   My Roman Empire. One of Sierra’s classic city builders, with isometric
   and slightly pixelated graphics that are firmly rooted in 1998, when
   the game was released. But being the provincial governor of Lugdunum,
   Lutetia or Carthage is as addictive as ever as you fend off military
   invasions, carefully manage your industry and cater to Caesar’s whims.

   Book: ‘Moi et François Mitterrand (François Mitterrand and I)’

   Hervé Le Tellier released this delightfully absurd epistolary novel in
   French in 2016. A man writes repeatedly to France’s president, receives
   the same pro forma reply each time, but interprets each letter as a
   personally crafted response — sending him into a hilarious spiral of
   delusion over a nonexistent friendship.

   TV: ‘Class Act’

   This seven-episode Netflix biopic chronicles the rise and fall of
   Bernard Tapie, the swaggering businessman, singer, sports impresario
   and government minister who “lurched throughout his life from wild
   success to humiliation, knowing everything from high political office
   to the prison cell,” as my colleague Roger Cohen wrote in a 2021
   obituary.

   Video: ‘Critical Role’

   Tabletop role-playing shows are increasingly popular, but few are as
   successful as this one, in which veteran voice actors play Dungeons &
   Dragons. It’s hard to explain a yearslong obsession over people rolling
   dice for four hours. But the emotions are real — just ask the crowds
   that filled London’s Wembley Arena to see a live show.

   [615]See more about ‘Critical Role’ here.
