5 Things to Do This Weekend

   Danielle Dowling
   Danielle DowlingReporting on the arts

   Before Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, there was
   Leatherface, who debuted some 50 years ago in the seminal slasher flick
   “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.”

   Here’s more on that film’s anniversary and other entertainment
   highlights this weekend →
   Bryanston Distributing Company

   “It felt like it had been made by serial killers,” the director Eli
   Roth says of “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.” A recent restoration
   screens at the Museum of Modern Art through Wednesday and at select
   theaters nationwide throughout the month. The movie is also available
   to stream on several major platforms.

   Kids

   Grown-ups often lose sight of what it’s like to be a child. “So we’re
   constantly trying to recapture that, and reframe our adult minds to
   really get into that preschool experience,” says Scott Schultz, a
   creator of the show “Yo Gabba Gabba!” and its reboot “Yo Gabba
   GabbaLand!” It premieres on Apple TV+ today.

   Many of the jokes don’t land in “Borderlands,” a “cluttered caper
   flick” based on a video game franchise, but its star, Cate Blanchett,
   “endures the nonsense by carrying herself like a warrior on a kitschy
   propaganda poster,” our critic writes. The film arrives in theaters
   today.

   Art & Museums

   “Growing Sideways: Performing Childhood,” featuring works by artists
   who have been inspired by or collaborated with children, “is by turns
   heartwarming and unsettling, examining how young and old understand,
   learn from and control one another,” our critic writes. It is at the
   Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University.

   Comedy

   Tony Hinchcliffe’s “Kill Tony,” which exposes new comedic talent
   through a sort of “open mic roast in the spirit of ‘The Gong Show,’”
   has had some breakthroughs this year, our critic writes. They include
   two shows at Madison Square Garden that are among our picks for
   entertainment in New York this weekend.
