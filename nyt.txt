Tens of Thousands Flee Lebanon to Syria

   Matthew Cassel

   Matthew Cassel

   Reporting from Lebanon
   Oct. 10, 2024
   (BUTTON)

   I traveled to the Masnaa border crossing and saw people fleeing to
   Syria as Israel intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon as part of its
   war against Hezbollah.

   Most of the people I met at the border were Syrian refugees themselves,
   who had been living in Lebanon after fleeing the civil war in Syria.

   The United Nations said that more than 250,000 people have already fled
   to Syria in the past two weeks.

   People fleeing had difficulty traversing a crater in the road that was
   created by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli Army claimed the crossing
   was being used to move weapons from Syria to Hezbollah.

   I also spoke with some Lebanese who told me that they were hoping to
   find safety in Syria, even if only temporarily.

What’s in Our Queue? Brandy Clark and More

   Emily Cochrane
   Emily CochraneWriting from Nashville

   I’m a national correspondent covering the American South. I spend a lot
   of time driving around the region, so I keep a running soundtrack of
   musical theater and upbeat songs. When I’m at home, I’m looking for
   ways to escape the pace of the news cycle.

   Here are five things I’ve been listening to, reading and watching →

   Music: Brandy Clark

   My first concert at the Ryman Auditorium — the “mother church of
   country music,” as they say — featured Brandy Clark. It was the first
   time it clicked for me that she was responsible for so much of the
   songwriting I enjoyed (most notably, some of Kacey Musgraves’s hits),
   and I’ve enjoyed listening to the songs she performs on her own.

   IFRAME: [634]about:blank

   Theater: ‘Operation Mincemeat’

   The (true!) story of a British intelligence operation where fake
   invasion plans were planted on a corpse disguised as a World War II
   pilot is wild enough — but then five West End actors decided to put on
   a musical. It’s one of my favorites: from the rousing “Useful” duet to
   the catchy “Making a Man” to its aptly named “A Glitzy Finale.”

   IFRAME:
   [635]https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJRhdPsVqsA?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Song: ‘My Days’

   Confession: I’ve never seen “The Notebook,” the 2004 romance, in its
   entirety. But I have had one song from the musical adaptation on
   repeat: “My Days,” performed by Joy Woods. The song, which builds to a
   powerful crescendo by the time she resolves to follow her heart and
   joy, resonates with me.

   IFRAME: [636]about:blank

   Social Media: Crochet Videos

   In an effort to stare less at screens, I’m trying to learn how to
   crochet. And while I’ve got a crafty friend on speed dial, I’ve found
   myself pulling up how-to videos on YouTube, where I can watch adorable
   round animals and blanket squares being stitched. (The screen time
   doesn’t count if it’s educational, right?)

   IFRAME:
   [637]https://www.youtube.com/embed/htXf4iLP9Xs?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Book: ‘The Outsiders’

   I read this S.E. Hinton book in middle school and, to be honest, it
   didn’t stick with me. But after getting hooked on the Broadway
   adaptation (are you sensing a trend?), I revisited it. I like
   contrasting the two different ways of telling the same story — the
   theatrical and the written — and I have a different appreciation for it
   now.

   [638]Here are some more favorites:
