At the Scene: Baltimore Key Bridge Cleanup

   Brent McDonald

   Brent McDonald

   April 4, 2024

   I rode with the U.S. Coast Guard to take a closer look at the efforts
   to remove the collapsed bridge. Our 45-foot boat was dwarfed by the
   enormous 985-foot Dali.

   A 200-ton section of the bridge was removed and loaded onto a barge.
   Workers then cut up a second portion light enough for these cranes to
   move.

   I saw three teams of divers working to map out the wreckage, clear the
   main channel and assess the Dali, still pinned down by the fallen
   bridge.

   Visibility underwater is extremely low, so divers are guided through
   the steel and concrete with sonar from above.

   The 21 crew members are still aboard, assisting investigators and
   tending to their normal ship duties.

   The Army Corps of Engineers plans to reopen the main channel by the end
   of May. The bodies of four construction workers have not yet been
   recovered.
