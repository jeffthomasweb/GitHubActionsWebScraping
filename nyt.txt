    4. [92]Indoors, dry ice is used in processing. The ice prevents
       bacterial growth and eats up oxygen that can ruin the flavor of the
       wine.

    5. [93]Scientists have found that expanding the variety of plants and
       animals on a vineyard like Chêne Bleu can reduce the impact of
       climate change.
