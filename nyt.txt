   ‘I Didn’t Make a Mistake’: Trump Declines to Apologize for Racist Video
   of Obamas

   Trump removed the video, which portrayed the former president and first
   lady as apes, from his Truth Social account after receiving criticism
   from members of his own party. It was an unusual walk-back by the
   president.
   [27]Isabella Kwai

   Isabella Kwai

   Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate’s only Black
   Republican, wrote on X that he hoped the post was fake “because it’s
   the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President
   should remove it.”

   Erica L. Green

   In response to questions about the clip, which Trump posted Thursday
   during a late-night spree on social media, Karoline Leavitt, the White
   House press secretary, said on Friday morning that criticism of the
   video was “fake outrage.”

   Erica L. Green

   “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the
   King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,”
   Leavitt said. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something
   today that actually matters to the American public.”

   “The President’s post is wrong and incredibly offensive,”
   Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, wrote in a social
   media post. Lawler, who represents the Hudson Valley, said the video
   “should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.”
   [31]Isabella Kwai

   Isabella Kwai

   The press office of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California condemned Trump’s
   post, saying it represented “disgusting behavior by the President.”
   Newsom added: “Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”
