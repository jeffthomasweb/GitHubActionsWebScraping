It’s a Great Deal, Before the ‘Drip Pricing’

   Santul Nerkar
   Santul NerkarReporting on pricing jargon

   It can happen with airline tickets, car rentals and taco dinners: The
   great deal you thought you clinched turns out not to be so great
   because of hidden fees. The practice is known as “drip pricing,” and
   regulators are trying to stamp it out.

   Here’s what to know →
   Cristina Spanò

   The term drip pricing has been around since at least 2009, when the
   British publication New Age Media used it to talk about an inquiry into
   online advertising. It became more widespread in 2012, when the Federal
   Trade Commission began raising alarms about it.

   The practice itself, which is especially widespread in e-commerce, has
   been going on for decades — probably because it works.

   A 2021 paper, for example, found that when StubHub, a secondary-ticket
   marketplace, used the technique on consumers, ticket revenue was about
   20 percent more than when the total cost, with fees, was disclosed
   upfront.

   A big reason drip pricing works, research has shown, is that our brains
   tend to fix on the price we first encountered even after we learn the
   total cost.

   And even when consumers learn about the hidden fees, they often pay up
   rather than shop around, said David Friedman, a law professor at
   Willamette University, because they figure that “investing more time
   into searching for it will not be worthwhile.”

   Regulators in the United States and abroad have been trying to rein in
   the practice with renewed urgency. In Britain last year, Prime Minister
   Rishi Sunak drafted legislation that would bar airlines from engaging
   in drip pricing. Canada amended its Competition Act in 2022 to stiffen
   financial penalties for it.

   That same year, the White House said it was cracking down on drip
   pricing. And last year, the Federal Trade Commission proposed a ban,
   citing the practice’s potential to “cost consumers tens of billions of
   dollars per year in unexpected costs.”

   “By hiding the total price, these junk fees make it harder for
   consumers to shop for the best product or service and punish businesses
   who are honest upfront,” Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, said in a
   statement at the time.
