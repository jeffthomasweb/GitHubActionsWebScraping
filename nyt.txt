What’s in Our Queue? ‘My Fair Lady’ and More

   David Yaffe-Bellany
   David Yaffe-BellanyWriting from San Francisco

   I’m a reporter covering the cryptocurrency industry from San Francisco.
   I love art that challenges me, but I also spend a lot of time watching
   mediocre rom-coms.

   Here are five things I’ve enjoyed recently →

   Movie: ‘My Fair Lady’

   Some friends and I recently spent a rainy afternoon at our local AMC,
   watching a big-screen revival of the musical “My Fair Lady.” We had a
   great time: The movie looks spectacular, and the dialogue is peppered
   with some classic insults. I’ve become particularly fond of the term
   “bilious pigeon.”

   Book: ‘Mrs. Dalloway’

   I read Virginia Woolf’s novel for the first time this summer and was
   completely awe-struck. There’s really nothing quite like it: a book
   that takes place over a single day and yet somehow captures the full
   sweep of human experience.

   Theater: ‘Appropriate’

   From the West Coast, it’s hard to keep up with the New York theater
   scene. But on a recent trip I got to see this funny and incisive play
   about race and family, starring Sarah Paulson and Corey Stoll.

   Song: ‘Three Lions’

   Unfortunately for my mental health, I follow the underachieving English
   national soccer team. (I have my British father to thank for
   introducing me to that world of pain.) Before England’s games this
   summer, I pumped myself up with the team’s de facto anthem, “Three
   Lions,” a song that perfectly captures the hope and suffering I
   associate with England fandom.

   Movie: ‘Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels’

   I love movie gangsters, especially when they speak in a kind of
   foul-mouthed poetry. I saw this violent and hilarious film at the
   Metrograph during my last trip to New York. Go watch it — you will
   learn some colorful new vocabulary.
