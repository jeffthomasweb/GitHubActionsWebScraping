   It’s Been the Year of Travis Kelce

   Since winning a Super Bowl in 2023, Kelce hosted “Saturday Night Live,”

The Big Number: $8,776

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the business news of the week

   There has been much ado about if, and how, Taylor Swift will make it to
   the Super Bowl. But average fans will need deep pockets if they want to
   attend. The median price of a ticket at one point last week was $8,776.

   Here are the other costs to consider →
   George Wylesol

   After travel, lodging and the steep price of the ticket itself,
   football fans can expect to pay close to $10,000 per person to see the
   Kansas City Chiefs take on the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas.

   A fan based in Houston, for example, would have to pay for airfare that
   has surged 112 percent compared with the same weekend last year. Hotel
   prices have increased 140 percent, according to the booking site
   Trivago.
   Doug Mills/The New York Times

   These eye-watering numbers make for one of the costliest Super Bowl
   Sundays to date. That may be because of the potent mix of a much-hyped
   matchup, the influence of Swift, who’s dating the Kansas City tight end
   Travis Kelce, and an otherwise stacked entertainment schedule
   throughout the weekend in Las Vegas.

   The city typically draws some 300,000 visitors during any Super Bowl
   weekend — regardless of where the game is being played.
   Julio Cortez/Associated Press

   Maybe that all sounds overwhelming and prohibitively expensive.

   Luckily, there’s always the timeless option: watching from your couch.
