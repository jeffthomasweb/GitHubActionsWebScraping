   Inspectors Say More Than 100 Chemical Weapons Sites Likely Remain in
   Syria

   [559]Megha Rajagopalan

   Megha Rajagopalan

   I went to Syria to try to figure out what happened to the country’s
   notorious chemical weapons program when the president, Bashar al-Assad,
   fled last year →
   [560]Megha Rajagopalan

   Megha Rajagopalan

   Al-Assad long ago disclosed keeping chemical weapons at a few dozen
   sites, but claimed to have shut them down. Everyone knew that was a
   lie.
   [561]Megha Rajagopalan

   Megha Rajagopalan

   I interviewed scientists and former weapons inspectors and government
   officials. Ultimately, I learned that the number of sites is likely far
   bigger than previously disclosed.
   [562]Megha Rajagopalan

   Megha Rajagopalan

   The international chemical weapons watchdog now believes that there
   could be over 100 sites left, far more than the Al-Assad government
   revealed.
   [563]Megha Rajagopalan

   Megha Rajagopalan

   What worries experts is that nobody knows how many of Syria’s sites are
   secure, or in what condition the weapons are held.
