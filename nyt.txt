The Big Number: 30 Million

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the Business news of the week

   Student loan relief isn’t dead. In the coming days, more than 30
   million borrowers will be invited to enroll in a new Biden
   administration program that rolled out this week.

   Here’s how it works →
   Dominic Kesterton

   The program, called SAVE, is something of a Plan B for President Biden,
   whose efforts to cancel up to $20,000 per borrower were thwarted by the
   Supreme Court in June, when justices ruled that he had overstepped his
   authority.

   While perhaps less flashy than Biden’s earlier effort, SAVE will reduce
   payments for millions of borrowers, eventually by as much as half.
   Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press

   For those who enroll, the new payments will be determined by income and
   family size, and will be readjusted each year. To start, all borrowers
   would see their payments fall to 5 percent of their discretionary
   income — or the money that’s left after paying for basics like rent and
   food — for undergraduate loans.

   A single person making less than $32,805 a year qualifies for $0
   payments, as does a person in a household of four who makes below
   $67,500.
   Evan Vucci/Associated Press

   After monthly payments are made for a set number of years — usually
   it’s 20 — any remaining balance is wiped out.

   Borrowers will want to act quickly: Applications can take about four
   weeks for the Education Department to process, and after more than
   three years of being on pause, student loan payments are scheduled to
   resume in October.
   Alex Brandon/Associated Press
