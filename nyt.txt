   [586]How a Software Update Crashed Computers
    1. [587]Widespread outages are often caused by errors in a centralized
       source, like a server farm, or damage to cables or other physical
       equipment.
    2. This outage was unique: It started with a software update sent to
       PCs from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm used by many big
       companies.
    3. [588]The update caused computers to constantly reboot, taking them
       offline. That made it harder for the company to push a fix from
       afar.
    4. [589]As a result, most computers will have to be fixed one-by-one
       by a person removing the faulty code.
