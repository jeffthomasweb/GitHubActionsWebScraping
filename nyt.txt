5 Things This Bulgari Designer Wishes She’d Made

   Nicole Acheampong
   Nicole AcheampongReporting for T Magazine

   Earlier this month, the Greek fashion designer Mary Katrantzou released
   her first collection as the creative director of leather goods and
   accessories for the Italian luxury brand Bulgari.

   We spoke about the architectural, sculptural and colorful designs
   Katrantzou would’ve liked to have created herself →
   Jamie Stoker

   Trône de Pauline (1990) by Claude Lalanne

   “I’m a fan of Lalanne’s Surrealist approach to furniture, the way a
   functional piece of hers can also be a work of art. And I love the
   ginkgo leaf. Especially in many Asian cultures, it’s a symbol of
   resilience and strength.”

   “Sleeping Muse” (1910) by Constantin Brancusi

   “My work is very layered and intricate. A Brancusi is devoid of any
   intricacy — it’s just form and abstraction. There’s so much strength in
   that. I probably saw ‘Sleeping Muse’ for the first time over 20 years
   ago, and it’s been on my mind a lot.”

   The Original Rainbow Flag (1978) by Gilbert Baker

   “If I could’ve created anything, it’d have been the rainbow itself.
   I’ve always seen color as a wellness tool. It has the power to express
   how people feel — or how they want to feel. The rainbow flag does that
   for a whole community.”

   “The Birds of America” (1827-38) by John James Audubon

   “Audubon documented every known bird species in North America. More
   than anything, I respect his commitment to a project that spanned more
   than 10 years. In fashion, you can never dedicate [that amount of] time
   to one thing.”
   Courtesy of the John James Audubon Center at Mill Grove, Montgomery
   County Audubon Collection and Zebra Publishing

   Bodice (Fall 1980) by Issey Miyake

   “Miyake turned the corset on its head. Instead of using it to restrict
   the body, he used it to highlight the body without restriction. This
   was [made in collaboration] with a manufacturer of mannequins,
   elevating corsetry to a sculptural form. Before I came into fashion, my
   training was in architecture. I still use that training; now it’s just
   in the proportions of a woman’s body.”
