Big Ticket: N.Y.’s Top Sales and Listings in February

   Vivian Marino
   Vivian MarinoReporting on real estate

   In time for summer, Rick and Kathy Hilton have listed their sprawling
   Hamptons home for $14.99 million. The house is in a gated community in
   Southampton, N.Y.

   Here’s more on big ticket real estate →
   Zack Milligan/Hamptons Visuals

   The renovated, 10,500-square-foot house sits near a beach and has six
   bedrooms and seven and a half baths. Plus, there are three wood-burning
   fireplaces, a library, den and private guest quarters. The backyard has
   a pool and hot tub. The property had been a vacation home for the
   Hiltons, who live in Los Angeles, and their family, including their
   daughter Paris, since they bought it in 1999 for $2.385 million.

   Quick Sale for Annie Leibovitz

   The photographer didn’t have to wait long for her duplex at 88 Central
   Park West to sell. It was listed last October and closed in February at
   $10.6 million, about $2 million above the asking price. Leibovitz still
   suffered a loss, having paid nearly $11.3 million nine years ago. The
   buyers were Gregg E. Zehr, who is credited with inventing Amazon’s
   Kindle e-book reader, and Kim M. Cooper, a general counsel for Apple.

   Under Contract in Hell’s Kitchen

   Days after being listed, the apartment where the celebrity hairdresser
   John Barrett lived until his death last August has gone into contract.
   The two-bedroom, two-bath home is at the Parc Vendome, at 333 West 56th
   Street. It was listed in early February for just under $2 million.
   Barrett’s clients have included Princess Diana, Martha Stewart and
   Hillary Clinton.
   Brown Harris Stevens

   New York City’s Priciest

   The biggest closing in February was a full-floor apartment at Aman New
   York, a luxury condo at 730 Fifth Avenue in Midtown. It sold for $61.6
   million, a discount from the $73.7 million list price. The buyer was
   Terence Chan, who runs the Hong Kong private equity firm Bay Area
   Capital Partners. The unit has about 6,300 square feet of space, and
   four bedrooms, five and a half baths and a home theater.
   Katherine Marks for The New York Times
