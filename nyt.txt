U.A.W. Goes on Strike Against Detroit’s Big Three

   [82]

First Walkout to Hit All Companies at Once

     * The United Automobile Workers union said its members were walking
       off the production lines in three plants Friday.
     * The strike is meant to press Ford, General Motors and Stellantis in
       talks on pay, benefits and the workweek, and could force the
       automakers to halt production at other locations.

On View: A Coffin That Connects Multiple Black Histories

   Shirley Ngozi Nwangwa
   Shirley Ngozi NwangwaReporting for T Magazine

   Awol Erizku’s exhibition of hip-hop-centric art opened recently at Sean
   Kelly gallery in New York. Here’s what he told me about one of the
   featured works →
   Photo by Hedi Slimane. Courtesy of Sean Kelly

   “Codeine Crazy (ft Paa Joe)” (2023) was produced by the Ghanaian
   craftsman Paa Joe, who specializes in fantasy coffins — elaborate
   caskets made in the Greater Accra Region. “You can bury somebody in
   this. It’s seven feet tall,” says Erizku. “It’s not made to be a prop
   coffin.”

   IFRAME:
   [123]https://www.youtube.com/embed/8lsDuWzIvQw?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   The work is titled after the 2014 song “Codeine Crazy,” by the rapper
   Future. “When I first moved to L.A. about 10 years ago, I want to say
   it was the peak of lean culture,” says Erizku, referring to the
   widespread usage of — and rap references to — the codeine-cough-syrup
   mixture. Hearing about consecutive deaths from overdoses on the
   substance, he explains, “would weigh on my consciousness. The fact that
   this thing has led to death, and how to address that, has been a
   concern for me.”

   “The label is magnified so that you can see what’s in this bottle,” the
   artist says. He hopes this will make viewers consider, “‘What else am I
   putting in my body that I’m not paying attention to?’”
   Photo: Adam Reich. Courtesy of Sean Kelly, New York/Los Angeles

   “In 2023, hip-hop is presented as an umbrella term that’s getting
   watered down and too commercialized,” Erizku says. “I’m after the
   things that are actually still about, and from, the streets.”

   He’s also melding references from across the African diaspora, to
   capture what “makes us unique,” he says. “I want to connect on things
   that people despise us for so that we can make that our universal
   language.”
   Photo: Adam Reich. Courtesy of Sean Kelly, New York/Los Angeles

   “I had a long-distance affinity with Paa Joe,” Erizku says, mentioning
   the chicken sculpture that the craftsman produced for the artist David
   Hammons in 2019. “I told him that this should be a collaboration. I’m
   not trying to fool anybody into thinking that I made a coffin out of
   nowhere.” Erizku discussed each detail — from the original concept to
   the size to the colors of the interior material — with Paa Joe’s team
   in Ghana over Zoom. “I like this community aspect of making something,”
   he says.

   Fredrik Nilsen Studio

   “Spirit is very important. I don’t want to make lifeless art,” says the
   artist. “That’s partly why I like this idea of a coffin coming from
   Africa — so many spirits have already touched it before I even got
   here. At the end of the day, my journey doesn’t have to be yours, but
   maybe you could take something out of it, right?”
