Israel and Hamas Are Set to Begin Pause in Fighting, Paving Way for a Swap

   Prodded by the U.S., Israel agreed to a four-day cease-fire and the
   release of 150 imprisoned Palestinians in exchange for 50 hostages held

Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade Draws Spectators and Protests

Kung Fu Panda and Snoopy, Flying High

   Amir Hamja

   Amir Hamja

   Reporting from New York City

   I had a streetside view at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

   Thousands of people packed the streets, rooftops and occasional
   balconies of Manhattan to watch.

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   It was my first time photographing the event. (It was Beagle Scout
   Snoopy’s first parade, too.)

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   Kung Fu Panda, another first-timer, was my favorite. But some classics,
   like Smokey the Bear, were crowd-pleasers as well.

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   In person, the balloons are gigantic. Taller than the trees and even
   some buildings.

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   The experience on the street is nothing like what you see on TV. The
   crowds and the performers are impressive.

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   And, of course, children are everywhere! Atop their dads’ shoulders.
   Cheering and screaming. Throwing confetti.

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   Even at ground level, the parade is a feast for the eyes, with winter
   hats in every shape and color, marching bands in crisp uniforms and
   clowns throwing confetti.

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   I dashed into the street to make sure I caught all of the balloons,
   like Greg from “Diary of a Wimpy Kid.”

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   One by one, they passed. I would run in, snap, run out again, repeat.
   When you’re working, the time goes by quickly.

   Amir Hamja/The New York Times

   And then, in a flash, another parade has gone by.
