   Justices to Decide Whether Trump Is Eligible for Colorado Ballot

   The Colorado Supreme Court ruled last month that Donald Trump could not
   appear on the state’s Republican primary ballot, saying he had engaged
   in insurrection.

   See which states have active lawsuits to bar former President Trump
   from the 2024 primary ballot.

Trump at the Supreme Court

   Adam Liptak
   Adam LiptakReporting from Washington

   The country’s top court will have at least three opportunities to weigh
   in on former President Donald J. Trump’s legal troubles.

   Here is an overview of the cases →
   Kent Nishimura for The New York Times

   Trump v. Anderson

   The Issue: Is Trump ineligible to be president under Section 3 of the
   14th Amendment?
   Meridith Kohut for The New York Times

   The Law: Section 3 bars officials who took an oath to support the
   Constitution from holding office if they then engage in insurrection.

   Where Things Stand: The Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the Jan. 6
   attack on the Capitol was an insurrection, that Trump engaged in it and
   that Section 3 applies to the presidency.  That means, the court said,
   that he cannot be on the state’s Republican primary ballot. But the
   ruling is on hold. The U.S. Supreme Court said it would hear Trump’s
   appeal in February.
   Erin Schaff/The New York Times

   United States v. Trump

   The Issue: Is a former president absolutely immune from prosecution for
   crimes committed while in office?
   Max Whittaker for The New York Times

   The Law: The Supreme Court has ruled that former presidents are immune
   from civil suits seeking money for official actions within the “outer
   perimeter” of their responsibilities, and the Justice Department has
   said that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.  But it’s an open
   question whether a former president is completely shielded from
   criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office.

   Where Things Stand: Judge Tanya S. Chutkan rejected Trump’s claim of
   absolute immunity from prosecution in a case charging him with plotting
   to overturn the 2020 election. The Supreme Court declined a request
   from Jack Smith, the special counsel, to hear an immediate appeal of
   that ruling.  A federal appeals court will hear arguments on Jan. 9,
   and the case will return to the Supreme Court if the losing side
   appeals, which is all but certain.

   Fischer v. United States

   The Issue: Can prosecutors charge defendants in cases arising from the
   Jan. 6 attack under a federal law that makes it a crime to corruptly
   obstruct an official proceeding?
   Erin Schaff/The New York Times

   The Law: A provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a law aimed
   primarily at white-collar crime, figures in two of the charges against
   Trump in the election-interference case. It applies to anyone who
   corruptly destroys evidence or “otherwise obstructs, influences or
   impedes any official proceeding.”

   Where Things Stand: A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against Joseph
   Fischer, saying that the law is not limited to destroying evidence and
   “applies to all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official
   proceeding.” The Supreme Court has agreed to hear his appeal and is
   expected to decide on it by June. A decision in Fischer’s favor could
   undermine part of the case against Trump.

   Just as he did in his speech earlier tonight, Trump has spent more time
   sharply attacking Nikki Haley. While his attacks last year were often
   broad — calling her “birdbrain,” for instance, and accusing her of
   disloyalty — tonight he has specifically criticized her positions.

The Big Number: 0%

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the Business news of the week

   From low alcohol to no-alcohol, Dry January is in full swing, and never
   have there been more choices for those who want to begin the year by
   abstaining from spirits.

   Here’s how the beverage industry is evolving →
   Allie Sullberg

   Craving a spritz? There’s a nonalcoholic aperitif for that. Missing
   your “Sunday Night Football” pint? Even stalwart brewers like Heineken
   offer 0 percent beers. Looking to shake, or stir, an elaborate
   mocktail? Nonalcoholic gin, tequila and whiskey are probably available
   at your local grocery — or even liquor — store.
   Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times

   The ever-widening array of no-spirit spirits reflects a booming
   industry. According to IWSR, a firm that tracks beverage alcohol
   trends, global retail sales of no- and low-alcohol products reached
   more than $13 billion in 2023.

   Ritual Zero Proof, an alcohol-free spirits brand and online retailer,
   said on Wednesday that it was selling a bottle every 50 seconds,
   beating its rate from last January.
   Krista Schlueter for The New York Times

   Despite the company’s strong sales, its co-founder, Marcus Sakey, said
   he was somewhat ambivalent about the annual tradition of avoiding
   alcohol during the first month of the year. He said the interest in his
   products was evidence of a broader cultural shift that transcends Dry
   January.
   Desiree Rios/The New York Times

   “When we first told people what we were making and selling, the first
   question was always, why?” Sakey said of the response to the company in
   2019. “At the time, there was an idea that we were against drinking and
   we were trying to tell people how to live their lives.”

   Now, as more people dabble in sobriety, or identify as “mindful”
   drinkers and “sober-curious,” trading in a martini for a nonalcoholic
   tipple carries less stigma, he said.
   Krista Schlueter for The New York Times

   By way of further evidence of how normalized it has become, a mocktail
   these days may cost almost as much as a regular cocktail.

   Nonalcoholic spirits can retail for $40 a bottle, and at some upscale
   bars in Manhattan, a zero-proof cocktail can cost $26 a glass.
   Krista Schlueter for The New York Times
