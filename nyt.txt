   Myanmar
   Aug. 2, 2024

   This year, Myanmar's military junta enforced conscription. Tens of
   thousands of young men and women fled home to join rebels in the
   jungle.

   We saw new recruits to the resistance sweat through basic training
   meant to prepare them for a brutal civil war.

   Jungle living, with no electricity or running water, is punishing for
   young people from the cities.

   During basic training, meals are eaten fast. Bellies are rarely sated.

   Life is regimented: wake, train, eat, wash, train some more. Exhaustion
   prevails.

   Three months later, the new resistance fighters are destined for the
   front lines.
