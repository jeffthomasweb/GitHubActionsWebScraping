Inside the U.C.L.A. Encampment as the Police Close In

   I arrived at U.C.L.A. on Wednesday to document the pro-Palestinian
   protests on campus. Tensions were high as protesters fortified their
   encampment in anticipation of a police raid.

   As night approached, at least 250 officers, some in riot gear, arrived
   on campus.

   The mood became even more tense as protesters waited for the
   confrontation.

   Flash-bangs went off and fire extinguishers sprayed amid clashes
   between protesters and the police.

   A line of protesters linked arms and chanted “Don’t attack students!”
   as the police began making arrests.

   After clearing the protesters, officers stood watch at the steps of
   Royce Hall.

   About 200 people were arrested and booked in the predawn raid at
   U.C.L.A. Across the country, more than 2,000 arrests have been made on
   college campuses as a result of the protests.
