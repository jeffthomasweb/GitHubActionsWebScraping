5 Things to Do This Weekend

   Danielle Dowling
   Danielle DowlingReporting on the arts

   In “Maestro,” Bradley Cooper creates a portrait as spirited and
   expressive as its subject: the conductor and composer Leonard
   Bernstein.

   Here’s more on that film and other entertainment highlights this
   weekend →
   Jason McDonald/Netflix

   Film

   IFRAME:
   [570]https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJP2QblqLA0?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Part of what gives “Maestro” currency and makes it stand out is how its
   star, director and co-writer, Bradley Cooper, “complicates the familiar
   Great Man of History template,” Manohla Dargis writes. The film, which
   also stars Carey Mulligan, is in select theaters.

   Theater

   The playwright Mary Kathyrn Nagle says that her hope for her work
   “Manahatta” is to “provide non-Native Americans with a genuine
   narrative about Native people that just might supplant one or more of
   the false narratives.” The play is at the Public Theater in Manhattan.

   With elements familiar to devotees of Hayao Miyazaki — a lonely child,
   threats of violence, fantastical creatures — the filmmaker’s latest,
   “The Boy and the Heron,” is more “an exercise in contemplation than
   storytelling,” our critic writes. The film is in select theaters.

   Dance

   When Theo Reis first saw “The Nutcracker,” he says that it inspired him
   “to become a dancer.” This year, he and Judah Horenfeldt (shown here
   from right) alternate in the role of the Prince in New York City
   Ballet’s production of the holiday classic. It’s at Lincoln Center
   through Dec. 31.
   OK McCausland for The New York Times

   Pop & Rock

   Liz Phair is on the road celebrating the 30th anniversary of “Exile in
   Guyville” with live performances of the entire album, which our critic
   calls “a sacred touchstone.” Her stop at Kings Theater in Brooklyn on
   Friday is among our picks for entertainment in New York City.
