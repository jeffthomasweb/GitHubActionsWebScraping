Without Hollywood, What Happens to Los Angeles?

   With actors and screenwriters on strike, Hollywood is shut down. L.A.
   isn’t a pure company town, but the industry is inextricable from the
   city in many ways.

Strike Prevents Actors From Promoting Films at Premieres or Festivals

   While on strike, actors are barred from publicizing studio projects
   they’ve appeared in. Their absence could affect movie theaters and the
   festival circuit.

The Big Number: 160,000

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the Business news of the week

   Sound stages are quiet, studio lots empty. The machinery in Hollywood
   is grinding to a halt, as SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000
   television and movie actors, began a strike on Friday.

   Here’s what to know →
   Allie Sullberg

   The contract between the actors’ union and Hollywood’s studios expired
   at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday. The Alliance of Motion Picture and
   Television Producers, which represents the Hollywood companies, said
   the union had “decided to walk away” from the bargaining table. Fran
   Drescher, the union’s president, said the companies had “stonewalled”
   negotiations.

   On Thursday, the union’s members — including some of the industry’s
   biggest stars — voted to walk off the job.
   Mario Tama/Getty Images

   SAG-AFTRA’s members join thousands of screenwriters, represented by the
   Writers Guild, who have been on strike for 70 days, making for more
   star-studded picket lines. The last time both the writers and actors
   were on strike was 1960 — 63 years ago.

   The two groups share many demands: Both unions are fighting for higher
   wages, increased residuals — a type of royalty payment — and new
   protections against artificial intelligence.
   Mario Tama/Getty Images

   Hollywood’s scripted industry was already 80 percent shut down by the
   writers’ strike.

   Viewers — already without new episodes of late-night television shows —
   may notice other big changes starting in the fall, when unscripted
   reality and competition shows like “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune” and
   “Dancing With the Stars” will replace “Grey’s Anatomy” or “Abbott
   Elementary.” If the strike drags on, blockbuster films could be
   delayed, too.
