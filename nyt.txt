The Big Number: $148 Billion

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the Business news of the week

   Sure, it’s the thought that counts. Still, maybe that ugly Christmas
   sweater is a bit too, well, ugly. According to the National Retail
   Federation, Americans are expected to return some $148 billion in
   holiday gifts.

   Here’s what that means for retailers →
   Allie Sullberg

   The $148 billion represents about 15.4 percent of all the merchandise
   purchased over the holiday season. That’s lower than last year, when
   customers returned 17.9 percent of holiday purchases. The estimated sum
   of returns for all of 2023 — $743 billion — decreased, too, from $816
   billion in 2022.

   But retailers continue to struggle to reduce returns, which are part of
   a complex and costly process known as “reverse logistics.”
   Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times

   Retailers and manufacturers are always trying to figure out the most
   efficient and affordable way to transport returned items back to their
   stores, warehouses or suppliers.

   Yet despite their efforts, even brand-new returns may never end up back
   on shelves and instead get sent to landfills, making more waste and
   cutting into profits.

   And during the holiday season, retailers are extra wary of fraudulent
   returns — merchandise that is used, is falsely claimed as defective or
   is stolen — which they expect will account for about $25 billion of
   holiday returns.

   As retailers try to reduce returns overall, they’re providing more
   detailed descriptions on sizing and fit of clothing for online
   shoppers, and being more stringent about receipts for all returns.
