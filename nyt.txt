What’s in Our Queue? ‘Shetland’ and More

   Patricia Mazzei
   Patricia MazzeiWriting from Miami

   I am The Times’s bureau chief in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto
   Rico. I try to keep up with detective series and subtitled shows.

   Here are five things I’ve been watching, reading and listening to →
   ITV Studios

   TV: ‘Shetland’

   I came across Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez in Ann Cleeves’s novel
   “Raven Black,” the first in her series set in the remote Shetland
   Islands of Scotland. The BBC’s adaptation is moody and transporting. I
   can’t believe Douglas Henshall ended his run as Perez last year after
   seven seasons.

   Book: ‘The Apartment’

   Miami has so many characters, it’s surprising more novels aren’t set
   here. Ana Menéndez’s history-rich tale, published this year, takes
   place in a single apartment on Miami Beach over many years and is
   haunting right from the prologue, when a Native American woman in the
   distant past gathers sea turtle eggs on the sand.

   Music: Rawayana

   Rawayana, a Venezuelan alt-rock band, has a reggae-funk sound that
   reminds me of my childhood in Caracas. The band’s latest album, “¿Quién
   trae las cornetas?” (“Who Brings the Speakers?”), was released in
   September.

   IFRAME: [602]about:blank

   TV: ‘Borgen: Power & Glory’

   I discovered the original three seasons of the political drama “Borgen”
   during the coronavirus pandemic — parliamentary intrigue in Danish! —
   and was thrilled when it returned in 2022 to explore what had become of
   Birgitte Nyborg, the protagonist and onetime prime minister on the
   show, 10 years later.

   IFRAME:
   [603]https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmRJiZ4mFQU?start=0&enablejsapi=1

   Podcast: ‘Radio Ambulante’

   For more than a decade, “Radio Ambulante” has roamed Latin America to
   tell long-form narrative audio stories. (Think “This American Life,”
   but in Spanish.) The latest season began in September, and I wish I had
   a few longer drives coming up to binge it.
