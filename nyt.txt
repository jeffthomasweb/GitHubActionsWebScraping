The Big Number: 98%

   Marie Solis
   Marie SolisReporting on the Business news of the week

   A botched initial public offering. An ousted founder. A work-from-home
   shift. These are just some of the troubles that plagued WeWork,
   culminating in a bankruptcy filing last Monday. Since January, its
   stock has fallen 98 percent.

   Here’s how it got there →
   Josie Norton

   The co-working company’s downward spiral began in 2019 when its
   founder, Adam Neumann, tried to take it public. Those plans were
   quickly shelved when Wall Street investors questioned its losses and
   raised governance issues. Neumann departed soon after.

   Without that infusion of capital, WeWork ran out of money and took a
   lifeline from its biggest investor, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.
   Eduardo Munoz/Reuters

   Neumann’s successor succeeded in taking the company public in 2021,
   through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, and began
   closing locations and renegotiating its leases.

   But it was not enough. By then, the pandemic had begun and workers
   stopped going to offices, further weakening WeWork.
   Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters

   A month before the bankruptcy filing, the company warned that it would
   miss tens of millions of dollars in interest payments.

   In the filing, WeWork reported debts of more than $18 billion and said
   its restructuring plan would include reducing its portfolio of office
   leases — a resounding blow not just to the landlords who leased WeWork
   the space, but also to the idea of the co-working revolution that
   Neumann had promised.
