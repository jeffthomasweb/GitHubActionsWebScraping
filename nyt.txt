   Street in Manhattan.
   Ye Fan for The New York Times

   During the pandemic, lockdowns and quarantines put a damper on travel
   and festivities.

   This year saw a continuing return to normal.

   In Manila, the Philippines, children took to the streets to perform a
   dance as part of the celebrations.

   There were also big crowds in Bangkok’s Chinatown.

   The season is a typically heavy travel period, with millions of people
   trekking to their hometowns for the holiday.

   Fireworks are also common in many celebrations marking the holiday,
   including in New Taipei City, Taiwan.

   Snow and freezing rain in the past week disrupted travel in China,
