What’s in Our Queue? ‘Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared’ and More

   Lawrence Levi
   Lawrence LeviWriting from New York City

   I’m an editor who works on features for The Times’s print edition. I’m
   also a street photographer, and I pursue culture the same way I
   practice photography: I wander until something catches my eye.

   Here are five things I recently came upon →
   Adult Swim

   TV: ‘Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared’

   This preposterously titled British series is a nightmare parody of a
   children’s educational show, with a clueless trio of furry main
   characters subjected to existential torments — the Muppets by way of
   David Lynch. Six homemade episodes appeared online a decade ago, and
   six more were made for TV in 2022. They’re wickedly funny.

   Essay: ‘Revelation at the Food Bank’

   Merrill Joan Gerber’s episodic contemplation of mortality and her
   six-decade marriage (it’s the title piece of her new book, and it’s in
   “Best American Essays 2023”) is enraged yet hilarious. It reads as
   improvised, which makes its acuity and wit all the more explosive, and
   includes her idea for a death-preparation venture called The End of the
   Road.

   Music: Jane Weaver

   Weaver’s bewitching songs, with their skronky guitars, dreamy synths
   and hints of the medieval, combine so many styles — pop, funk,
   electro-glam, psychedelia, krautrock — that they can recall any number
   of bands without ever sounding derivative. Until her next album
   arrives, I’ll keep her latest single, “Love in Constant Spectacle,” on
   repeat.

   Art: Harry Smith

   My favorite work in the Whitney Museum’s excellent show devoted to this
   indefinable artist was his surrealistic short “Film No. 11: Mirror
   Animations,” circa 1957. In it, a parade of cutout images like
   skeletons, basketballs, Buddhas and devils cavort to a Thelonious Monk
   soundtrack. It’s ingenious, and it cracked me up.

   Movie: ‘Zola’

   I just rewatched Janicza Bravo’s audacious, unsettling, sidesplitting
   second feature, the mostly true story of a waitress who takes a road
   trip to Florida with a sketchy pole dancer. It’s a pitch-black comedy
   for the social media age, released in 2021. Whatever Bravo is cooking
   up for her third feature, I can’t wait to see it.
