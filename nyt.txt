   Michael Apted’s “Up” documentary series has checked in with the same
   Britons — now in their 60s — every seven years since they were in grade
   school. Love, death, work, faith, parenting, friendship, politics, the
   meaning of life — it’s all here. I sought out the latest, possibly
   final, installation on BritBox and was moved to tears.

   Books: ‘Olav Audunsson’

   The early 20th-century Norwegian writer Sigrid Undset is one of my
   favorite novelists of religious life. She’s best known for the “Kristin
   Lavransdatter” trilogy, which follows the life of an affluent woman in
   medieval Norway. I’m now enjoying her “Olav Audunsson” series, newly
   translated by Tiina Nunnally, who is revered by my fellow Undset-heads.

   Music: ‘Baïlèro’

   I discover a lot of new-to-me classical music by listening to the great
   Dallas radio station WRR. This short, sensual song composed by Joseph
   Canteloube, one of a collection inspired by the Auvergne region of
   France, knocked me out when I heard it a few weeks ago. It’s just
   gorgeous. Turn it up.

   Podcast: ‘Tech Talk’

   This improvised podcast is an epic fictional narrative about
   masculinity in the 21st century in the guise of an upbeat chat show
   hosted by two dads who love Apple products and worship Elon Musk. The
   joke landscape has gotten baroque over the years, and you basically
   have to start from the beginning, but the payoff is consistently both
   hilarious and poignant.

   Music: James McMurtry

   I see this Texas singer-songwriter perform as often as I can, including
   in September at the great little Kessler Theater in Dallas. My favorite
   song at the moment is “Canola Fields,” the rueful and romantic first
   track on his most recent album: “Cashin’ in on a 30-year crush, you
   can’t be young and do that.”
