   A ticker-tape parade on Thursday celebrated the Liberty, the W.N.B.A.’s
   newest champions. Betnijah Laney-Hamilton, a guard who battled injuries
   to become a secret weapon during the finals, greeted fans along the
   route.

   Todd Heisler/The New York Times

   The parade moved to a steady drumbeat, backed by fans' screams and
   cheers.

   Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times

   The dance moves of Ellie the Elephant, the team's mascot, were on full
   display, too.

   Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times

   A stretch of Broadway was filled with the team's signature sea foam
   green.

   Todd Heisler/The New York Times

   The Timeless Torches, the Liberty's 40-and-over dance troupe and a fan
   favorite, usually perform during the third quarter of home games.

   Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times

   While the original ticker tape consisted of scrap paper from stock
   machines, it has come to include almost anything that can be thrown out
   a window.
