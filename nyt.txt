On View: A Painter Inspired by Islamic Art and Rural New York Life

   Anakwa Dwamena
   Anakwa DwamenaReporting for T Magazine

   At Hauser & Wirth gallery in London, the Somali-born, New York-based
   artist Uman is exhibiting her latest works.

   Here’s what she told me about the nostalgic roots of her painting

   In upstate New York, “I’m surrounded by nature and animals,” Uman says,
   “so that comes out in my paintings: chicken feet, dogs, mouths and
   teeth.” In “When Rolfie Smiles My World Is Sunshine,” an abstract
   portrait of her dog, certain shapes recall a snout, a hill and twigs.

   “I always mix the same colors, so my paintings are all sort of
   connected,” Uman says. Her palette is tied to her earliest memories:
   “Blues and greens have always reminded me of the coast of Mombasa,”
   where the artist spent part of her childhood, she says. “And red
   reminds me of my mother and Somali women.”

   In “When Rolfie Smiles ... ,” the colors are a vibrant swirl. “During
   Covid, I started to experiment with oil sticks,” Uman says.

   “They’re so freeing. It’s almost like using crayons or a Sharpie: They
   give the effect of markings, are much easier to use and are always very
   bright and vibrant.”

   Uman’s works are influenced by Islamic art, and several depict
   geometric patterns. Some, such as “To Infinity,” include mirrors, a nod
   to the mirror-embellished outfits that Uman and her relatives would
   wear during Eid al-Fitr. The work “comes from a place of nostalgia,”
   she says.

   Wirth and Nicola Vassell Gallery. Photo: Sarah Muehlbauer

   “Kara Walker’s silhouettes have played a big role in my work. When you
   look back at some of my [paintings] from the past, you can see
   [similar] black silhouettes,” Uman says.

   She’s also inspired by the Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard, at whose
   studio she previously worked.

   “He showed me it was OK to make very violent and extreme work. I had
   always been trying to refine things, but he showed me that you could
   make these very crude, brutish paintings,” she says.

   Something)” (2016). © Kara Walker, courtesy of Sikkema Jenkins & Co.
   and Sprüth Magers

   Over 20 years, Uman’s practice has incorporated multiple media,
   including sewing, photography and glass blowing. But “for the past
   decade, I’ve been painting every single day,” she says.

   “I do about a dozen paintings at a time, all spread out around the
   room,” the artist adds, referring to her works as “my children; every
   day I go and take care of each one.”

   [624]On View highlights works by Black artists, who have traditionally
   faced a disproportionately uphill battle in having their work exhibited
   by mainstream institutions.
