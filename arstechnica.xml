              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI today <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1910378768172212636">announced</a> a significant expansion of ChatGPT's customization and memory capabilities. For some users, it will now be able to remember information from the full breadth of their prior conversations with it and adjust its responses based on that information.</p>
<p>This means ChatGPT will learn more about the user over time to personalize its responses, above and beyond just a handful of key facts.</p>
<p>Some time ago, OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/amnesia-begone-soon-chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-tell-it-between-sessions/">added</a> a feature called "Memory" that allowed a limited number of pieces of information to be retained and used for future responses. Users often had to specifically ask ChatGPT to remember something to trigger this, though it occasionally tried to guess at what it should remember, too. (When something was added to its memory, there was a message saying that its memory had been updated.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-can-now-remember-and-reference-all-your-previous-chats/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Remember when teachers demanded that you "show your work" in school? Some fancy new AI models promise to do exactly that, but <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/reasoning-models-dont-say-think">new research</a> suggests that they sometimes hide their actual methods while fabricating elaborate explanations instead.</p>
<p>New research from Anthropic—creator of the ChatGPT-like Claude AI assistant—examines simulated reasoning (SR) models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">DeepSeek's R1</a>, and its own Claude series. In a research paper <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/71876fabef0f0ed4/original/reasoning_models_paper.pdf">posted last week</a>, Anthropic's Alignment Science team demonstrated that these SR models frequently fail to disclose when they've used external help or taken shortcuts, despite features designed to show their "reasoning" process.</p>
<p>(It's worth noting that OpenAI's o1 and o3 series SR models deliberately obscure the accuracy of their "thought" process, so this study does not apply to them.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>After modest success with its first two smartwatches, OnePlus was poised to release a third-generation smartwatch early this year. Unfortunately, the company had to delay the Watch 3 from February to April, and now the previously announced $330 price tag is nowhere to be seen. Instead, the OnePlus Watch 3 has launched at an eye-watering $500 in the US, and you can probably guess why.</p>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 was all set for release a few months ago, but early reviewers spotted an embarrassing typo on the device. Like most smartwatches, OnePlus printed the watch's key specs on the bottom of the housing. Part of that text was supposed to read "Made in China," but instead, it said "Meda in China." Oops.</p>
<p>OnePlus delayed the launch so it could correct the mistake on retail units. However, the US-China trade relationship has deteriorated dramatically in the intervening weeks. Since the watch is <del>meda</del> made in China, it is subject to tariffs—the amount of Trump's China tariffs is changing on an almost daily basis, but it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/amazons-chinese-sellers-to-raise-prices-or-quit-us-market-as-tariffs-hit-145/">currently 145 percent</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/after-typo-fixing-delay-oneplus-watch-3-launches-with-50-higher-price/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 2023, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/take-an-eye-popping-3d-tour-of-the-titanics-digital-twin/">we reported</a> on the unveiling of the first full-size 3D digital scan of the remains of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>—a "digital twin" that captured the wreckage in unprecedented detail. Magellan Ltd, a <a href="https://www.magellan.gg/titanic-in-3d/">deep-sea mapping company</a>, and Atlantic Productions conducted the scans over a six-week expedition. That project is the subject of the new National Geographic documentary <a href="https://www.natgeotv.com/za/programs/natgeo/titanic-the-digital-resurrection"><em>Titanic: The Digital Resurrection</em></a>, detailing several fascinating initial findings from experts' ongoing analysis of that full-size scan.</p>
<p><em>Titanic</em> met its doom just four days into the Atlantic crossing, roughly 375 miles (600 kilometers) south of Newfoundland. At 11:40 pm ship's time on April 14, 1912, <em>Titanic</em> hit that infamous iceberg and began taking on water, flooding five of its 16 watertight compartments, thereby sealing its fate. More than 1,500 passengers and crew perished; only around 710 of those on board survived.</p>
<p><em>Titanic</em> remained undiscovered at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean until an expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and Robert Ballard reached the wreck on September 1, 1985. The ship split apart as it sank, with the bow and stern sections lying roughly one-third of a mile apart. The bow proved to be surprisingly intact, while the stern showed severe structural damage, likely flattened from the impact as it hit the ocean floor. There is a debris field spanning a 5×3-mile area, filled with furniture fragments, dinnerware, shoes and boots, and other personal items.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/3d-digital-twin-of-titanic-wreck-yields-fresh-insights/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google has long been on the lookout for ways to break Microsoft's stranglehold on US government office software, and the current drive to cut costs may be it. Google and the federal government have announced an agreement that makes Google Workspace available to all agencies at a significant discount, trimming 71 percent from the service's subscription price tag.</p>
<p>Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the government has engaged in a campaign of unbridled staffing reductions and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/despite-court-orders-climate-and-energy-programs-stalled-by-trump-freeze/">program cancellations</a>, all with the alleged aim of reducing federal spending. It would appear Google recognized this opportunity, negotiating with the General Services Administration (GSA) to offer Workspace at a lower price. Google claims the deal could yield up to $2 billion in savings.</p>
<p>Google has previously offered discounts for federal agencies interested in migrating to Workspace, but it saw little success displacing Microsoft. The Windows maker has enjoyed decades as an entrenched tech giant, leading the 365 productivity tools to proliferate throughout the government. While Google has gotten some agencies on board, Microsoft has traditionally won the lion's share of contracts, including the $8 billion Defense Enterprise Office Solutions contract that pushed Microsoft 365 to all corners of the Pentagon beginning in 2020.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-slashes-workspace-pricing-for-feds-to-capitalize-on-cost-cutting/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For quick reminders and can’t-miss memos, sticky notes are effective tools, and I'd argue that the simplicity of the sticky note is its best attribute. But the ease behind propping up sticky notes also means that it’s easy for people to find their desks covered in the things, making it difficult to glean critical information quickly.</p>
<p>Rocketbook, a Boston-based company that also makes<a href="https://getrocketbook.com/products/rocketbook-core"> reusable notebooks</a>, thinks it has a solution for sticky note overload in the form of an app that interprets handwriting and organizes reusable sticky notes. But not everyone has the need—or time—for a dedicated sticky notes app.</p>
<h2>Rocketbook’s Reusable Sticky Notes</h2>
<p>Like Rocketbook’s flagship notebooks, its Reusable Sticky Notes rely on erasable pens that allow you to use the paper repeatedly. The Reusable Sticky Notes work with the Rocketbook app (available for iOS or Android), which transforms the sticky notes into images that are automatically stored in the app and can be emailed to specified people (as a PDF) or shared with third-party apps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/hands-on-handwriting-recognition-app-brings-sticky-notes-into-the-21st-century/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating telework for staff who review drugs, medical devices, and tobacco, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-remote-work-telework-f7b6036c62f44359b5d04fafb9eb5fec">reporting by the Associated Press</a>. Review staff and supervisors are now allowed to resume telework at least two days a week, according to an internal email obtained by the AP.</p>
<p>The move reverses a jarring return-to-office decree by the Trump administration, which it used to spur resignations from federal employees. Now, after a wave of such resignations and a brutal round of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/this-will-be-a-painful-period-rfk-jr-slashes-24-of-us-health-dept/">layoffs that targeted about 3,500 staff</a>, the move to restore some telework appears aimed at keeping the remaining talent amid fears that the agency's review capabilities are at risk of collapse.</p>
<p>The cut of 3,500 staff is a loss of about 19 percent of the agency's workforce, and staffers told the AP that lower-level employees are "pouring" out of the agency amid the Trump administration's actions. Entire offices responsible for FDA policies and regulations have been shuttered. Most of the agency's communication staff have been wiped out, as well as teams that support food inspectors and investigators, the AP reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/fda-backpedals-on-rto-to-stop-talent-hemorrhage-after-hhs-bloodbath/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Chinese companies that sell to US customers on Amazon are reportedly preparing to raise prices or quit the US market because of tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has meanwhile confirmed that he expects the cost of tariffs to be passed on to US buyers.</p>
<p>Reuters talked to several individual sellers and a Chinese trade association that represents over 3,000 Amazon sellers for an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-sellers-amazon-hike-prices-or-exit-us-tariffs-soar-association-says-2025-04-10/">article</a> published today. "It'll be very hard for anyone to survive in the US market" because "the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed" by the tariffs, Reuters was told by Wang Xin, who leads the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association. Xin also "not[ed] the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs."</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-boosts-china-tariffs-to-125-pauses-tariff-hikes-on-other-countries/">increased tariffs</a> on China imports to 125 percent yesterday even as he announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes affecting other countries. The total tariffs are 145 percent because the newly raised tariff "comes on top of a 20 percent fentanyl-related tariff that Trump previously imposed on China," CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/china-trump-tariffs-live-updates.html">wrote</a> today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/amazons-chinese-sellers-to-raise-prices-or-quit-us-market-as-tariffs-hit-145/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, OpenAI <a href="ttps://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Musk-v-Altman-Response-to-Amended-Complaint-4-9-25.pdf">counter-sued</a> Elon Musk, alleging that Musk's "sham" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/sam-altman-openai-is-not-for-sale-even-for-elon-musks-97-billion-offer/">bid to buy OpenAI</a> was intentionally timed to maximally disrupt and potentially even frighten off investments from honest bidders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Slamming Musk for attempting to become an "AGI dictator," OpenAI said that if Musk's allegedly "relentless" yearslong campaign of "harassment" isn’t stopped, Musk could end up taking over OpenAI and tanking its revenue the same way he did with Twitter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In its filing, OpenAI argued that Musk and the other investors who joined his bid completely fabricated the $97.375 billion offer. It was allegedly not based on OpenAI's projections or historical performance, like Musk claimed, but instead appeared to be "a comedic reference to Musk’s favorite sci-fi" novel, Iain Banks' <em>Look to Windward</em>. Musk and others also provided "no evidence of financing to pay the nearly $100 billion purchase price," OpenAI said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/elon-musk-wants-to-be-agi-dictator-openai-tells-court/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For its third incarnation, the Mini Countryman now comes in an all-electric variant. The Countryman is Mini's take on the family car, a compact crossover with bold design both inside and out. At a time when far too many automakers are supersizing their vehicles, Mini's offerings are still right-sized, even if the Countryman is a bit bigger than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/minis-new-countryman-hybrid-is-hobbled-by-too-small-a-battery/">the model it replaces</a>. But at times, you might be left feeling that style took preference over substance.</p>
<p>The previous Countryman was available with the brand's only plug-in hybrid powertrain, but Mini now only offers the Countryman with either an internal combustion engine or as a full battery electric vehicle. Consequently, the Countryman SE is a fair bit more expensive now, starting at $45,200 before any tariffs are taken into account.</p>
<p>Much of that money has gone to more lithium-ion—66.5 kWh in total (64.7 kWh useable), coupled to a pair of electric motors with a combined output of 308 hp (230 kW) and 364 lb-ft (494 Nm). That's sufficient for an EPA range estimate of 212 miles (341 km), although that might be a little on the conservative side. Based on the past few hundred miles, the test car we spent a week with averaged 3.4 miles/kWh (18.3 miles/kWh), which should allow for 220 miles (354 km) on a single charge, at least in good weather.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/the-2025-mini-countryman-se-whimsy-doesnt-make-up-for-annoying/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Framework is <a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1910137465924702695">opening</a> US preorders for its new Laptop 12 today, a couple of months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/frameworks-laptop-12-is-its-first-stab-at-a-budget-convertible-touchscreen-pc/">announcing the system</a> at an event in February. Framework's DIY edition of the laptop, which is missing RAM, an SSD, a USB-C charger, and an OS and requires some assembly, will start at $549. A fully assembled pre-built version with 8GB of RAM, a 500GB SSD, a 60 W charger, and Windows 11 Home starts at $799.</p>
<p>All preorders placed on Framework's site require a $100 deposit, and almost all configurations begin shipping in July. A first batch of systems is slated to ship in June, but this requires <a href="https://frame.work/hacktheworld">a $250 donation to Hack Club</a>; Framework says the donation will be used to buy Framework 12 laptops for high school students.</p>
<p>The Laptop 12 was built to be a more budget-friendly system, which is reflected in its specs, screen size, and its mostly plastic construction. But like the Laptop 13, the Laptop 12 prioritizes upgradeability and repairability and retains the USB-C-based Expansion Card system that was the Laptop 13's biggest innovation when it was introduced. Each Laptop 12 has four Expansion Card bays plus a headphone jack, allowing the installation of USB-C, USB-A, DisplayPort, and HDMI ports, as well as the other Expansion Cards Framework offers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/frameworks-cheaper-colorful-laptop-12-up-for-preorder-starts-at-549-bare-bones/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Job cuts at the US traffic safety regulator instigated by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency disproportionately hit staff assessing self-driving risks, hampering oversight of technology on which the world’s richest man has staked the future of Tesla.</p>
<p>Of roughly 30 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration workers dismissed in February as part of Musk’s campaign to shrink the federal workforce, many were in the “office of vehicle automation safety,” people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The cuts are part of mass firings by Doge that have affected at least 20,000 federal employees and raised widespread concern over potential conflicts of interest for Musk given many of the targeted agencies regulate or have contracts with his businesses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/car-safety-experts-at-nhtsa-which-regulates-tesla-axed-by-doge/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It took a few years, but Google's Pixel phones have risen to the top of the Android ranks, and its new Pixel 9a keeps most of what has made flagship Pixel phones so good, including the slick software and versatile cameras. Despite a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/the-pixel-9a-arrives-this-month-for-499-with-streamlined-design-and-larger-battery/">revamped design and larger battery</a>, Google has maintained the $499 price point of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pixel-8a-review-googles-budget-champion-gets-even-better/">last year's phone</a>, undercutting other "budget" devices like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/iphone-16e-review-the-most-expensive-cheap-iphone-yet/">iPhone 16e</a>.</p>
<p>However, hitting this price point involves trade-offs in materials, charging, and—significantly—the on-device AI capabilities compared to its pricier siblings. None of those are deal-breakers, though. In fact, the Pixel 9a may be coming along at just the right time. As we enter a period of uncertainty for imported gadgets, a modestly priced phone with lengthy support could be the perfect purchase.</p>
<h2>A simpler silhouette</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9a sports the same rounded corners and flat edges we've seen on other recent smartphones. The aluminum frame has a smooth, almost silky texture, with rolled edges that flow into the front and back covers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-pixel-9a-review-all-the-phone-you-need/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A family altar in the Maya city of Tikal offers a glimpse into events in an enclave of the city’s foreign overlords in the wake of a local coup.</p>
<p>Archaeologists recently unearthed the altar in a quarter of the Maya city of Tikal that had lain buried under dirt and rubble for about the last 1,500 years. The altar—and the wealthy household behind the courtyard it once adorned—stands just a few blocks from the center of Tikal, one of the most powerful cities of Maya civilization. But the altar and the courtyard around it aren’t even remotely Maya-looking; their architecture and decoration look like they belong 1,000 kilometers to the west in the city of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico.</p>
<p>The altar reveals the presence of powerful rulers from Teotihuacan who were there at a time when a coup ousted Tikal’s Maya rulers and replaced them with a Teotihuacan puppet government. It also reveals how hard those foreign rulers fell from favor when Teotihuacan’s power finally waned centuries later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/painted-altar-in-maya-city-of-tikal-reveals-the-aftermath-of-an-ancient-coup/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Shortly after its inauguration, the Trump administration has made no secret that it isn't especially interested in funding research. Before January's end, major science agencies had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/">instituted pauses</a> on research funding, and grant funding has not been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/report-us-scientists-lost-3-billion-in-nih-grants-since-trump-took-office/">restored to previous levels</a> since. Many individual grants have been targeted on ideological grounds, and agencies like the National Science Foundation are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/white-house-budget-proposal-could-shatter-the-national-science-foundation/">expected to see significant cuts</a>. Since then, individual universities have been targeted, starting with an ongoing fight <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html">with Columbia University</a> over $400 million in research funding.</p>
<p>This week, however, it appears that the targeting of university research has entered overdrive, with multiple announcements of funding freezes targeting several universities. Should these last for any considerable amount of time, they will likely cripple research at the targeted universities.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Science learned that the National Institutes of Health <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-freezes-all-research-grants-columbia-university">has frozen</a> all of its research funding to Columbia, despite the university agreeing to steps previously demanded by the administration and the resignation of its acting president. In 2024, Columbia had received nearly $700 million in grants from the NIH, with the money largely going to the university's prestigious medical and public health schools.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-administrations-attack-on-university-research-accelerates/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the last week, the US Space Force <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/with-new-contracts-spacex-will-become-the-us-militarys-top-launch-provider/">awarded SpaceX a $5.9 billion deal</a> to make Elon Musk's space company the Pentagon's leading launch provider, and then it assigned the vast majority of this year's most lucrative launch contracts to SpaceX.</p>
<p>On top of these actions, the Space Force <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/a-military-satellite-waiting-to-launch-with-ula-will-now-fly-with-spacex/">reassigned the launch of a GPS navigation satellite</a> from United Launch Alliance's long-delayed Vulcan rocket to fly on SpaceX's Falcon 9.

<p>Given the close relationship between Musk and President Donald Trump, it's not out of bounds to ask why SpaceX is racking up so many wins.

              <![CDATA[<p>Google made waves with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">release of Gemini 2.5</a> last month, rocketing to the top of the AI leaderboard after previously struggling to keep up with the likes of OpenAI. That first experimental model was just the beginning. Google is deploying its improved AI in more places across its ecosystem, from the developer-centric Vertex AI to the consumer Gemini app.</p>
<p>Gemini models have been dropping so quickly, it can be hard to grasp Google's intended lineup. Things are becoming clearer now that the company is beginning to move its products to the new branch. At the Google Cloud Next conference, it <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/gemini-2-5-pro-flash-on-vertex-ai">has announced</a> initial availability of Gemini 2.5 Flash. This model is based on the same code as Gemini 2.5 Pro, but it's faster and cheaper to run.</p>
<p>You won't see Gemini 2.5 Flash in the Gemini app just yet—it's starting out in the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?redirectPath=%2Fvertex-ai%2Fstudio&amp;facet_utm_source=google&amp;facet_utm_campaign=%28organic%29&amp;facet_utm_medium=organic&amp;facet_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Fblog%2Fproducts%2Fai-machine-learning%2Fgemini-2-5-pro-flash-on-vertex-ai">Vertex AI development platform</a> and AI Studio. The experimental wide release of Pro helped Google gather data and see how people interacted with the new model, and that has helped inform the development of 2.5 Flash.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/googles-best-gemini-ai-model-is-showing-up-in-more-places/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON, DC—Over the course of a nearly three-hour committee hearing Wednesday, the nominee to lead NASA for the Trump administration faced difficult questions from US senators who sought commitments to specific projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, maneuvering like a pilot with more than 7,000 hours in jets and ex-military aircraft, entrepreneur and private astronaut Jared Isaacman dodged most of their questions and would not be pinned down. His basic message to members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation was that NASA is an exceptional agency that does the impossible, but that it also faces some challenges. NASA, he said, receives an “extraordinary” budget, and he vowed to put taxpayer dollars to efficient use in exploring the universe and retaining the nation’s lead on geopolitical competitors in space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have lived the American dream, and I owe this nation a great debt,” said Isaacman, who founded his first business at 16 in his parents' basement and would go on to found an online payments company, Shift4, that would make him a billionaire. Isaacman is also an avid pilot who self-funded and led two private missions to orbit on Crew Dragon. Leading NASA would be “the privilege of a lifetime,” he said.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/isaacman-sls-and-orion-are-not-a-long-term-solution-for-nasa/">Read full article</a></p>
