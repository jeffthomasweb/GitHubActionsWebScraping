<p>“We were getting basil leaves the size of your palm,” University of Arizona researcher Greg Barron-Gafford said, describing some of the benefits he and his team have seen farming under solar panels in the Tucson desert.</p>
<p>For 12 years, Barron-Gafford has been investigating agrivoltaics, the integration of solar arrays into working farmland. This practice involves growing crops or other vegetation, such as pollinator-friendly plants, under solar panels, and sometimes grazing livestock in this greenery. Though a relatively new concept, at least 604 agrivoltaic sites have popped up across the United States, according to <a href="https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map">OpenEI</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/in-the-southwest-solar-panels-in-can-help-both-photovoltaics-and-crops/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Russia is a waning space power, but President Vladimir Putin has made sure he still has a saber to rattle in orbit.</p>
<p>This has become more evident in recent weeks, when we saw a pair of rocket launches carrying top-secret military payloads, the release of a mysterious object from a Russian mothership in orbit, and a sequence of complex formation-flying maneuvers with a trio of satellites nearly 400 miles up.</p>
<p>In isolation, each of these things would catch the attention of Western analysts. Taken together, the frenzy of maneuvers represents one of the most significant surges in Russian military space activity since the end of the Cold War. What's more, all of this is happening as Russia lags further behind the United States and China in everything from rockets to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/10/russian-space-chief-explains-why-country-can-only-build-40-satellites-a-year/">satellite manufacturing</a>.

                            <![CDATA[<p>A political effort to remove space shuttle <em>Discovery</em> from the Smithsonian and place it on display in Texas encountered some pushback on Thursday, as a US senator questioned the expense of carrying out what he described as a theft.</p>
<p>"This is not a transfer. <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-071025a-space-shuttle-discovery-smithsonian-houston-transfer-heist-senate-appropriations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It's a heist</a>," said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) during a budget markup hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee. "A heist by Texas because they lost a competition 12 years ago."</p>
<p>In April, Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, both representing Texas, introduced the "<a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-041025a-space-shuttle-discovery-move-smithsonian-houston-legislation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bring the Space Shuttle Home Act</a>" that called for <em>Discovery</em> to be relocated from the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in northern Virginia and displayed at Space Center Houston. They then inserted a provision into the Senate version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill," which, to comply with Senate rules, was more vaguely worded but was meant to achieve the same goal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/its-a-heist-senator-calls-out-texas-for-trying-to-steal-shuttle-from-smithsonian/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The woman, Katie Mohan, told the outlet that she had seen a doctor on Instagram suggesting it was useful against inflammation and joint pain. So, she began taking turmeric capsules at a dose of 2,250 mg per day. According to the World Health Organization, an acceptable daily dose is <a href="https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/638">up to 3 mg</a> per kilogram of weight per day—for a 150-pound (68 kg) adult, that would be about 204 mg per day. Mohan was taking more than 10 times that amount.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, she developed stomach pain, nausea, fatigue, and dark urine. "I just did not feel well generally," she said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/woman-takes-10x-dose-of-turmeric-gets-hospitalized-for-liver-damage/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Earlier this week, seven space industry trade groups representing more than 450 companies sent letters to House and Senate leaders urging them to counter the White House's proposal. A spokesperson for the military's Space Operations Command, which currently has overall responsibility for space traffic management, said it will "continue to advocate" for a civilian organization to take over the Space Force's role as orbital traffic cop.</p>
<h2>Giveth and taketh away</h2>
<p>The White House's budget request submitted to Congress for fiscal year 2026 would slash the Office of Space Commerce's budget from $65 million to $10 million and eliminate funding for the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS). The TraCSS program was established in the Department of Commerce after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/as-space-gets-more-crowded-us-seeks-to-ensure-a-safe-environment/">Trump signed a policy directive in his first term</a> as president to reform how the government supervises the movements of satellites and space debris in orbit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/nearly-everyone-opposes-trumps-plan-to-kill-space-traffic-control-program/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Europe have detained five people, including a former Russian professional basketball player, in connection with crime syndicates responsible for ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>Until recently, one of the suspects, <a href="https://basketball.eurobasket.com/player/Daniil-Kasatkin/334475">Daniil Kasatkin</a>, played for MBA Moscow, a basketball team that’s part of the VTB United League, which includes teams from Russia and other Eastern European countries. Kasatkin also briefly played for <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/stats/_/id/4397240/daniil-kasatkin">Penn State University</a> during the 2018–2019 season. He has denied the charges.</p>

The arrest occurred as the basketball player was at the de Gaulle airport while traveling with his fiancée, whom he had just proposed to. The 26-year-old has been under extradition arrest since June 23, Wednesday's news report said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/pro-basketball-player-and-4-youths-arrested-in-connection-to-ransomware-crimes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, a digital rights group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, published an expansive <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/axons-draft-one-designed-defy-transparency">investigation</a> into AI-generated police reports that the group alleged are, by design, nearly impossible to audit and could make it easier for cops to lie under oath.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/chatbots-offer-cops-the-ultimate-out-to-spin-police-reports-expert-says/">Axon's Draft One debuted last summer</a> at a police department in Colorado, instantly raising questions about the feared negative impacts of AI-written police reports on the criminal justice system. The tool relies on a ChatGPT variant to generate police reports based on body camera audio, which cops are then supposed to edit to correct any mistakes, assess the AI outputs for biases, or add key context.</p>
<p>But the EFF found that the tech "seems designed to stymie any attempts at auditing, transparency, and accountability." Cops don't have to disclose when AI is used in every department, and Draft One does not save drafts or retain a record showing which parts of reports are AI-generated. Departments also don't retain different versions of drafts, making it difficult to assess how one version of an AI report might compare to another to help the public determine if the technology is "junk," the EFF said. That raises the question, the EFF suggested, "Why wouldn't an agency want to maintain a record that can establish the technology’s accuracy?"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/cops-favorite-ai-tool-automatically-deletes-evidence-of-when-ai-was-used/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile is ending DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policies in an attempt to obtain the Trump administration's approval for two mergers.</p>
<p>"As T-Mobile indicated earlier this year, we recognize that the legal and policy landscape surrounding DEI under federal law has changed and we remain fully committed to ensuring that T-Mobile does not have any policies or practices that enable invidious discrimination, whether in fulfillment of DEI or any other purpose," T-Mobile General Counsel Mark Nelson wrote in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10709912829018/1">July 8 letter</a> that was posted to the Federal Communications Commission's filings website yesterday. "We have conducted a comprehensive review of T-Mobile's policies, programs, and activities, and pursuant to this review, T-Mobile is ending its DEI-related policies as described below, not just in name, but in substance."</p>
<p>It's clear that T-Mobile was trying to influence the FCC's review of its pending transactions because the carrier filed the letter in two dockets: one for its pending acquisition of <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/uscellular-acquisition-operations-assets">US Cellular's wireless operations</a> and another for a joint venture to <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-kkr-joint-venture-to-acquire-metronet">acquire fiber provider Metronet</a>. The FCC observes an informal timeline of 180 days to review mergers; the T-Mobile/US Cellular deal is on <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/transaction/t-mobile-uscellular">day 253</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/t-mobile-follows-orders-from-trump-fcc-ends-dei-to-get-two-mergers-approved/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"There was always a passion about motorbikes. But it's not only passion, it also needs to be a sustainable business model," Mario Gebetshuber, BRP-Rotax vice president of global sourcing and operations powertrain, told Ars Technica during a tour of the company's museum of motors over the decades.</p>
<p>Gebetshuber says the company wanted to return to the motorcycle market but knew that it was a highly competitive and extremely crowded market. The COVID-related motorcycle sales bump didn't last, and Rotax wasn't interested in what it anticipated would be a 5 percent market share battling against traditional companies like Kawasaki, Honda, Harley, BMW, and others. It's going electric with its bikes and something else—it's not saying what—in August.</p>
<p>"If we want to enter, we want to enter to be a player," Gebetshuber said. Electrification was where the company saw itself as able to move quickly. It could be Rotax's anchor and a way to jump ahead of the competition and grow.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/rotax-eyes-an-ev-future-beyond-can-am-motorcycles/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2019, Nintendo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/2019/5/16/18627669/nintendo-switch-online-game-vouchers-deal">announced</a> a new benefit for subscribers to its Switch Online service: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">a pair of game vouchers</a>, available for $100, that could be redeemed for any two Switch games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=pd&amp;p=0">Nintendo's eligibility list</a>. If you already knew you were going to be buying first-party games, the voucher could save you $20, or even $30, if you used it on the normally $70 <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo announced today that it will soon end the program, rather than carrying it forward into the Switch 2 era. Switch Online subscribers can still buy a pair of vouchers until the end of January 2026, and those vouchers will be redeemable for up to a year after purchase, but you can't buy new vouchers after that.</p>
<p>The vouchers were already notably <em>not</em> usable to buy Switch 2-exclusive games like <em>Mario Kart World </em>or <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. However, for hybrid Switch games with a separate Switch 2 Edition, you could still use them to buy a game like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and then upgrade it to the Switch 2 edition separately. Nintendo also <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html">said on its FAQ page</a> that new titles would be added to the eligibility list between now and January 2026, raising the possibility that upcoming high-profile hybrid games like <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> or <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>could make the list.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/nintendo-discontinues-cost-saving-game-vouchers-for-switch-online-players/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After flying three missions into low-Earth orbit this year, Varda Space Industries appears to be making credible progress toward developing the nascent manufacturing-in-space industry.</p>
<p>Investors seem to think the same, as the California-based company announced an impressive $187 million Series C round of funding on Thursday. This brings the company's total amount of money raised since its founding in 2021 to $325 million.</p>
<p>"A decent chunk of the capital is going to go toward scaling up our production and operations," said the company's cofounder and president, Delian Asparouhov, in an interview. "And another chunk of that we're going to invest in our next-generation capabilities and spacecraft. With a vehicle like ours, there is a benefit to increasing the percentage of the total vehicle that is reusable."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/after-some-success-in-space-varda-raises-187-million-to-expand-ambitions/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>These rules—which have not yet been finalized and focus on copyright protections, transparency, and public safety—will initially be voluntary when they take effect for the biggest makers of "general purpose AI" on August 2.</p>
<p>But the EU will begin enforcing the AI Act in August 2026, and the Commission has noted that any companies agreeing to the rules could benefit from a "reduced administrative burden and increased legal certainty," The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/business/ai-rules-europe.html">reported</a>. Rejecting the voluntary rules could force companies to prove their compliance in ways that could be more costly or time-consuming, the Commission suggested.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/everything-tech-giants-will-hate-about-the-eus-new-ai-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In late June, we hosted this year's second Ars Live event, a conversation with climate scientist <a href="https://berkeleyearth.org/team/">Zeke Hausfather</a>, who holds positions with the financial services company Stripe and at the Berkeley Earth Project, which tracks the global surface temperatures. We wanted to get his perspective on why those temperatures have been setting extreme records with regularity of late, but we took a little detour on the way, asking how he ended up doing climate science in the first place.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a very indirect route. He'd been a climate activist during his college years and helped launch a couple of cleantech startups afterward. At the time, some of the first academic climate bloggers were getting started, and Hausfather found himself doing small projects with them. Over time, he decided "my hobby was more fun than my day job," so he decided to take time off from the business world and get a PhD in climate science. From there, he has kept his feet in both the climate and business worlds.</p>
<p>The conversation then moved to the record we have of the Earth's surface temperatures and the role of Berkeley Earth in providing an alternate method of calculating those. While the temperature records were somewhat controversial in the past, those arguments have largely settled down, and Berkeley Earth played a major role in helping to show that the temperature records have been reliable.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/ars-live-recap-climate-science-in-a-rapidly-changing-world/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday night, Elon Musk unveiled xAI's latest flagship models Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy via <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1lDGLzplWnyxm">livestream</a>, just one day after the company's Grok chatbot began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/grok-praises-hitler-gives-credit-to-musk-for-removing-woke-filters/">generating outputs</a> that featured blatantly antisemitic tropes in responses to users on X.</p>
<p>Among the two models, xAI calls Grok 4 Heavy its "multi-agent version." According to Musk, Grok 4 Heavy "spawns multiple agents in parallel" that "compare notes and yield an answer," simulating a study group approach. The company describes this as test-time compute scaling (similar to previous <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">simulated reasoning models</a>), claiming to increase computational resources by roughly an order of magnitude during runtime (called "inference").</p>
<p>During the livestream, Musk claimed the new models achieved frontier-level performance on several benchmarks. On <a href="https://agi.safe.ai/">Humanity's Last Exam</a>, a deliberately challenging test with 2,500 expert-curated questions across multiple subjects, Grok 4 reportedly scored 25.4 percent without external tools, which the company says outperformed OpenAI's o3 at 21 percent and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro at 21.6 percent. With tools enabled, xAI claims Grok 4 Heavy reached 44.4 percent. However, it remains to be seen if these AI benchmarks actually measure properties that translate to usefulness for users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/musks-grok-4-launches-one-day-after-chatbot-generated-hitler-praise-on-x/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Brembo provided flights from Austin to Paris and accommodation so Ars could attend Le Mans and visit the Brembo factory. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>LE MANS, FRANCE—It's 2 am at the Circuit de la Sarthe, just a few hours from Paris, France. The 24 Hours of Le Mans race is nearly halfway through, and fans are late-night snacking, snoozing in their sleeping bags, or pressed up against the fence to watch the cars zip by. The sound is thunderous as a batch of hypercars pass, each brand with a distinctive pattern of notes.</p>
<p>The real show after darkness falls is not the laser lights or drone formation but the sight of red-hot brake discs glowing through the front wheels at the turns. Turn four, in particular, put on a display of fiery orange and red, visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>For the first time, all 62 cars on the 2025 Le Mans starting grid were equipped with at least one component—including calipers, discs, and pads—made by a single company: Brembo Group. The glowing brakes are a result of high friction and high temperatures that start at 574˚ Fahrenheit (300˚ Celsius) and soar past the 1500˚ F (815˚ C) mark, and the components undergo extreme stress. Impressively, these systems are designed to endure through a whole race without changing a single element, despite Le Mans now being a 24-hour sprint race. (Mid-race brake changes were commonplace back when the cars were more fragile.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/why-brembo-uses-endurance-racing-as-a-test-bench-for-brake-development/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A new version of Mazda's popular CX-5 SUV is on the way. Earlier today, the Japanese automaker revealed details about the third-generation CX-5, which goes on sale in Europe later this year before coming here in 2026.</p>
<p>The current CX-5, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/mazda-wants-to-move-upmarket-with-the-2017-cx-5/">first introduced in 2017</a>, marked Mazda's move upmarket, with a renewed focus on elegant interiors and keen handling without luxury automaker prices. Mazda remains committed to its core principle of "Jinba Ittai"—the horse and rider being at one—and the cars remain popular with enthusiasts, but it's fair to say that the available powertrains often leave something to be desired in terms of fuel efficiency.</p>
<p>At one time, Mazda readied a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/mazda-brings-a-new-diesel-cx-5-suv-to-the-us-but-why/">new diesel engine</a> to try to improve its fleet average, although that option disappeared within a couple of years due to minimal demand. And for a while, we were teased with the clever "Skyactiv-X" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/mazdas-skyactiv-x-shows-the-internal-combustion-engine-has-a-future/">compression ignition engine</a>, which promised diesel-like efficiency on regular pump gasoline. It seems the odds of that one actually going on sale in the US are now remote, though.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/mazdas-third-gen-cx-5-suv-on-sale-in-2026-hybrid-comes-in-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's Veo 3 videos have propagated across the Internet since the model's debut in May, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">blurring the line between truth and fiction</a>. Now, it's getting even easier to create these AI videos. The Gemini app is gaining photo-to-video generation, allowing you to upload a photo and turn it into a video. You don't have to pay anything extra for these Veo 3 videos, but the feature is only available to subscribers of Google's Pro and Ultra AI plans.</p>
<p>When Veo 3 launched, it could conjure up a video based only on your description, complete with speech, music, and background audio. This has made Google's new AI videos staggeringly realistic—it's actually getting hard to identify AI videos at a glance. Using a reference photo makes it easier to get the look you want without tediously describing every aspect. This was an option in Google's Flow AI tool for filmmakers, but now it's in the Gemini app and web interface.</p>
<p>To create a video from a photo, you have to select "Video" from the Gemini toolbar. Once this feature is available, you can then add your image and prompt, including audio and dialogue. Generating the video takes several minutes—this process takes a lot of computation, which is why video output is still quite limited.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/google-adds-photo-to-video-generation-with-veo-3-to-the-gemini-app/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Greetings, Arsians! We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, and I'm not just talking the latest AAA blockbusters—we love <em>all</em> kinds of games, from modern to ancient and all points in between.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we're trying something different for the next few months to see how it goes: We've partnered with the folks at <a href="https://www.gog.com">GOG.com</a> to create <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fpartner%2FArsTechnica">a store page featuring a hand-curated list</a> of some of our favorites from GOG's catalog. At the end of every month, we'll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.</p>
<p>(Please forgive the messy affiliate link—it points to <code>https://www.gog.com/en/partner/ArsTechnica</code> if you'd prefer to go there directly, but arriving on GOG's site via that affiliate link gives Ars a small portion of revenue for anything you buy during your session once you're there. This helps us out quite a bit!)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/introducing-the-ars-technica-gog-store-page-lets-buy-some-retro-games/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent years, illicit drugs in the US have been cut with some high-profile and dangerous adulterants, such as the powerful veterinary sedative xylazine (aka tranq) and the yet more powerful veterinary sedative medetomidine. But last year, a new adulterant hit the streets. Unlike its predecessors, it didn't show up here and there and gain ground gradually; it seemed to show up everywhere at once and quickly overtook the market. Even more oddly, it's not a type of chemical one might expect in illicit drugs. It's not another sedative. In fact, it has no known psychoactive effects at all.</p>
<p>The chemical is bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, also called BTMPS, which is in a group of chemicals called hindered amine light stabilizers. BTMPS is usually added to plastics, coatings, and adhesives to protect them from weathering and UV radiation.</p>
<p>Researchers don't know why it's being added to illicit drugs—or what it does once it's there. BTMPS has never been tested in humans before, given that it's never been intended for use in humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/weird-chemical-used-in-plastics-has-erupted-as-latest-fentanyl-adulterant/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>McCully studies heart damage prevention at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School and was keenly interested in <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2022/mitochondria-origin-eukaryotes">mitochondria</a>. These power-producing organelles are particularly important for organs like the heart that have high energy needs. McCully had been wondering whether transplanting healthy mitochondria into injured hearts might help restore their function.</p>
<p>The pig’s heart was graying rapidly, so McCully decided to try it. He loaded a syringe with the extracted mitochondria and injected them directly into the heart. Before his eyes, it began beating normally, returning to its rosy hue.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/mighty-mitochondria-cell-powerhouses-harnessed-for-healing/">Read full article</a></p>
