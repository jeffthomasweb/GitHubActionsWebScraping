                            <![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/us/chatbot-god.html">reported</a> that tens of millions of people are confessing secrets to AI chatbots trained on religious texts, with apps like <a href="https://thebiblechat.com/">Bible Chat</a> reaching over 30 million downloads and Catholic app <a href="https://hallow.com/">Hallow</a> briefly topping Netflix, Instagram, and TikTok in Apple's App Store. In China, people are using DeepSeek to try to decode their fortunes. In her report, Lauren Jackson examined "faith tech" apps that cost users up to $70 annually, with some platforms claiming to channel divine communication directly.</p>
<p>Some of the apps address what creators describe as an accessibility problem. "You don't want to disturb your pastor at three in the morning," Krista Rogers, a 61-year-old Ohio resident, told the Times about using the <a href="https://www.youversion.com/the-bible-app/">YouVersion Bible app</a> and ChatGPT for spiritual questions.</p>
<p>The report also examines platforms that go beyond simple scriptural guidance. While a service like <a href="https://www.chatwithgod.ai/">ChatwithGod</a> operates as a "spiritual advisor," its conversational nature is convincing enough that users often question whether they are speaking directly with a divine being. As its chief executive told the Times, the most frequent question from users is, "Is this actually God I am talking to?"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/millions-turn-to-ai-chatbots-for-spiritual-guidance-and-confession/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The first flight of Northrop's upgraded Cygnus spacecraft, called Cygnus XL, is on its way to the international research lab after launching Sunday evening from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. This mission, known as NG-23, is set to arrive at the ISS early Wednesday with 10,827 pounds (4,911 kilograms) of cargo to sustain the lab and its seven-person crew.</p>
<p>By a sizable margin, this is the heaviest cargo load transported to the ISS by a commercial resupply mission. NASA astronaut Jonny Kim will use the space station's Canadian-built robotic arm to capture the cargo ship on Wednesday, then place it on an attachment port for crew members to open hatches and start unpacking the goodies inside.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/northrop-grummans-new-spacecraft-is-a-real-chonker/">Read full article</a></p>

Kennedy Jr. has appointed <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html">five more people</a> to the federal advisory committee that sets national vaccination recommendations. Like the existing members, the new appointees have questionable qualifications for being on the panel, and many have expressed anti-vaccine views.</p>
<p>In June, Kennedy purged all 17 highly qualified and thoroughly vetted members of the committee, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on setting vaccine policy. Kennedy quickly repopulated ACIP with seven hand-picked allies, most of whom also have questionable qualifications and have expressed anti-vaccine or contrarian public health views. Two members, including the new chair, have also been <a href="https://www.biospace.com/fda/two-of-kennedys-new-acip-picks-were-paid-expert-witnesses-in-merck-vaccine-cases">paid to testify against the vaccine makers</a> in cases claiming they caused harms, a clear conflict of interest.</p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The companies seeking to build larger AI models have been increasingly stymied by a lack of high-quality training data. As tech firms scour the web for more data to feed their models, they could increasingly rely on potentially sensitive user data. A team at Google Research is exploring new techniques to make the resulting large language models (LLMs) less likely to "memorize" any of that content.</p>
<p>LLMs have non-deterministic outputs, meaning you can't exactly predict what they'll say. While the output varies even for identical inputs, models do sometimes regurgitate something from their training data—if trained with personal data, the output could be a violation of user privacy. In the event copyrighted data makes it into training data (either accidentally or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-rejects-metas-claim-that-torrenting-is-irrelevant-in-ai-copyright-case/">on purpose</a>), its appearance in outputs can cause a different kind of headache for devs. Differential privacy can prevent such memorization by introducing calibrated noise during the training phase.</p>
<p>Adding differential privacy to a model comes with drawbacks in terms of accuracy and compute requirements. No one has bothered to figure out the degree to which that alters the scaling laws of AI models until now. The team worked from the assumption that model performance would be primarily affected by the noise-batch ratio, which compares the volume of randomized noise to the size of the original training data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/google-releases-vaultgemma-its-first-privacy-preserving-llm/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A settlement has been reached in a lawsuit where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/record-labels-sue-internet-archive-for-digitizing-obsolete-vintage-records/">music publishers sued the Internet Archive</a> over the Great 78 Project, an effort to preserve early music recordings that only exist on brittle shellac records.</p>
<p>No details of the settlement have so far been released, but a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/UMG-v-Internet-Archive-Joint-Notice-of-Settlement-9-15-25.pdf">court filing</a> on Monday confirmed that the Internet Archive and UMG Recordings, Capitol Records, Sony Music Entertainment, and other record labels "have settled this matter." More details may come in the next 45 days, when parties must submit filings to officially dismiss the lawsuit, but it's unlikely the settlement amount will be publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>Days before the settlement was announced, record labels had indicated that everyone but the Internet Archive and its founder, Brewster Kahle, had agreed to sign a joint settlement, seemingly including the Great 78 Project's recording engineer George Blood, who was also a target of the litigation. But in the days since, IA has gotten on board, posting a <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/09/15/an-update-on-the-great-78s-lawsuit/">blog</a> confirming that "the parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/internet-archives-big-battle-with-music-publishers-ends-in-settlement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As someone who writes about the AI industry relatively frequently for this site, there is one question that I find myself constantly asking and being asked in turn, in some form or another: What do you actually use large language models for?</p>
<p>Today, OpenAI's Economic Research Team went a long way toward answering that question, on a population level, releasing <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34255">a first-of-its-kind National Bureau of Economic Research working paper</a> (in association with Harvard economist David Denning) detailing how people end up using ChatGPT across time and tasks. While other research has sought to estimate this kind of usage data using self-reported surveys, this is the first such paper with direct access to OpenAI's internal user data. As such, it gives us an unprecedented direct window into reliable usage stats for what is still the most popular application of LLMs by far.</p>
<p>After digging through the dense 65-page paper, here are seven of the most interesting and/or surprising things we discovered about how people are using OpenAI today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/seven-things-we-learned-from-openais-first-study-on-chatgpt-usage/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Ars spoke with the Consumer Technology Association's vice president of international trade, Ed Brzytwa, to check in and see how tech firms have navigated Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff regimes so far.</p>
<p>Brzytwa has led CTA's research helping tech firms prepare for Trump's trade war, but during our talk, he confirmed that "the reality has been a lot more difficult and far worse, because of not just the height of the tariffs, but the variability, the tariffs on, tariffs off."</p>

<p>Currently, every tech company is in a "slightly different position," depending on its specific supply chains, he explained. However, until semiconductor tariffs are announced, "it's impossible" for any tech company to make the kind of long-term plans that could help keep consumer prices low as Trump's negotiations with foreign partners and investigations into various products drag on, Brzytwa said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/ars-live-cta-policy-expert-explains-why-tariff-stacking-is-a-nightmare/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday proposed fines of $3.1 million against Boeing for various safety violations related to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/four-bolts-were-missing-from-boeing-737-before-door-plug-blew-off-ntsb-says/">January 2024 door plug blowout</a> and what the FAA called "interference with safety officials' independence."</p>
<p>An FAA <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-proposes-31-million-fines-against-boeing">statement</a> said the proposed fine covers "safety violations that occurred from September 2023 through February 2024," and is the "maximum statutory civil penalty authority consistent with law." Boeing, which <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/2Q25-Press-Release.pdf">reported</a> $22.7 billion in revenue and a net loss of $612 million last quarter, has 30 days to file a response with the agency.</p>
<p>"The FAA identified hundreds of quality system violations at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, and Boeing subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems' 737 factory in Wichita, Kansas. Additionally, Boeing presented two unairworthy aircraft to the FAA for airworthiness certificates and failed to follow its quality system," the FAA said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/boeing-faces-3-1m-fine-for-door-plug-blowout-hundreds-of-safety-violations/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The last time Apple gave macOS a fresh design was in 2020's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/macos-11-0-big-sur-the-ars-technica-review/">macOS 11 Big Sur</a>.</p>
<p>That release was relatively light on new features and heavy on symbolism. Big Sur is also when Apple finally jettisoned the "10" in Mac OS X after two decades. More importantly, it was the first release installed on then-new Apple Silicon Macs, the culmination of a decade-plus of in-house chip design that began with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A4">single-core, low-power iPhone and iPad chips</a> and culminated in something <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/this-is-the-new-apple-silicon-mac-pro/">powerful enough for the Mac Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Today's macOS 26 Tahoe release holds up a translucent, glassy mirror to the Big Sur update. It comes with an all-new look, one that further unifies Apple's design language across all its operating systems. And it even throws out the old version numbering system and introduces a new one.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/macos-26-tahoe-the-ars-technica-review/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4KdFr5-21E?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>The blockbuster success of the 1986 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun"><em>Top Gun</em></a>—chronicling the paths of young naval aviators as they go through the grueling US Navy's <a title="United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_Strike_Fighter_Tactics_Instructor_program">Fighter Weapons School</a> (aka the titular Top Gun)—spawned more than just a successful multimedia franchise. It has also been credited with inspiring future generations of fighter pilots. National Geographic takes viewers behind the scenes to see the process play out for real, with its new documentary series, <em>Top Guns: The Next Generation</em>.</p>
<p>Each episode focuses on a specific aspect of the training, following a handful of students from the Navy and Marines through the highs and lows of their training. That includes practicing dive bombs at break-neck speeds; successfully landing on an aircraft carrier by "catching the wire"; learning the most effective offensive and defensive maneuvers in dogfighting; and, finally, engaging in a freestyle dogfight against a seasoned instructor to complete the program and (hopefully) earn their golden wings. NatGeo was granted unprecedented access, even using in-cockpit cameras to capture the pulse-pounding action of being in the air, as well as capturing behind-the-scenes candid moments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">How does reality stack up against its famous Hollywood depiction? "I think there is a lot of similarity," Capt. Juston "Poker" Kuch, who oversees all training and operations at NAS Meridian, told Ars. "The execution portion of the mission gets focused in the movie so it is all about the flight and the dogfighting and dropping the bombs. What they don't see is the countless hours of preparation that go into the mission, all the years and years of training that it took to get there. You see the battle scenes in <em>Top Gun</em> and you're inspired, but there's a lot of time and effort that goes in to get an individual to that point. It doesn't make for good movies, I guess."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/get-into-the-cockpit-as-new-crop-of-top-gun-pilots-get-their-wings/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Once again, the Trump administration is hyping a deal that could see TikTok finally sold to US owners to avoid a nationwide ban that Congress <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/supreme-court-rules-tiktok-can-be-banned/">successfully argued</a> was otherwise necessary to protect national security.</p>
<p>On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the US and China had ironed out a "framework" for the deal, but ultimately, Donald Trump will be responsible for closing the deal on a call this Friday with China's president, Xi Jinping, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/trump-tiktok-china.html">reported</a>. Critically, Bessent said that the framework pointed to a "switch to US-controlled ownership," the South China Morning Post (SCMP) <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3325628/trump-teases-possible-deal-tiktok-plans-call-xi">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Presumably, TikTok won't shut down ahead of Trump's call with Xi, but TikTok risked going dark as soon as Wednesday. That's the latest deadline for the forced sale after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trump-suggests-he-needs-china-to-sign-off-on-tiktok-sale-delays-deal-again/">Trump extended the deadline three times</a> as negotiations with China remained tense.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/will-tiktok-go-dark-wednesday-trump-claims-deal-with-china-avoids-shutdown/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>General Motors will temporarily lay off workers at its Wentzville assembly plant in Missouri. <a href="https://uawlocal2250.net/live/index.php/2025/09/12/layoff-notice/">According to a letter</a> sent to employees by the head of the plant and the head of the local union, a shortage of parts is the culprit, and as a result, the factory will see "a temporary layoff from September 29–October 19." The plant is about 45 minutes west of St. Louis and employs more than 4,000 people to assemble midsize pickup trucks for Chevrolet and GMC, as well as full-size vans.</p>
<p>Not every employee will be laid off—"skilled trades, stamping, body shop, final process and those groups that support these departments" may still have work.</p>
<h2>Government policies</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, GM revealed plans to reduce the number of electric vehicles it builds, despite having a bumper month in August that saw it sell very nearly twice as many EVs as Ford. In that case, it blamed weak demand for electric vehicles, no doubt forecasting what the end of the IRS clean vehicle tax credit will do to the market.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/parts-shortage-is-the-latest-problem-to-hit-general-motors-production/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In the wake of the 2003 loss of the space shuttle <em>Columbia</em> and its STS-107 crew, NASA created a program to use the orbiter's debris for research and education at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Agency employees were invited to see what remained of the space shuttle as a powerful reminder as to why they had to be diligent in their work. Access to the Columbia Research and Preservation Office, though, was limited as a result of its location and related logistics.</p>
<p>To address that and open up the experience to more of the workforce at Kennedy, the agency has quietly begun work to establish a new facility.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/nasa-seeks-to-expand-employee-access-to-space-shuttle-tragedy-artifacts/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="bolded">n May, </span>President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors and the development of nuclear energy technology; the orders aim to cut red tape, ease approval processes, and reshape the role of the main regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.”</p>
<p>Self-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/nuclear-energy">nuclear fission</a>, in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/trump-aims-for-400-gw-of-nuclear-by-2050-10-large-reactors-under-construct/749107/">400 gigawatts</a> by 2050. To help achieve that goal, scientific institutions like the Idaho National Laboratory, a leading research institute in nuclear energy, are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel. Companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs, a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector. For example, Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based nuclear power company, plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/the-us-is-trying-to-kick-start-a-nuclear-energy-renaissance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Six decades have now passed since some of the most iconic Project Gemini spaceflights. The 60th anniversary of Gemini 4, when Ed White conducted the first US spacewalk, came in June. The next mission, Gemini 5, ended just two weeks ago, in 1965. These missions are now forgotten by most Americans, as most of the people alive during that time are now deceased.</p>
<p>However, during these early years of spaceflight, NASA engineers and astronauts cut their teeth on a variety of spaceflight firsts, flying a series of harrowing missions during which it seems a miracle that no one died.</p>
<p>Because the Gemini missions, as well as NASA's first human spaceflight program Mercury, yielded such amazing stories, I was thrilled to realize that a new book has recently been published—<em><a href="https://www.apolloremastered.com/gemini-and-mercury-remastered">Gemini &amp; Mercury Remastered</a></em>—that brings them back to life in vivid color.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/60-years-after-gemini-newly-processed-images-reveal-incredible-details/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This year's budget expires at the end of this month, and Congress must act before October 1 to avert a government shutdown. If Congress passes a budget before then, it will most likely be in the form of a continuing resolution, an extension of this year's funding levels into the first few weeks or months of fiscal year 2026.</p>
<p>The White House's budget request for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 25 percent cut to NASA's overall budget, and a nearly 50 percent reduction in funding for the agency's Science Mission Directorate. These cuts would cut off money for at least 41 missions, including 19 already in space and many more far along in development.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/scientists-its-do-or-die-time-for-americas-primacy-exploring-the-solar-system/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Under ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr, federal health officials are working to link COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to the deaths of 25 children, and may further restrict access to the shots, possibly recommending them for people aged 75 and up, instead of 65 and up, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/12/covid-vaccine-child-death-cdc/">according to The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Four unnamed sources close to the situation told the Post that Trump administration health officials appear to be using information from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to make the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed children. VAERS is a system in which anyone can report anything they think is an adverse event related to a vaccination. The reports are completely unverified upon submission, and the <span id="_M5PEaKv_DKK40PEP4NbYkAI_25" class="wtBS9">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> staff follow up on serious reports to try to substantiate claims and assess if they were actually caused by a vaccine. They rarely are.</p>
<h2>Vaccine safety</h2>
<p>Federal health experts continuously monitor VAERS and other safety surveillance systems, exhaustively assessing the safety of vaccines. After billions of COVID-19 doses have been administered worldwide, they—like other governments, health organizations, and academic researchers around the world—have found the shots to be remarkably safe. While they have been linked to a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart and surrounding tissue, respectively), that risk is low and the cases are generally mild. During the 2023–2024 COVID-19 season, the incidence rate of heart conditions was 27 cases per million doses for males aged 12 to 24, who have the highest risk of any group. The shots have not been linked to deaths or heart transplants, according to data presented by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/04-Meyer-COVID-508.pdf">staff experts at the CDC</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/covid-shot-access-could-tighten-rfk-jr-may-claim-they-cause-child-deaths/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When software engineer Joshua Fonseca recently <a href="https://joshfonseca.com/blogs/animal-crossing-llm">connected</a> the GameCube simulation classic <em>Animal Crossing</em> to a modern AI language model like the kind that powers ChatGPT, he decided to shake things up. By programming the AI to roleplay as villagers growing aware of their debt situation, and giving them a shared memory to track conversations, Fonseca orchestrated a scenario where the residents began to organize against their raccoon landlord.</p>
<p>In <em>Animal Crossing</em>, Tom Nook runs the town shop and provides home loans (paid out in bells, the in-game currency) that keep players perpetually in debt, which is a core mechanic of the game.</p>
<p>"Predictably, it escalated into an anti-Tom Nook movement," Fonseca <a href="https://joshfonseca.com/blogs/animal-crossing-llm">wrote</a> in a detailed post documenting his hack that bridges a 2002 game to cloud-based AI without modifying any game code. While Fonseca frames the uprising as a type of emergent phenomenon in his post and a YouTube video, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/10/animal-crossing-llm/">examination of the source code</a> by AI researcher Simon Willison shows that Fonseca specifically instructed the villagers to behave this way and even <a href="https://github.com/vuciv/animal-crossing-llm-mod/blob/cc9b6b571da1be062d979d50aa86e2ac1dce7a44/dialogue_prompt.py#L165-L184">escalate</a> the unrest over time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/animal-crossing-mod-uses-ai-to-orchestrate-anti-tom-nook-villager-revolt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While the Trump administration has continued to refer to efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change as a scam, it has done almost nothing to counter the copious scientific evidence that demonstrates that climate change is real and doing real damage to the citizens of the US. The lone exception has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/analysis-the-trump-administrations-assault-on-climate-action/">a draft Department of Energy report</a> prepared by a handful of carefully chosen fringe figures that questioned the mainstream understanding of climate change. The shoddy work and questionable conclusions of that report were so extensive that an analysis of it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/mockery-of-science-climate-scientists-tear-into-new-us-climate-report/">required over 450 pages</a> to detail all of its shortcomings.</p>
<p>But its shortcomings may not have been limited to the science, as a lawsuit alleges that its preparation violated a law that regulates the activities of federal advisory panels. Now, in an attempt to avoid dealing with that lawsuit, the Department of Energy is claiming that it dissolved the committee that prepared the report, making the lawsuit moot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Congress is also attempting to muddy the waters. In response to the DOE report, the National Academies of Science announced that it would prepare a report describing the current state of climate science. Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight have responded by announcing an investigation of the National Academies "for undermining the EPA."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/department-of-energy-gets-rid-of-climate-skeptics-group-to-dodge-lawsuit/">Read full article</a></p>
