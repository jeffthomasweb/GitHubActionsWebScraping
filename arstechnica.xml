<p>Since the beginning of the year, landowners have discovered several pieces of space junk traced to missions supporting the International Space Station. On all of these occasions, engineers expected none of the disposable hardware would survive the scorching heat of reentry and make it to Earth's surface.</p>
<p>These incidents highlight an urgency for more research into what happens when a spacecraft makes an uncontrolled reentry into the atmosphere, according to engineers from the Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research center based in El Segundo, California. More stuff is getting launched into space than ever before, and the trend will continue as companies deploy more satellite constellations and field heavier rockets.</p>
<p>"The biggest immediate need now is just to do some more work to really understand this whole process and to be in a position to be ready to accommodate new materials, new operational approaches as they happen more quickly," said Marlon Sorge, executive director of Aerospace's Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies. "Clearly, that’s the direction that spaceflight is going.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033944#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033944&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>NASA and Boeing officials pushed back Friday on headlines that the commercial Starliner crew capsule is stranded at the International Space Station but said they need more time to analyze data before formally clearing the spacecraft for undocking and reentry.</p>
<p>Two NASA astronauts, commander Butch Wilmore and pilot Suni Williams, will spend at least a few more weeks on the space station as engineers on the ground conduct thruster tests to better understand issues with the Starliner propulsion system in orbit. Wilmore and Williams launched June 5 aboard an Atlas V rocket and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-drama-filled-day-boeings-starliner-finally-finds-its-way/">docked at the station the next day</a>, completing the first segment of Starliner's first test flight with astronauts.</p>
<p>NASA managers originally planned for the Starliner spacecraft to remain docked at the space station for at least eight days, although they left open the possibility of a mission extension. The test flight is now likely to last at least a month and a half, and perhaps longer, as engineers wrestle with helium leaks and thruster glitches on Starliner's service module.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034431#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034431&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple's Vision Pro headset went on sale outside the United States for the first time today, in the first of two waves of expanded availability.</p>
<p>The $3,499 "spatial computing" device launched back in February in the US, but it hasn't taken the tech world by storm. Part of that has been its regional launch, with some of the biggest markets still lacking access.</p>
<p>Apple announced that the product would be sold internationally during its keynote at the Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034503#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034503&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Since the rise of large language models like ChatGPT there have been lots of anecdotal reports about students submitting AI-generated work as their exam assignments and getting good grades. So, we stress-tested our university’s examination system against AI cheating in a controlled experiment,” says Peter Scarfe, a researcher at the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at the University of Reading.</p>
<p>His team created over 30 fake psychology student accounts and used them to submit ChatGPT-4-produced answers to examination questions. The anecdotal reports were true—the AI use went largely undetected, and, on average, ChatGPT scored better than human students.</p>
<h2>Rules of engagement</h2>
<p>Scarfe’s team submitted AI-generated work in five undergraduate modules, covering classes needed during all three years of study for a bachelor’s degree in psychology. The assignments were either 200-word answers to short questions or more elaborate essays, roughly 1,500 words long. “The markers of the exams didn’t know about the experiment. In a way, participants in the study didn’t know they were participating in the study, but we’ve got necessary permissions to go ahead with that”, Scarfe claims.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034465#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034465&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>After weeks of reports of severe illnesses across the country, the maker of Diamond Shruumz microdosing chocolates, gummies, and candy cones has <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/prophet-premium-blends-recalls-diamond-shruumz-products-because-possible-health-risk">finally issued a recall</a>. It covers all lots and all flavors of all the brand's products.</p>
<p>The illnesses have been marked by several severe symptoms, which notably include seizures, loss of consciousness, and the need for intubation and intensive care. To date, there have been 39 people sickened, including 23 hospitalizations across 20 states, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">according to the Food and Drug Administration</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/environmental-health-studies/outbreak-investigation-diamond-shruumz-products/index.html#cdc_generic_section_1-outbreak-investigation-summary">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The FDA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/people-are-seizing-being-intubated-after-eating-microdose-chocolates/">first issued a warning</a> on the brand's chocolate bars on June 7, when there were reports of eight cases, including six hospitalizations, in four states.</p>
<p>Diamond Shruumz's parent company, Prophet Premium Blends, said in the recall notice that it had received only two complaints about the products to date and, upon receiving those complaints, reviewed recent laboratory analyses (Certificates of Analysis) of its products. According to the company, those CoAs noted "higher than normal amounts of muscimol," which is one of two key compounds found in hallucinogenic <em>Amanita </em>mushrooms. Muscimol "could be a potential cause of symptoms consistent with those observed in persons who became ill after eating Diamond Shruumz products," the company said in the recall notice.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034470#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034470&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Internet Archive (IA) went before a three-judge panel Friday to defend its open library's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/06/internet-archive-backs-up-digital-books-on-paper/">controlled digital lending (CDL) practices</a> after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/publishers-beat-internet-archive-as-judge-rules-e-book-lending-violates-copyright/">book publishers last year won a lawsuit</a> claiming that the archive's lending violated copyright law.</p>
<p>In the weeks ahead of IA's efforts to appeal that ruling, IA was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/internet-archive-forced-to-remove-500000-books-after-publishers-court-win/">forced to remove 500,000 books from its collection</a>, shocking users. In an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/let-readers-read-an-open-letter-to-the-publishers-in-hachette-v-internet-archive">open letter</a> to publishers, more than 30,000 readers, researchers, and authors begged for access to the books to be restored in the open library, claiming the takedowns dealt "a serious blow to lower-income families, people with disabilities, rural communities, and LGBTQ+ people, among many others," who may not have access to a local library or feel "safe accessing the information they need in public."</p>
<p>During a press briefing following arguments in court Friday, IA founder Brewster Kahle said that "those voices weren't being heard." Judges appeared primarily focused on understanding how IA's digital lending potentially hurts publishers' profits in the ebook licensing market, rather than on how publishers' costly ebook licensing potentially harms readers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034435#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034435&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a shocking announcement this week, the European intergovernmental organization responsible for launching and operating the continent's weather satellites has pulled its next mission off a future launch of Europe's new Ariane 6 rocket. Instead, the valuable MTG-S1 satellite will now reach geostationary orbit on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket in 2025.</p>
<p>“This decision was driven by exceptional circumstances” <a href="https://www.eumetsat.int/meteosat-satellite-be-launched-spacex">said</a> Phil Evans, director general of the organization Eumetsat. “It does not compromise our standard policy of supporting European partners, and we look forward to a successful SpaceX launch for this masterpiece of European technology.”</p>
<p>The decision, taken at a council meeting of Eumetsat's 30 member nations on Wednesday and Thursday, comes less than two weeks before the debut of the Ariane 6 rocket, scheduled for July 9.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034369#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034369&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the most striking things about the explosion of renewable power that's happening in the US is that much of it is going on in states governed by politicians who don't believe in the problem wind and solar are meant to address. Acceptance of the evidence for climate change tends to be lowest among Republicans, yet many of the states where renewable power has boomed—wind in Wyoming and Iowa, solar in Texas—are governed by Republicans.</p>
<p>That's partly because, up until about 2020, there was a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of expanding wind and solar power, with support above 75 percent among both parties. Since then, however, support among Republicans has dropped dramatically, approaching 50 percent, according to polling data released this week.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img alt="Renewables enjoyed solid Republican support until recently." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-3.png"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Renewables enjoyed solid Republican support until recently.

<p>To a certain extent, none of this should be surprising. The current leader of the Republican Party has been saying that wind turbines <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/04/trumps-faulty-wind-power-claims/">cause cancer</a> and offshore wind is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66928305">killing whales</a>.

<p>The US Supreme Court today overturned the 40-year-old <em>Chevron</em> precedent in a ruling that limits the regulatory authority of federal agencies. The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf">6-3 decision</a> in <em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em> will make it harder for agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations without explicit authorization from Congress.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the opinion of the court and was joined by Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Justice Elena Kagan filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>
<p><em>Chevron</em> gave agencies leeway to interpret ambiguous laws as long as the agency's conclusion was reasonable. But the Roberts court said that a "statutory ambiguity does not necessarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency, as opposed to a court, resolve the resulting interpretive question."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034370#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034370&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brussels is preparing for an antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s $13 billion investment into OpenAI, after the European Union decided not to proceed with a merger review into the most powerful alliance in the artificial intelligence industry.</p>
<p>The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, began to explore a review under merger control rules in January, but on Friday announced that it would not proceed due to a lack of evidence that Microsoft controls OpenAI.</p>
<p>However, the commission said it was now exploring the possibility of a traditional antitrust investigation into whether the tie-up between the world’s most valuable listed company and the best-funded AI start-up was harming competition in the fast-growing market.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034368#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034368&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In what may be the biological equivalent to getting struck by lightning, a very unlucky man in the Philadelphia area took a very rare bee sting directly to the eyeball—and things went badly from there.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the 55-year-old went to the emergency department, where doctors tried to extract the injurious insect's stinger from the man's right eye. But it soon became apparent that they didn't get it all.</p>
<p>Two days after the bee attack, the man went to the Wills Eye Hospital with worsening vision and pain in the pierced eye. At that point, the vision in his right eye had deteriorated to only being able to count fingers. The eye was swollen, inflamed, and bloodshot. Blood was visibly pooling at the bottom of his iris. And right at the border between the man's cornea and the white of his eye, ophthalmologists spotted the problem: a teeny spear-like fragment of the bee's stinger still stuck in place.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034341#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034341&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's safe to say that Marvel Studios' <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> is one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the summer. We've had a teaser and full trailer, and now the studio has released a second one-minute trailer with a surprise appearance bound to delight <em>X-Men</em> fans everywhere. It's none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabretooth_(character)">Sabretooth</a>, played by the same actor, Tyler Mane, who portrayed the character in 2000's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film)"><em>X-Men</em></a>. And he's got a score to settle with Wolverine.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/trailer-for-deadpool-and-wolverine-is-filled-with-fun-slo-mo-action-f-bombs/">previously reported</a>, Ryan Reynolds found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/wade-wilson-joins-the-mcu-in-deadpool-and-wolverine-super-bowl-teaser/">the perfect fit</a> with 2016's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(film)"><em>Deadpool</em></a>, starring as Wade Wilson, a former Canadian special forces operative (dishonorably discharged) who develops regenerative healing powers that heal his cancer but leave him permanently disfigured with scars all over his body. Wade decides to become a masked vigilante, turning down an invitation to join the X-Men and abandon his bad-boy ways. The first <em>Deadpool</em> was a big hit, racking up $782 million at the global box office, critical praise, and a couple of Golden Globe nominations for good measure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2"><em>Deadpool 2</em></a> was released in 2018 and was just as successful.</p>
<p><em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> reunites Reynolds with many familiar faces from the first two films. Morena Baccarin is back as Wade's girlfriend Vanessa, along with Leslie Uggams as Blind Al; Karan Soni as Wade's personal chauffeur, taxi driver Dopinder; Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead; Stefan Kapičić as the voice of Colossus; Shioli Kutsuna as Negasonic's mutant girlfriend, Yukio; Randal Reeder as Buck; and Lewis Tan as X-Force member Shatterstar.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034308#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034308&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00335-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666386424003357%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#">new study</a>, researchers from the University of Tokyo, Harvard University, and the International Research Center for Neurointelligence have unveiled a technique for creating lifelike robotic skin using living human cells. As a proof of concept, the team engineered a small robotic face capable of smiling, covered entirely with a layer of pink living tissue.</p>

<p>The researchers note that using living skin tissue as a robot covering has benefits, as it's flexible enough to convey emotions and can potentially repair itself. "As the role of robots continues to evolve, the materials used to cover social robots need to exhibit lifelike functions, such as self-healing," wrote the researchers in the study.</p>
<p>Shoji Takeuchi, Michio Kawai, Minghao Nie, and Haruka Oda authored the study, titled "<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00335-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666386424003357%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#">Perforation-type anchors inspired by skin ligament for robotic face covered with living skin</a>," which is due for July publication in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/home">Cell Reports Physical Science</a>.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Most readers probably did not anticipate seeing a Tour de France preview on Ars Technica, but here we are. Cycling is a huge passion of mine and several other staffers, and this year, a ton of intrigue surrounds the race, which has a <a href="https://inrng.com/2024/06/tour-de-france-2024-stage-profiles/">fantastic route</a>. So we're here to spread Tour fever.</p>
<p>The three-week race starts Saturday, paradoxically in the Italian region of Tuscany. Usually, there is a dominant rider, or at most two, and a clear sense of who is likely to win the demanding race. But this year, due to rider schedules, a terrible crash in early April, and new contenders, there is more uncertainty than usual. A solid case could be made for at least four riders to win this year's Tour de France.</p>
<p>For people who aren't fans of pro road cycling—which has to be at least 99 percent of the United States—there's a great series on Netflix called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdNosghI3UI"><em>Unchained</em></a> to help get you up to speed. The second season, just released, covers last year's Tour de France and introduces you to most of the protagonists in the forthcoming edition. If this article sparks your interest, I recommend checking it out.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033276#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033276&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.50 of the Rocket Report! SpaceX launched its 10th Falcon Heavy rocket this week with the GOES-U weather satellite for NOAA, and this one was a beauty. The late afternoon timing of the launch and atmospheric conditions made for great photography. Falcon Heavy has become a trusted rocket for the US government, and its next flight in October will deploy NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft on the way to explore one of Jupiter's enigmatic icy moons.</p>

<p><b>Sir Peter Beck dishes on launch business. </b><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/sir-peter-beck-unplugged-transporter-can-do-it-for-free-for-all-we-care/">Ars spoke with the recently knighted Peter Beck</a>, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, on where his scrappy company fits in a global launch marketplace dominated by SpaceX. Rocket Lab racked up the third-most number of orbital launches by any US launch company (it's headquartered in California but primarily assembles and launches rockets in New Zealand). SpaceX's rideshare launch business with the Falcon 9 rocket is putting immense pressure on small launch companies like Rocket Lab. However, Beck argues his Electron rocket is a bespoke solution for customers desiring to put their satellite in a specific place at a specific time, a luxury they can't count on with a SpaceX rideshare.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034138#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034138&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/judge-tosses-big-pharma-suit-claiming-drug-price-negotiation-is-unconstitutional/">a series of decisive court losses</a>, the pharmaceutical industry appears to be taking its fight against Medicare drug price negotiations directly to the people—and the White House is not impressed.</p>
<p>This week, the high-powered industry group PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America) released two eye-catching attacks on federal efforts to lower America's singularly astronomical drug prices. In <a href="https://phrma.org/resource-center/Topics/Access-to-Medicines/New-Analysis-The-IRA-Could-Lead-to-Higher-Out-of-Pocket-Costs-for-3-point-5-Million-Medicare-Patients">a press release Tuesday</a>, PhRMA announced an analysis suggesting that the Medicare drug price negotiations—part of the Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act—could actually cost some seniors and people with disabilities slightly more in out-of-pocket costs. <a href="https://www.milliman.com/en/insight/ira-mdpnp-impact-on-beneficiary-oop">The analysis</a>, however, relies on a key—and questionable—assumption that the federal government will set price limits using the highest possible estimate for maximum fair prices in 2026.</p>
<p>Milliman, the consulting firm PhRMA commissioned to do the study, cautioned that the actual prices "will certainly vary due to differences in unit cost and utilization trend, 2026 benefit designs, and actual 2026 maximum fair prices."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034140#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034140&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, a slim majority of the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23a349_0813.pdf">issued an emergency ruling</a> that places a stay on rules developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, meant to limit the spread of ozone-generating pollutants across state lines. Because it was handled on an emergency basis, the decision was made without any evidence gathered during lower court proceedings. As a result, the justices don't even agree on the nature of the regulations the EPA has proposed, leading to a blistering dissent from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was joined by the court's three liberal justices.</p>
<h2>Bad neighbors</h2>
<p>The rule at issue arose from the EPA's regular process of revisiting existing limits in light of changes in public health information and pollution-control technology. In this case, the focus was on ozone-producing chemicals; in 2015, the EPA chose to lower the limit on ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion.</p>
<p>Once these standards are set, states are required to submit plans that fulfill two purposes. One is to limit pollution within the state itself; the second involves pollution controls that will limit the exposure in states that are downwind of the pollution sources. The EPA is required to evaluate these plans; if they are deemed insufficient, the EPA can require the states to follow a federal plan devised by the EPA.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034143#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034143&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, OpenAI researchers unveiled <a href="https://openai.com/index/finding-gpt4s-mistakes-with-gpt-4/">CriticGPT</a>, a new AI model designed to identify mistakes in code generated by ChatGPT. It aims to enhance the process of making AI systems behave in ways humans want (called "alignment") through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback">Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</a> (RLHF), which helps human reviewers make large language model (LLM) outputs more accurate.</p>

<p>As outlined in a new research paper called "<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/llm-critics-help-catch-llm-bugs-paper.pdf">LLM Critics Help Catch LLM Bugs</a>," OpenAI created CriticGPT to act as an AI assistant to human trainers who review programming code generated by the ChatGPT AI assistant. CriticGPT—based on the GPT-4 family of LLMS—analyzes the code and points out potential errors, making it easier for humans to spot mistakes that might otherwise go unnoticed. The researchers trained CriticGPT on a dataset of code samples with intentionally inserted bugs, teaching it to recognize and flag various coding errors.</p>
<div class="font-claude-message pr-4 md:pr-9 relative leading-[1.65rem] [&amp;_pre&gt;div]:bg-bg-300 [&amp;_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&amp;_pre]:-mr-9">
<div>
<div class="grid-col-1 grid gap-2.5 [&amp;_&gt;_*]:min-w-0">
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The researchers found that CriticGPT's critiques were preferred by annotators over human critiques in 63 percent of cases involving naturally occurring LLM errors and that human-machine teams using CriticGPT wrote more comprehensive critiques than humans alone while reducing confabulation (hallucination) rates compared to AI-only critiques.</p>
<h2>Developing an automated critic</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The development of CriticGPT involved training the model on a large number of inputs containing deliberately inserted mistakes. Human trainers were asked to modify code written by ChatGPT, introducing errors and then providing example feedback as if they had discovered these bugs. This process allowed the model to learn how to identify and critique various types of coding errors.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034089#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034089&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
