<p>HOUSTON—While it doesn't have the same relevance to public consciousness as safety problems with commercial airliners, a successful test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in May would be welcome news for the beleaguered aerospace company.</p>
<p>This will be the first time the Starliner capsule flies into low-Earth orbit with humans aboard. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are in the final stages of training for the so-called Crew Flight Test (CFT), a milestone running seven years behind the schedule Boeing said it could achieve when it won a $4.2 billion commercial crew contract from NASA a decade ago.</p>
<p>If schedules hold, Wilmore and Williams will take off inside Boeing's Starliner spacecraft aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket after midnight May 1, local time, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. They will fly Starliner to the International Space Station for a stay of at least eight days, then return the capsule to a parachute-assisted, airbag-cushioned landing in the western United States, likely at White Sands, New Mexico.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012455#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012455&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>American workers who have more flexibility and security in their jobs also have better mental health, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816735">a study of 2021 survey data</a> from over 18,000 nationally representative working Americans.</p>
<p>The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, may not be surprising to those who have faced return-to-office mandates and rounds of layoffs amid the pandemic. But, it offers clear data on just how important job flexibility and security are to the health and well-being of workers.</p>
<p>For the study, job flexibility was assessed in terms of ease of adjusting work schedules, advance notice of scheduling changes, and whether schedules were changed by employers often. People who reported greater flexibility in their job had 26 percent lower odds of serious psychological distress, which was measured on a validated, widely used questionnaire that assesses depression, nervousness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, among other forms of distress. Greater job flexibility was also linked to 13 percent lower odds of experiencing daily anxiety, 11 percent lower odds of experiencing weekly anxiety, and 9 percent lower odds of experiencing anxiety a few times a year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012543#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012543&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            This is one of the Panasonic Avionics Astrova in-flight entertainment systems, set to debut in Icelandair, Qantus, and United Airlines flights in the next couple of years.                          [credit:

<p>Flying on commercial airlines today might be a lot more of a pain than it used to be, but new tech is going to bring some improvement to one part of the experience—in-flight entertainment. Panasonic Avionics' brand <a href="https://www.panasonic.aero/our-offerings/systems/astrova/">Astrova</a> in-flight entertainment systems are starting to roll out on commercial flights on certain airlines, promising 4K HDR TVs and other features to the backs of seats that should be a huge upgrade over the abysmal screens we normally watch in-flight movies on.</p>
<p>Look at most commercial airlines today, and you'll find a tiny, terrible LCD TV embedded in the seat in front of you. These HD, standard dynamic range screens have terrible contrast and poor viewing angles, and they aren't bright enough to achieve a good viewing experience when the overhead lights are on.</p>
<p>They're bad enough that I always bring my own hardware for flights—most recently, I took three flights with Apple's Vision Pro headset, which I plan to write about later this week. But most people just bring a tablet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012437#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012437&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Justice Department on Monday unsealed an indictment charging seven men with hacking or attempting to hack dozens of US companies in a 14-year campaign furthering an economic espionage and foreign intelligence gathering by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>All seven defendants, federal prosecutors alleged, were associated with Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd. a front company created by the Hubei State Security Department, an outpost of the Ministry of State Security located in Wuhan province. The MSS, in turn, has funded an advanced persistent threat group tracked under names including APT31, Zirconium Violet Typhoon, Judgment Panda, and Altaire.</p>
<h2>Relentless 14-year campaign</h2>
<p>“Since at least 2010, the defendants … engaged in computer network intrusion activity on behalf of the HSSD targeting numerous US government officials, various US economic and defense industries and a variety of private industry officials, foreign democracy activists, academics and parliamentarians in response to geopolitical events affecting the PRC,” federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1345141/dl?inline">alleged</a>. “These computer network intrusion activities resulted in the confirmed and potential compromise of work and personal email accounts, cloud storage accounts and telephone call records belonging to millions of Americans, including at least some information that could be released in support of malign influence targeting democratic processes and institutions, and economic plans, intellectual property, and trade secrets belonging to American businesses, and contributed to the estimated billions of dollars lost every year as a result of the PRC’s state-sponsored apparatus to transfer US technology to the PRC.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012482#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012482&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://monitor.mozilla.org/">Mozilla's Monitor Plus</a>, a service <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/mozilla-expands-its-privacy-focus-with-monitor-plus-data-broker-removal-service/">launched by the privacy-minded tech firm in February</a>, notes on its pitch page that there is "a $240 billion industry of data brokers selling your private information for profit" and that its offering can "take back your privacy."</p>
<p>Mozilla's most recent move to protect privacy has been to cut out one of the key providers of Monitor Plus' people-search protections, <a href="https://onerep.com/">Onerep</a>. That comes after reporting from security reporter Brian Krebs, who uncovered Onerep CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest as the founder of "dozens of people-search services since 2010," including one, Nuwber, that still sells the very kind of "background reports" that Monitor Plus seeks to curb.</p>
<p>Shelest <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dimitri-Shelest-Letter-_-Comment-on-Krebs-article-3.20.24-1.pdf">told Krebs in a statement</a> (PDF) that he did have an ownership stake in Nuwber, but that Nuwber has "zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep" and that he no longer operates any other people-search sites. Shelest admitted the bad look but said that his experience with people search gave Onerep "the best tech and team in the space."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012417#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012417&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has just released version 14.4.1 for macOS Sonoma, a small-but-significant patch that claims to fix several issues with third-party software and accessories that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/usb-hubs-printers-java-and-more-seemingly-broken-by-macos-14-4-update/">cropped up in the 14.4 update</a>. The 14.4.1 release also includes a pair of security fixes.</p>
<p>Apple’s release notes highlight fixes for three major problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>USB hubs connected to external displays may not be recognized</li>
<li>Copy protected Audio Unit plug-ins designed for professional music apps may not open or pass validation</li>
<li>Apps that include Java may quit unexpectedly</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Users and companies began noticing problems shortly after the macOS 14.4 update was released earlier this month. Reports of broken USB hubs cropped up on Reddit, the Apple Support Communities forums, and elsewhere within the first couple of days, and issues with Java and <a href="https://help.ilok.com/faq_licenses.html#sonoma_14_4_plugins">iLok audio software DRM devices</a> were reported later on. Some users also reported broken printer drivers and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/sonoma-bug-destroys-saved-versions-icloud-drive/">deleted file revisions in iCloud Drive</a>, though Apple's release notes don't mention those problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012440#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012440&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last year Google brought its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-dusts-off-the-failed-google-playbook-to-fight-chatgpt/">new obsession</a> with AI-powered chatbots to Google Search with the launch of the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/google-search-starts-rolling-out-chat-gpt-style-generative-ai-results/">Search Generative Experience,</a>" or "SGE." If you opted in, SGE intercepted your Google search queries and put a giant, screen-filling generative AI chatbot response at the top of your search results. The usual 10 blue links were still there, but you had to scroll past Google's ChatGPT clone to see them. That design choice makes outgoing web links seem like a legacy escape hatch for when the chatbot doesn't work, and Google wants to know why more people haven't opted in to this.</p>
<p>Barry Schwartz at <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-starts-testing-ai-overviews-from-sge-in-main-google-search-interface-438680">Search Engine Land</a> reports that Google is going to start pushing SGE out to some users, even if they haven't opted in to the "Labs experiment." A Google spokesperson told the site SGE will be turned on for a "subset of queries, on a small percentage of search traffic in the US." The report says "Google told us they want to get feedback from searchers who have not opted into SGE specifically. This way they can get feedback and learn how a more general population will find this technology helpful."</p>
<p>Citing his conversation with Google, Schwartz says some users automatically see Chatbot results for queries where Google thinks a chatbot "can be especially helpful." Google will turn on the feature for "queries that are often more complex or involve questions where it may be helpful to get information from a range of web pages—like 'how do I get marks off painted walls.'"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012427#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012427&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A US judge has struck down a lawsuit brought by X against a nonprofit group that researched toxic content on the social media platform, finding the Elon Musk-owned company’s case appeared to be an attempt at “punishing” the group for exercising free speech.</p>
<p>The Center for Countering Digital Hate had sought to dismiss the case from X, which alleged the nonprofit unlawfully accessed and scraped X data for its studies. The CCDH found a rise in hate speech and misinformation on the platform. X had also alleged the group “cherry-picked” from posts on the platform to conduct a “scare campaign” to drive away advertisers, costing it tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>In a stinging ruling, US judge Charles Breyer in California granted the motion. “Sometimes it is unclear what is driving a litigation, and only by reading between the lines of a complaint can one attempt to surmise a plaintiff’s true purpose. Other times, a complaint is so unabashedly and vociferously about one thing that there can be no mistaking that purpose. This case represents the latter circumstance. This case is about punishing the defendants for their speech,” he wrote in the decision.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012453#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012453&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Windows 11 has done a lot to update and modernize long-neglected parts of Windows' user interface, including many Settings menus and venerable apps like Notepad and Paint. But if you dig deep enough, you'll still find parts of the user interface that look and work like they did in the mid-'90s, either for compatibility reasons or because no one ever thought to go back and update them.</p>
<p>Former Microsoft programmer Dave Plummer shared some history about one of those finely aged bits: the Format dialogue box, which is still used in fully updated Windows 11 installs to this day when you format a disk using Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Plummer says he wrote the Format dialog in late 1994, when the team was busy porting the user interface from the consumer-focused Windows 95 (released in mid-1995) to the more-stable but more resource-intensive Windows NT (NT 4.0, released in mid-1996, was the first to use the 95-style UI).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012379#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012379&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last week, the 2004 cult classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind"><em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em></a> marked its 20th anniversary, prompting many people to revisit the surreal sci-fi psychological drama about two ex-lovers who erase their memories of each other—only to find themselves falling in love all over again. <em>Eternal Sunshine</em> was a box office success and earned almost universal praise upon its release. It's still a critical favorite today and remains one of star Jim Carrey's most powerful and emotionally resonant dramatic roles. What better time for a rewatch and in-depth discussion of the film's themes of memory, personal identity, love, and loss?</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the 2004 film below.)</strong></p>
<p>Director Michel Gondry and co-writer Pierre Bismuth first came up with the concept for the film in 1998, based on a conversation Bismuth had with a female friend who, when he asked, said she would absolutely erase her boyfriend from her memory if she could. They brought on Charlie Kaufman to write the script, and the three men went on to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for their efforts. The title alludes to a 1717 poem by Alexander Pope, "<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44892/eloisa-to-abelard">Eloisa to Abelard</a>," based on the tragic love between medieval philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Abelard">Peter Abelard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9lo%C3%AFse">Héloïse d'Argenteuil</a> and their differing perspectives on what happened between them when they exchanged letters later in life. These are the most relevant lines:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011777#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011777&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you enter "how to see the eclipse" into your favorite search engine, you're bound to see thousands—millions?—of helpful guides. Some of these are extremely detailed and thorough, almost as if the author were getting paid by the word or augmented by AI.</p>
<p>In reality, seeing a solar eclipse is just about the easiest thing one can do in one's life. Like, it's difficult to think of anything else that has the greatest reward-lowest effort ratio in life. You just need to know a couple of things. For the sake of simplicity, here is Ars' four-step guide to having a four-star eclipse-viewing experience. Steps are listed in order of ascending importance.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Identify the path of totality. This is where the total solar eclipse will be visible on April 8. The National Solar Observatory <a href="https://nso.edu/for-public/eclipse-map-2024/">has a good map here</a>. Click on the map to get the exact timing. It's time and place sorted.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012372#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012372&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>X used to be called Twitter, but soon it will become "the Everything App," and that day is "closer than everyone thinks," X CEO Linda Yaccarino <a href="https://twitter.com/lindayaX/status/1745614699440533658">promised</a> in one of her first X posts of 2024.</p>
<p>"Nothing can slow us down," Yaccarino said.</p>
<p>Turning Twitter into an everything app is arguably the reason that Elon Musk purchased Twitter. He openly craved the success of the Chinese everything app WeChat, telling Twitter staff soon after purchasing the app that "you basically live on WeChat in China because it’s so usable and helpful to daily life, and I think if we can achieve that, or even get close to that at Twitter, it would be an immense success,” The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jul/29/elon-musk-wechat-twitter-rebranding-everything-app-for-west">reported</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007075#p3">Read 68 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007075&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We're at an interesting crossroads in the high-performance enthusiast car market. Running east to west is the adoption of electric vehicles and a slow reduction in internal combustion engine car production. North to south is the progression of ICE horsepower from the factory over the years, and it's unclear how far it continues from here. Coming in diagonally is the weakening demand for manual transmissions—this is sadly where they end.</p>
<p>In the middle of this intersection is the 2024 BMW M2 six-speed manual, hanging its tail out in a massive controlled drift around the edges, expressing one last hurrah as BMW's final object of internal-combustion M car affection.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to pilot BMW's latest, smallest M car through some of Southern California's most fun mountain roads, plus Willow Springs International Raceway's Streets of Willow circuit. When it comes to quickly figuring out this kind of car's powertrain and chassis, I can't think of a better mix of pavement. Here's what makes the latest—and last—six-speed-manual-equipped M2 generation an overall excellent enthusiast coupe.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012238#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012238&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For Reddit, as for Huffman, the bet on a public offering for a site he described as a “fun and special, but sometimes crazy place” has appeared to pay off.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012282#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012282&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With all due respect to the Capcom team, which poured itself into <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a> and deserves praise, raises, and time off, let me get right to it: I love this game for how dumb it is.</p>

<p>I mean "dumb" in the way most heavy metal lyrics are dumb, but you find yourself rocking out nonetheless. Dumb like when you laugh uncontrollably at the sight of someone getting conked on the head and falling over backward. Dumb as in the silliest bits of <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>, just nowhere near as self-aware (unless, due to translation issues, this game actually is self-aware, then I apologize).</p>
<p><i>Dragon’s Dogma 2</i> (<em>DD2</em>) reminds me of playing another huge, dumb, enjoyable game: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/11/skyrim-sells-a-reported-35-million-units-in-2-days-shows-demand-for-single-player-gaming/"><i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i></a>. Not the first time you play through it, though. I’m talking about the second or third run-through (or that 100-plus-hour save in which you refuse to finish the game), and your admiration of this huge, rich world gives way to utter ridiculousness. You one-shot dragons with your <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/skyrim-stealth-archer-build/">broken stealth-archer build</a>, you put <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/skyrim-bucket-robbery-is-a-testament-to-player-creativity/">buckets on the heads of NPCs</a> to rob them, and you marvel at how the most effective fast travel is <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrims-horse-tilting-glitch-redefines-fast-travel-1788754191">horse tilting</a>. You lunge into possibilities, choose chaos, and appreciate all the ways you can do so.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012266#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012266&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A prototype jet independently developed by Boom Supersonic made its first flight on Friday, the company said.</p>
<p>The XB-1 vehicle flew from Mojave Air &amp; Space Port in California, reaching an altitude of 7,120 feet (2.2 km) and a maximum speed of 273 mph (439 kph). <a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/flyby/inaugural-first-flight-xb1-supersonic-demonstrator">In a news release</a>, Boom Supersonic said the initial test flight of the XB-1 aircraft met all of its objectives.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>After public outcry, General Motors has decided to stop sharing driving data from its connected cars with data brokers. Last week, news broke that customers enrolled in GM's OnStar Smart Driver app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/car-makers-shady-data-sharing-takes-spotlight-in-gm-connected-car-scandal/">have had their data shared with LexisNexis and Verisk</a>.</p>
<p>Those data brokers in turn shared the information with insurance companies, resulting in some drivers finding it much harder or more expensive to obtain insurance. To make matters much worse, customers allege they never signed up for OnStar Smart Driver in the first place, claiming the choice was made for them by salespeople during the car-buying process.</p>
<p>Now, in what feels like an all-too-rare win for privacy in the 21st century, that data-sharing deal is no more.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012276#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012276&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO—Trade shows like the Game Developers Conference and the (dearly departed) E3 are a great chance to see what's coming down the pike for the game industry. But they can also be a great place to celebrate gaming's history, as we've shown you with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/a-trip-through-gaming-history-the-videogame-history-museum-at-e3/">any</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/06/e3-photo-diary-finale-vr-headsets-and-a-visit-to-the-game-history-museum/">number</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/gallery-take-a-tour-of-e3s-video-game-theme-park/">on-site</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/gallery-gdc-2015-shows-off-inventive-controllers-and-atari-history/">photo galleries</a> in years past.</p>
<p>The history display tucked away in a corner of this year's Game Developers Conference—the first one arranged by the Video Game History Foundation—was a little different. Rather than simply laying out a parcel of random collectibles, as past history-focused booths have, VGHF took a more curated approach, with mini-exhibits focused on specific topics like women in gaming, oddities of gaming music, and an entire case devoted to <a href="https://gamehistory.org/where-in-north-dakota-is-carmen-sandiego/">a little-known entry in a famous edutainment series</a>.</p>
<p>Then there was the central case, devoted to the idea that all sorts of ephemera—from design docs to photos to pre-release prototypes to newsletters to promotional items—were all an integral part of video game history. The organization is practically begging developers, journalists, and fan hoarders of all stripes not to throw out even items that seem like they have no value. After all, today's trash might be tomorrow's important historic relic.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012261#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012261&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An Internet service provider that admitted lying to the Federal Communications Commission about where it offers broadband will pay a $10,000 fine and implement a compliance plan to prevent future violations.</p>
<p>Jefferson County Cable (JCC), a small ISP in Toronto, Ohio, admitted that it falsely claimed to offer fiber service in an area that it hadn't expanded to yet. A company executive also admitted that the firm submitted false coverage data to prevent other ISPs from obtaining government grants to serve the area. Ars helped expose the incident in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/cable-company-tries-to-block-grants-to-rivals-by-lying-about-coverage-area/">February 2023 article</a>.</p>
<p>The FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-eb-settles-jefferson-county-cable">announced the outcome</a> of its investigation on March 15, saying that Jefferson County Cable violated the Broadband Data Collection program requirements and the Broadband DATA Act, a US law, "in connection with reporting inaccurate information or data with respect to the Company's ability to provide broadband Internet access service."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012235#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012235&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
