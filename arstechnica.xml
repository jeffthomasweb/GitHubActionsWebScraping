<p>NASA would like to start stacking the Space Launch System rocket for the Artemis II mission—the first human flight around the Moon since 1972—sometime next month, but the agency's exploration chief says the milestone could be delayed as engineers continue studying the readiness of the Orion spacecraft's heat shield.</p>
<p>The heat shield, already installed at the base of the Orion spacecraft, will take the brunt of the heating when the capsule blazes through Earth's atmosphere at the end of the 10-day mission. On the Artemis I test flight in late 2022, NASA sent an Orion spacecraft to the Moon and back without a crew aboard. The only significant blemish on the test flight was a finding that charred chunks of the heat shield unexpectedly stripped away from the capsule during reentry as temperatures increased to nearly 5,000° Fahrenheit (2,760° Celsius).</p>
<p>The spacecraft safely splashed down, and if any astronauts had been aboard, they would have been fine. However, the inspections of the recovered spacecraft showed divots of heat shield material were missing. The heat shield material, called Avcoat, is designed to erode away in a controlled manner during reentry. Instead, fragments fell off the heat shield that left cavities resembling potholes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044603#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044603&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bethesda's <em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em> is the latest game from a Microsoft subsidiary that will make its way to the PlayStation 5. The game will hit Sony's console in the spring of 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/the-great-circle-is-indiana-jones-for-a-post-uncharted-world/">announced yesterday</a>, months after a planned December launch on Xbox Series S/X and Windows.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_o61DN93ik">an interview with YouTube channel Xbox On</a>, Microsoft's Phil Spencer expanded on that decision, implying that multiplatform releases for Microsoft gaming properties were important to the Xbox division's bottom line. "We run a business," he said, "It's definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery that we have to give back to the company, because we get a level of support from the company that's just amazing in what we're able to go do."</p>

"[The industry] has been growing for a long, long time and now people are looking for ways to grow," he said. "And I think that us, as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there's going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed [ars] going to change... for all of us."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044702#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044702&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A phone company agreed to pay a $1 million fine for transmitting spoofed robocalls in which a deepfake of President Joe Biden's voice urged New Hampshire residents not to vote. Lingo Telecom, which is based in Texas, agreed to a settlement with the Federal Communications Commission, the agency <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404951A1.pdf">announced today</a>.</p>
<p>Lingo Telecom "will pay a $1 million civil penalty and implement a historic compliance plan—the first of its kind secured by the FCC—that will require strict adherence to the FCC's STIR/SHAKEN Caller ID authentication rules," the FCC said. The settlement includes "requirements that the company abide by 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) and 'Know Your Upstream Provider' (KYUP) principles" that focus on vetting call traffic to ensure it is trustworthy, and "requirements that the company more thoroughly verify the accuracy of the information provided by its customers and upstream providers."</p>
<p>The calls made before New Hampshire's presidential primary in January were orchestrated by Steve Kramer, a Democratic consultant who was working for a candidate running against Biden. Kramer was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/democratic-consultant-indicted-for-biden-deepfake-that-told-people-not-to-vote/">indicted</a> on charges of voter suppression and impersonation of a candidate, and the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-6-million-fine-deepfake-robocalls-around-nh-primary">proposed a $6 million fine</a> for Kramer. The calls inaccurately displayed a phone number associated with a prominent New Hampshire political operative.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044661#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044661&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The FGS <em>Braunschweig</em> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_corvette_Braunschweig">German naval corvette</a> made for stealthy littoral (shoreline) operations, but the <em>Braunschweig</em> ditched the stealth completely while transiting up the Thames this week on a training mission to London. Instead, the ship turned out its enlisted men to stand on deck in <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/watch-german-navy-plays-darth-100342710.html">light blue shirts and dark pants</a> while the boat blasted a recording of "The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)" from <em>Star Wars</em> as it floated past Tower Bridge.</p>
<p>Coming eight decades after Londoners lived through the German "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz">blitz</a>" in World War II and then spent years waiting for a German naval invasion that never materialized, playing the Big Bad Guy's theme from Star Wars films was certainly a bold choice. But a German naval spokesperson <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cn87608w389o">assured the BBC</a> that the music had "no deeper message" and added that it was not some sort of commentary from the German naval staff. Rather, the boat's commander "can choose the music freely."</p>
<p>The little spectacle did show two things. One—assuming this was, in fact, a joke—it put the lie to the old stereotype that the Germans have no sense of humor, a stereotype which has led to the production of actual BBC headlines like "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20170802-why-people-think-germans-arent-funny">Why people think Germans aren't funny</a>."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044654#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044654&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Phishers are using a novel technique to trick iOS and Android users into installing malicious apps that bypass safety guardrails built by both Apple and Google to prevent unauthorized apps.</p>
<p>Both mobile operating systems employ mechanisms designed to help users steer clear of apps that steal their personal information, passwords, or other sensitive data. iOS bars the installation of all apps other than those available in its App Store, an approach widely known as the Walled Garden. Android, meanwhile, is set by default to allow only apps available in Google Play. Sideloading—or the installation of apps from other markets—must be manually allowed, something Google warns against.</p>
<h2>When native apps aren’t</h2>
<p>Phishing campaigns making the rounds over the past nine months are using previously unseen ways to workaround these protections. The objective is to trick targets into installing a malicious app that masquerades as an official one from the targets’ bank. Once installed, the malicious app steals account credentials and sends them to the attacker in real time over Telegram.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044637#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044637&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>An unusually bright burst of radio waves—dubbed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal">Wow! signal</a>—discovered in the 1970s has baffled astronomers ever since, given the tantalizing possibility that it just might be from an alien civilization trying to communicate with us. A team of astronomers think they might have <a href="https://phl.upr.edu/wow">a better explanation</a>, according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08513">a preprint</a> posted to the physics arXiv: clouds of atomic hydrogen that essentially act like a naturally occurring galactic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maser">maser</a>, emitting a beam of intense microwave radiation when zapped by a flare from a passing magnetar.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/the-real-science-behind-setis-hunt-for-intelligent-aliens/">previously reported</a>, the Wow! signal was detected on August 18, 1977, by The Ohio State University Radio Observatory, known as “Big Ear.” Astronomy professor Jerry Ehman was analyzing Big Ear data in the form of printouts that, to the untrained eye, looked like someone had simply smashed the number row of a typewriter with a preference for lower digits. Numbers and letters in the Big Ear data indicated, essentially, the intensity of the electromagnetic signal picked up by the telescope over time, starting at ones and moving up to letters in the double digits (A was 10, B was 11, and so on). Most of the page was covered in ones and twos, with a stray six or seven sprinkled in.</p>
<p>But that day, Ehman found an anomaly: 6EQUJ5 (sometimes misinterpreted as a message encoded in the radio signal). This signal had started out at an intensity of six—already an outlier on the page—climbed to E, then Q, peaked at U—the highest power signal Big Ear had ever seen—then decreased again. Ehman circled the sequence in red pen and wrote “Wow!” next to it. The signal appeared to be coming from the direction of the Sagittarius constellation, and the entire signal lasted for about 72 seconds. Alas, SETI researchers have never been able to detect the so-called “Wow! Signal” again, despite many tries with radio telescopes around the world.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044511#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044511&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft will begin sending a revised version of its controversial Recall feature to Windows Insider PCs beginning in October, according to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/">an update published today</a> to the company's original blog post about the Recall controversy. The company didn't elaborate further on specific changes it's making to Recall beyond what it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/microsoft-makes-recall-feature-off-by-default-after-security-and-privacy-backlash/">already announced in June</a>.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, Recall is a Windows service that runs in the background on compatible PCs, continuously taking screenshots of user activity, scanning those screenshots with o<span class="BxUVEf ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">ptical character recognition</span></span> (OCR), and saving the OCR text and the screenshots to a giant searchable database on your PC. The goal, according to Microsoft, is to help users retrace their steps and dig up information about things they had used their PCs to find or do in the past.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned/">The problem</a> was that other users on the same PC, or attackers with physical or remote access to your PC, could easily access, view, and export those screenshots and the OCR database since none of the information was encrypted at rest or protected in any substantive way.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044616#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044616&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chrome users who declined to sync their Google accounts with their browsing data secured a big privacy win this week after previously losing a proposed class action claiming that Google secretly collected personal data without consent from over 100 million Chrome users who opted out of syncing.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Calhoun-v-Google-Appeals-Court-Opinion-8-20-2024.pdf">reversed</a> the prior court's finding that Google had properly gained consent for the contested data collection.</p>
<p>The appeals court said that the US district court had erred in ruling that Google's general privacy policies secured consent for the data collection. The district court failed to consider conflicts with Google's Chrome Privacy Notice (CPN), which said that users' "choice not to sync Chrome with their Google accounts meant that certain personal information would not be collected and used by Google," the appeals court ruled.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044594#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044594&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/conde-nast/">announced</a> a partnership with Ars Technica parent company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond%C3%A9_Nast">Condé Nast</a> to display content from prominent publications within its AI products, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> and a new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/openai-hits-google-where-it-hurts-with-new-searchgpt-prototype/">SearchGPT</a> prototype. It also allows OpenAI to use Condé content to train future AI language models. The deal covers well-known Condé brands such as Vogue, The New Yorker, GQ, Wired, Ars Technica, and others. Financial details were not disclosed.</p>

<p>One immediate effect of the deal will be that users of ChatGPT or SearchGPT will now be able to see information from Condé Nast publications pulled from those assistants' live views of the web. For example, a user could ask ChatGPT, "What's the latest Ars Technica article about Space?" and ChatGPT can browse the web and pull up the result, attribute it, and summarize it for users while also linking to the site.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the deal also means that OpenAI can openly and officially utilize Condé Nast articles to train future AI language models, which includes successors to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>. In this case, "training" means feeding content into an AI model's neural network so the AI model can better process conceptual relationships.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044379#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044379&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google made its AI assistant, Gemini, central to its pitch to reviewers and the public—it's what makes Pixel phones different from any other Android phone, the company says. In fact, you have to go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jvyyfvf0gjI?feature=shared&amp;t=1445">24 minutes into Google's keynote presentation</a>, and cringe through a couple of live AI demo failures, before Pixel hardware details are even mentioned.</p>
<p>I've been using a Pixel 9 Pro as my daily phone for about a week. There is almost nothing new about the Pixel 9 that is not linked to Gemini in some way, minus the physical design of the thing. So this review will look at how Gemini performs on the Pixel 9, which is Google's premier platform for Gemini at the moment. While some of the Pixel 9's AI-powered features may make it to other Android-powered phones in future Android releases, that's not a certainty. AI—as a free trial, as a custom Google-designed chip, and as an OS integration—is something Google is using to set Pixels apart.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-family-the-just-hardware-review-no-ai/">a separate review of the three main Pixel 9 devices</a>. But considering the Pixel 9 as a hardware-only product is strange. The short version is that the phones themselves are capable evolutions of the Pixel series and probably the best versions Google has made yet, and they're sold at prices that reflect that. If you love Pixel phones, are eager to upgrade, and plan to ignore Gemini specifically and AI features generally, that might be all you need to know.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043949#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043949&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"It's definitely possible to use a Pixel 9 without Gemini," the bot responded in a remarkably casual voice. "While Gemini adds some cool features, your phone will still work pretty much the same as any other Android phone. You'll still have access to all the basic stuff like making calls, texting, taking photos, and all your favorite apps."</p>

(credit: Sonos)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Sonos' new app was launched and reviewed so poorly that the company is expecting to spend <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/app-redesign-blowback-will-cost-sonos-up-to-30-million-ceo-says/">$20 million to $30 million</a> on remediation. The Verge reported last week that high-level Sonos executives were considering relaunching the old app so users can have the functionality and stability that the update lacks. However, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence confirmed yesterday that the old app won't be re-released.</p>
<p>In May, Sonos launched an updated companion app for controlling its devices that was maligned for a lack of features. With users being vocal about their disappointment to lose functionality, like local music library access, sleep timers, and accessibility features, and the app seemingly being rushed out prematurely, by July, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/pained-by-having-let-you-down-sonos-apologizes-for-app-failures/">Spence had apologized for the app</a> and promised biweekly updates to fix the software's problems.</p>
<p>Fixing the app and Sonos' reputation has been critical for the Santa Barbara, California-headquartered company, leading Sonos to delay two hardware launches it had planned for its fiscal Q4. In more bad news for the firm, it said last week that it would be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/sonos-laying-off-100-people-amid-expensive-app-problems/">laying off 100 people</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044454#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044454&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A federal judge in Texas yesterday blocked the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to ban noncompete agreements that make it difficult for workers to change jobs or start new businesses. Judge Ada Brown in the Northern District of Texas <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064.211.0_3.pdf">granted a motion for summary judgment</a> that was requested by a tax services firm and business groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>"The Court sets aside the Non-Compete Rule. Consequently, the Rule shall not be enforced or otherwise take effect on its effective date of September 4, 2024 or thereafter," the ruling said.</p>
<p>The judge wrote in a previous ruling that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/judge-says-ftc-lacks-authority-to-issue-rule-banning-noncompete-agreements/">FTC lacks authority</a> to issue a rule banning noncompete agreements and granted a preliminary injunction. But that previous ruling only postponed the effective date of the rule as it applied to the plaintiffs, whereas yesterday's order blocks the FTC rule entirely.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044482#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044482&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ford has scrapped plans to build some big three-row electric SUVs and is revising its North American electrification roadmap, the company announced this morning. The automaker, which comes in at a distant second to Tesla in the US electric vehicle sales charts, says the focus will now be on cheaper, more efficient EVs, including some new commercial vehicles. Those big SUVs will still show up at some time, but they'll be hybrids, not fully electric.</p>
<p>Ford has never been afraid to tear up an existing plan, particularly when it comes to EVs. The Mustang Mach-E was supposed to be a much more boring compliance car <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/heres-everything-we-know-about-the-electric-ford-mustang-mach-e/">until an internal skunkworks called Team Edison</a> came up with the idea of a crossover that could only be a Ford in 2017.</p>
<p>But it also had big ambitions for its EVs. It created a new division, called "Model e," to be responsible for EVs and announced it had locked up <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/ford-secures-battery-supplies-for-600000-evs-a-year-from-2023/">supplies for 600,000 EV batteries</a> a year from 2023. In addition to the midsize Mach-E crossover, it created a fully electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck and an electric E-Transit van.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044465#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044465&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Michael Sentonas told the Financial Times that attempts by competitors to use the July 19 disruption to promote their own products were “misguided.”</p>
<p>After criticism from rivals including SentinelOne and Trellix, the CrowdStrike executive said no vendor could “technically” guarantee that their own software would never cause a similar incident.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044431#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044431&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If it feels like many years since you first saw Volkswagen's retro electric microbus, the ID. Buzz, you're not wrong. It's surprisingly aptly named; I can't think of another car during the past decade that has aroused so much interest among people who don't usually care about four-wheeled transport. Nearly eight years after the concept made its debut, the Buzz is on sale in Europe and has been for a year. Now it's time for America to get its turn, with deliveries starting later this year.</p>
<p>We drove the Euro-spec Buzz <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/weve-driven-volkswagens-retro-cool-id-buzz-electric-minivan/">almost two years ago</a>, but it's fair to say the version that's coming to the US is a better proposition. The Buzz we drove had a shorter wheelbase, a smaller-capacity battery, and seats only for five, and if you sat in the back, there was no ventilation, and the windows couldn't be opened.</p>
<p>The US market will only receive the longer-wheelbase Buzz, which adds about 10 inches (250 mm) between the axles. This adds room for a third row of seats, making it a proper seven-seater. It should be a bit more humane sitting in the back, as there are air vents—we're waiting to drive it to find out if any windows open back there.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044353#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044353&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last Tuesday, loads of Linux users—many running packages released as early as this year—started reporting their devices were failing to boot. Instead, they received a cryptic error message that included the phrase: “Something has gone seriously wrong.”</p>
<p>The cause: an <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-2601">update</a> Microsoft issued as part of its monthly patch release. It was intended to close a <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-2601">2-year-old vulnerability</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB">GRUB</a>, an open source boot loader used to start up many Linux devices. The vulnerability, with a severity rating of 8.6 out of 10, made it possible for hackers to bypass secure boot, the industry standard for ensuring that devices running Windows or other operating systems don’t load malicious firmware or software during the bootup process. CVE-2022-2601 was discovered in 2022, but for unclear reasons, Microsoft patched it only last Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Multiple distros, both new and old, affected</h2>
<p>Tuesday’s update left dual-boot devices—meaning those configured to run both Windows and Linux—no longer able to boot into the latter when Secure Boot was enforced. When users tried to load Linux, they received the message: “Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation.” Almost immediately <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1euuiwv/please_help_error_verifying_shim_sbat_data_failed/">support</a> and <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1523353/windows-aug-13-update-broke-my-ubuntu-system">discussion</a> forums <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/sbat-verification-error-booting-linux-after-windows-update/56354">lit up</a> with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1euuha4/please_help_error_message_verifying_shim_sbat/">​​reports</a> of the <a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=427297&amp;sid=dab5f35699069b1d030e710a1eb3c793">failure</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044381#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044381&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In news that will delight some and disappoint others, Disney has canceled Star Wars series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/06/star-wars-behind-the-scenes-creating-the-unique-aesthetic-of-the-acolyte/"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> after just one season, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/the-acolyte-canceled-no-season-2-star-wars-disney-plus-1236044233/">Deadline Hollywood reports</a>. The eight-episode series got off to a fairly strong start, with mostly positive reviews and solid ratings, albeit lower than prior Star Wars series. But it couldn't maintain and build upon that early momentum, and given the production costs, it's not especially surprising that Disney pulled the plug.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> arguably wrapped up its major narrative arc pretty neatly in the season finale, but it also took pains to set the stage for a possible sophomore season. In this streaming age, no series is ever guaranteed renewal. Still, it would have been nice to see what showrunner Leslye Headland had planned; when given the chance, many shows hit their stride on those second-season outings.</p>

We'll give you another heads-up when we get to major spoilers.)</strong></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044253#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044253&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the more than 30 hospitals in the Steward Health Care System scrounged for cash to cover supplies, shuttered pediatric and neonatal units, closed maternity wards, laid off hundreds of health care workers, and put patients in danger, the system paid out at least $250 million to its CEO and his companies, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/steward-health-ceo-ralph-de-la-torre-deabfe4b">according to a report by The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>The newly revealed financial details bring yet more scrutiny to Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre, a Harvard University-trained cardiac surgeon who, in 2020, took over majority ownership of Steward from the private equity firm Cerberus. De la Torre and his companies were reportedly paid at least $250 million since that takeover. In May, Steward, <a href="https://www.steward.org/network/our-hospitals">which has hospitals in eight states</a>, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Critics—including members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP)—allege that de la Torre stripped the system's hospitals of assets, siphoned payments from them, and loaded them with debt, all while reaping huge payouts that made him obscenely wealthy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044320#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044320&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
