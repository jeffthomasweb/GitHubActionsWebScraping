                            <![CDATA[<p>We are now a few years into the AI revolution, and talk has shifted from who has the best chatbot to whose AI agent can do the most things on your behalf. Unfortunately, AI agents are still rough around the edges, so tasking them with anything important is not a great idea. OpenAI launched its Atlas agent late last year, which we found to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/10/we-let-openais-agent-mode-surf-the-web-for-us-heres-what-happened/">modestly useful</a>, and now it's Google's turn.</p>
<p>Unlike the OpenAI agent, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-begins-rolling-out-chromes-auto-browse-ai-agent-today/">Google's new Auto Browse agent</a> has extraordinary reach because it's part of Chrome, the world's most popular browser by a wide margin. Google began rolling out Auto Browse (in preview) earlier this month to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to send the agent across the web to complete tasks.</p>
<p>I've taken Chrome's agent for a spin to see whether you can trust it to handle tedious online work for you. For each test, I lay out the problem I need to solve, how I prompted the robot, and how well (or not) it handled the job.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/tested-how-chromes-auto-browse-agent-handles-common-web-tasks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida is accustomed to getting makeovers. It got another one Wednesday with the removal of the Crew Access Arm used by astronauts to board their rides to space.</p>
<p>Construction workers first carved the footprint for the launch pad from the Florida wetlands more than 60 years ago. NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.</p>
<p>SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad's tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA's orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company's human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. Astronauts started using the pathway, suspended more than 200 feet above the pad surface, beginning with the first crew flight on a Dragon spacecraft in 2020.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/heres-why-americas-most-historic-launch-pad-is-getting-yet-another-facelift/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, a fossil-fuel lobbying group called the Washington Coal Club awarded President Trump a trophy that named him the "Undisputed Champion of Clean, Beautiful Coal." Trump took advantage of the opportunity to take his latest shot at reviving the fortunes of the US's most polluting source of electricity: an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/02/strengthening-united-states-national-defense-with-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-power-generation-fleet/">executive order</a> that would make the military buy it.</p>
<p>Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump's return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term.</p>
<p>Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trump-admin-orders-another-coal-plant-to-stay-open/">forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations</a>. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/trumps-latest-plan-to-revive-coal-power-make-the-military-buy-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/faa-shuts-down-el-paso-airspace-for-10-days-and-wont-say-why/">closed airspace up to 18,000 feet</a> above the El Paso International Airport in Texas, saying the restrictions would be in place for 10 days. Then, less than 10 hours later, the federal agency reopened the airspace, allowing planes to land and take off at the busy airport.</p>
<p>About an hour after lifting the restrictions, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, whose responsibilities include overseeing the FAA, explained the unexpected closure by saying, "The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion." (The Trump Administration refers to the Department of Defense as the Department of War, or DOW, although its legal name remains the former.)</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees with Duffy's account.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/el-paso-airport-closed-after-military-used-new-anti-drone-laser-to-zap-party-balloon/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last May, law enforcement authorities around the world scored a key win when they hobbled the infrastructure of Lumma, an infostealer that infected nearly 395,000 Windows computers over just a two-month span leading up to the international operation. Researchers said Wednesday that Lumma is once again “back at scale” in hard-to-detect attacks that pilfer credentials and sensitive files.</p>
<p>Lumma, also known as Lumma Stealer, first appeared in Russian-speaking cybercrime forums in 2022. Its cloud-based malware-as-a-service model provided a sprawling infrastructure of domains for hosting lure sites offering free cracked software, games, and pirated movies, as well as command-and-control channels and everything else a threat actor needed to run their infostealing enterprise. Within a year, Lumma was selling for as much as $2,500 for premium versions. By the spring of 2024, the FBI counted more than 21,000 listings on crime forums. Last year, Microsoft said Lumma had become the “go-to tool” for multiple crime groups, including Scattered Spider, one of the most prolific groups.</p>
<h2>Takedowns are hard</h2>
<p>The FBI and an international coalition of its counterparts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/authorities-carry-out-global-takedown-of-infostealer-used-by-cybercriminals/">took action</a> early last year. In May, they said they seized 2,300 domains, command-and-control infrastructure, and crime marketplaces that had enabled the infostealer to thrive. Recently, however, the malware has made a comeback, allowing it to infect a significant number of machines again.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/once-hobbled-lumma-stealer-is-back-with-lures-that-are-hard-to-resist/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On February 1, Robert Tinney, the illustrator whose airbrushed cover paintings defined the look and feel of pioneering computer magazine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">Byte</a> for over a decade, died at age 78 in Baker, Louisiana, <a href="https://tinney.net/in-memoriam">according to</a> a memorial posted on his official website.</p>
<p>As the primary cover artist for Byte from 1975 to the late 1980s, Tinney became one of the first illustrators to give the abstract world of personal computing a coherent visual language, translating topics like artificial intelligence, networking, and programming into vivid, surrealist-influenced paintings that a generation of computer enthusiasts grew up with.</p>
<p>Tinney went on to paint more than 80 covers for Byte, working almost entirely in airbrushed <a href="https://www.winsornewton.com/collections/designers-gouache?srsltid=AfmBOor7o0-Tfj7G3bYkw784iQTYkhe9Nw3tBBSWyMSt1pHPoK2W4jl9">Designers Gouache</a>, a medium he chose for its opaque, intense colors and smooth finish. He <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/169/vcg-interview-robert-tinney-microcomputer-illustration-pioneer">said</a> the process of creating each cover typically took about a week of painting once a design was approved, following phone conversations with editors about each issue's theme. He cited René Magritte and M.C. Escher as two of his favorite artists, and fans often noticed their influence in his work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/byte-magazine-artist-robert-tinney-who-illustrated-the-birth-of-pcs-dies-at-78/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A little more than two months ago, a Rocket Lab employee called the Stennis Space Center Fire Department from the nearby A3 test stand. There was a grass fire where Archimedes engines undergo testing. Could they please send personnel over?</p>
<p>According to the fire station's November 30 dispatcher log, the employee said, "The fire started during a test when an anomaly caused an electrical box to catch fire."</p>
<p>Satellite imagery from before and after the anomaly appears to show that the roof had been blown off the left test cell, one of two at the test stand at the historic NASA facility in southern Mississippi. One person with knowledge of the anomaly said, "The characterization of this as an electrical fire doesn't reflect what actually occurred. This was a catastrophic engine explosion that resulted in significant infrastructure damage."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/yes-rocket-lab-is-blowing-up-engines-no-its-not-a-big-deal-ceo-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The pre-Inca Chincha Kingdom (circa 1000-1400 CE), along Peru's southern coast, was one of the most wealthy and influential of its time before falling to the Inca and Spanish empires. Scientists have long puzzled over the foundation for that prosperity, and it seems one critical factor was bird poop, according to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0341263">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE.</p>
<p>“Seabird guano may seem trivial, yet our study suggests this potent resource could have significantly contributed to sociopolitical and economic change in the Peruvian Andes,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1115214">said co-author Jacob Bongers</a>, a digital archaeologist at the University of Sydney. “Guano dramatically boosted the production of maize (corn), and this agricultural surplus crucially helped fuel the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chincha_culture">Chincha</a> Kingdom’s economy, driving their trade, wealth, population growth and regional influence, and shaped their strategic alliance with the Inca Empire. In ancient Andean cultures, fertiliser was power.”</p>
<p>Last November, Bongers co-authored <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/indigenous-accounting-and-exchange-at-monte-sierpe-band-of-holes-in-the-pisco-valley-peru/41D83389D230D99CFF18194CF274A9A3">a paper</a> detailing <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2025/11/10/mysterious-holes-in-the-andes-may-have-been-an-ancient-marketplace-new-research-suggests.html">evidence supporting</a> the hypothesis that the mysterious "Band of Holes" on Mount Sierpe in the Andes might have been an ancient marketplace. Aerial photographs from the 1930s first revealed that long row of around 5,200 precisely aligned holes, seemingly organized into blocked sections, most likely constructed by the Chincha Kingdom. Scholars had suggested various hypotheses for what the site's purpose may have been: defense, storage, or accounting, perhaps, or maybe to collect water and capture fog for local gardens. But nobody had any strong evidence for those suggestions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/did-seabird-poop-fuel-rise-of-chincha-in-peru/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, former OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/opinion/openai-ads-chatgpt.html">published</a> a guest essay in The New York Times announcing that she resigned from the company on Monday, the same day OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/openai-to-test-ads-in-chatgpt-as-it-burns-through-billions/">began testing</a> advertisements inside ChatGPT. Hitzig, an economist and published poet who holds a junior fellowship at the Harvard Society of Fellows, spent two years at OpenAI helping shape how its AI models were built and priced. She wrote that OpenAI's advertising strategy risks repeating the same mistakes that Facebook made a decade ago.</p>
<p>"I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create," Hitzig wrote. "This week confirmed my slow realization that OpenAI seems to have stopped asking the questions I'd joined to help answer."</p>
<p>Hitzig did not call advertising itself immoral. Instead, she argued that the nature of the data at stake makes ChatGPT ads especially risky. Users have shared medical fears, relationship problems, and religious beliefs with the chatbot, she wrote, often "because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda." She called this accumulated record of personal disclosures "an archive of human candor that has no precedent."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/openai-researcher-quits-over-fears-that-chatgpt-ads-could-manipulate-users/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This week, Microsoft disrupted that update cadence by <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/what-to-know-about-windows-11-version-26h1/4491941">announcing</a> more information on Windows 11 26H1, which is best described not as an update to Windows 11 but as another version of the operating system entirely. That's because 26H1 is a "scoped" release intended exclusively for new PCs, starting with those based on Qualcomm's recently announced <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/laptops/products/snapdragon-x2-elite">Snapdragon X2 Elite chips</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft's support page explains why this release is strange: It won't be released broadly to other Windows 11 PCs, which should continue to use either 24H2 or 25H2. PCs running 24H2 or 25H2 will never be offered an update to version 26H1, though testers in the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/11/07/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-28000-canary-channel/">Windows Insider Program's early access Canary channel</a> are able to install it to other PCs if they want. (Build numbers for Windows 11 26H1 start with 28000, compared to 26100 for 24H2 and 26200 for 25H2.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/windows-11-26h1-is-a-special-version-of-windows-exclusively-for-new-arm-pcs/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Like most cloud-enabled home security cameras, Google's Nest products don't provide long-term storage unless you pay a monthly fee. That video may not vanish into the digital aether right on time, though. Investigators involved with the high-profile abduction of Nancy Guthrie have released video from Guthrie's Nest doorbell camera—video that was believed to have been deleted because Guthrie wasn't paying for the service.</p>
<p>Google's cameras connect to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/googles-gemini-powered-smart-home-revamp-is-here-with-a-new-app-and-cameras/">recently upgraded</a> Home Premium subscription service. For $10 per month, you get 30 days of stored events, and $20 gets you 60 days of events with 10 days of the full video. If you don't pay anything, Google only saves three hours of event history. After that, the videos are deleted, at least as far as the user is concerned. Newer Nest cameras have limited local storage that can cache clips for a few hours in case connectivity drops out, but there is no option for true local storage. Guthrie's camera was reportedly destroyed by the perpetrators.</p>

<p>Expired videos are no longer available to the user, and Google won't restore them even if you later upgrade to a premium account. However, that doesn't mean the data is truly gone. Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her home in the early hours of February 1, and at first, investigators said there was no video of the crime because the doorbell camera was not on a paid account. Yet, video showing a masked individual fiddling with the camera was <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/nancy-guthrie">published on February 10</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/google-recovers-deleted-nest-video-in-high-profile-abduction-case/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The National Labor Relations Board abandoned a Biden-era complaint against SpaceX after a finding that the agency does not have jurisdiction over Elon Musk's space company. The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies.</p>
<p>The Railway Labor Act is enforced by a separate agency, the National Mediation Board, and has different rules than the National Labor Relations Act enforced by the NLRB. <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-railway-labor-act-a-practical-guide-3459793/">For example</a>, the Railway Labor Act has an extensive dispute-resolution process that makes it difficult for railroad and airline employees to strike. Employers regulated under the Railway Labor Act are <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act">exempt</a> from the National Labor Relations Act.</p>
<p>In January 2024, an NLRB regional director <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/spacex-illegally-fired-employees-who-criticized-elon-musk-nlrb-alleges/">alleged in a complaint</a> that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/06/spacex-employees-write-letter-blasting-musks-harmful-twitter-behavior/">open letter</a>, criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment." The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/victory-for-elon-musk-us-labor-board-abandons-authority-over-spacex/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple has just released the latest major updates for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, and all the other operating systems it released back in September of 2025. The 26.3 updates for these operating systems are fairly mild, focusing mostly on bug fixes and security patches, but Apple is adding a handful of iPhone features designed to make it easier to use third-party devices in Apple's ecosystem.</p>
<p>The first is a "transfer to Android" feature that will facilitate switching away from Apple's phones into the Android ecosystem. Apple offers to transfer "photos, messages, notes, apps, and more," as well as the user's phone number, but won't transfer things like Bluetooth pairing information or sensitive data from the Health app.</p>
<p>Whether third-party apps can have their data transferred is likely tied to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appmigrationkit">AppMigrationKit developer framework</a> that Apple added in iOS 26.1. Apps using this framework can import and export data to and from other devices and also access and download content the app has stored in the cloud. Apple notes that AppMigrationKit only functions for transfers from an Apple device to a non-Apple device; Apple already has several systems in place for preserving and transferring data and settings when upgrading from one iPhone to another.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/apple-releases-ios-26-3-with-updates-that-mainly-benefit-non-apple-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>China's space program, striving to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, carried out a test flight of a new reusable booster and crew capsule late Tuesday (US time), and the results were spectacular.</p>
<p>The demonstration "marks a significant breakthrough in the development of [China's] manned lunar exploration program," the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement. China and the United States are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/how-america-fell-behind-china-in-the-lunar-space-race-and-how-it-can-catch-back-up/">racing to accomplish the next human landing</a> on the Moon in a competition for national prestige and lunar resources. The Long March 10 rocket and Mengzhou spacecraft, both tested Tuesday, are core elements of China's lunar architecture.</p>
<p>The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule's safety system. The test began with liftoff of the Long March 10 booster from a new launch pad at Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan Island, China's southernmost province, at 10 pm EST Tuesday (03:00 UTC or 11 am Beijing time Wednesday).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/china-showcases-new-moon-ship-and-reusable-rocket-in-one-extraordinary-test/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2022, Apple announced it was adopting a "new Home architecture" for its smart home ecosystem to improve its performance and reliability and make it possible to support different kinds of accessories. Although it was mostly an invisible update when it worked properly, some users who attempted to switch to the new architecture when it first rolled out in iOS 16.2 ran into slow or unresponsive devices and other problems, prompting Apple to pause the rollout and re-release it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/apple-seems-ready-to-re-release-its-revamped-home-architecture-in-ios-16-4/">as part of iOS 16.4</a>.</p>
<p>If you put off transitioning to the new architecture because of those early teething problems or for some other reason, Apple is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102287">forcing the issue</a> starting today: You'll need to update to the new Home architecture if you want to continue using the Home app, and older iOS and macOS versions that don't support the new architecture will no longer be able to control your smart home devices. The old version of the Home app and the old Home/HomeKit architecture are no longer supported.</p>
<p>If you're like me, you hit an "upgrade" button in your Home app years ago and then mostly forgot about it—if you open the Home app on a modern iPhone, iPad, or Mac and don't see an update prompt, it means you're already using the updated architecture and don't need to worry about it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/smart-home-psa-apples-new-architecture-for-home-app-becomes-mandatory-today/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>By revoking its 17-year-old scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency will demolish the legal underpinning of its authority to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.</p>
<p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will be alongside President Donald Trump for an event Wednesday focused on <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10022026/trump-department-of-defense-coal-power/">boosting US use of coal, as mercury and air toxics standards are repealed. That is expected to be a prelude to Zeldin finalizing </a>the endangerment finding repeal, an assignment the president handed him in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term in office.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/whats-next-after-the-trump-administration-revokes-key-finding-on-climate-change/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A long time ago, in (I believe) an issue of Car Magazine from the mid-1990s, the designer Gordon Murray shared his thoughts about a possible four-door follow-up to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/these-mclaren-f1s-and-bugatti-eb110s-were-the-stars-of-car-week/">McLaren F1</a>.</p>
<p>Road cars weren't really his thing. Until then, his career had been focused on Formula 1 car design, and he brought that sport's obsession with weight savings with him. Were he to design a sedan, he'd trim the interior with textile, not leather. After all, wool made fine suits and coats, Murray reasoned, and it would save weight.</p>
<p>A four-door McLaren never happened during his tenure, nor has one appeared since. Murray now runs his own boutique <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/08/gordon-murray-says-the-his-new-supercar-is-the-most-driver-centric-ever/">hypercar</a> company, which also builds no sedans. But the idea that high-end cars could use something other than leather has stuck with me, especially after driving BMW's i7, which  debuted in 2022 with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/testing-bmws-biggest-and-best-sedan-now-fully-electric-the-2023-i7/">a premium cashmere wool interior</a>. More recently, new EVs have experimented with interesting textile alternatives to leather. Two good examples are the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/how-bmw-slashed-the-carbon-footprint-of-its-next-ev-the-2026-ix3/">BMW iX3</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/audis-next-ev-is-the-a6-e-tron-sportback-but-no-station-wagon-for-the-us/">Audi A6</a>, though neither can be ordered with these textile options in the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/02/america-its-time-to-think-beyond-leather-for-luxury-car-seats/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Food and Drug Administration has refused to review Moderna's application for an mRNA flu vaccine, the company revealed Tuesday.</p>
<p>While the move came as a surprise to the high-profile vaccine maker, it is just the latest hostility toward vaccines—and mRNA vaccines in particular—from an agency overseen by the fervent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his first year in office, Kennedy has already <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/under-anti-vaccine-rfk-jr-cdc-slashes-childhood-vaccine-schedule/">dramatically slashed childhood vaccine recommendations</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/rfk-jr-defends-500m-cut-for-mrna-vaccines-with-pseudoscience-gobbledygook/">canceled $500 million</a> in research funding for mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic threats.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=7346090610333866&amp;symbol=MRNA">a news release late Tuesday</a>, Moderna said it was blindsided by the FDA's refusal, which the FDA cited as being due to the design of the company's Phase 3 trial for its mRNA flu vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1010. Specifically, the FDA's rejection was over the comparator vaccine Moderna used.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-refuses-to-review-modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX's next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company's previous booster.</p>
<p>SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: "Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster's redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength."</p>
<p>Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey's Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster's propellant tanks on launch day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/spacexs-starbase-is-coming-alive-again-after-a-lull-in-starship-testing/">Read full article</a></p>
