<p>When lawmakers in Washington set out to expand a lucrative tax break for the state’s data center industry in 2022, they included what some considered an essential provision: a study of the energy-hungry industry’s impact on the state’s electrical grid.</p>
<p>Gov. Jay Inslee vetoed that provision but let the tax break expansion go forward.

<p>Among the many obstacles to enacting federal limits on climate pollution, none has been more daunting than the Supreme Court. That is where the Obama administration’s efforts to regulate power plant emissions met their demise and where the Biden administration’s attempts will no doubt land.</p>
<p>A forthcoming study seeks to inform how courts consider challenges to these regulations by establishing once and for all that the lawmakers who shaped the Clean Air Act in 1970 knew scientists considered carbon dioxide an air pollutant, and that these elected officials were intent on limiting its emissions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040871#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040871&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Have you seen Google's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgtHJKn0Mck">"Dear Sydney" ad</a>? The one where a young girl wants to write a fan letter to Olympic hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone? To which the girl's dad responds that he is "pretty good with words but this has to be <em>just right"</em>? And so, to be <em>just right</em>, he suggests that the daughter get Google's Gemini AI to write a first draft of the letter?</p>
<p>If you're watching the Olympics, you have undoubtedly seen it—because the ad has been everywhere. Until today. After a string of negative commentary about the ad's dystopian implications, Google has pulled the "Dear Sydney" ad from TV. In a statement to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/google-pulls-dear-sydney-gemini-ai-ad-olympics-1235965087/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the company said, "While the ad tested well before airing, given the feedback, we have decided to phase the ad out of our Olympics rotation."</p>
<p>The backlash was similar to that against Apple's recent ad in which an enormous hydraulic press crushed TVs, musical instruments, record players, paint cans, sculptures, and even emoji into… the newest model of the iPad. Apple apparently wanted to show just how much creative and entertainment potential the iPad held; critics read the ad as a warning image about the destruction of human creativity in a technological age. Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/apple-apologizes-for-ad-that-crushes-the-sum-total-of-human-artistic-endeavor/">apologized</a> soon after.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040972#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040972&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Buying counterfeit weight loss drugs from illegal online pharmacies that don't require prescriptions is, in fact, a very bad idea, according to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821882">study published Friday in JAMA Network Open</a>.</p>
<p> The counterfeit drugs are sold as equivalents to the blockbuster semaglutide drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, which are prescription only. When researchers got their hands on three illegal versions, they found that the counterfeit drugs had low-purity semaglutide, had dosages that exceeded the labeled amount, and one had signs of bacterial contamination.</p>
<p>The three substandard drugs tested came from three different illegal online pharmacies, which sold them as generic semaglutide drugs for weight loss, appetite suppression, diabetes, and cardiovascular health. However, the researchers, led by scientists at the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Pécs in Hungary, had initially tried purchasing counterfeit drugs from six such sellers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040959#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040959&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Department of Justice <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/US-v-ByteDance-Complaint-8-2-2024.pdf">sued</a> TikTok today, accusing the short-video platform of illegally collecting data on millions of kids and demanding a permanent injunction "to put an end to TikTok’s unlawful massive-scale invasions of children’s privacy."</p>
<p>The DOJ said that TikTok had violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA Rule), claiming that TikTok allowed kids "to create and access accounts without their parents’ knowledge or consent," collected "data from those children," and failed to "comply with parents’ requests to delete their children’s accounts and information."</p>
<p>The COPPA Rule requires TikTok to prove that it does not target kids as its primary audience, the DOJ said, and TikTok claims to satisfy that "by requiring users creating accounts to report their birthdates."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040944#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040944&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If there was something wrong with an old game, or you wanted to make a different version of it, and you wanted people to help you fix that, you typically did that on RomHacking.net. After this week, you'll have to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, the site has been home to some remarkable remakes, translations, fix-ups, and experiments. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/so-long-slowdown-new-hack-runs-snes-star-fox-at-up-to-60-fps/"><em>Star Fox </em>running at 60 fps</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/a-christmas-gift-from-game-boy-rom-hackers-super-mario-land-2-in-color/"><em>Super Mario Land 2</em> in color</a>, a fix for <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s bad smoke, even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/we-traced-namcos-new-pac-man-demake-to-its-source-a-2008-fan-romhack/">a <em>Pac-Man</em> "demake" that Namco spiffed up and resold</a>—and that's not even counting the stuff that was pulled down by corporate cease-and-desist actions. It's a remarkable collection, one that encompasses both very obscure and mainstream games and well worth preserving.</p>
<p>Preserved it will be, but it seems that the RomHacking site will not go on further. The site's founder <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=39405">posted a sign-off statement to the site Thursday night</a>, one that in turn praised the community, decried certain members of it, and looked forward to what will happen with "the next generation."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040891#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040891&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NZXT, which sells gaming PCs, components, and peripherals, has a subscription <a href="https://nzxt.com/collection/flex">program</a> that charges a monthly fee to rent one of its gaming desktops. Subscribers don't own the computers and receive an upgraded rental system every two years.</p>
<p>NZXT's Flex program subscription prices range from $49 to $169 per month, depending on the specs of the system, as you can see below:</p>

<p>There's also a one-time setup and shipping fee for the rentals that totals $50. NZXT says it will "likely" charge subscribers a separate fee if they return the rental without the original box and packaging (NZXT hasn't disclosed how much).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040844#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040844&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As the price of silicon panels has continued to come down, we've reached the point where they're a small and shrinking cost of building a solar farm. That means that it might be worth spending more to get a panel that converts more of the incoming sunlight to electricity, since it allows you to get more out of the price paid to get each panel installed. But silicon panels are already pushing up against physical limits on efficiency. Which means our best chance for a major boost in panel efficiency may be to combine silicon with an additional photovoltaic material.</p>
<p>Right now, most of the focus is on pairing silicon with a class of materials called perovskites. Perovskite crystals can be layered on top of silicon, creating a panel with two materials that absorb different areas of the spectrum—plus, perovskites can be made from relatively cheap raw materials. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to make perovskites that are both high-efficiency and last for the decades that the silicon portion will.</p>
<p>Lots of labs are attempting to change that, though. And two of them reported some progress this week, including a perovskite/silicon system that achieved 34 percent efficiency.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040875#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040875&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI is facing increasing pressure to prove it's not hiding AI risks after whistleblowers alleged to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the AI company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/openai-ends-harsh-non-disparagement-agreements-that-could-claw-back-millions/">non-disclosure agreements had illegally silenced employees</a> from disclosing major safety concerns to lawmakers.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/8bf076a6-663b-4552-be52-079b79274f9c.pdf">letter</a> to OpenAI yesterday, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) demanded evidence that OpenAI is no longer requiring agreements that could be "stifling" its "employees from making protected disclosures to government regulators."</p>
<p>Specifically, Grassley asked OpenAI to produce current employment, severance, non-disparagement, and non-disclosure agreements to reassure Congress that contracts don't discourage disclosures. That's critical, Grassley said, so that it will be possible to rely on whistleblowers exposing emerging threats to help shape effective AI policies safeguarding against existential AI risks as technologies advance.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040870#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040870&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, AI-startup Black Forest Labs <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-black-forest-labs/">announced</a> the launch of its company and the release of its first suite of text-to-image AI models, called FLUX.1. The German-based company, founded by researchers who developed the technology behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a> and invented the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752">latent diffusion technique</a>, aims to create advanced generative AI for images and videos.</p>

<p>The launch of FLUX.1 comes about seven weeks after Stability AI's troubled release of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/ridiculed-stable-diffusion-3-release-excels-at-ai-generated-body-horror/">Stable Diffusion 3 Medium</a> in mid-June. Stability AI's offering faced widespread criticism among image-synthesis hobbyists for its poor performance in generating human anatomy, with users sharing examples of distorted limbs and bodies across social media. That problematic launch followed the earlier departure of three key engineers from Stability AI—Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, and Dominik Lorenz—who went on to found Black Forest Labs along with latent diffusion co-developer Patrick Esser and <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/our-team/">others</a>.</p>
<p>Black Forest Labs launched with the release of three FLUX.1 text-to-image models: a high-end commercial "pro" version, a mid-range "dev" version with open weights for non-commercial use, and a faster open-weights "schnell" version ("schnell" means quick or fast in German). Black Forest Labs claims its models outperform existing options like Midjourney and DALL-E in areas such as image quality and adherence to text prompts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040748#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040748&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Department of Justice is investigating Nvidia’s acquisition of Run:ai, an Israeli artificial intelligence startup, for potential antitrust violations, said a person familiar with discussions the government agency has had with third parties.</p>
<p>The DoJ has asked market participants about the competitive impact of the transaction, which Nvidia announced in April. The price was not disclosed but a report from TechCrunch estimated it at $700 million.</p>
<p>The scope of the probe remains unclear, the person said. But the DoJ has inquired about matters including whether the deal could quash emerging competition in the up-and-coming sector and entrench Nvidia’s dominant market position.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040841#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040841&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Naming a game must be incredibly hard. How many more <em>Dark Fallen Journeys </em>and <em>Noun: Verb of the Noun</em> games can fit into the market? And yet certain games just appear with a near-perfect, properly descriptive label.</p>
<p><em>Metropolis 1998</em> is just such a game, telling you what you'll be doing, how it will look and feel, and what era it harkens back to. You can verify this with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287430/Metropolis_1998/">its "pre-alpha" demo on Steam</a> and <a href="https://yesbox.itch.io/archapolis">Itch.io</a>. There's plenty more to come, but what is already in place is impressive. And it's simply pleasant to play, especially if you're the type who wants to make something entirely yours. Not just "put the park inside the commercial district," but <em>The Sims-</em>style "choose which wood color for the dining room table in a living room you framed up yourself."</p>
<p>You start out in a big field with no features (yet) and the sounds of birds chirping. Once you lay down a road, you can add things at a few different levels. You can, <em>SimCity</em>-style, simply plot out colored zones and let the people figure it out themselves. You can add pre-made buildings individually. Or you can really get in there, spacing out individual rooms, choosing the doors and windows and objects inside, and realizing how hard it is to shape multi-floor houses so the roof doesn't look grotesque. You can save the filled-out house for later reuse or just hold on to its core aspects as a blueprint.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040744#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040744&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Muscle-on-chip systems are three-dimensional human muscle cell bundles cultured on collagen scaffolds. A Stanford University research team sent some of these systems to the International Space Station to study the muscle atrophy commonly observed in astronauts.</p>
<p>It turns out that space triggers processes in human muscles that eerily resemble something we know very well: getting old. “We learned that microgravity mimics some of the qualities of accelerated aging,” said Ngan F. Huang, an associate professor at Stanford who led the study.</p>
<h2>Space-borne bioconstructs</h2>
<p>“This work originates from our lab’s expertise in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. We received funding to do a tissue engineering experiment on the ISS, which really helped us embark on this journey, and became curious how microgravity affects human health,” said Huang. So her team got busy designing the research equipment needed to work onboard the space station. The first step was building the muscle-on-chip systems.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040423#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040423&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Intel will be releasing a microcode update to prevent further damage to crashing 13th- and 14th-generation desktop processors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/intel-has-finally-tracked-down-the-problem-making-13th-and-14th-gen-cpus-crash/">sometime this month</a> if it can stick to its previously announced schedule. This fix should be available via BIOS updates from PC and motherboard makers and from Microsoft as a Windows update. But it will take time for those updates to roll out to users, and Intel has said that processors that are already exhibiting crashes have been permanently damaged and won't be fixed by the microcode update.</p>

<p>In an effort to provide peace of mind to buyers and cover anyone whose CPU is subtly damaged but not showing explicit signs of instability, Intel is extending the warranty on all affected 13th- and 14th-generation CPUs by an additional two years, Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-an-extra-two-years-of-warranty-for-its-chips-amid-crashing-and-instability-issues-longer-warranty-applies-to-13th-and-14th-gen-core-processors">reports</a>. This raises the warranty on a new boxed Intel CPU from three years to five. For processors that came installed in pre-built PCs, Intel says users should reach out to their PC's manufacturer for support instead.</p>
<p>Though owners of high-end chips like the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K were the most frequently affected by the crashing issue, Intel says that any 13th- or 14th-generation desktop CPU with a base power of 65 W or higher could ultimately be affected. This means that even slower, more budget-oriented chips like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/intels-core-i5-is-the-best-bargain-in-cpus-right-now-but-which-should-you-get/">Core i5-13400</a> could end up having problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040742#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040742&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/going-deep-with-the-book-8088-the-brand-new-laptop-that-runs-like-its-1981/">Book 8088</a> was a neat experiment, but as a clone of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/06/ibm-pc-history-part-1/">the original IBM PC</a>, it was pretty limited in what it could do. Early MS-DOS apps and games worked fine, and the very first Windows versions ran… technically. Just not the later ones that could actually run Windows software.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-ultimate-windows-3-1-laptop-sellers-behind-book-8088-are-back-with-pocket-386/">Pocket 386 laptop</a> is a lot like the Book 8088, but fast-forwarded to the next huge evolution in the PC’s development. Intel’s 80386 processors not only jumped from 16-bit operation to 32-bit, but they implemented different memory modes that could take advantage of many megabytes of memory while maintaining compatibility with apps that only recognized the first 640KB.</p>
<p>Expanded software compatibility makes this one more appealing to retro-computing enthusiasts since (like a vintage 386) it will do just about everything an 8088 can do, with the added benefit of a whole lot more speed and much better compatibility with seminal versions of Windows. It’s much more convenient to have all this hardware squeezed into a little laptop than in a big, clunky vintage desktop with slowly dying capacitors in it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034561#p3">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034561&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.05 of the Rocket Report! The Federal Aviation Administration grounded SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket for 15 days after a rare failure of its upper stage earlier this month. The FAA gave the green light for Falcon 9 to return to flight July 25, and within a couple of days, SpaceX successfully launched three missions from three launch pads. There's a lot on Falcon 9's to-do list, so we expect SpaceX to quickly return to form with several flights per week.</p>

<p><b>Big delay for a reusable rocket testbed. </b>The French space agency, CNES, has revealed that the inaugural test flight of its Callisto reusable rocket demonstrator will not take place until late 2025 or early 2026, <a href="https://europeanspaceflight.com/has-the-inaugural-callisto-test-flight-slipped-to-2026/">European Spaceflight reports</a>. CNES unveiled an updated website for the Callisto rocket program earlier this month, showing the test rocket has been delayed from a debut launch later this year to until late 2025 or early 2026. The Callisto rocket is designed to test techniques and technologies required for reusable rockets, such as vertical takeoff and vertical landing, with suborbital flights from the Guiana Space Center in South America.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040677#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040677&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There have been a handful of ancient Egyptian mummies discovered with their mouths wide open, as if mid-scream. This has puzzled archaeologists because Egyptian mummification typically involved bandaging the mandible to the skull to keep the mouth closed. Scientists have "virtually dissected" one such "Screaming Woman" mummy and concluded that the wide-open mouth is not the result of poor mummification, according to a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2024.1406225/full">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. There was no clear cause of death, but the authors suggest the mummy's expression could indicate she died in excruciating pain.</p>
<p>"The Screaming Woman is a true ‘time capsule’ of the way that she died and was mummified,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1052837?">said co-author Sahar Saleem</a>, a professor of radiology at Cairo University in Egypt. "Here we show that she was embalmed with costly, imported embalming material. This, and the mummy's well-preserved appearance, contradicts the traditional belief that a failure to remove her inner organs implied poor mummification."</p>
<p>Saleem has long been involved in paleoradiology and archaeometry of "screaming"  Egyptian mummies. For instance, she co-authored <a href="https://ejrnm.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43055-020-00255-6">a 2020 paper</a> applying similar techniques to the study of another "Screaming Woman" mummy, dubbed Unknown Woman A by the then-head of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, Gaston Maspero, and one of two such mummies discovered in the Royal Cache at Deir el Bahari near Luxor in 1881. This was where 21st and 22nd Dynasty priests would hide the remains of royal members from earlier dynasties to thwart grave robbers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039947#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039947&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As part of today’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/politics/russia-us-prisoner-swap/index.html">blockbuster prisoner swap</a> between the US and Russia, which freed the journalist Evan Gershkovich and several Russian opposition figures, Russia received in return a motley collection of serious criminals, including an assassin who had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/europe/russia-krasikov-prisoner-swap.html">executed an enemy of the Russian state in the middle of Berlin</a>.</p>
<p>But the Russians also got two hackers, Vladislav Klyushin and Roman Seleznev, each of whom had been convicted of major financial crimes in the US. The US government <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.232574/gov.uscourts.mad.232574.248.0.pdf">said</a> that Klyushin “stands convicted of the most significant hacking and trading scheme in American history, and one of the largest insider trading schemes ever prosecuted.” As for Seleznev, federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/technology/russian-hacker-sentenced.html">said</a> that he has “harmed more victims and caused more financial loss than perhaps any other defendant that has appeared before the court.”</p>
<p>What sort of hacker do you have to be to attract the interest of the Russian state in prisoner swaps like these? Clearly, it helps to have hacked widely and caused major damage to Russia’s enemies. By bringing these two men home, Russian leadership is sending a clear message to domestic hackers: We’ve got your back.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040698#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040698&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A small study in Texas suggests that human bird flu cases are being missed on dairy farms where the H5N1 virus has taken off in cows, sparking an unprecedented nationwide outbreak.</p>
<p>The finding adds some data to what many experts have suspected amid the outbreak. But the authors of the study, led by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, went further, stating bluntly why the US is failing to fully surveil, let alone contain, a virus with pandemic potential.</p>
<p>"Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few," the authors write in <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.27.24310982v1">the topline summary of their study</a>, which was posted online as a pre-print and had not been peer-reviewed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040675#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040675&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It has now been eight weeks since Boeing's Starliner spacecraft launched into orbit on an Atlas V rocket, bound for the International Space Station. At the time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-drama-filled-day-boeings-starliner-finally-finds-its-way/">NASA officials said</a> the two crew members, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, could return to Earth as soon as June 14, just eight days later.</p>
<p>Yes, there had been some problems on Starliner's ride to the space station that involved helium leaks and failing thrusters. But officials said they were relatively minor and sought to downplay them. "Those are pretty small, really, issues to deal with," Mark Nappi, vice president and manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, said during a post-docking news conference. "We’ll figure them out for the next mission. I don’t see these as significant at all."</p>
<p>But days turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months as NASA and Boeing continued to study the two technical problems. Of these issues, the more pressing concern was the failure of multiple reaction control system thrusters that are essential to steering Starliner during its departure from the space station and setting up a critical engine burn to enter Earth's atmosphere.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040615#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040615&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
