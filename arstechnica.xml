              <![CDATA[<p>Most astronauts these days are fairly anonymous, and chances are you have never heard of Nichole Ayers. And that's OK.</p>
<p>But sometimes it's worth pausing for a moment to reflect on just how accomplished these people are. Ayers, 36, flew the supersonic F-22 stealth aircraft in the international war against the Islamic State and rose to become a major in the US Air Force before being selected as a NASA astronaut in 2021. Oh, yeah, she also completed a master's degree in computational and applied mathematics at Rice University.</p>
<p>For her first spaceflight, Ayers launched on the Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station in March. This flight got a fair amount of media attention, but that was largely because the arrival of Crew-10 allowed the Crew Dragon spacecraft to which Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were assigned to return home. Since then, Ayers has spent 50 days in space, astronauting. This included a spacewalk last week, her first, alongside veteran astronaut Anne McClain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/tuesday-telescope-its-not-space-weather-but-weather-from-space/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A California man has pleaded guilty to hacking an employee of The Walt Disney Company by tricking the person into running a malicious version of a widely used open source AI image-generation tool.</p>
<p>Ryan Mitchell Kramer, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, the US Attorney for the Central District of California <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/santa-clarita-man-agrees-plead-guilty-hacking-disney-employees-computer-downloading">said Monday</a>. In a plea agreement, Kramer said he published an app on GitHub for creating AI-generated art. The program contained malicious code that gave access to computers that installed it. Kramer operated using the moniker NullBulge.</p>
<h2>Not the ComfyUI you’re looking for</h2>
<p>According to researchers at <a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/news/comfyui-malicious-custom-node/">VPNMentor</a>, the program Kramer used was ComfyUI_LLMVISION, which purported to be an extension for the legitimate <a href="https://comfy.icu/">ComfyUI</a> image generator and had functions added to it for copying passwords, payment card data, and other sensitive information from machines that installed it. The fake extension then sent the data to a Discord server that Kramer operated. To better disguise the malicious code, it was folded into files that used the names OpenAI and Anthropic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/man-pleads-guilty-to-using-malicious-ai-software-to-hack-disney-employee/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In a hard-to-watch video, a healthy-looking 4-year-old boy lies on a bed as doctors lift his eyelids to watch his big brown eyes erratically swirl and roll backward. His head jerks, and his little limbs weakly twitch and spasm. A small bit of foam pushes past his lips.</p>
<p>The video, captured by neurologists in India and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2833454">published today in JAMA Neurology</a>, shows what it looks like when the measles virus is allowed to ravage a child's brain. (The video can be viewed <a href="https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18967853">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The boy was never vaccinated and developed a rare complication from measles called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The condition occurs when the measles virus quietly sneaks into the central nervous system. It often lurks for years after an initial infection before it begins wreaking havoc, triggering damaging inflammation, destroying neurons, and causing brain lesions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/heartbreaking-video-shows-deadly-risk-of-skipping-measles-vaccine/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A messaging service used by former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has temporarily shut down while the company investigates an apparent hack. The messaging app is used to access and archive Signal messages but is not made by Signal itself.</p>
<p>404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/">reported</a> yesterday that a hacker stole data "from TeleMessage, an obscure Israeli company that sells modified versions of Signal and other messaging apps to the US government to archive messages." 404 Media interviewed the hacker and reported that the data stolen "contains the contents of some direct messages and group chats sent using [TeleMessage's] Signal clone, as well as modified versions of WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat."</p>
<p>TeleMessage is based in Israel and was <a href="https://www.smarsh.com/press-release/smarsh-completes-acquisition-of-telemessage-extends-communications-compliance-leadership">acquired in February 2024</a> by Smarsh, a company headquartered in Portland, Oregon.

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/evolving-our-structure/">announced</a> it will remain under the control of its founding nonprofit board, scrapping its controversial plan to split off its commercial operations as a for-profit company after mounting pressure from critics.</p>
<p>In an official OpenAI blog post announcing the latest restructuring decision, CEO Sam Altman wrote: "We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware."</p>
<p>The move represents a significant shift in OpenAI's proposed restructuring. While the most recent previous version of the company's plan (which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/openai-defends-for-profit-shift-as-critical-to-sustain-humanitarian-mission/">we covered</a> in December) would have established OpenAI as a Public Benefit Corporation with the nonprofit merely holding shares and having limited influence, the revised approach keeps the nonprofit firmly in control of operations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-scraps-controversial-plan-to-become-for-profit-after-mounting-pressure/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google's accelerated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">Android release cycle</a> will soon deliver a new version of the software, and it might look quite different from what you'd expect. Amid rumors of a major UI overhaul, Google seems to have accidentally published a blog post detailing "Material 3 Expressive," which we expect to see revealed at I/O later this month. Google quickly removed the post from its design site, but not before the Internet Archive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250501004611/https://design.google/library/expressive-material-design-google-research">saved it</a>.</p>
<p>It has been a few years since Google introduced any major changes to its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/android-12s-beautiful-color-changing-ui-already-lives-up-to-the-hype/">Material theming</a>, but the design team wasn't just sitting idly this whole time. According to the leaked blog post, Google has spent the past three years working on a more emotionally engaging vision for Android design. While the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/android-ls-app-design-early-looks-at-youtube-gmail-maps-and-more/">original Material Design</a> did an admirable job of leveraging colors and consistent theming, it could make apps look too similar. The answer to that, apparently, is Material 3 Expressive.</p>

<p>Google says this is "the most-researched update to Google’s design system, ever." The effort reportedly included 46 separate studies with hundreds of sample designs. The team showed these designs to more than 18,000 study participants to understand how the user experience would work. In these studies, the design team used a variety of metrics, including the following:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-accidentally-reveals-androids-material-3-expressive-interface-ahead-of-i-o/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of e-commerce sites, at least one owned by a large multinational company, were backdoored by malware that executes malicious code inside the browsers of visitors, where it can steal payment card information and other sensitive data, security researchers said Monday.</p>
<p>The infections are the result of a supply-chain attack that compromised at least three software providers with malware that remained dormant for six years and became active only in the last few weeks. At least 500 e-commerce sites that rely on the backdoored software were infected, and it’s possible that the true number is double that, researchers from security firm Sansec <a href="https://sansec.io/research/license-backdoor">said</a>.</p>
<p>Among the compromised customers was a $40 billion multinational company, which Sansec didn’t name. In an email Monday, a Sansec representative said that “global remediation [on the infected customers] remains limited.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/hundreds-of-e-commerce-sites-hacked-in-supply-chain-attack/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In 2022, we told you about a study <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/ancient-peruvians-partied-hard-spiked-their-beer-with-hallucinogens-to-win-friends/">reporting</a> evidence that an ancient Peruvian people called the Wari laced the beer served at their feasts with hallucinogens—particularly a substance derived from the seeds of the vilca tree, which was common in the region during the Middle Horizon period (circa 850 CE) when the Wari empire thrived. This may have helped the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wari_culture">Wari</a> forge political alliances and expand their empire.</p>
<p>Now archaeologists have discovered direct evidence that the use of vilca was a common practice some 1,000 years earlier than the Wari, thanks to analysis of artifacts unearthed at Chavín de Huántar, located about 250 kilometers north of Lima, Peru. And the Chavín people may have used it for a different purpose: to reinforce social hierarchies by limiting consumption of those substances to an elite few, according to a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/study-confirms-egyptians-likely-used-hallucinogens-in-rituals/">ancient Egypt</a>, as well as ancient Greek, Vedic, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/study-the-maya-blessed-their-ball-courts-in-rituals-with-hallucinogenic-plants/">Maya</a>, Inca, and Aztec cultures. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urarina">Urarina</a> people who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca">ayahuasca</a> in their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have been known to participate. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wari_Empire">Wari empire</a> lasted from around 500 CE to 1100 CE in the central highlands of Peru.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/only-elites-used-hallucinogens-in-ancient-andes-society/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, and now its journey is over.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Today is the day: Microsoft has formally shuttered the Skype app and service after announcing in February that Skype was being axed in favor of Microsoft Teams, the company's Slack competitor.</p>
<p>The Skype apps have all been advertising the end of the service and pointing users to Teams for weeks now. As of today, if you open the app or navigate <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">to the Skype site</a>, you'll be directed to use Teams instead. The last active vestige of Skype is the <a href="https://calling.web.skype.com/">Skype Dial Pad</a>, which Skype subscribers and members with Skype Credits can still use to make calls to traditional telephone numbers (the Dial Pad is also incorporated into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/free?msockid=220be8a57ee56b8b14cefc597fe16aaf">Microsoft Teams Free</a>).</p>
<p>It's an unceremonious end for an app that was once synonymous with video calls. Microsoft originally bought Skype <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/05/microsoft-confirms-85-bn-skype-purchase-clarifies-nothing/">for $8.5 billion in 2011</a>; it was also owned by eBay from 2005 to 2009 and by a group of venture capital firms between 2009 and 2011. Ironically, Microsoft bought the app to replace its own first-party communication client at the time, Windows Live Messenger (which itself had grown out of the old MSN Messenger).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsoft-officially-shuts-down-skype-redirects-all-app-users-to-teams/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Assistance from an external "agent harness" was key to the model's success.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, we took a look at how and why <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">Anthropic's Claude large language model was struggling to beat <em>Pokémon Red</em></a> (a game, let's remember, designed for young children). But while Claude 3.7 is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon">still struggling to make consistent progress at the game</a> weeks later, a similar <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon">Twitch-streamed effort using Google's Gemini 2.5 model</a> managed to finally complete <em>Pokémon Blue</em> this weekend across over 106,000 in-game actions, earning accolades from followers, <a href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1918455766542930004?t=8NLgn42y3kAqUbZVhg4zLw&amp;s=19">including Google CEO Sundar Pichai</a>.</p>
<p>Before you start using this achievement as a way to compare the relative performance of these two AI models—or even the advancement of LLM capabilities over time—there are some important caveats to keep in mind. As it happens, Gemini needed some fairly significant outside help on its path to eventual Pokémon victory.</p>
<h2>Strap in to the agent harness</h2>
<p>Gemini Plays Pokémon developer JoelZ (who's unaffiliated with Google) will be the first to tell you that Pokémon is ill-suited as a reliable benchmark for LLM models. As he <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon">writes on the project's Twitch FAQ</a>, "please don't consider this a benchmark for how well an LLM can play Pokémon. You can't really make direct comparisons—Gemini and Claude have different tools and receive different information. ... Claude's framework has many shortcomings so I wanted to see how far Gemini could get if it were given the right tools."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/why-google-geminis-pokemon-success-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration filed an emergency application on Friday asking the Supreme Court to restore DOGE's access to Social Security Administration records. A lower-court order that prohibited DOGE's access is causing "irreparable harm to the executive branch" and thwarting DOGE's attempts to "eliminate waste and fraud," US Solicitor General John Sauer <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A1063/358032/20250502151449738_SSA%20v.%20AFSCME%20stay%20final%20with%20appendix.pdf">wrote in the appeal</a>.</p>
<p>"The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing such waste and fraud from performing their jobs," Sauer told the Supreme Court. The preliminary injunction that is currently in place halted "the Executive Branch's critically important efforts to improve its information-technology infrastructure and eliminate waste," the brief said.</p>
<p>The appeal was lodged in a case filed by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the Alliance for Retired Americans; and American Federation of Teachers. Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24a1063.html#:~:text=Response%20to%20application%20(24A1063)%20requested%20by%20The%20Chief%20Justice">asked</a> them to file a response to the US by May 12.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/after-two-court-losses-doge-asks-supreme-court-for-social-security-data-access/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An update to Roku OS has resulted in colors looking washed out in HDR content viewed on Roku apps, like Disney+.</p>
<p>Complaints started surfacing on Roku's <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/m-p/1068784/highlight/true#M8212">community forum</a> a week ago. On May 1, a company representative posted that Roku was “investigating the Disney Plus HDR content that was washed out after the recent update.” However, based on user feedback, it seems that HDR on additional Roku apps, including Apple TV+ and Netflix, are also affected. Roku’s representative has been asking users to share their experiences so that Roku can dig deeper into the problem.</p>
<p>One user, going by "Squinky" on the forum, reported having a TCL TV with the problem and shared the following photo comparison:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/software-update-makes-hdr-content-unwatchable-on-roku-tvs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The most popular online destination for deepfake porn shut down permanently this weekend, 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/mr-deepfakes-the-biggest-deepfake-porn-site-on-the-internet-says-its-shutting-down-for-good/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>"Mr. Deepfakes" drew a swarm of toxic users who, researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2410.11100v1">noted,</a> were willing to pay as much as $1,500 for creators to use advanced face-swapping techniques to make celebrities or other targets appear in non-consensual pornographic videos. At its peak, researchers found that 43,000 videos were viewed more than 1.5 billion times on the platform. The videos were generated by nearly 4,000 creators, who profited from the unethical—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trumps-rush-to-stop-revenge-porn-and-ai-nudes-may-break-encryption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and now illegal</a>—sales.</p>
<p>But as of this weekend, none of those videos are available to view, and the forums where requests were made for new videos went dark, 404 Media reported. According to a notice posted on the platform, the plug was pulled when "a critical service provider" terminated the service "permanently."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/largest-deepfake-porn-site-shuts-down-forever/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a brief reprieve, Formula 1's teams were back at it this past weekend at the Miami Grand Prix. It was the first of three stops in the US and five in North America as F1 capitalizes on its current wave of popularity here. The sport evidently believes something is going right—it just announced a contract extension that will see the event remain on the calendar for another 16 years.</p>
<p>The Miami race is among the latest of F1's new breed of Grands Prix. It was originally supposed to be more of a true street circuit like Baku or Singapore or Las Vegas, with a route that crossed over a bridge into South Beach. But the track is laid out around the various parking lots of Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, like a 21st-century version of the early '80s Caesars Palace Grands Prix or the now-defunct Sochi race that wound its way around Vladimir Putin's favorite sea-side theme park.</p>
<p>Ticket prices appear to have come down a little now that the race is in its third year, but the "beach club" and Potemkin marina remain, even if they didn't look particularly busy on any of the overhead shots. Despite what looked like sparse attendance on Friday and Saturday, we're told that 275,000 people attended across the weekend.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/f1-in-miami-were-doing-this-until-at-least-2041/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/">National Hurricane Center</a>’s forecasts in 2024 <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/pdfs/Verification_2024.pdf">were its most accurate on record</a>, from its one-day forecasts, as tropical cyclones neared the coast, to its forecasts five days into the future, when storms were only beginning to come together.</p>
<p>Thanks to federally funded research, forecasts of tropical cyclone tracks today are up to <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/pdfs/Verification_2024.pdf">75 percent more accurate</a> than they were in 1990. A National Hurricane Center forecast three days out today is about as accurate as a one-day forecast in 2002, giving people in the storm’s path more time to prepare and reducing the size of evacuations.</p>
<p>Accuracy will be crucial again in 2025, as meteorologists <a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html">predict another active Atlantic hurricane season</a>, which runs from June 1 to November 30.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/on-cusp-of-storm-season-noaa-funding-cuts-put-hurricane-forecasting-at-risk/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Shortly after sunrise on a late summer morning nearly nine years ago at SpaceX's sole operational launch pad, engineers neared the end of a static fire test. These were still early days for their operation of a Falcon 9 rocket that used super-chilled liquid propellants, and engineers pressed to see how quickly they could complete fueling. This was because the liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel warmed quickly in Florida's sultry air, and cold propellants were essential to maximizing the rocket's performance.</p>
<p>On this morning, September 1, 2016, everything proceeded more or less nominally up until eight minutes before the ignition of the rocket's nine Merlin engines. It was a stable point in the countdown, so no one expected what happened next.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-pushed-sniper-theory-with-the-feds-far-more-than-is-publicly-known/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Plus: Kyle and Andrew discuss '80s pop covers and free jazz. No, seriously...]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here after they air</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: We start this episode from the perspective of a band of highly armed FEDRA agents in 2018 Seattle, shooting the shit in a transport that somehow still has usable gasoline. Maybe it's just the political moment we're in, but I was not quite emotionally prepared for these militarized characters in my post-apocalyptic escape show to start casually using "voters" as an ironic signifier for regular people.</p>
<p>"LOL, like we'd ever let them vote, amirite?"</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: We've spent so little time with FEDRA—the post-collapse remnant of what had once been the US government—since the very opening episodes of the show that you can forget exactly why nearly every other individual and organization in the show's world hates it and wants nothing to do with it. But here's a reminder for us: casual cruelty, performed by ignorant fascists.</p>
<p>Of course as soon as you see and hear Jeffrey Wright, you know he's going to be A Guy (he's an HBO alum from <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> and <em>Westworld</em>, among many, many other film, TV, vocal, and stage performances). He just as casually betrays and blows up the transport full of jumped-up FEDRA jarheads, which is a clear prestige TV storytelling signifier. Here is a Man With A Code, but also a Man To Be Feared.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, Isaac's backstory was only broadly hinted at in the games, so getting to see this big "Who This Character Is" moment in the show was pretty effective.</p>
<p>What I found less effective was Ellie playing a very able A-Ha cover when she discovers the abandoned guitar room. In the game it serves as a welcome change of pace from a lot of frenetic action, and a good excuse for an endearing guitar-playing mini-game. Here it felt like it just kind of dragged on, with a lot of awkward dwelling on close-ups of Dina's creepily enamored face.</p>

<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: You know what, though, I do appreciate that the show at least made an effort to explain why this 30-year-old guitar was still in pristine condition. I don't <em>instantly</em> buy that the silica gel packets (which Ellie, wisely, does not eat) in the guitar case would have lasted for that long, but at least she didn't pull a mossy guitar straight off the wall and start tuning it up. Those strings are gonna corrode! That neck is gonna warp!</p>
<p>I do also think the show (and the game, I guess, picking up your context clues) got away with picking one of the goofiest songs they possibly could that would still read as "soulful and emotionally resonant" when played solo on acoustic guitar. But I suppose that's always been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c745E7T_Wvg">the power of that particular instrument</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Both the game and the show have leaned heavily on the '80s nostalgia that Joel passed on to Ellie, and as a child of the '80s, I'll be damned if I said it doesn't work on me on that level.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: It's also, for what it's worth, exactly what a beginner-to-intermediate guitar player is going to know how to do. If I find a guitar during an apocalypse, all people are going to be able to get out of me are mid-2000s radio singles with easy chord progressions. It's too bad that society didn't last long enough in this reality to produce "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Not to cut short "Guitar Talk," but the show cuts it off with a creepy scene of Isaac talking about high-end cookware to an initially unseen companion on the floor. The resulting scene of torture is, for my money, way worse than most anything we're exposed to in the games—and these are games that are not exactly squeamish about showing scenes of torture and extreme violence!</p>
<p>Felt to me like they're taking advantage of HBO's reputation for graphic content just because they could, here...</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Definitely gratuitous! But not totally without storytelling utility. I do think, if you're setting Isaac up to be a mid-season miniboss on the road to the Dramatic Confrontation with Abby, that you've got to make it especially clear that he is capable of really nasty things. Sure, killing a truckful of guys is ALSO bad, but they were guys that we as viewers are all supposed to hate. Torturing a defenseless man reinforces the perception of him as someone that Ellie and Dina do <em>not</em> want to meet, especially now that they've popped a couple of his guys.</p>
<p>Because Ellie and Dina have unwittingly wandered into the middle of a Seattle civil war of sorts, between Isaac and his militarized WLF members and the face-cutting cultists we briefly met in the middle of last episode. And while the WLF types do seem to have the cult outgunned, we are told here that WLF members are slowly defecting to the cult (rather than the other way around).</p>

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I will say I appreciated the surprisingly cogent history of the "chicken and egg games" beef between the two factions, as discussed between torturer and torture victim. Definitely a memorable bit of world-building.</p>
<p>But then we're quickly back to the kind of infected attack scene that now seems practically contractually obligated to happen at least once an episode. At this point, I think these kinds of massive setpiece zombie battles would work better as a light seasoning than a thick sauce that just gets dumped on us almost every week.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: People in and from Seattle seem to have a unique gift for kicking up otherwise dormant swarms of infected! I know we'll get back to it eventually, but I was more intrigued by the first episode's reveal of more strategic infected that seemed to be retaining more of their human traits than I am by these screaming mindless hordes. Here, I think the tension is also ratcheted up artificially by Ellie's weird escape strategy, which is to lead the two of them through a series of dead ends and cul-de-sacs before finally, barely, getting away.</p>
<p>But like you said, gotta have zombies on the zombie show! And it does finally make the "Dina finds out that Ellie is immune" shoe drop, though Dina doesn't seem ready to think through any of the other implications of that reveal just yet. She has her own stuff going on!</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yes, I've had to resist my inclination to do the remote equivalent of nudging you in the ribs to see if you had picked up on the potential "morning sickness" explanation of Dina's frequent vomiting (which was hidden decently amid the "vomiting because of seeing horrifying gore" explanation).</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It does explain a couple of things! It does seem like a bit of a narrative shortcut to make Ellie extremely invested in Dina and whether she lives or dies, and given this show I am worried that this zygote is only going to be used to create more trauma for Ellie, rather than giving us a nuanced look at parenting during an apocalypse. But it is sweet to see how enthusiastically and immediately Ellie gets invested.</p>
<p>A question for you, while spoiling as little as you can: Are we still mostly just adapting the game at this point? You'd mentioned getting more Isaac backstory (sometimes the show expands on backstories well and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-episode-8-ruins-one-of-the-games-best-villains/">sometimes it doesn't</a>), and some things have happened a bit out of order. But my impression is that we haven't gotten a full departure a la the Nick Offerman episode from last season yet.</p>

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: At this point it's kind of like a jazz riff on what happens in the game, with some bits copied note for note, some remixed and thrown into entirely different temporal locations, and some fresh new improv thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>I'm definitely not a "the game is canon and you must interpret it literally" type of person, but the loose treatment is giving me a bit of whiplash. The reveal of Dina's pregnancy, for instance, is not greeted with nearly as much immediate joy in the games. That said, the moment of joy Ellie and Dina <em>do</em> share here feels transplanted (in tone if nothing else) from an earlier game scene that the show had mostly skipped thus far. It's like free association, man. Dig it!</p>
<p>The show also spends an inordinate amount of time discussing how pregnancy tests work in the post-apocalypse, which for me pushed past world-building and into overexplaining. It's OK to just let stuff be sometimes, y'know?</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It's jazz, man. It's about the zombies you <em>don't</em> kill.</p>
<p>However it's been rearranged, I can still tell I'm watching a video game adaptation, because there are stealth kills and because important information is conveyed via messages and logos scrawled in blood on the walls. But I am still enjoying myself, and doing <em>slightly</em> less minute-to-minute missing of Joel than I did last episode. Slightly.</p>
<p>The episode ends with Ellie and Dina hearing the name of someone who has the same name as someone who knew Abby over a WLF walkie-talkie they nabbed, which gives them their next objective marker for Abby Quest. But they've got to cross an active war zone to get where they're going (though I couldn't tell from that distance whether we're meant to be able to tell exactly who is fighting who at the moment). Guess I'll have to wait and see!</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personally, I'm hoping we see the moment where the newly out-and-proud bisexual Dina finally realizes "what's the deal with all the rainbows." Show your post-apocalyptic pride, girl!</div>

              <![CDATA[<p>It looks like Marvel has another critical and box office hit on its hands—and deservedly so—with <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolts*">Thunderbolts*</a>,</em> a follow-up of sorts to 2021's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/black-widow-review-scarjos-sendoff-is-mcus-best-standalone-film-yet/"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and the final film in the MCU's Phase Five.</p>
<p>Yes, the asterisk is part of the title. Yes, I found that choice inexplicable when it was first announced. And yes, having seen the film, the asterisk makes perfect sense now as a well-timed joke. I won't spill the beans because that would spoil the fun. Instead, I'll simply say that <em>Thunderbolts*</em> is a refreshing return to peak Marvel form: well-paced, witty, and action-packed with enough heart to ensure you care about the characters.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For many, many years, I wouldn't get a new game console until a couple years after it launched. This was partly because I wanted any new console I bought to have a decent-sized library of things to play, and partly because it sometimes paid to sit back and see which console was going to "win" the generation in terms of first-party exclusives and third-party developer support.</p>
<p>But mostly it was because, from the Atari VCS in the '70s all the way up through the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation in the 2010s, you could always count on game consoles getting cheaper as time went on. Those price reductions would often also come with internal tweaks and external redesigns—smaller or slimmer or otherwise improved versions of the console that made them superior to the originals (though you would occasionally lose a lesser-used feature or two along the way).</p>
<p>But both of those things have mostly stopped. The last permanent price drop for a major home or portable console we could find came back in 2016, when the PS4 Slim launched and dropped the price of entry from $349 to $299 (this doesn't count the launch of new editions of consoles with reduced feature sets, like the New Nintendo 2DS in 2017 or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-month-later-249-all-digital-xbox-one-s-still-seems-unsustainable/">$249 all-digital Xbox One</a> in 2019). This generation, we've seen something that would have been unheard of a few years ago: price <em>increases </em>for consoles, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">$50 extra for the new OLED edition</a> of the Nintendo Switch in 2021, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/ps5-slim-teardowns-suggest-same-chip-not-much-shrinking-but-nifty-disc-drive/">$50 price hike</a> for the slimmer disc-drive-less version of the PlayStation 5 in 2023, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">$80 to $100 price hikes</a> for the exact same unimproved versions of the Xbox Series S and X earlier this week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A young entrepreneur who was among the earliest known recruiters for Elon Musk’s so-called <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-mystery-general-services-administration/">Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</a> has a new, related gig—and he’s hiring. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/">Anthony Jancso</a>, cofounder of AcclerateX, a government tech startup, is looking for technologists to work on a project that aims to have artificial intelligence perform tasks that are currently the responsibility of tens of thousands of federal workers.</p>
<p>Jancso, a former Palantir employee, wrote in a Slack with about 2000 Palantir alumni in it that he’s hiring for a “DOGE orthogonal project to design benchmarks and deploy AI agents across live workflows in federal agencies,” according to an April 21 post reviewed by WIRED. Agents are programs that can perform work autonomously.</p>
<p>We’ve identified over 300 roles with almost full-process standardization, freeing up at least 70k FTEs for higher-impact work over the next year,” he continued, essentially claiming that tens of thousands of federal employees could see many aspects of their job automated and replaced by these AI agents. Workers for the project, he wrote, would be based on site in Washington, DC, and would not require a security clearance; it isn’t clear for whom they would work. Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/a-doge-recruiter-is-staffing-a-project-to-deploy-ai-agents-across-the-us-government/">Read full article</a></p>
