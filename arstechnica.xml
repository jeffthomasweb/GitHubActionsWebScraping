<p>The TV business isn't just about selling TVs anymore. Companies are increasingly seeing viewers, not TV sets, as their most lucrative asset.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, TV makers have seen rising financial success from TV operating systems that can show viewers ads and analyze their responses. Rather than selling as many TVs as possible, brands like LG, Samsung, Roku, and Vizio are increasingly, if not primarily, seeking recurring revenue from already-sold TVs via ad sales and tracking.</p>
<p>How did we get here? And what implications does an ad- and data-obsessed industry have for the future of TVs and the people watching them?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027078#p3">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027078&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Moon may not have much of an atmosphere, mostly because of its weak gravitational field (whether it had a substantial atmosphere billions of years ago is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X17304971?via%3Dihub">debatable</a>). But it is thought to presently be maintaining its tenuous atmosphere—also known as an exosphere—because of meteorite impacts.</p>
<p>Space rocks have been bombarding the Moon for its 4.5-billion-year existence. Researchers from MIT and the University of Chicago have now found that lunar soil samples collected by astronauts during the Apollo era show evidence that meteorites, from hulking meteors to micrometeoroids no bigger than specks of dust, have launched a steady flow of atoms into the exosphere.</p>
<p>Though some of these atoms escape into space and others fall back to the surface, those that do remain above the Moon create a thin atmosphere that keeps being replenished as more meteorites crash into the surface.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043696#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043696&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A US judge has temporarily blocked the launch of a sports streaming service formed by Disney’s ESPN, Warner Bros and Fox, finding that it was likely to “substantially lessen competition” in the market.</p>
<p>The service, dubbed Venu, was expected to launch later this year. But FuboTV, a sports-focused streaming platform, filed an antitrust suit in February to block it, arguing its business would “suffer irreparable harm” as a result.</p>
<p>On Friday, US District Judge Margaret Garnett in New York granted an injunction to halt the launch of the service while Fubo’s lawsuit against the entertainment giants works its way through the court.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043960#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043960&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's no secret that despite significant investment from companies like OpenAI and Runway, AI-generated videos still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/we-made-a-cat-drink-a-beer-with-runways-ai-video-generator-and-it-sprouted-hands/">struggle to achieve</a> convincing realism at times. Some of the <a href="https://x.com/CharaspowerAI/status/1819443246478610618">most amusing fails</a> end up on social media, which has led to a new response trend on Chinese social media platforms TikTok and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili">Bilibili</a> where users create videos that mock the imperfections of AI-generated content. The trend has since spread to X (formerly Twitter) in the US, where users have been sharing the humorous parodies.</p>

<p>In particular, the videos seem to parody image synthesis videos where subjects <a href="https://x.com/CharaspowerAI/status/1819443246478610618">seamlessly morph</a> into other people or objects in unexpected and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SipsTea/comments/1ashf65/ai_videos_are_weird/">physically impossible</a> ways. Chinese social media replicate these unusual visual non-sequiturs without special effects by positioning their bodies in unusual ways as new and unexpected objects appear on-camera from out of frame.</p>
<p>This exaggerated mimicry has struck a chord with viewers on X, who find the parodies entertaining. User @theGioM <a href="https://x.com/theGioM/status/1824000938870292771">shared one video</a>, seen above. "<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">This is high-level performance arts," <a href="https://x.com/ArtsRayne/status/1824103991233712424">wrote</a> one X user. "art is imitating life imitating ai, almost shedded a tear." Another <a href="https://x.com/vanamerongen/status/1824071986517041609">commented</a>, </span>"I feel like it still needs a motorcycle the turns into a speedboat and takes off into the sky.

<p>It's been four years since <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the world's most popular games, was pulled from the Apple App Store in a blaze of controversy and finger-pointing. Today, it's returning to the iPhone—but only in the European Union.</p>
<p>Today marks the launch of the Epic Games Store on Android and iOS—iOS just in Europe, Android worldwide. Right now, it just has three games: <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em>, and <em>Fall Guys</em>. And you'll have to be in Europe to access it on your iPhone.</p>
<p>The Epic Games Store is run by Epic Games, the same company that develops and publishes <em>Fortnite</em>. Most folks who have been paying attention to either Epic or Apple in recent years knows the story at this point, but here's the quick summary and analysis.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043896#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043896&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A text parser? Typing in “Open drawer,” then “Look in drawer,” then “Take brochures,” in the year 2024, on a computer that can generate a 4K 3D model of the Acropolis if I ask it to? Is that really what <i><a href="https://www.thecrimsondiamond.com/">The Crimson Diamond</a></i> asks of us?</p>
<p>Yes, it is, and solo developer/writer/producer Julia Minamata is right to ask it. If you have text-prompt adventures from the likes of Sierra in your mental library (like, say, <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_colonels_bequest">The Colonel's Bequest)</a></em>, or if you’re willing to meet the parser halfway, it will work. <i>The Crimson Diamond</i>’s parser is fairly agile, accepting a range of nouns and verbs in most circumstances. You can still use arrow keys and a mouse to move and click a few useful shortcuts. And the parser has shortcuts, like typing “n” to look at your quest-tracking notebook or “o d” or “o c” for the very common actions of opening a door or cabinet.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cabinets and drawers in this game because it’s set in northern Ontario, Canada, in 1914. You are Nancy Maple, a junior geologist eager for some field work, sent by your museum to the mining town of Crimson to investigate a diamond that fell out of a river fish’s guts. Everything goes wrong with your trip, and you’re on your own to investigate this town, its odd inhabitants and visitors, and, eventually, a crime that may or may not have to do with potential diamonds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043870#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043870&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A plague of parasitic mites has descended upon Illinois in the wake of this year's historic crop of cicadas, leaving residents with raging rashes and incessant itching.</p>
<p>The mighty attack follows the overlapping emergence of the 17-year Brood XIII and the 13-year Brood XIX this past spring, <a href="https://cicadas.uconn.edu/">a specific co-emergence that only occurs every 221 years</a>. The cacophonous boom in cicadas sparked an explosion of mites, which can feast on various insects, including the developing eggs of periodical cicadas. But, when the mites' food source fizzles out, the mites bite any humans in their midst in hopes of finding their next meal. While the mites cannot live on humans, their biting leads to scratching. The mite, <em>Pyemotes herfsi</em>, is aptly dubbed the "itch mite."</p>

<p>As we wait for this fall's Windows 11 24H2 update to be released to the general public, work continues on other new features that could be part of other future Windows updates. A new Canary channel Windows Insider build <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/08/15/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27868-canary-channel/">released yesterday</a> fixes a decades-old and arbitrary limitation that restricted new FAT32 partitions to 32GB in size, even though the filesystem itself has a maximum supported size of 2TB (and Windows can read and recognize 2TB FAT32 partitions without an issue).</p>
<p>For now, this limit is only being lifted for the command-line formatting tools in Windows. The disk formatting UI, which looks more or less the same now as it did when it was introduced in Windows NT 4.0 almost 30 years ago, still has the arbitrary 32GB capacity restriction.</p>

<p>The 32GB limit can allegedly be pinned on former Microsoft programmer Dave Plummer, who occasionally shares stories about his time working on Windows in the 1990s and early 2000s. Plummer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/windows-current-disk-formatting-ui-is-a-30-year-old-placeholder-from-windows-nt/">says</a> that he wrote the file format dialog, intending it as a "temporary" solution, and arbitrarily chose 32GB as a size limit for disks, likely because it seemed big enough at the time (Windows NT 4.0 required a whopping 110MB of disk space).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043819#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043819&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A large Internet service provider wants the Supreme Court to rule that ISPs shouldn't have to disconnect broadband users who have been accused of piracy. Cable firm Cox Communications, which is trying to overturn a ruling in a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Sony, <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Cox-v-Sony-Cert-Petition-8.15-Final.pdf">petitioned</a> the Supreme Court to take up the case yesterday.</p>
<p>Cox <a href="https://newsroom.cox.com/Cox_Petitions_Supreme_Court">said in a press release</a> that a recent appeals court ruling "would force ISPs to terminate Internet service to households or businesses based on unproven allegations of infringing activity, and put them in a position of having to police their networks—contrary to customer expectations... Terminating Internet service would not just impact the individual accused of unlawfully downloading content, it would kick an entire household off the Internet."</p>
<p>The case began in 2018 when Sony and other music copyright holders sued Cox, claiming that it didn't adequately fight piracy on its network and failed to terminate repeat infringers. A US District Court jury in the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/12/cox-communications-hit-with-1-billion-verdict-over-music-piracy/">ruled in December 2019</a> that Cox must pay $1 billion in damages to the major record labels.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043862#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043862&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Those of us who collect classic game consoles and computers (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gear-envy-my-collection-of-500-plus-pieces-of-computer-and-gaming-hardware">here's looking at you, AI reporter Benj Edwards</a>) know the difficulty of keeping all that hardware not just working but instantly accessible with a simple press of a power button. Too often, large hardware collections end up languishing, boxed up on shelves, or sitting loose and unconnected to a display for long periods.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Ibrahim Al-Nasser grew tired of having that problem with his massive gaming collection, so he decided to hook 444 different gaming devices up to a single TV, <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/8/gaming-is-serious-business-for-man-with-444-consoles-hooked-up-to-one-tv">earning a Guinness World Record in the process</a>.</p>
<p>"After a while, I noticed that I had a big stack of gaming consoles that I couldn’t play," Al-Nasser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLaTSb8k518">said in a video filmed by Guinness</a>. "The TV ports are limited, and if I want to play, I either unplug the existing consoles or I'll keep everything and add more switchers and of course more converters as well. By adding more switchers, the idea came to my mind to connect all of the gaming consoles I have to the TV, then contact Guinness World Records because this project is unique."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043824#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043824&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>San Francisco's city attorney David Chiu is <a href="https://www.sfcityattorney.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Complaint_Final_Redacted.pdf">suing</a> to shut down 16 of the most popular websites and apps allowing users to "nudify" or "undress" photos of mostly women and girls who have been increasingly harassed and exploited by bad actors online.</p>
<p>These sites, Chiu's suit claimed, are "intentionally" designed to "create fake, nude images of women and girls without their consent," boasting that any users can upload any photo to “see anyone naked” by using tech that realistically swaps the faces of real victims onto AI-generated explicit images.</p>
<p>"In California and across the country, there has been a stark increase in the number of women and girls harassed and victimized by AI-generated" non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) and "this distressing trend shows no sign of abating," Chiu's suit said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043812#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043812&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Anova, a company that sells smart sous vide cookers, is getting backlash from customers after announcing that it will soon charge a subscription fee for the device's companion app.</p>
<p>Sous vide cooking, per Ars Technica sister site <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-sous-vide-cooking">Bon appétit</a>, "is the process of sealing food in an airtight container—usually a vacuum sealed bag—and then cooking that food in temperature-controlled water." Sous vide translates from French to "under vacuum," and this cooking method ensures that the water stays at the desired temperature for the ideal cook.</p>
<p>Anova was founded in 2013 and sells sous vide immersion circulators. Its current third-generation Precision Cooker 3.0 has an MSRP of $200. Anova also sells a $149 model and a $400 version that targets professionals. It debuted the free Anova Culinary App in 2014.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043773#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043773&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Telling someone they can't have something is a great way to make them want it. Take the station wagon, for example. This once-popular form factor for family transport has all but disappeared from new car showrooms in North America, consequently making the station wagon all kinds of cool in the process. At the apex are the superwagons, factory-tuned models with prodigious power outputs, with one in particular attaining legendary status in large part because BMW chose never to import the M5 Touring across the Atlantic. Until now.</p>
<p>BMW first made a Touring—or station wagon—version of the M5 in 1992 with the second-generation (better known as the E34) 5 series. When I was growing up in the UK, these were unavailable, as they were in the US, quickly giving the five-door M5 an extra level of cachet that the four-door lacked, despite a starring role in <em>Ronin</em>.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the E34 M5 Touring looked very cool, but it wasn't the greatest sales success.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043774#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043774&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>ChatGPT was able to pass some of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) tests in a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000198">study</a> done in 2022. This year, a team of Canadian medical professionals checked to see if it’s any good at actual doctoring. And it’s not.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT vs. Medscape</h2>
<p>“Our source for medical questions was the Medscape questions bank,” said Amrit Kirpalani, a medical educator at the Western University in Ontario, Canada, who led the new research into ChatGPT’s performance as a diagnostic tool. The USMLE contained mostly multiple-choice test questions; Medscape has full medical cases based on real-world patients, complete with physical examination findings, laboratory test results, and so on.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is to make those cases challenging for medical practitioners due to complications like multiple comorbidities, where two or more diseases are present at the same time, and various diagnostic dilemmas that make the correct answers less obvious. Kirpalani’s team turned 150 of those Medscape cases into prompts that ChatGPT could understand and process.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043636#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043636&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Over two decades of parenting has left me with a healthy appreciation for SUVs and minivans. But there comes a time when the nest empties and transportation needs change. While it's useful to have a larger car around for road trips and hauling stuff around, one such vehicle is sufficient. The second car can be small, economical, energy efficient—the kind of car that I wouldn't have given a second glance in the past.</p>
<p>When Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/the-2024-fiat-500e-is-a-34k-ev-that-appeals-to-emotion-not-logic/">first drove the Fiat 500e</a> last spring, we were impressed with what we saw and how it drove during the few hours spent behind the wheel. But Fiat is positioning this as an ideal <i>second</i> car, as Fiat CEO Olivier Francois told Ars at the drive. "My ambition is not to replace your sedan or [S]UV." The automaker wants the 500e to be your stylish but economical secondary ride.</p>
<h2>A novel approach to branding</h2>
<p>After spending a week with the <a href="https://www.fiatusa.com/500e-inspired-beauty.html">Fiat 500e Inspired by Beauty</a>, I can attest that the 500e does indeed make for an ideal second car, at least if you don't have regular backseat passengers. Fiat's tiny hatchback is also one of the most efficient BEVs Ars has ever driven, as it consistently averaged 5 mi/kWh (12.4 kWh/100 km).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043413#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043413&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.07 of the Rocket Report! SpaceX has not missed a beat since the Federal Aviation Administration gave the company a green light to resume Falcon 9 launches after a failure last month. In 19 days, SpaceX has launched 10 flights of the Falcon 9 rocket, taking advantage of all three of its Falcon 9 launch pads. This is a remarkable cadence in its own right, but even though it's a small sample size, it is especially impressive right out of the gate after the rocket's grounding.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>A quick turnaround for Rocket Lab. </b>Rocket Lab launched its 52nd Electron rocket on August 11 from its private spaceport on Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand, <a href="https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-launches-capella-space-sar-satellite/">Space News reports</a>. The company's light-class Electron rocket deployed a small radar imaging satellite into a mid-inclination orbit for Capella Space. This was the shortest turnaround between two Rocket Lab missions from its primary launch base in New Zealand, coming less than nine days after an Electron rocket took off from the same pad with a radar imaging satellite for the Japanese company Synspective. Capella's Acadia 3 satellite was originally supposed to launch in July, but Capella requested a delay to perform more testing of its spacecraft. Rocket Lab swapped its place in the Electron launch sequence and launched the Synspective mission first.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043638#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043638&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the first round of direct price negotiations between Medicare and drug manufacturers, prices for 10 expensive and commonly used drugs saw price cuts between 38 percent to 79 percent compared to their 2023 list prices, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-lower-prices-for-first-ten-drugs-selected-for-medicare-price-negotiation-to-lower-costs-for-millions-of-americans/">the White House</a> and the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/15/historic-first-biden-harris-administration-successfully-negotiates-medicare-drug-prices-delivers-promise-lower-prescription-drug-costs-american-seniors.html">US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a> announced Thursday. The new negotiated prices will take effect on January 1, 2026.</p>
<p>The 10 drugs that were up for negotiations are used to treat various conditions, from diabetes, psoriasis, blood clots, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease to blood cancers. About 9 million people with Medicare use at least one of the drugs on the list. In 2023, the 10 drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending, or about 20 percent of total gross spending by Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. But in 2018, spending on the 10 drugs was just about $20 billion, increasing to 46 billion in 2022—a 134 percent rise. In 2022, Medicare enrollees collectively paid $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs for these drugs.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices.jpg"><img alt="The 10 drugs as well as their use, 2023 costs, negotiated prices, and savings." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices-640x309.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices-1280x617.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">The 10 drugs as well as their use, 2023 costs, negotiated prices, and savings.</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/3e8abec86039ac0ed674a8c5fac492e3/price-change-over-time-brief.pdf">HHS</a>)</p></div>
<p>For now, it's unclear how much the newly set prices will actually save those who have Medicare enrollees in 2026. Overall costs and out-of-pocket costs will depend on each member's coverage plans and other drug spending. Additionally, in 2025, Medicare Part D enrollees will have their out-of-pocket drug costs capped at $2,000, which alone could significantly lower costs for some beneficiaries before the negotiated prices take effect.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043687#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043687&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You can now play the original <em>Diablo</em> (and its expansion, <em>Hellfire</em>) in virtually any web browser on any computer with generally excellent performance and operating-as-expected controls. It's all thanks to an open source project published on GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb">Diabloweb</a> that's now being <a href="https://x.com/iequalshane/status/1823357647673868408">circulated</a> by game developers on X.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> in the project's GitHub repository, the project's developer (d07RiV) notes that it is based on <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX">DevilutionX</a>, another open source project that did a lot of legwork to make <em>Diablo</em> run well on modern operating systems.</p>
<p>"I've modified the code to remove all dependencies and exposed the minimal required interface with JS, allowing the game to be compiled into WebAssembly," writes d07RiV. "Event handling (especially in the menus) had to be modified significantly to fit the JS model."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043640#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043640&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here at Ars, we're always on the lookout for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">hints</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">actions</a> that suggest the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">long</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/10/half-life-2-episode-3-may-not-see-release-until-2010/">long wait</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/valves-newell-explains-continuing-silence-on-next-half-life/"><em>Half-Life 3</em></a> may eventually come to an end. So when users across the Internet started making note of the mysterious and intriguingly named <a href="https://blackmesa.com/">BlackMesa.com</a> recently, our ears perked up for signs of a new promotional <a href="https://arstechnica.com/technopaedia/2008/05/alternate-reality-game/">alternate reality game</a> (ARG).</p>
<p>Alas, this seems like yet another false alarm. BlackMesa.com is simply the website for Black Mesa, which <a href="https://blackmesa.com/resonance-cascades">confirmed in a public statement</a> that it is "actually a real company in the Boston area... working hard to assure and secure vaccine and other biological manufacturing production."</p>

<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon are urging telecom regulators to reject a key part of SpaceX's plan to offer cellular service with T-Mobile, claiming the satellite system will interfere with and degrade service for terrestrial mobile broadband networks.</p>
<p>Filings urging the Federal Communications Commission to deny SpaceX's request for a waiver were submitted by <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1081242986780/1">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1081205395437/1">Verizon</a> this week. The plan by SpaceX's Starlink division also faces opposition from satellite companies <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1081207358352/1">EchoStar</a> (which owns Dish and Hughes) and <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/108130251822158/1">Omnispace</a>.</p>
<p>SpaceX and T-Mobile plan to offer Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) for T-Mobile's cellular network using SpaceX satellites. As part of that plan, SpaceX is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1071546968000/1">seeking a waiver</a> of FCC rules regarding out-of-band emission limits.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043647#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043647&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
