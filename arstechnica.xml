              <![CDATA[<p>It's that time again, when families and friends gather and implore the more technically inclined among them to troubleshoot problems they're having behind the device screens all around them. One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.</p>
<p>Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passwordless-google-accounts-are-easier-and-more-secure-than-passwords-heres-why/">two years ago</a>, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts. How and why is that?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/passkey-technology-is-elegant-but-its-most-definitely-not-usable-security/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The art of space mission patches is now more than six decades old, dating to the Vostok 6 mission in 1963 that carried Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova into low-Earth orbit for nearly three days. The patch for the first female human spaceflight showcased a dove flying above the letters designating the Soviet Union, CCCP.</p>
<p>That patch was not publicly revealed at the time, and the use of specially designed patches was employed only infrequently by subsequent Soviet missions. NASA's first mission patch would not follow for two years, but the practice would prove more sticky for missions in the United States and become a time-honored tradition.</p>
<p>The first NASA flight to produce a mission-specific patch worn by crew members was Gemini 5. It flew in August 1965, carrying astronauts Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad on an eight-day mission inside a small Gemini spacecraft. At the time, it was the longest spaceflight conducted by anyone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/after-60-years-of-spaceflight-patches-here-are-some-of-our-favorites/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It feels like tech workers have caught very few breaks over the past several years, between ongoing mass layoffs, stagnating wages amid inflation, AI supposedly coming for jobs, and unpopular orders to return to office that, for many, threaten to disrupt work-life balance.</p>
<p>But in 2024, a potentially critical mass of tech workers seemed to reach a breaking point. As labor rights groups advocating for tech workers told Ars, these workers are banding together in sustained strong numbers and are either winning or appear tantalizingly close to winning better worker conditions at major tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>In February, the industry-wide Tech Workers Coalition (TWC) <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/blog/labor-notes-highlights/">noted</a> that "the tech workers movement is far more expansive and impactful" than even labor rights advocates realized, noting that unionized tech workers have gone beyond early stories about Googlers marching in the streets and now "make the headlines on a daily basis."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/from-ai-to-rto-unpopular-policies-may-fuel-tech-worker-movements-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a long day of stops and starts that stretched well into the evening, and on what appeared to be the company's fifth attempt Friday, Blue Origin successfully ignited the seven main engines on its massive New Glenn rocket.</p>
<p>The test firing came as fog built over the Florida coast, and it marks the final major step in the rocket company's campaign to bring the New Glenn rocket—a privately developed, super-heavy lift vehicle—to launch readiness. Blue Origin said it fired the vehicle's engines for a duration of 24 seconds. They fired at full thrust for 13 of those seconds.</p>
<p>"This is a monumental milestone and a glimpse of what’s just around the corner for New Glenn’s first launch," said Jarrett Jones,  senior vice president of the New Glenn program, <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenn-completes-integrated-launch-vehicle-hotfire">in a news release</a>. "Today’s success proves that our rigorous approach to testing—combined with our incredible tooling and design engineering–is working as intended."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/blue-origin-hot-fires-new-glenn-rocket-setting-up-a-launch-early-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A brave YouTuber has managed to defeat a fake Nintendo lawyer improperly targeting his channel with copyright takedowns that could have seen his entire channel removed if YouTube issued one more strike.</p>
<p>Sharing his story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/27/24326278/nintendo-fake-takedowns-youtube-domtendo-dmca">with The Verge</a>, Dominik "Domtendo" Neumayer—a German YouTuber who has broadcasted play-throughs of popular games for 17 years—said that it all started when YouTube removed some videos from his channel that were centered on <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>. Those removals came after a pair of complaints were filed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and generated two strikes. Everyone on YouTube knows that three strikes mean you're out and off the platform permanently.</p>
<p>Suddenly at risk of losing the entire channel he had built on YouTube, Neumayer was stunned, The Verge noted, partly because most game companies consider "Let's Play" videos like his to be free marketing, not a threat to their business. And while Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/nintendo-issues-copyright-claims-on-mario-themed-minecraft-videos/">been known to target YouTubers</a> with DMCA takedowns, it generally historically took no issues with accounts like his.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/youtuber-won-dmca-fight-with-fake-nintendo-lawyer-by-detecting-spoofed-email/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>'Tis the season for many holiday traditions, including the Ugly Christmas Sweater—you know, those 1950s-style heavy knits featuring some kind of cartoonish seasonal decoration, like snowflakes, Santa Claus, or—in the case of Mark Darcy from <em>Bridget Jones' Diary</em> (2001)—Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. "It’s obnoxious and tacky, but also fuzzy and kind of wholesome—the fashion equivalent of a Hallmark Christmas movie (with a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek)," as CNN's Marianna Cerini <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/ugly-christmas-sweater-holidays-history/index.html">recently observed</a>.</p>
<p>Fashion (or lack thereof) aside, sweaters and other knitted fabric are also fascinating to physicists and mathematicians. Case in point: a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.248201">recent paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Letters examining the complex mechanics behind the many resting shapes a good Jersey knit can form while at rest.</p>
<p>Knitted fabrics are part of a class of intertwined materials—which also includes birds' nests, surgical knots, knotted shoelaces, and even the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10570-023-05683-x">degradation of paper fibers</a> in ancient manuscripts. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/physicists-are-decoding-math-y-secrets-of-knitting-to-make-bespoke-materials/">Knitted fabrics are technically a type</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial">metamaterial</a>: an engineered material that gets its properties not from the base materials but from their designed structures. The elasticity (aka, stretchiness) of knitted fabrics is an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3410/03-ask.html">emergent property</a>: the whole is more than the sum of its parts. How those components (strands of yarn) are arranged at an intermediate scale (the structure) determines the macro scale properties of the resulting fabric.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/the-physics-of-ugly-christmas-sweaters/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has finally shared details about its plans to shake up its core business by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openai-plans-tectonic-shift-from-nonprofit-to-for-profit-giving-altman-equity/">shifting to a for-profit </a>corporate structure.</p>
<p>On Thursday, OpenAI posted on its <a href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">blog</a>, confirming that in 2025, the existing for-profit arm will be transformed into a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC). As a PBC, OpenAI would be required to balance its shareholders' and stakeholders' interests with the public benefit. To achieve that, OpenAI would offer "ordinary shares of stock" while using some profits to further its mission—"ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity"—to serve a social good.</p>
<p>To compensate for losing control over the for-profit, the nonprofit would have some shares in the PBC, but it's currently unclear how many will be allotted. Independent financial advisors will help OpenAI reach a "fair valuation," the blog said, while promising the new structure would "multiply" the donations that previously supported the nonprofit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/openai-defends-for-profit-shift-as-critical-to-sustain-humanitarian-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apparently Hertz's purging of electric vehicles from its fleet isn't going fast enough for the car rental giant. A Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HertzRentals/comments/1hi5p7d/hertz_trying_to_sell_you_the_car_youre_currently/">posted an offer</a> they received from Hertz to buy the 2023 Tesla Model 3 they had been renting for $17,913.</p>
<p>Hertz originally went strong into EVs, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/hertz-to-purchase-100000-tesla-model-3s-for-its-rental-fleet/">announcing a plan</a> to buy 100,000 Model 3s for its fleet by the end of 2021, but 16 months later had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/hertz-falls-short-of-ambitious-tesla-2022-fleet-goal/">acquired only half that amount</a>. The company found that repair costs—especially for Teslas, which averaged 20 percent more than other EVs—were cutting into its profit margins. Customer demand was also not what Hertz had hoped for; last January, it announced plans to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/hertz-is-selling-20000-used-evs-due-to-high-repair-costs/">sell off 20,000 EVs</a>.</p>
<p>Asking its customers if they want to purchase their rentals isn't a new strategy for Hertz. "By connecting our rental customers who opt into our emails to our sales channels, we're not only building awareness of the fact that we sell cars but also offering a unique opportunity to someone who may be in the market for the same car they have on rent," Hertz communications director Jamie Line <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/26/24329874/hertz-ev-tesla-email-sales-offers">told The Verge</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/hertz-is-asking-ev-renters-if-they-want-to-buy-their-rentals/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>There are thousands of YouTube videos in which DIY science enthusiasts cut grapes in half—leaving just a thin bit of skin connecting them—and put the grapes in the microwave, just to marvel at the sparks and plume of ionized gas (plasma) that the grapes produce. This quirky property of grapes might help make more efficient quantum sensors, according to a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.22.064078">new paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Applied.</p>
<p>The plasma-inducing grape effect was first observed in 1994, per the authors. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/these-scientists-broke-12-microwaves-to-learn-how-grapes-create-plasmas/">previously reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-here-s-how-to-make-plasma-by-microwaving-a-grape">usual explanation</a> for the generation of plasmas is that grapes are so small that the irradiating microwaves become <a href="https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=818">highly concentrated</a> in the grape tissue, <a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/12/3/7326643/grape-plasma-microwave">ripping some the molecules apart</a> to generate charged ions (adding to the electrolytes already present in the grapes). The electromagnetic field that forms causes ions to flow from one grape half to the other via the connecting skin—at least at first. That's when you get the initial sparks. Eventually, the ions start passing through the surrounding air as well, ionizing it to produce that hot plume of plasma.</p>
<p>But in 2019, Trent University scientists <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1818350116">showed that</a> explanation isn't quite right. The skin bridge isn't necessary for the effect to occur. Rather, the plasma is generated by an electromagnetic "hot spot." The grapes have the right refractive index and size to "trap" microwaves, so putting two of them close together leads to the generation of a hot spot between them. The trick also works with gooseberries, large blackberries, and quail eggs, as well as hydrogel beads—plastic beads soaked in water. ("Many microwaves were in fact harmed during the experiments," co-author Hamza Khattak admitted at the time.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/could-microwaved-grapes-be-used-for-quantum-sensing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Microsoft in a wide-ranging probe that will examine whether the company’s business practices have run afoul of antitrust laws, according to people familiar with the matter. In recent weeks, FTC attorneys have been conducting interviews and setting up meetings with Microsoft competitors.</p>
<p>One key area of interest is how the world’s largest software provider packages popular Office products together with cybersecurity and cloud computing services, said one of the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.</p>
<p>This so-called bundling was the subject of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-white-house-offer-cybersecurity-biden-nadella">a recent ProPublica investigation</a>, which detailed how, beginning in 2021, Microsoft used the practice to vastly expand its business with the US government while boxing competitors out of lucrative federal contracts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/ftc-launches-probe-of-microsoft-over-bundling/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When you want to move an object from one place to another, you usually grab it with your hands or a robotic arm. But what if you want to move something you cannot touch without damaging or disrupting it, like a droplet of liquid? A solution proposed by a team of scientists at the North Carolina State University is a metamaterial that can change shape in response to magnetic fields.</p>
<p>This material had to be easily deformable to change shape, yet at the same time stiff enough to bear loads. “That seemed contradictory—how do you make something that is stiff and deformable at once?” says Jie Yin, a mechanical metamaterials researcher at NC State. His team did it with ferromagnetic elastomers, kirigami cuts, balloons, and magnets.</p>
<h2>Refreshable Braille display</h2>
<p>“There is not much research on using magnets to manipulate non-magnetic objects. It is very, very hard,” says Yinding Chi, another NC State researcher and lead author of the study. The idea Chi and his colleagues came up with could be compared to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/braille-display-demo-refreshes-with-miniature-fireballs/">refreshable Braille display</a>. They imagined a surface dotted with domes that could rise, turn, or depress on demand, allowing it to dynamically form relief-like images or move in a pattern similar to waves in the ocean. Objects would then move on these surfaces like they were carried by waves. “This way, you can move various objects without using grippers,” Yin says.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/magnetic-shape-shifting-surface-can-move-stuff-without-grasping-it/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There is now a genetic excuse not to bother cutting carbs. Humans have genetically adapted to eating starchy foods, and our ancestors may have been carb-ivores even before modern <i>Homo sapiens </i>emerged.</p>
<p>The salivary amylase gene, known as AMY1, is already known to have helped us adapt to eating carbs. It encodes amylase, an enzyme that breaks starches found in pasta and bread down to glucose—and may have given us a taste preference for them. Humans have multiple copies of the gene, which may help us produce high levels of the enzyme.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Buffalo and the Jackson Laboratory have now found that, while most copies of this gene arose with the advent of farming, modern humans and our closest relatives had accumulated extra copies long before agriculture.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/craving-carbs-blame-an-ancient-gene/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>More than 18,500 games will have been released onto the PC gaming platform Steam in the year 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">according to SteamDB</a>. Dividing that by the number of people covering games at Ars, or the gaming press at large, or even everybody who games and writes about it online, yields a brutal ratio.</p>
<p>Games often float down the river of time to us, filtered by friends, algorithms, or pure happenstance. They don't qualify for our best games of the year list, but they might be worth mentioning on their own. Many times, they're better games then they were at release, either by patching or just perspective. And they are almost always lower priced.</p>
<p>Inspired by the cruel logic of calendars and year-end lists, I asked my coworkers to tell me about their favorite games <em>of</em> 2024 that were not <em>from</em> 2024. What resulted were some quirky gems, some reconsiderations, and some titles that just happened to catch us at the right time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It started, like so many overwrought home optimization projects, during the pandemic.</p>
<p>My wife and I, like many people stuck inside, were ordering takeout more frequently. We wanted to support local restaurants, reduce the dish load, and live a little. It became clear early on that app-based delivery services like DoorDash and Uber Eats were not the best way to support local businesses. If a restaurant had its own ordering site or a preferred service, we wanted to use that—or even, heaven forfend, call the place.</p>
<p>The secondary issue was that we kept ordering from the same places, and we wanted to mix it up. Sometimes we'd want to pick something up nearby. Sometimes we wanted to avoid an entire category ("Too many carbs this week, no pasta") or try the newest places we knew about, or maybe a forgotten classic. Or just give me three places randomly, creative constraints, please—it's Friday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/making-tiny-no-code-webapps-out-of-spreadsheets-is-a-weirdly-fulfilling-hobby/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[What do eating rocks, rat genitals, and Willy Wonka have in common? AI, of course.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's been a wild year in tech thanks to the intersection between humans and artificial intelligence. 2024 brought a parade of AI oddities, mishaps, and wacky moments that inspired odd behavior from both machines and man. From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.</p>
<p>Why the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/chatgpts-success-could-have-come-sooner-says-former-google-ai-researcher/">Transformer-based</a> AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">launched in June</a> held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">OpenAI's o1</a> used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/">NotebookLM</a> also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">music synthesis models</a> and also better <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/">AI video generators</a>, including several from China.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hey, look at that! Another year has flown by, and I suspect many people would say "good riddance" to 2024.</p>
<p>The 2020s have been quite the decade so far. No matter what insanity has transpired by a particular December 31, the following year has shown up and promptly said, "Hold my beer."</p>
<p>The biggest news at Ars in 2024 was our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/welcome-to-our-latest-design-update-ars-9-0/">first site redesign in nearly a decade</a>. We're proud of Ars 9.0 (we're up to 9.0.3 now), and we have continued to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-9-0-1-redesign-is-now-live-with-density-tweaks-and-visited-link-colors/">make changes based on your feedback</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their favorite film that serves as alternative Christmas movie fare, with <em>Die Hard</em> (1988) and <em>Lethal Weapon</em> (1987) typically topping the list—at least when all you want for Christmas is buddy-cop banter, car chases, shootouts, and glorious explosions. (Massive gratuitous property damage is a given.) I love me some <em>Lethal Weapon</em> but it's high time to give some holiday love to another great action flick set during the Christmas season: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Kiss_Goodnight"><em>The Long Kiss Goodnight</em></a> (1996), starring Geena Davis as an amnesiac school teacher who turns out to have been a government assassin in her former life.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below for this nearly 30-year-old film.)</strong></p>
<p>At the time, Davis was married to director Renny Harlin, coming off a disastrous showing for their previous collaboration, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroat_Island"><em>Cutthroat Island</em></a> (1995), which remains one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. (It is indeed a pretty bad movie.) But Shane Black's smart, savvy script for <em>The Long Kiss Goodnight</em> seemed like the perfect next project for them; it was promising enough that New Line Cinema bought it for what was then a record $4 million.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/why-the-long-kiss-goodnight-is-a-great-alt-christmas-movie/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[From wacky crime capers and dystopian video game adaptions to sweeping historical epics, 2024 had a little of everything]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor's note</strong>: Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything major, please note this list does include a few specific references to several of the listed shows that some might consider spoiler-y.</em></p>
<p>This was another good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Really, 2024 had a little of everything, from wacky crime capers (<em>Bad Monkey</em>) and Satanic Panic (<em>Hysteria</em>) to dystopian video game adaptations (<em>Fallout</em>) and sweeping historical epics (<em>Shōgun)</em>, with plenty of genre-mashup delights in between. While streaming platforms continue to dominate, the selection is more evenly distributed across them this year, with only Hulu and Netflix snagging more than two slots (depending on whether or not you lump Hulu together with Disney+ after the merger).</p>
<p>As always, we're opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our "year's best" vote at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/tv-technica-2024-our-picks-for-the-best-of-tv/">Read full article</a></p>

You still have time to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $4,000 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win).</p>
<p>In the first week or so of the drive, hundreds of readers have contributed well over $16,000 to either the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is barely hanging on to a small donation lead at the moment). That's a long way off from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/">2020's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Thursday, January 2, 2025.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/reminder-donate-to-win-swag-in-our-annual-charity-drive-sweepstakes-16/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At this point, any serious retro gamer knows that a bulky cathode ray tube (CRT) TV provides <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/10/11/are-crt-tvs-important-for-retro-gaming/">the most authentic</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/video-demonstrates-the-marvel-of-crt-displays-at-380000-frames-per-second/">lag-free experience</a> for game consoles that predate the era of flat-panel HDTVs (i.e,. before the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 era). But modern gamers used to massive flat panel HD displays might balk at the display size of the most common CRTs, which tend to average in the 20- to 30-inch range (depending on the era they were made).</p>
<p>For those who want the absolute largest CRT experience possible, Sony's KX-45ED1 model (aka PVM-4300) has become the stuff of legends. The massive 45-inch CRT was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/xuhbb9/biggest_trinitron_ever_the_kx45ed1_it_was_sold/">sold in the late '80s</a> for a whopping $40,000 (over $100,000 in today's dollars), according to contemporary reports.</p>
<p>That price means it wasn't exactly a mass-market product, and the limited supply has made it something of a white whale for CRT enthusiasts to this day. While a few pictures have emerged of the PVM-4300 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/liyitz/the_picture_of_kx45ed1_aka_pvm4300/">in the wild</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/444560212348840/posts/2936345963170240/">in marketing materials</a>, no collector has stepped forward with detailed footage of a working unit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/retro-gamers-save-one-of-the-last-45-inch-crt-tvs-in-existence/">Read full article</a></p>
