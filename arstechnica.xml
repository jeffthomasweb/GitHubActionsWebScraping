                            <![CDATA[<p>There’s been a lot of talk of an AI bubble lately, especially with regards to circular funding involving companies like OpenAI and Anthropic—but Clem Delangue, CEO of machine learning resources hub Hugging Face, has made the case that the bubble is specific to large language models, which is just one application of AI.</p>
<p>“I think we’re in an LLM bubble, and I think the LLM bubble might be bursting next year,” he said at an <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/18/hugging-face-delangue-axios-bfd-2025-llm-bubble">Axios</a> event this week, as quoted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/hugging-face-ceo-says-were-in-an-llm-bubble-not-an-ai-bubble/">a TechCrunch article.</a> “But ‘LLM’ is just a subset of AI when it comes to applying AI to biology, chemistry, image, audio, [and] video. I think we’re at the beginning of it, and we’ll see much more in the next few years.”</p>
<p>At Ars, we’ve written at length in recent days about the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/tech-giants-pour-billions-into-anthropic-as-circular-ai-investments-roll-on/">fears around AI investment</a>. But to Delangue’s point, almost all of those discussions are about companies whose chief product is large language models, or the data centers meant to drive those—specifically, those focused on general-purpose chatbots that are meant to be everything for everybody.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/were-in-an-llm-bubble-hugging-face-ceo-says-but-not-an-ai-one/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since early July, telescopes around the world have been tracking just our third confirmed interstellar visitor, the comet 3I/ATLAS—3I, for third interstellar, and ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) for the telescope network that first spotted it. But the object’s closest approach to the Sun came in late October during the US government shutdown. So, while enough people went to work to ensure that the hardware continued to do its job, nobody was available at NASA to make the images available to the public or discuss their implications.</p>
<p>So today, NASA held a press conference to discuss everything that we now know about 3I/ATLAS, and how NASA’s hardware contributed to that knowledge. And to say one more time that the object is a fairly typical comet and not some spaceship doing its best to appear like one.</p>
<h2>Extrasolar comet</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is an extrasolar comet and the third visitor from another star that we’ve detected. We know the comet part because it looks like one, forming a coma of gas and dust, as well as a tail, as the Sun heats up its materials. That hasn’t stopped the usual suspect (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Loeb">Avi Loeb</a>) from speculating that it might be a spacecraft, as he had for the earlier visitors. NASA doesn’t want to hear it. “This object is a comet,” said Associate Administrator Amit Kshatrya. “It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/nasa-really-wants-you-to-know-that-3i-atlas-is-an-interstellar-comet/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When a Cloudflare outage <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/widespread-cloudflare-outage-blamed-on-mysterious-traffic-spike/">disrupted large numbers</a> of websites and online services yesterday, the company initially thought it was hit by a “hyper-scale” DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack.</p>
<p>“I worry this is the big botnet flexing,” Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince wrote in an internal chat room yesterday, while he and others discussed whether Cloudflare was being hit by attacks from the prolific <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azureinfrastructureblog/defending-the-cloud-azure-neutralized-a-record-breaking-15-tbps-ddos-attack/4470422">Aisuru botnet</a>. But upon further investigation, Cloudflare staff realized the problem had an internal cause: an important file had unexpectedly doubled in size and propagated across the network.</p>
<p>This caused trouble for software that needs to read the file to maintain the Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/bot-management/">bot management system</a> that uses a machine learning model to protect against security threats. Cloudflare’s core CDN, security services, and several other services were affected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/cloudflare-broke-much-of-the-internet-with-a-corrupted-bot-management-file/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody expects to get sued for re-posting a YouTube video on social media by using the “share” button, but librarian Ian Linkletter spent the past five years embroiled in a copyright fight after doing just that.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now that a settlement has been reached, Linkletter told Ars why he thinks his 2020 tweets sharing public YouTube videos put a target on his back.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Linkletter’s legal nightmare started in 2020 after an education technology company, Proctorio, began monitoring student backlash on Reddit over its AI tool used to remotely scan rooms, identify students, and prevent cheating on exams. On Reddit, students echoed serious concerns <a href="https://pressbooks.pub/cdpcollection/chapter/our-bodies-encoded-algorithmic-test-proctoring-in-higher-education/">raised by researchers</a>, warning of privacy issues, racist and sexist biases, and barriers to students with disabilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/proctorio-settles-curious-lawsuit-with-librarian-who-shared-public-youtube-videos/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft’s warning on Tuesday that an experimental AI agent integrated into Windows can infect devices and pilfer sensitive user data has set off a familiar response from security-minded critics: Why is Big Tech so intent on pushing new features before their dangerous behaviors can be fully understood and contained?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/new-windows-11-ai-agents-can-work-in-the-background-but-create-new-security-risks/">reported Tuesday</a>, Microsoft introduced Copilot Actions, a new set of “experimental agentic features” that, when enabled, perform “everyday tasks like organizing files, scheduling meetings, or sending emails,” and provide “an active digital collaborator that can carry out complex tasks for you to enhance efficiency and productivity.”</p>
<h2>Hallucinations and prompt injections apply</h2>
<p>The fanfare, however, came with a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">significant caveat</a>. Microsoft recommended users enable Copilot Actions only “if you understand the security implications outlined.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/critics-scoff-after-microsoft-warns-ai-feature-can-infect-machines-and-pilfer-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This year’s newest iPhones included one momentous change that marked a new phase in the evolution of Apple Silicon: the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/apples-n1-chip-extends-its-custom-silicon-into-wi-fi-bluetooth-and-thread/">Apple N1</a>, Apple’s first in-house chip made to handle local wireless connections. The N1 supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and the Thread smart home communication protocol, and it replaces the third-party wireless chips (mostly made by Broadcom) that Apple used in older iPhones.</p>
<p>Apple claimed that the N1 would enable more reliable connectivity for local communication features like AirPlay and AirDrop but didn’t say anything about how users could expect it to perform. But Ookla, the folks behind <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">the SpeedTest app and website</a>, have analyzed about five weeks’ worth of users’ testing data to get an idea of how the iPhone 17 lineup stacks up to the iPhone 16, as well as Android phones with Wi-Fi chips from Qualcomm, MediaTek, and others.</p>
<p>While the N1 isn’t at the top of the charts, Ookla <a href="https://www.ookla.com/articles/apple-n1-2025">says</a> Apple’s Wi-Fi chip “delivered higher download and upload speeds on Wi-Fi compared to the iPhone 16 across every studied percentile and virtually every region.” The median download speed for the iPhone 17 series was 329.56Mbps, compared to 236.46Mbps for the iPhone 16; the upload speed also jumped from 73.68Mbps to 103.26Mbps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/testing-shows-apple-n1-wi-fi-chip-improves-on-older-broadcom-chips-in-every-way/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, veteran game developer Rebecca Ann Heineman died in Rockwall, Texas, at age 62 after a battle with adenocarcinoma. Apogee founder Scott Miller first <a href="https://x.com/ScottApogee/status/1990536909689381210?s=20">shared</a> the news publicly on social media, and her son William confirmed her death with Ars Technica. Heineman’s GoFundMe page, which displayed a final message she had <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer">posted</a> about entering palliative care, will now help her family with funeral costs.</p>
<p>Rebecca “Burger Becky” Heineman was born in October 1963 and grew up in Whittier, California. She first gained national recognition in 1980 when she <a href="https://www.atariarchive.org/blog/space-invaders-march-1980/">won</a> the national Atari 2600 <em>Space Invaders</em> championship in New York at age 16, becoming the first formally recognized US video game champion. That victory launched a career <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/343/rebecca-ann-heineman/">spanning</a> more than four decades and 67 credited games, according to MobyGames.</p>
<p>Among many achievements in her life, Heineman was perhaps best known for co-founding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment">Interplay Productions</a> with Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell in 1983. The company created franchises like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wasteland_the_classic_original"><em>Wasteland</em></a>, <em>Fallout</em>, and <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>. At Interplay, Heineman designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bard%27s_Tale_III:_Thief_of_Fate"><em>The Bard’s Tale III: Thief of Fate</em></a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dragon_wars"><em>Dragon Wars</em></a> while also programming ports of classics like <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> and <em>Battle Chess</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/interplay-co-founder-and-pioneering-game-developer-rebecca-heineman-dies-at-62/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Computers are extremely good with numbers, but they haven’t gotten many human mathematicians fired. Until recently, they could barely hold their own in high school-level math competitions.</p>
<p>But now Google’s DeepMind team has built AlphaProof, an AI system that matched silver medalists’ performance at the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad, scoring just one point short of gold at the most prestigious undergrad math competition in the world. And that’s kind of a big deal.</p>
<h2>True understanding</h2>
<p>The reason computers fared poorly in math competitions is that, while they far surpass humanity’s ability to perform calculations, they are not really that good at the logic and reasoning that is needed for advanced math. Put differently, they are good at performing calculations really quickly, but they usually suck at understanding why they’re doing them. While something like addition seems simple, humans can do semi-formal proofs based on definitions of addition or go for fully formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano arithmetic</a> that defines the properties of natural numbers and operations like addition through axioms.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/deepminds-latest-an-ai-for-handling-mathematical-proofs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title"><span style="font-size: 16px;">On a sunny </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/19/louvre-closed-after-robbery-french-culture-minister-says">morning on October 19 2025</a>, four men allegedly walked into the world’s most-visited museum and left, minutes later, with crown jewels worth 88 million euros ($101 million). The theft from Paris’ Louvre Museum—one of the world’s most surveilled cultural institutions—took just under eight minutes.</p>
<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Visitors kept browsing. Security didn’t react (until alarms were triggered). The men disappeared into the city’s traffic before anyone realized what had happened.</p>
<p>Investigators later revealed that the thieves wore hi-vis vests, disguising themselves as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/arts/design/louvre-museum-robbery-high-visibility-vests.html">construction workers</a>. They arrived with a furniture lift, a common sight in Paris’s narrow streets, and used it to reach a balcony overlooking the Seine. Dressed as workers, they looked as if they belonged.</p>
<p>This strategy worked because we don’t see the world objectively. We see it through categories—through what we expect to see. The thieves understood the social categories that we perceive as “normal” and exploited them to avoid suspicion. Many <a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-ai-90">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) systems work in the same way and are vulnerable to the same kinds of mistakes as a result.</p>
<p>The sociologist Erving Goffman would describe what happened at the Louvre using his concept of the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-15044-000">presentation of self</a>: people <a href="https://web.pdx.edu/%7Etothm/theory/Presentation%20of%20Self.htm">“perform”</a> social roles by adopting the cues others expect. Here, the performance of normality became the perfect camouflage.</p>
<h2>The sociology of sight</h2>
<p>Humans carry out mental categorization all the time to make sense of people and places. When something fits the category of “ordinary,” it slips from notice.</p>
<p>AI systems used for tasks such as facial recognition and detecting suspicious activity in a public area operate in a similar way. For humans, categorization is cultural. For AI, it is mathematical.</p>
<p>But both systems rely on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/soc4.12962">learned patterns rather than objective reality</a>. Because AI learns from data about who looks “normal” and who looks “suspicious,” it absorbs the categories embedded in its training data. And this makes it <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/algorithmic-bias-detection-and-mitigation-best-practices-and-policies-to-reduce-consumer-harms/">susceptible to bias</a>.</p>
<p>The Louvre robbers weren’t seen as dangerous because they fit a trusted category. In AI, the same process can have the opposite effect: people who don’t fit the statistical norm become more visible and over-scrutinized.</p>
<p>It can mean a facial recognition system disproportionately flags certain racial or gendered groups as potential threats while letting others pass unnoticed.</p>
<p>A sociological lens helps us see that these aren’t separate issues. AI doesn’t invent its categories; it learns ours. When a computer vision system is trained on security footage where “normal” is defined by particular bodies, clothing, or behavior, it reproduces those assumptions.</p>
<p>Just as the museum’s guards looked past the thieves because they appeared to belong, AI can look past certain patterns while overreacting to others.</p>
<p>Categorization, whether human or algorithmic, is a double-edged sword. It helps us process information quickly, but it also encodes our cultural assumptions. Both people and machines rely on pattern recognition, which is an efficient but imperfect strategy.</p>
<p>A sociological view of AI treats algorithms as mirrors: They reflect back our social categories and hierarchies. In the Louvre case, the mirror is turned toward us. The robbers succeeded not because they were invisible, but because they were seen through the lens of normality. In AI terms, they passed the classification test.</p>
<h2>From museum halls to machine learning</h2>
<p>This link between perception and categorization reveals something important about our increasingly algorithmic world. Whether it’s a guard deciding who looks suspicious or an AI deciding who looks like a “shoplifter,” the underlying process is the same: assigning people to categories based on cues that feel objective but are culturally learned.</p>
<p>When an AI system is described as “biased,” this often means that it reflects those social categories too faithfully. The Louvre heist reminds us that these categories don’t just shape our attitudes, they shape what gets noticed at all.</p>
<p>After the theft, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-louvre-culture-minister-heist-crown-jewels-adac61e953d030b4ff1e05062c3ba052">France’s culture minister promised new cameras and tighter security</a>. But no matter how advanced those systems become, they will still rely on categorization. Someone, or something, must decide what counts as “suspicious behavior.” If that decision rests on assumptions, the same blind spots will persist.</p>
<p>The Louvre robbery will be remembered as one of Europe’s most spectacular museum thefts. The thieves succeeded because they mastered the sociology of appearance: They understood the categories of normality and used them as tools.</p>
<p>And in doing so, they showed how both people and machines can mistake conformity for safety. Their success in broad daylight wasn’t only a triumph of planning. It was a triumph of categorical thinking, the same logic that underlies both human perception and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear: Before we teach machines to see better, we must first learn to question how we see.</p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>We’re in something of a purple patch if you’re a fan of clever new technology in single-seat race cars. Out in the Middle East, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/driverless-racing-is-real-terrible-and-strangely-exciting/">autonomous A2RL crew</a> held another race at Yas Marina, one that by all accounts was a lot more impressive than the last time the self-driving race cars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/man-vs-ai-race-scrapped-after-ai-car-crashes-into-wall-on-warm-up-lap/">competed against a human</a>. Formula E teams are getting ready for the debut next year of their Gen4 era, which sees cars with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/formula-e-gets-2x-the-power-and-awd-with-new-gen4-car/">real downforce and almost twice as much power</a>. Meanwhile, we only have a few months left before we see the results of F1’s new technical rules change, as the sport adopts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/lighter-nimbler-more-hybrid-power-he-f1-car-of-2026/">far more powerful electrical propulsion and active aerodynamics</a>. But what if there was an electric single-seater that was faster around a track than any of these?</p>
<p>That’s the idea behind the DRG-Lola, a racing concept designed from the ground up by Lola Cars, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/rebuilding-a-once-great-racing-name-the-return-of-lola-cars/">storied-now-reborn British race car manufacturer</a>, and Lucas di Grassi, veteran of the hybrid LMP1 sportscar days and FIA Formula E champion. Di Grassi is one of the more thoughtful racing drivers out there and is a passionate advocate of clean technologies in racing—in 2020 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/faster-to-125mph-than-f1-one-racing-drivers-plan-to-improve-formula-e/">he shared his earlier thoughts</a> on where Formula E could take its technical direction.</p>
<p>The DRG-Lola is much closer to reality than that 2020 concept; di Grassi has relied on existing battery and motor technology, rather than some uninvented unobtanium to make it all work. It generates 804 hp (600 kW) from a pair of electric motors driving the front and rear axles and is powered by a 60 kWh battery pack that’s arranged in modules on either side of the driver’s cockpit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/an-electric-car-thats-faster-than-f1-around-monaco-thats-the-idea/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OnePlus got its start courting the enthusiast community by offering blazing-fast phones for a low price. While the prices aren’t quite as low as they once were, the new OnePlus 15 still delivers on value. Priced at $899, this phone sports the latest and most powerful Snapdragon processor, the largest battery in a mainstream smartphone, and a super-fast screen.</p>
<p>The OnePlus 15 still doesn’t deliver the most satisfying software experience, and the camera may actually be a step back for the company, but the things OnePlus gets right are <em>very</em> right. It’s a fast, sleek phone that runs for ages on a charge, and it’s a little cheaper than the competition. But its shortcomings make it hard to recommend this device over the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-pixel-10-series-review-dont-call-it-an-android/">latest from Google</a> or Samsung—or even the flagship phone OnePlus released 10 months ago.</p>
<p>US buyers have time to mull it over, though. Because of the recent government shutdown, <span id="_AwceaZOePJqe0PEP5YuP0QI_37" class="K6pdKd wtBS9"><span class="pOOWX">Federal Communications Commission </span></span> approval of the OnePlus 15 has been delayed. The company says it will release the phone as soon as it can, but there’s no exact date yet.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/oneplus-15-review-the-end-of-range-anxiety/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Congressional Republicans angered local government leaders with a plan for what local groups call an “unprecedented federal intrusion” into how municipalities issue permits for construction of broadband networks. The Republican plan drew rave reviews from cable lobby groups, however.</p>
<p>A House subcommittee moved ahead with the plan today despite the opposition from local leaders and criticism from congressional Democrats. Under the bills, some kinds of local telecom projects would be approved automatically if a city or town doesn’t rule within a deadline set by Congress.</p>
<p>“These bills represent an unprecedented federal intrusion into established local decision-making processes, favoring large broadband, telecommunications, wireless, and cable companies at the expense of residents and taxpayers,” four groups representing local leaders wrote in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251117-Local-Gov-Associations-Opp-Commerce-CT-Markup_merged.pdf">letter</a> to US lawmakers. “These bills strip local governments of the ability to effectively manage the infrastructure built on local streets and in neighborhoods, while imposing no reciprocal obligations on providers.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/gop-overhaul-of-broadband-permit-laws-cities-hate-it-cable-companies-love-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, a DoorDash driver in upstate New York delivered an item to a local house in Oswego—only to find the front door open and a man apparently unconscious or asleep on a couch in the front room. The man was also quite naked, with pants and underwear around his ankles, and he was fully visible from the porch.</p>
<p>The DoorDasher was a 23-year-old woman named Olivia Henderson, and she felt like the whole situation was some kind of creepy exploitation play. Was this guy purposely exposing himself to her? Was he even asleep? Should she have to endure the sight of random male genitalia just to make a few bucks?</p>
<p>She did not think so, and she decided to do something about it. Henderson filmed the man from outside the home, and she later posted the video on TikTok to shame him. Naturally, it went viral.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/doordasher-claims-sexual-assault-but-cops-arrest-her-for-filming-nude-drunk-man/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal health officials have linked two massive US measles outbreaks, confirming that the country is about two months away from losing its measles elimination status, according to a report by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/health/measles-us-elimination-status-outbreaks.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The Times obtained a recording of a call during which officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to state health departments that the ongoing measles outbreak <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/measles-outbreak-investigation-in-utah-blocked-by-patient-who-refuses-to-talk/">at the border of Arizona and Utah</a> is a continuation of the explosive outbreak in West Texas that began in mid- to late-January. That is, the two massive outbreaks are being caused by the same subtype of measles virus.</p>
<p>This is a significant link that hasn’t previously been reported despite persistent questions from journalists and concerns from health experts, particularly in light of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/canada-fought-measles-and-measles-won-virus-now-endemic-after-1998-elimination/">Canada losing its elimination status last week</a>. The loss of an elimination status means that measles will once again be considered endemic to the US, an embarrassing public health backslide for a vaccine-preventable disease.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/cdc-data-confirms-us-is-2-months-away-from-losing-measles-elimination-status/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After years of pushback from the Federal Trade Commission over Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta has defeated the FTC’s monopoly claims.</p>
<p>In a Tuesday <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FTC-v-Meta-Opinion-11-18-25.pdf">ruling</a>, US District Judge James Boasberg said the FTC failed to show that Meta has a monopoly in a market dubbed “personal social networking.” In that narrowly defined market, the FTC unsuccessfully argued, Meta supposedly faces only two rivals, Snapchat and MeWe, which struggle to compete due to its alleged monopoly.</p>
<p>But the days of grouping apps into “separate markets of social networking and social media” are over, Boasberg wrote. He cited the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who “posited that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” while telling the FTC they missed their chance to block Meta’s purchase.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/meta-wins-monopoly-trial-convinces-judge-that-social-networking-is-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

Nvidia will commit up to $10 billion to Anthropic and Microsoft up to $5 billion, with both companies investing in Anthropic’s next funding round.</p>
<p>The deal brings together two companies that have backed OpenAI and connects them more closely to one of the ChatGPT maker’s main competitors. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl7vHnOgEg0&amp;t=4s">said</a> in a video that OpenAI “remains a critical partner,” while adding that the companies will increasingly be customers of each other.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has been adding AI features to Windows 11 for years, but things have recently entered a new phase, with both generative and so-called “agentic” AI features working their way <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsofts-vision-for-ai-pcs-looks-a-lot-like-another-crack-at-cortana/">deeper into the bedrock</a> of the operating system. A new build of Windows 11 released to Windows Insider Program testers yesterday includes a new “experimental agentic features” toggle in the Settings to support a feature called Copilot Actions, and Microsoft has <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">published a detailed support article</a> detailing more about just how those “experimental agentic features” will work.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar, “agentic” is a buzzword that Microsoft has used repeatedly to describe its future ambitions for Windows 11—in plainer language, these agents are meant to accomplish assigned tasks in the background, allowing the user’s attention to be turned elsewhere. Microsoft says it wants agents to be capable of “everyday tasks like organizing files, scheduling meetings, or sending emails,” and that Copilot Actions should give you “an active digital collaborator that can carry out complex tasks for you to enhance efficiency and productivity.”</p>
<p>But like other kinds of AI, these agents can be prone to error and confabulations and will often proceed as if they know what they’re doing even when they don’t. They also present, in Microsoft’s own words, “novel security risks,” mostly related to what can happen if an attacker is able to give instructions to one of these agents. As a result, Microsoft’s implementation walks a tightrope between giving these agents access to your files and cordoning them off from the rest of the system.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/new-windows-11-ai-agents-can-work-in-the-background-but-create-new-security-risks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever tried to hook an old Nintendo 64 up to a modern HDTV, you know the results can be less than ideal. Assuming your original hardware still works and your flatscreen even has the requisite R/F and/or composite inputs to allow for the connection, the N64’s output will probably look like a blurry mess on a flatscreen that wasn’t designed with those old video signals as a priority.</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D solves this very specific problem very well, with a powerful FPGA core that accurately replicates a Nintendo 64 and well-made display filters that do a good job of approximating that cathode-ray tube glow you remember from decades ago. But the lack of easy expandability limits the appeal of this $250 device to all but the most die-hard fans of original N64 hardware.</p>
<h2>A beauty to behold</h2>
<p>As a piece of physical design, the Analogue 3D is a work of art. The gentle curves of its sleek black shell evoke the original N64 design without copying it, coming in at a slightly smaller footprint and height. Plus, there’s no ugly power brick.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/the-analogue-3d-is-the-modern-n64-fans-have-been-waiting-for/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As Kent Halliburton stood in a bathroom at the Rosewood Hotel in central Amsterdam, thousands of miles from home, running his fingers through an envelope filled with 10,000 euros in crisp banknotes, he started to wonder what he had gotten himself into.</p>
<p>Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-worlds-biggest-bitcoin-mine-is-rattling-this-texas-oil-town/">bitcoin mining hardware</a> on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States.</p>
<p>As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia.
