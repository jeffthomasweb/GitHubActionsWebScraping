<p>The final flight of Europe's Vega rocket is scheduled for liftoff Wednesday night from French Guiana, carrying an important environmental monitoring satellite for the European Union's flagship Copernicus program.</p>
<p>The launch is set for 9:50 pm EDT Wednesday (01:50 UTC Thursday) from the European-run spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The 98-foot-tall (30-meter) Vega rocket will head north from the launch pad on the coast of South America, aiming for a polar orbit about 480 miles (775 kilometers) above the Earth.</p>
<p>The sole payload is Sentinel-2C, a remote sensing platform set to join Europe's fleet of Copernicus environmental satellites. The multibillion-dollar Copernicus system is the world's most comprehensive space-based Earth observation network, with satellites fitted with different kinds of instruments monitoring land surfaces, oceans, and the atmosphere.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047033#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047033&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Now that NASA has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/">resolved the question</a> of the Starliner spacecraft and its two crew members on the International Space Station, the agency faces another high-stakes human spaceflight decision.</p>
<p>The choice concerns the Orion spacecraft's heat shield and whether NASA will make any changes before the Artemis II mission that will make a lunar flyby. Although Starliner has garnered a lot of media attention, this will be an even higher-profile decision for NASA, with higher consequences—four astronauts will be on board, and hundreds of millions, if not billions of people, will be watching humanity's first deep space mission in more than five decades.</p>
<p>The issue is the safety of the heat shield, located at the base of the capsule, which protects Orion's crew during its return to Earth. During the Artemis I mission that sent Orion beyond the Moon in late 2022, without astronauts on board, chunks of charred material cracked and chipped away from Orion's heat shield during reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Once the spacecraft landed, engineers found more than 100 locations where the stresses of reentry damaged the heat shield.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043964#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043964&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Over the weekend, the nonprofit National Novel Writing Month organization (NaNoWriMo) <a href="https://nanowrimo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/29933455931412-What-is-NaNoWriMo-s-position-on-Artificial-Intelligence-AI">published an FAQ</a> outlining its position on AI, calling categorical rejection of AI writing technology "classist" and "ableist." The statement caused a backlash online, prompted <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nanowrimo-organizers-classist-and-ableist-to-condemn-ai/">four members</a> of the organization's board to step down, and prompted a sponsor to <a href="https://ellipsus.com/blog/nanowrimo-sponsorship-generative-ai">withdraw</a> its support.</p>

<p>"We believe that to categorically condemn AI would be to ignore classist and ableist issues surrounding the use of the technology," wrote NaNoWriMo, "and that questions around the use of AI tie to questions around privilege."</p>
<p>NaNoWriMo, known for its annual challenge where participants write a 50,000-word manuscript in November, argued in its post that condemning AI would ignore issues of class and ability, suggesting the technology could benefit those who might otherwise need to hire human writing assistants or have differing cognitive abilities.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047101#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047101&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Judges for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday rejected the Internet Archive (IA) argument that its controlled digital lending—which allows only one person to borrow each scanned e-book at a time—was a transformative fair use that worked like a traditional library and did not violate copyright law.</p>
<p>As Judge Beth Robinson wrote in the decision, because the IA's digital copies of books did not "provide criticism, commentary, or information about the originals" or alter the original books to add "something new," the court concluded that the IA's use of publishers' books was not transformative, hobbling the organization's fair use defense.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047365#p3">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047365&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Minecraft</em> is among the most successful and influential games of the early 21st century, winning many awards and selling over 300 million copies (so far) since its 2011 release. So it was only a matter of time before Hollywood gave us a feature film based on the 3D sandbox game, simply titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Minecraft_Movie"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a>. Sure, one might have reservations about yet another video game-based movie, but on the plus side, we've got Jason Momoa and Jack Black co-starring. And the first teaser is full of eye-popping candy-colored cubic visuals and sly references to the game that should please fans.</p>
<p>Within a year of <em>Minecraft</em>'s initial release, Mojang Studios was fielding offers from Hollywood producers about making a TV series based on the game, but the company wanted to wait for "the right idea." There was a 2014 attempt to crowd-source a fan film, but game creator Markus "Notch" Persson didn't agree to license that effort since he was already negotiating with Warner Bros. about developing a film based on the game. Thus began a long, convoluted process of directors and writers being hired and leaving the project for various reasons.</p>
<p>When the dust finally settled, Jared Hess (who worked with Black on <em>Nacho Libre</em>) ended up directing. The COVID pandemic and 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike delayed things further, but filming finally wrapped earlier this year in Auckland, New Zealand—just in time for a spring 2025 theatrical release. Per the official synopsis:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047135#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047135&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>With one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the country, Oregon is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in decades. This year's count is now higher than anything seen since 2000, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html">declared the highly contagious virus eliminated from the US</a>.</p>
<p>Since the start of the year, Oregon has tallied <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ph/diseasesconditions/diseasesaz/pages/measles.aspx">31 cases of measles, all in unvaccinated people</a>. The cases have been accumulating in sustained waves of transmission since mid-June.</p>
<p>Last month, when the outbreak tally was still in the 20s, health officials noted that it was nearing a state record set in 2019. There were 28 cases that year, which were linked to a large outbreak across the border in Washington state. But, with that record now surpassed, the state is in pre-elimination territory.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047323#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047323&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Networking hardware-maker Zyxel is warning of nearly a dozen vulnerabilities in a wide array of its products. If left unpatched, some of them could enable the complete takeover of the devices, which can be targeted as an initial point of entry into large networks.</p>
<p>The most serious vulnerability, tracked as <a href="https://www.zyxel.com/global/en/support/security-advisories/zyxel-security-advisory-for-os-command-injection-vulnerability-in-aps-and-security-router-devices-09-03-2024">CVE-2024-7261</a>, can be exploited to “allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute OS commands by sending a crafted cookie to a vulnerable device,” Zyxel warned. The flaw, with a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, stems from the “improper neutralization of special elements in the parameter ‘host’ in the CGI program” of vulnerable access points and security routers. Nearly 30 Zyxel devices are affected. As is the case with the remaining vulnerabilities in this post, Zyxel is urging customers to patch them as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>But wait... there’s more</h2>
<p>The hardware manufacturer warned of seven additional vulnerabilities affecting firewall series including the ATP, USG-FLEX, and USG FLEX 50(W)/USG20(W)-VPN. The vulnerabilities carry severity ratings ranging from 4.9 to 8.1. The vulnerabilities are:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047312#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047312&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Wars of necessity spawn weapons innovation as each side tries to counter the other's tactics and punch through defenses. For instance—as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made drone warfare real, both sides have developed ways to bring down drones more easily. One recent Ukrainian innovation has been building <a href="https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1829130105160896959">counter-drone ramming drones </a>that literally knock Russian drones from the sky.</p>
<p>In the case of the trench warfare that currently dominates the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainians have another new tactic: dragon's fire. Delivered by drone.</p>
<p>Videos have begun to circulate on Telegram and X this week from Ukrainian units showing their new weapon. (You can see three of them below.) The videos each show a drone moving deliberately along a trench line as it releases a continuous stream of incendiary material, which often starts fires on the ground below (and ignites nearby ammunition).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047277#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047277&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As large language models have continued to rise in prominence, many users and companies have focused on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/gmails-ai-powered-email-summaries-can-dig-through-your-inbox-for-you/">their useful ability to quickly summarize lengthy documents</a> for easier human consumption. When Australia's Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) looked into this potential use case, though, it found that the summaries it was able to get from the Llama2-70B model were judged as significantly worse than those provided by humans.</p>
<p>ASIC's <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=b4fd6043-6626-4cbe-b8ee-a5c7319e94a0">proof-of-concept study</a> (PDF)—which was run in January and February, written up in March, and published in response to a Senate inquiry in May—has a number of limitations that make it hard to generalize about the summarizing capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in the present day. Still, the government study shows many of the potential pitfalls large organizations should consider before simply inserting LLM outputs into existing workflows.</p>
<h2>Keeping score</h2>
<p>For its study, ASIC teamed up with Amazon Web Services to evaluate LLMs' ability to summarize "a sample of public submissions made to an external Parliamentary Joint Committee inquiry, looking into audit and consultancy firms." For ASIC's purposes, a good summary of one of these submissions would highlight any mention of ASIC, any recommendations for avoiding conflicts of interest, and any calls for more regulation, all with references to page numbers and "brief context" for explanation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047265#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047265&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Department of Justice is reportedly deepening its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/us-agencies-to-probe-ai-dominance-of-nvidia-microsoft-and-openai/">probe into Nvidia</a>. Officials have moved on from merely questioning competitors to subpoenaing Nvidia and other tech companies for evidence that could substantiate allegations that Nvidia is abusing its "dominant position in AI computing," Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation">reported</a>.</p>
<p>When news of the DOJ's probe into the trillion-dollar company was first reported in June, Fast Company <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91141626/nvidia-doj-probe-market-dominance">reported</a> that scrutiny was intensifying merely because Nvidia was estimated to control "as much as 90 percent of the market for chips" capable of powering AI models. Experts told Fast Company that the DOJ probe might even be good for Nvidia's business, noting that the market barely moved when the probe was first announced.</p>
<p>But the market's confidence seemed to be shaken a little more on Tuesday, when Nvidia lost a "record-setting $279 billion" in market value following Bloomberg's report. Nvidia's losses became "the biggest single-day market-cap decline on record," TheStreet <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/nvidia-stock-extends-280-billion-slump-after-doj-probe-report">reported</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047264#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047264&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I live in suburbia, which means I've got a garage (or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhbJnlIvfyc">carhole</a>, if you’re not so fancy). It's a detached garage, so part of my nightly routine when I check to make sure the house is all locked up is to peek out the back window. I like to know the garage door is closed and our cars are tucked in safely.</p>
<p>But actually <em>looking</em> out a <em>window</em> with my stupid analog <em>eyeballs</em> is lame, so I figured I could make things easier by adding some smarts to my garage. The first thing I did was use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230311070645/https://www.richlynch.com/2013/07/27/pi_garage_alert_1/">this fellow’s instructions</a> (the original site is sadly offline, but the Wayback Machine is forever) to cobble together a Raspberry Pi-based solution that would fire off an email every time the garage door opened or closed. I couldn’t remotely open or close the door from inside the house myself (well, I mean, I <em>could</em> with the actual garage door opener remote control), but I could just glance at my inbox to see if the garage door was open or shut in the evenings.</p>
<p>This worked great for a couple of years, until Texas summers murdered the poor Pi. (This was possibly my fault, too, because of the PoE hat that I’d slapped onto the Pi, which resulted in extra heat.) So, I was back to peeking out my window to check on the garage in the evenings. Like a sucker.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047096#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047096&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Conventional wisdom would suggest that all dogs love to play fetch, while most cats would simply refuse to do so. But a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0309068">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE suggests that cats not only play fetch with their owners, they do so far more frequently than previously believed. And while most dogs play fetch at least sometimes, about 12 percent do not. More-trainable dog breeds are more likely to exhibit fetching behavior, while in both species, animals that are more active and playful—and usually male—are more likely to enjoy playing fetch, suggesting that it is a form of play.</p>
<p>"We were surprised to find that there were very few studies of fetching behavior in dogs," said co-author Mikel Delgado, a veterinary medicine researcher at Purdue University. "And personally, as a life-long cat person, I have to admit that I thought all dogs fetched. So it was interesting to get a better sense of how common this behavior is in cats and dogs. We hope that the study draws more attention to fetching behavior in cats, who are often portrayed as independent and aloof. In fact, they can be very social, and this is a nice example of one way they are interactive with humans."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/yes-some-cats-like-to-play-fetch-its-science/">previously reported</a>, many different animal species exhibit play behavior, and it's most common in mammals and birds. Contrary to what one might expect from cats, fetching behavior has been observed across multiple cat breeds all over the world, usually emerging in kittenhood. One owner who participated in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1558787822000533">2022 study</a> noted that their cat was so obsessed with fetch that it would sometimes drop its favorite toy on their face in the middle of the night.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046689#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046689&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-co-founder-sutskevers-new-safety-focused-ai-startup-ssi-raises-1-billion-2024-09-04/">reported</a> that Safe Superintelligence (SSI), a new AI startup <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/ex-openai-star-sutskever-shoots-for-superintelligent-ai-with-new-company/">cofounded</a> by OpenAI's former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised $1 billion in funding. The 3-month-old company plans to focus on developing what it calls "safe" AI systems that surpass human capabilities.</p>

<p>The fundraising effort shows that even amid <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai--too-much-spend,-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf">growing skepticism</a> around massive investments in AI tech that so far have failed to be profitable, some backers are still willing to place large bets on high-profile talent in foundational AI research. Venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, DST Global, and SV Angel participated in the SSI funding round.</p>
<p>SSI aims to use the new funds for computing power and attracting talent. With only 10 employees at the moment, the company intends to build a larger team of researchers across locations in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Reuters reported.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047175#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047175&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In January 2022, a placid patch of the ocean’s surface near the islands of Tonga suddenly exploded with activity. After a month or so of activity, an underwater eruption of unprecedented scale from the Hunga volcano blasted ash up through the water column and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/hunga-tonga-eruption-put-over-50b-kilograms-of-water-into-the-stratosphere/"><span data-contrast="none">more than 30 miles into the air</span></a>, where it quickly spread out in a billowing plume spanning hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>The blast was so powerful that it rang Earth like a bell; it produced a shockwave that circled the globe multiple times and released a sonic boom heard as far away as Alaska. The eruption also triggered a tsunami that affected coastlines across the Pacific Ocean and made waves recorded in Japan, North and South America, and Antarctica.</p>
<p>Quite by surprise, scientists discovered that the eruption also had an underwater aftermath, recently described in a paper published in the journal <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s43247-024-01411-w">Nature Communications Earth and Environment</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046659#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046659&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you had given me, at age 15 or so, a game in which you can fight seemingly hundreds of Tyranid bugs at once with two friends, alternately blasting them with bolt rifles or pulverizing them with a chainsword, then finishing the biggest of them by ripping off one of his claws and shoving it through his head, all of it happening to the sounds of action-movie orchestration and dialogue about stoic duty, would I have had any complaints?</p>

<p>No, I would not. But we're spoiled for choice now. How much you enjoy <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em></a> (for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation and releasing on September 9) will depend on your ability to tap into the deep basement of your kill-'em-all mentality and fantasy lore engagement. You can enjoy it somewhat ironically, which I did at times, especially when playing co-op with friends who told me that they did not like the game's aesthetics at all. But strip away the grimdark trappings of zealotry, Chaos Marines, and skulls—so, so many skulls—and you have a competent, sometimes innovative third-person squad shooter. It feels like <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/gears-of-war-5-hands-on-a-new-blockbuster-for-the-game-subscription-era/">Gears of War</a>, </em>minus the cover, but with heavier characters, more melee combat, and somehow even fewer women.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of <em>Space Marine 2 </em>means suspending disbelief, feeling heavy metal, and wanting to kill a whole bunch of things with some very big dudes. In roughly a dozen hours of gameplay, I found the core gameplay loop relatively engaging, with enough mix-ups, upgrades, and challenges to keep it feeling more like the fun kind of endless war, not the real kind. It's pretty enjoyable to team up with friends, too, so long as they're cool with <em>Warhammer 40K's </em>vibes and some occasionally repetitive challenges.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047067#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047067&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Starlink said it is complying with Brazil's order to block Elon Musk's X platform, backtracking from its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/starlink-vows-to-defy-brazilian-order-that-isps-block-musks-x-platform/">earlier position</a> that it would not block X until Brazilian officials released Starlink's frozen assets. In an <a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1831053118265843722">update on Tuesday afternoon</a>, Starlink said it is blocking X while continuing to fight the asset freeze in court.</p>
<p>"Following last week's order from [Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes] that froze Starlink's finances and prevents Starlink from conducting financial transactions in Brazil, we immediately initiated legal proceedings in the Brazilian Supreme Court explaining the gross illegality of this order and asking the Court to unfreeze our assets," SpaceX's satellite broadband division said. "Regardless of the illegal treatment of Starlink in freezing of our assets, we are complying with the order to block access to X in Brazil. We continue to pursue all legal avenues, as are others who agree that @alexandre's recent orders violate the Brazilian constitution."</p>
<p>Starlink <a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1829253524842303678">previously said</a> that a Brazilian court order froze its assets "based on an unfounded determination that Starlink should be responsible for the fines levied—unconstitutionally—against X." An <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brazil-starlink-x-block-compliance-musk-supreme-court-moraes-d09dfe4c6fbfacf303968fe44bcd0ab1">Associated Press article</a> said that "de Moraes froze Starlink's accounts last week as a means to compel it to cover X's fines that already exceeded $3 million, reasoning that the two companies are part of the same economic group."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047158#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047158&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp8625">In a new study</a>, we have sequenced DNA from a Christian community in medieval Spain that lived in artificial caves carved into a rocky outcrop.</p>
<p>This is one of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271205472_Forest_resource_management_during_Roman_and_Medieval_cave_occupations_in_the_Northwest_of_the_Iberian_Peninsula_Cova_do_Xato_and_Cova_Eiros_Galicia_Spain">several medieval cave communities</a> known to have lived on the Iberian Peninsula—which includes both Portugal and Spain. Why these groups favored caves over more conventional village dwellings is a subject of longstanding debate for archaeologists. While it may be tempting to speculate about hermits or religious groups, there’s scant evidence to support such theories.</p>
<p>Our study, published in Science Advances, explores the possibilities, adding genetic analysis to what we know about the physical remains of people from the site’s cemetery. DNA was able to shed light on the ancestry of this community, their relationships to each other and the diseases that afflicted them.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047094#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047094&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>America's tradespeople have steadily been getting more van-curious over the years, helped no doubt by Ford beginning local production of the already Euro-popular Transit in Kansas City in 2014. In 2022 Ford <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/weve-driven-fords-other-electric-workhorse-the-2022-e-transit/">debuted the E-Transit</a>, which has been <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/725448/ford-us-ev-sales-june2024/">steadily growing in sales</a> over the past few quarters. Now the Blue Oval has started deliveries of the model-year 2024 E-Transit, and there are some worthwhile improvements compared to the MY23 van.</p>
<p>The opprobrium that is now starting to stick to supersized pickup trucks has mostly ignored the humble van. It's contradictory, on the face of it; even a low-roof Transit takes up more volume on the road than most pickups. But then, there aren't leather-and-chrome special edition Transit vans driven more as commuter cars or weekend toys like there are pickups—at least for now.</p>
<p>EV vans ought to be even more immune, for they maintain their working class credentials and burnish them with a side helping of environmentalism. For example, Ford says that data from its telematics show that since its introduction in 2022 until the end of Q2 2024, E-Transit customers in the US and Canada had avoided burning more than 3 million gallons of gas (11.3 million L) and reduced their output of CO<sub>2</sub> by 25 million kg.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047080#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047080&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Windows-on-Arm is finally just about good enough to serve as your main PC, thanks to a combination of long-awaited Snapdragon X-series silicon from Qualcomm, Arm-specific improvements in the Windows 11 24H2 update, and third-party software developers that are slowly but surely putting out Arm-native versions of their most popular apps.</p>
<p>So far, those Snapdragon X chips have been confined mostly to $1,000-and-up premium PCs like the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop. But Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon has said that he wants to get better hardware into midrange laptops in the $700 range, and today the company took a concrete step toward making that happen: a new version of the Snapdragon X with 8 CPU cores instead of 10, but the same Oryon CPU architecture (a neural processing unit [NPU] that still meets Microsoft's requirements for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">Copilot+ PCs</a>) and the same Snapdragon X Plus branding as the faster 10-core versions.</p>
<p>There are two separate versions of the 8-core Snapdragon X Plus. The X1P-46-100 version allows its CPU to boost up to 4.0 GHz for single-core tasks and has a GPU capable of 2.1 TFLOPS of performance (compared to 3.8 for the 10-core X plus, and 4.6 for the fastest Snapdragon X Elite variants). The X1P-42-100 version only boosts up to 3.4 GHz in single-core mode and has a 1.7 TFLOPS GPU. All of Qualcomm's NPUs are the same, offering 45 trillion operations per second (TOPS).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046929#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046929&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A splashy California-based launch company named Relativity Space shared a photo of sleek-looking rocket hardware on its <a href="https://www.threads.net/@relativityspace/post/C_OeeNdSoLq">social media</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/relativity/posts/?feedView=all">channels</a> last week. The image featured an impressively large payload fairing, which protects satellites on the ride into space.</p>
<p>"Time to take a look at Terran R’s payload envelope," the company said, calling attention to three people standing to the left of the tall fairing.</p>
<p>Such an anodyne post seems an unlikely candidate to spark an analysis of what is really happening at Relativity Space, but that’s exactly what happened. Less than an hour after its publication, a source I've been talking to about Relativity for a while contacted me again.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046136#p3">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046136&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
