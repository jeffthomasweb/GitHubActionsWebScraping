              <![CDATA[<p>Computed tomography scans have become vital, even lifesaving, medical imaging for diagnosing and monitoring health conditions. But they do expose patients to ionizing radiation at levels linked to higher risks of cancer. In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778">a new study in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>, researchers tried to estimate what those higher risks are exactly—and although the estimates come with uncertainty, they may seem startling.</p>
<p>Based on data from 93 million CT scans performed on 62 million people in 2023, the researchers estimated that the CT scans would lead to 103,000 future cancers. To put that in context, those 103,000 cancers would account for about 5 percent of cancers diagnosed each year, based on the current cancer rates and the current usage of CT scans. And the estimate puts CT scans on par with alcohol consumption and obesity in terms of risk factors for developing cancer.</p>
<p>The most common types of cancers estimated to be a result of CT scans were lung cancer and colon cancer—two cancers that are becoming more common in younger people for reasons experts do not fully understand. The types of CT scans linked to the greatest number of cancers were abdomen and pelvis CT scans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/ct-scans-could-cause-5-of-cancers-study-finds-experts-note-uncertainty/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-administrations-attack-on-university-research-accelerates/">using federal research funding as a cudgel</a>. The government has blocked billions of dollars in research funds and threatened to put a hold on even more in order to compel universities to adopt what it presents as essential reforms. In the case of Columbia University, that includes changes in the leadership of individual academic departments.</p>
<p>On Friday, the government sent a list of demands that it presented as necessary to "maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government." On Monday, Harvard responded that accepting these demands would "allow itself to be taken over by the federal government." The university also changed its home page into an extensive tribute to the research that would be eliminated if the funds were withheld.</p>
<p>In response, the Trump administration later <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/joint-task-force-combat-anti-semitism-statement-regarding-harvard-university">put $2.2 billion of Harvard's research funding on hold</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/harvard-says-feds-research-funding-demands-amount-to-a-takeover/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Mars is back on the agenda.</p>
<p>During his address to a joint session of Congress in March, President Donald Trump said the United States "will pursue our Manifest Destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars."</p>
<p>What does this mean? Manifest destiny is the belief, which was particularly widespread in 1800s America, that US settlers were destined to expand westward across North America. Similarly, then, the Trump administration believes it is the manifest destiny of Americans to settle Mars. And he wants his administration to take steps toward accomplishing that goal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/should-the-us-prioritize-settling-mars/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[OpenAI's brand new "GPT-4.1" has a funky name but reasonable performance for the price.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/">announced</a> the GPT-4.1 model family, its newest series of AI language models that brings a 1 million token context window to OpenAI for the first time and continues a long tradition of very confusing AI model names. Three confusing new names, in fact: GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and GPT‑4.1 nano.</p>
<p>According to OpenAI, these models outperform <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a> in several key areas. But in an unusual move, GPT-4.1 will only be available through the developer API, not in the consumer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> interface where most people interact with OpenAI's technology.</p>
<p>The 1 million token context window—essentially the amount of text the AI can process at once—allows these models to ingest roughly 3,000 pages of text in a single conversation. This puts OpenAI's context windows on par with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">Google's Gemini models</a>, which have offered similar extended context capabilities for some time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/when-is-4-1-greater-than-4-5-when-its-openais-newest-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In one way or another, the Lunar Gateway has lingered around the periphery of NASA's human exploration program since the Obama administration.</p>
<p>Back then, the elements that eventually coalesced into the Gateway were geared toward a nebulous initiative to capture a small asteroid and reposition it closer to Earth. Under direction from the first Trump administration, NASA ditched the asteroid idea and repackaged the concept to become a mini-space station in orbit around the Moon.</p>
<p>NASA officials justified the Lunar Gateway program by highlighting its utility as a staging point or safe haven for astronauts traveling to and from the surface of the Moon. Crews could launch from Earth and travel to the Moon's vicinity inside NASA's Orion spacecraft, connect with the Gateway, and then float into their lunar lander already docked with the outpost.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/heres-the-latest-on-nasas-lunar-gateway-a-program-many-people-want-to-cancel/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Razer, maker of green-hued gaming hardware and accessories, has entered the game-streaming space with its new—but not entirely new—app, <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-software/razer-pc-remote-play">PC Remote Play</a>. It's based on very good existing streaming tech and makes connecting a PC to mobile devices fairly simple. It's worth checking out unless you have a hard-and-fast policy about avoiding software "utilities" from RGB-obsessed gaming companies.</p>
<p>That, or you're already using and comfortable with <a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/">Moonlight</a>. Moonlight and <a href="https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine">Sunshine</a> are the open source game-streaming client and server that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/nvidias-gamestream-is-dead-sunshine-and-moonlight-are-better-replacements/">wonderfully picked up where Nvidia's Gamestream left off</a>. PC Remote Play is based on Moonstream's open source code, and Razer has <a href="https://github.com/razerofficial/Razer-PC-Remote-Play-android">made much of its own version's code available</a>.</p>
<p>You're getting a few small upgrades when using PC Remote Play:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/razer-built-a-game-streaming-app-on-top-of-moonlight-and-its-not-too-bad/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Li-ion batteries that power everything from smartphones to electric cars are usually packed in rigid, sealed enclosures that prevent stresses from damaging their components and keep air from coming into contact with their flammable and toxic electrolytes. It’s hard to use batteries like this in soft robots or wearables, so a team of scientists at the University California, Berkeley built a flexible, non-toxic, jelly-like battery that could survive bending, twisting, and even cutting with a razor.</p>
<p>While flexible batteries using hydrogel electrolytes have been achieved before, they came with significant drawbacks. “All such batteries could [only] operate [for] a short time, sometimes a few hours, sometimes a few days,” says Liwei Lin, a mechanical engineering professor at UC Berkeley and senior author of the study. The battery built by his team endured 500 complete charge cycles—about as many as the batteries in most smartphones are designed for.</p>
<h2>Power in water</h2>
<p>“Current-day batteries require a rigid package because the electrolyte they use is explosive, and one of the things we wanted to make was a battery that would be safe to operate without this rigid package,” Lin told Ars. Unfortunately, flexible packaging made of polymers or other stretchable materials can be easily penetrated by air or water, which will react with standard electrolytes, generating lots of heat, potentially resulting in fires and explosions. This is why, in 2017, scientists started to experiment with quasi-solid-state hydrogel electrolytes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/scientists-made-a-stretchable-lithium-battery-you-can-bend-cut-or-stab/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Starting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust trial Monday with a bang, Daniel Matheson, the FTC's lead litigator, flagged a "smoking gun"—a 2012 email where Mark Zuckerberg suggested that Facebook could buy Instagram to "neutralize a potential competitor," The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/technology/meta-antitrust-trial-ftc.html">reported</a>.</p>
<p>And in "another banger of an email from Zuckerberg," Brendan Benedict, an antitrust expert monitoring the trial for Big Tech on Trial, <a href="https://x.com/BBenedict33/status/1911799375904268464">posted</a> on X that the Meta CEO wrote, "Messenger isn't beating WhatsApp. Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion... that's not exactly killing it."</p>
<p>These messages and others, the FTC hopes to convince the court, provide evidence that Zuckerberg runs Meta by the mantra "it's better to buy than compete"—seemingly for more than a decade intent on growing the Facebook empire by killing off rivals, allegedly in violation of antitrust law. Another message from Zuckerberg exhibited at trial, Benedict <a href="https://x.com/BBenedict33/status/1911792988847575043">noted</a> on X, suggests Facebook tried to buy yet another rival, Snapchat, for $6 billion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/ftcs-monopoly-case-hinges-on-zuckerbergs-damaging-texts-emails/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Samsung began the process of updating millions of smartphones around the world to its latest One UI 7 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/android-15s-security-and-privacy-features-are-the-updates-highlight/">Android 15</a>) software last week, but that process has now been halted. Over the weekend, Samsung purged the One UI 7 update from its servers, which indicates that a serious problem has occurred. The company isn't offering any explanation for the pause yet, but reports around the Internet suggest there are some bugs problematic enough that it required Samsung to slam on the brakes.</p>
<p>This update was destined for the Galaxy S24, Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6, all of which launched with One UI 6 (Android 14). Samsung promises seven years of update support like Google, but it takes longer for it to release new operating system versions. Not only does Samsung modify the way Android looks, but it also integrates a raft of Galaxy AI features with Android. It takes time to do that—seven months and counting since Android 15's release—but it seems Samsung should have spent a little more time testing all those changes.</p>
<p>As soon as Samsung began the rollout on April 7, Galaxy S24 users in Korea noticed their phones would intermittently refuse to unlock, as <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1911616077756580142">reported</a> by frequent Samsung leaker IceUniverse. There are also reports that Samsung's supposedly private Secure Folder has a bug in One UI 7 that can see photos from the gallery appear in auto-generated Stories. These Stories are accessible from outside the Secure Folder, which rather defeats the purpose of having private photos.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/samsungs-android-15-update-has-been-halted/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[It would be Apple's first overhaul of iPad multitasking since 2022's iPadOS 16.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Apple is taking another crack at iPad multitasking, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-13/apple-vision-pro-2-details-low-latency-headset-ar-glasses-ipados-19-details-m9flf1fd">report</a> from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. This year's iPadOS 19 release, due to be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-the-week-of-june-9/">on June 9</a>, will apparently include an "overhaul that will make the tablet's software more like macOS."</p>
<p>The report is light on details about what's actually changing, aside from a broad "focus on productivity, multitasking, and app window management." But Apple will apparently continue to stop short of allowing users of newer iPads to run macOS on their tablets, despite the fact that modern iPad Airs and Pros use the same processors as Macs.</p>
<p>If this is giving you déjà vu, you're probably thinking about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/ipados-16-has-lots-of-updates-but-new-multitasking-features-require-an-m1-chip/">iPadOS 16</a>, the last time Apple tried making significant upgrades to the iPad's multitasking model. Gurman's reporting at the time even used similar language, saying that iPads running the new software would work "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-02/apple-to-upgrade-its-ipad-software-in-bid-to-satisfy-pro-users">more like a laptop and less like a phone</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/report-apple-will-take-another-crack-at-ipad-multitasking-in-ipados-19/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-manufacture-american-made-ai-supercomputers-us/">announced plans</a> today to manufacture AI chips and build complete supercomputers on US soil for the first time, commissioning over one million square feet of manufacturing space across Arizona and Texas. The politically timed move comes amid rising US-China tensions and the Trump administration's push for domestic manufacturing.</p>
<p>Nvidia's announcement comes less than two weeks after the Trump administration's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-boosts-china-tariffs-to-125-pauses-tariff-hikes-on-other-countries/">chaotic rollout</a> of new tariffs and just two days after the administration's contradictory messages on electronic component exemptions.</p>
<p>On Friday night, the US Customs and Border Protection <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/12/nx-s1-5363025/apple-iphone-tariff-exemption-china">posted a bulletin</a> exempting electronics including smartphones, computers, and semiconductors from Trump's steep reciprocal tariffs. But by Sunday, Trump and his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick contradicted this move, claiming the exemptions <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/trump-tariffs-live-updates-us-stronger-despite-market/?id=120551033">were only temporary</a> and that electronics would face new "semiconductor tariffs" in the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-admin-new-tariffs-electronics-china-1235316601/">coming months</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/amid-trump-tariff-chaos-nvidia-launches-ai-chip-production-on-us-soil/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What a difference a week makes. This past weekend, Formula 1 went back to Bahrain, the site of this year's preseason test, for round four of the 2025 season. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/f1-in-japan-reminds-us-a-great-track-might-not-make-for-a-great-race/">Last week's race in Japan</a> sent many to sleep, but that was definitely not the case on Sunday. The overtaking was frenetic, the sparks didn't set anything on fire, and the title fight just got that little bit more complicated. It was a heck of a race.</p>
<h2>V10s? Not any time soon</h2>
<p>Before the racing got underway, the sport got some clarity on future powertrain rules. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/lighter-nimbler-more-hybrid-power-he-f1-car-of-2026/">An ambitious new ruleset</a> goes into effect next year, with an all-new, small-capacity turbocharged V6 engine working together with an electric motor that powers the rear wheels. Just under half the total power comes from the hybrid system, much more than the two hybrid systems on current F1 cars, and developing them <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/perfecting-hondas-2026-f1-powertrain-is-not-so-easy-says-racing-boss/">is no easy task</a>. Nor is it cheap.</p>
<p>F1 is also moving to supposedly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/formula-1-talks-to-ars-about-sustainability-and-synthetic-fuels/">carbon-neutral synthetic fuels</a> next year, and that has prompted some to wonder—increasingly loudly—if instead of the expensive hybrids lasting for four years, maybe they could be replaced with a cheaper non-hybrid engine instead, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/bring-the-noise-f1-considering-the-return-of-the-v10s/">like a naturally aspirated V10</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/f1-in-bahrain-i-dare-you-to-call-that-race-boring/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The colonial victory against the British in the American Revolutionary War was far from a predetermined outcome. In addition to good strategy and the timely appearance of key allies like the French, Continental soldiers relied on several key technological innovations in weaponry. But just how accurate is an 18th-century musket when it comes to hitting a target? Did the rifle really determine the outcome of the war? And just how much damage did cannon inflict? A team of military weapons experts and re-enactors set about testing some of those questions in a new NOVA documentary, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/"><em>Revolutionary War Weapons</em></a>.</p>
<p>The documentary examines the firing range and accuracy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bess">Brown Bess muskets</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_rifle">long rifles</a> used by both the British and the Continental Army during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a>; the effectiveness of Native American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk">tomahawks</a> for close combat (no, they were usually not thrown as depicted in so many popular films, but there are modern throwing competitions today); and the effectiveness of cannons against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabion#:~:text=A%20gabion%20(from%20Italian%20gabbione,building%2C%20military%20applications%20and%20landscaping.">gabions</a> and other defenses employed to protect the British fortress during the pivotal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown">Siege of Yorktown</a>. There is even a fascinating segment on the first military submarine, dubbed "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(submersible)">the Turtle</a>," created by American inventor David Bushnell.</p>
<p>To capture all the high-speed ballistics action, director Stuart Powell relied upon a range of high-speed cameras called the Phantom Range. "It is like a supercomputer," Powell told Ars. "It is a camera, but it doesn't feel like a camera. You need to be really well-coordinated on the day when you're using it because it bursts for, like, 10 seconds. It doesn't record constantly because it's taking so much data. Depending on what the frame rate is, you only get a certain amount of time. So you're trying to coordinate that with someone trying to fire a 250-year-old piece of technology. If the gun doesn't go off, if something goes wrong on set, you'll miss it. Then it takes five minutes to reboot and get ready for the new shot. So a lot of the shoot revolves around the camera; that's not normally the case."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/new-nova-doc-puts-revolutionary-war-weapons-to-the-test/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal scientists responsible for monitoring the health of West Coast fisheries are cleaning office bathrooms and reconsidering critical experiments after the Department of Commerce failed to renew their lab’s contracts for hazardous waste disposal, janitorial services, IT, and building maintenance.</p>
<p>Trash is piling up at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers told ProPublica. Ecologists, chemists, and biologists at Montlake Laboratory, the center’s headquarters in Seattle, are taking turns hauling garbage to the dumpster and discussing whether they should create a sign-up sheet to scrub toilets.</p>
<p>The scientists—who conduct genetic sampling of endangered salmon to check the species’ stock status and survival—routinely work with chemicals that can burn skin, erupt into flames, and cause cancer. At least one said they’d have to delay mission-critical research if hazardous waste removal isn’t restored.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/noaa-scientists-scrub-toilets-rethink-experiments-after-service-contracts-end/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Dolphins are generally regarded as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/whale-and-dolphin-brains-are-bigger-if-their-species-is-more-social/">some of the smartest</a> creatures on the planet. Research has shown they can cooperate, teach each other new skills, and even recognize themselves in a mirror. For decades, scientists have attempted to make sense of the complex collection of whistles and clicks dolphins use to communicate. Researchers might make a little headway on that front soon with the help of Google's open AI model and some Pixel phones.</p>
<p>Google has been finding ways to work generative AI into everything else it does, so why not its collaboration with the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP)? This group has been studying dolphins since 1985 using a non-invasive approach to track a specific community of Atlantic spotted dolphins. The WDP creates video and audio recordings of dolphins, along with correlating notes on their behaviors.</p>
<p>One of the WDP's main goals is to analyze the way dolphins vocalize and how that can affect their social interactions. With decades of underwater recordings, researchers have managed to connect some basic activities to specific sounds. For example, Atlantic spotted dolphins have signature whistles that appear to be used like names, allowing two specific individuals to find each other. They also consistently produce "squawk" sound patterns during fights.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/google-created-a-new-ai-model-for-talking-to-dolphins/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[One game-player and one newbie return to recap HBO's fungal free-for-all.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here every Monday morning</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: To start us off as we return to the world of <em>The Last of Us</em>, as a non-game player, maybe recap what you remember from the first season and what you've heard about the second.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Going into the first season, I’d been aware of <em>The Last of Us</em>, the video game, as a story about an older guy and a kid trying to navigate a post-apocalyptic world. And the show was also mostly that: It’s Joel and Ellie against the world, and who knows, maybe this spunky young girl with an apparent immunity to the society-ravaging fungal infection could hold the key to a cure!
<p>Things fell apart at the end of last season when the Fireflies (a group of survivalists/doctors/scientists/etc.) may or may not have been threatening to kill Ellie in order to research their cure, which made Joel go on a murder rampage, which he then lied to Ellie about. We fade to black as they make their way back toward the one semi-functioning human settlement they’d visited on their travels, where Joel’s brother and his family also happen to live.</p>
<p>Going into this season: I know nothing. I don’t really engage in TV show fandoms or keep up with casting announcements or plot speculation. And the only thing I know about the second game going into this is a vague sense that it wasn’t as well-received as the first. In short, I am as a newborn baby, ready to take in the second season of a show I kind of like with the freshest possible eyes.</p></div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: I may be to blame for that vague sense you have. I fell in love with the first game, especially the relationship between Joel and Ellie, and I thought the first season of the show captured that quite well. I thought the endings to both the game and season 1 of the show were just about perfect and that any continuation after that was gonna struggle to justify itself.
<p>Without giving too much away, I think the second game misses a lot of what made the narrative of the first one special and gets sidetracked in a lot of frankly gratuitous directions. That said, this premiere episode of the second season drew me in more than I expected.</p>
<p>One jarring thing (in a good way) about both the second game and the second season is suddenly seeing Joel and Ellie just existing in a thriving community with electric lights, music, alcohol, decent food, laughter, etc., etc. After the near-constant precarity and danger they've faced in the recent past, it really throws you for a loop.</p></div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Unfortunately but predictably, you see both of them struggling to adapt in different ways; these are two extremely individualistic, out-for-number-one people. Ellie (now a 19-year-old, after a five-year time jump) never met a rule she couldn’t break, even when it endangers her friends and other community members.
<p>And while Joel will happily fix your circuit breaker or re-string your guitar, he emphatically rejected a needs-of-the-many-outweigh-the-needs-of-the-few approach at the end of last season. When stuff breaks bad (and I feel confident that it will, that’s the show that it is) these may not be the best people to have in your corner.</p>
<p>My only real Game Question for you at the outset is the big one: Is season 2 adapting <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> or is it doing its own thing or are we somewhere in between or is it too early to say?</p>

      "Oh, dang, is that Catherine O'Hara?"
    
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: From what I have heard it will be adapting the first section of the second game (it's a long game) and making some changes and digressions that expand on the game's story (like the well-received Nick Offerman episode last season). Already, I can tell you that Joel's therapy scene was created for the TV show, and I think it improves on a somewhat similar "Joel pours his heart out" scene from early in the game.
<p>The debut episode is also already showing a willingness to move around scenes from the game to make them fit better in chronological order, which I'm already appreciating.</p>
<p>One thing I think the show is already doing well, too, is showing 19-year-old Ellie "acting like every 19-year-old ever" (as one character puts it) to father figure Joel. Even in a zombie apocalypse, it's a relatable bit of character-building for anyone who's been a teenager or raised a teenager.</p></div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Joel’s therapist, played by the wonderful Catherine O’Hara. (See, that’s why you don’t follow casting announcements, so you can watch a show and be like, “Oh, dang, is that Catherine O’Hara?”)
<p>I didn’t know if it was a direct adaptation, but I did notice that the show’s video gamey storytelling reflexes were still fully intact. We almost instantly end up in a ruined grocery store chock-full of environmental storytelling (Ellie notes a happy birthday banner and 2003’s Employee of the Year wall).</p>
<p>And like in any <s>new game</s> new season of a TV show, we quickly run into a whole new variant of mushroom monster that retains some of its strategic instincts and can take cover rather than blindly rushing at you. Some of the jump scares were so much like quick-time events that I almost grabbed my controller so I could press X and help Ellie out.</p></div>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, it's pretty easy to see that the semi-stealthy assault on the abandoned market came directly from the game. I felt like there was some implication that the "strategic" zombie still had a little more humanity left in her that was struggling to fight against the fungus' pull, which was pretty chilling in the way it was presented.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yes! Fungus is still a maximally creepy and visually interesting way for an infection to spread, and it’s a visual note that helps <em>TLoU</em> stand out from other zombie stories.
<p>It <em>does</em> seem like we’re moving into Phase 2 of most zombie apocalypse fiction. Phase 1 is: There’s an infection! Society collapses. Phase 2 is: Humanity attempts to rebuild. But maybe the scariest monster of all… is humankind??</p>
<p>I’ve always found Phase 2 to be inherently less interesting because I can watch all kinds of shows where people are the antagonists, but Joel and Ellie remain unique and compelling enough as characters that maybe they’ll carry me through.</p></div>

<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: The first game already established a lot in the way of "humans are the real monsters" vignettes. And while I still don't want to give too much away, I will say that human-versus-human drama is definitely going to be an increasingly central part of the narrative going forward.
<p>Speaking of which, I wondered what you made of the brief scenes we get with Abby leading a reluctant but willing band of revenge-seekers that see doctor-murdering Joel as an unalloyed evil (somewhat justifiably, especially from their point of view).</p></div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: My first thought was “look at all these clean, hot, well-coiffed apocalypse survivors.” At least Joel and Ellie both look a little weathered.
<p>But in seriousness, yes, it’s obvious that What Joel Did is a bomb that’s going to go off sooner rather than later. Trying to address it without addressing it has pushed taciturn, closed-off Joel into therapy, where he insists to a woman whose (presumably infected) husband he killed that he’s a “good guy.” And it seems clear to me that Ellie’s shunning of Joel is coming from her sense that something is amiss, just as much as it is about a 19-year-old rebelling against her would-be father figure.</p>
<p>In Joel’s case, it’s telling that it seems like lying to Ellie is weighing on him more than the murder-rampage itself. But having these improbably fresh-faced Firefly remnants chasing him down will mean that he might end up paying for both.</p></div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: I think Joel can live with sacrificing the entire world to save Ellie. I don't think he can live with Ellie knowing he did that pretty much against her explicit wishes.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Oops!! Pobody’s nerfect!</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: I'm sure Abby will understand if Joel just says he made an oopsie.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Seriously. Can’t believe they’re <em>still</em> mad even after a five-year time jump. Can’t we all just move on?
<p>As we close, and while at least trying to avoid spoilers, are there any game moments you’re looking forward to seeing? Or are you just hoping that this season can “fix” a story that didn’t work as well for you in video game form?</p>

<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Actually, I don't have to spoil anything to say that the scene at the dance was one I was looking forward to seeing in both the game and the show. That's because a large chunk of it was the first bit of the game Sony ever showed during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMW_sycSs30">a memorable E3 2018 press conference</a>, which would end up being the company's last ever official E3 press presentation.
<p>Besides making me an instant fan of the song ".44 Pistol," that scene had me very excited to see how the social adventures of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Growed_Up">All Growed Up</a>" Ellie might develop. And while I don't feel like the game really delivered a very satisfying or believable version of Ellie's evolution, I'm hopeful the show might be able to smooth out some of the rough storytelling edges and give a more compelling version of the character.</p></div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah. Video games get remastered, but they <em>mostly</em> seek to preserve the original game rather than overhauling it. A well-funded multiseason TV adaptation is a rare opportunity for a redo.</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: The way HBO handled the first season gives me hope that they can once again embrace the excellent world-building of the games while adding some prestige TV polish to the plot.</div>

              <![CDATA[<p>In a very real sense, the Internet, this marvelous worldwide digital communications network that you’re using right now, was created because one man was annoyed at having too many computer terminals in his office.</p>
<p>The year was 1966. Robert Taylor was the director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Information Processing Techniques Office. The agency was created in 1958 by President Eisenhower in response to the launch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik</a>. So Taylor was in the Pentagon, a great place for acronyms like ARPA and IPTO. He had three massive terminals crammed into a room next to his office. Each one was connected to a different mainframe computer. They all worked slightly differently, and it was frustrating to remember multiple procedures to log in and retrieve information.</p>

<p>In those days, computers took up entire rooms, and users accessed them through teletype terminals—electric typewriters hooked up to either a serial cable or a modem and a phone line. ARPA was funding multiple research projects across the United States, but users of these different systems had no way to share their resources with each other. Wouldn’t it be great if there was a network that connected all these computers?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-history-of-the-internet-part-1-an-arpa-dream-takes-form/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration has excluded smartphones and other consumer electronics from its steep “reciprocal” tariffs in a significant boost for Big Tech as the White House battles to calm global markets after launching a multifront trade war.</p>
<p>According to a notice posted late on Friday night by Customs and Border Patrol, smartphones, along with routers, chipmaking equipment, wireless earphones, and certain computers and laptops would be exempt from reciprocal tariffs, which include the 125 percent levies Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese imports.</p>
<p>The carve-out is a big win for companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft and follows a week of intense turbulence in US markets after Trump unleashed a trade war on “liberation day” on April 2. The announcement rattled global investors and triggered a stock market rout.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/after-market-tumult-trump-exempts-smartphones-from-massive-new-tariffs/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>There are few areas where AI has seen more robust deployment than the field of software development. From "vibe" coding to GitHub Copilot to startups building quick-and-dirty applications with support from LLMs, AI is already deeply integrated.</p>
<p>However, those claiming we're mere months away from AI agents <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/work-productivity/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-says-ai-will-write-90-percent-of-code-in-6-months">replacing most programmers</a> should adjust their expectations because models aren't good enough at the debugging part, and debugging occupies most of a developer's time. That's the suggestion of Microsoft Research, which built a new tool called debug-gym to test and improve how AI models can debug software.</p>
<p>Debug-gym (available on <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-gym/">GitHub</a> and detailed in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/debug-gym-an-environment-for-ai-coding-tools-to-learn-how-to-debug-code-like-programmers/">a blog post</a>) is an environment that allows AI models to try and debug any existing code repository with access to debugging tools that aren't historically part of the process for these models. Microsoft found that without this approach, models are quite notably bad at debugging tasks. With the approach, they're better but still a far cry from what an experienced human developer can do.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-find-ai-is-pretty-bad-at-debugging-but-theyre-working-on-it/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Debate around how much taxes US-based streaming services should pay internationally, among other factors, could result in people paying more for subscriptions to services like Netflix and Disney+.</p>
<p>On April 10, the United Kingdom's Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Committee reignited calls for a streaming tax on subscription revenue acquired through UK residents. The recommendation came alongside the committee's 120-page report [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/British-film-and-high-end-television.pdf">PDF</a>] that makes numerous recommendations for how to support and grow Britain’s film and high-end television (HETV) industry.</p>
<p>For the US, the recommendation garnering the most attention is one calling for a 5 percent levy on UK subscriber revenue from streaming-video-on-demand services, such as Netflix. That’s because if streaming services face higher taxes in the UK, costs could be passed on to consumers, resulting in more <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/streaming-prices-climb-in-2025-after-already-surpassing-inflation-rates/">streaming price hikes</a>. The CMS committee wants money from the levy to support HETV production in the UK and wrote in its report:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/streaming-price-hikes-more-likely-amid-uncertainty-around-global-taxes-economy/">Read full article</a></p>
