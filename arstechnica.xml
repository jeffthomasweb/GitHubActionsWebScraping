<p>“Gadgets aren’t fun anymore,” sighed my wife, watching me tap away on my Palm Zire 72 as she sat on the couch with her MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And it’s true: The smartphone has all but eliminated entire classes of gadgets, from point-and-shoot cameras to MP3 players, GPS maps, and even flashlights. But arguably no style of gadget has been so thoroughly superseded as the personal digital assistant, the handheld computer that dominated the late '90s and early 2000s. The PDA even set the template for <i>how</i> its smartphone successors would render it obsolete, moving from simple personal information management to encompass games, messaging, music, and photos.</p>
<p>But just as smartphones would do, PDAs offered a dizzying array of operating systems and applications, and a great many of them ran Palm OS. (I bought my first Palm, an m505, new in 2001, upgrading from an HP 95LX.) Naturally, there’s no way we could enumerate every single such device in this article. So in this Ars retrospective, we’ll look back at some notable examples of the technical evolution of the Palm operating system and the devices that ran it—and how they paved the way for what we use now.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013776#p3">Read 92 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013776&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reddit has made it clear that it’s an ad-first business. Today, it expanded on that practice with a new ad format that looks to sell things to Reddit users. Simultaneously, Reddit has marketers who are interested in pushing products to users through seemingly legitimate accounts.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/expanding-our-shopping-ecosystem-introducing-dynamic-product-ads">blog post</a> today, Reddit announced that its Dynamic Product Ads are entering public beta globally. The ad format uses "shopping signals," aka discussions with people looking to try a product or brand, machine learning, and advertiser product catalogs in order to post relevant ads. Reddit shared an image in the blog post that shows ads, including with products and pricing, that seem to relate to a posted question. User responses to the Reddit post appear under the ad.</p>

            The Polestar Phone. Someday it will unlock your Polestar car.                          [credit:

<p>Polestar, the Volvo offshoot EV company, has made a smartphone. It's called, predictably, the <a href="https://www.polestar.cn/zh-cn/polestar-phone">Polestar Phone</a>, and it's only available in China. There have been a lot of <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/flashback_not_so_weird_car_branded_phones_from_mclaren_aston_martin_ferrari_and_land_rover-news-46707.php#:~:text=Those%20have%20been%20around%20for,rather%20than%20a%20car%20maker).">car-brand smartphones</a> out there (it's often <a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-x/find-x-lamborghini/">Lamborghini</a>), but usually, these are licensing deals that the car company ignores. Polestar seems to be proud of this phone, though, making it a bit more involved than the usual car-brand licensing deal. Just look at the new navigation drawer on the polestar.cn site, which has four main items: "Polestar 2", "Polestar 3", "Polestar 4" and now "Polestar Phone."</p>
<p>Why would a niche EV brand make a phone? Maybe all that work on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/android-automotive-os-review-under-the-hood-with-googles-car-os/">Android Automotive OS</a> made Polestar's engineers really enthusiastic about Android device development. The website, through machine translation, promises the phone was "jointly designed by the Polestar global design team and the Xingji Meizu team in Gothenburg, Sweden, and is decorated with Swedish gold details that symbolize high performance." "Decorated" is probably the best way you could describe Polestar's contributions to this phone since it seems to be a bog standard <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/meizu_21_pro-12805.php">Meizu 21 Pro</a> with some Polestar branding. It does <em>look</em> beautiful, with a no-nonsense minimal rectangular design and all-screen front, but the same can be said for the Meizu phone this is based on.</p>
<p>So, how exactly is the Polestar Phone related to a Polestar car? Well, both run Android and have all-electric power systems. The phone has a <em>slightly</em> smaller battery than the EV, at only 5,050 mAh (that's something like 18 Wh) compared to the 100 kWh battery of something like a Polestar 4. The car also has the phone beat on-screen size, with the phone packing a pocketable 120 Hz 6.79-inch, 3192×1368 OLED, and the Polestars all sporting big tablet screens.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019697#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019697&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gamma rays are a broad category of high-energy photons, including everything with more energy than an X-ray. While they are often created by processes like radioactive decay, few astronomical events produce them in sufficient quantities that they can be detected when the radiation originates in another galaxy.</p>
<p>That said, the list is larger than one, which means detecting gamma rays doesn't mean we know what event produced them. At lower energies, they can be produced in the areas around black holes and by neutron stars. Supernovae can also produce a sudden burst of gamma rays, as can the merger of compact objects like neutron stars.</p>
<p>And then there are magnetars. These are neutron stars that, at least temporarily, have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/behold-the-magnetar-natures-ultimate-superweapon/">extreme magnetic fields</a>—over 10<sup>12</sup> times stronger than the Sun's magnetic field. Magnetars can experience flares and even giant flares where they send out copious amounts of energy, including gamma rays. These can be difficult to distinguish from gamma-ray bursts generated by the merger of compact objects, so the only confirmed magnetar giant bursts have happened in our own galaxy or its satellites. Until now, apparently.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019842#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019842&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hackers backed by a powerful nation-state have been exploiting two zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco firewalls in a five-month-long campaign that breaks into government networks around the world, researchers reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The attacks against Cisco’s Adaptive Security Appliances firewalls are the latest in a rash of network compromises that target firewalls, VPNs, and network-perimeter devices, which are designed to provide a moated gate of sorts that keeps remote hackers out. Over the past 18 months, threat actors—mainly backed by the Chinese government—have turned this security paradigm on its head in attacks that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in security appliances from the likes of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/mass-exploitation-of-ivanti-vpns-is-infecting-networks-around-the-globe/">Ivanti</a>,<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/critical-vulnerability-in-atlassian-confluence-server-is-under-mass-exploitation/"> Atlassian</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/critical-citrix-bleed-vulnerability-allowing-mfa-bypass-comes-under-mass-exploitation/">Citrix</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/mass-exploitation-of-critical-moveit-flaw-is-ransacking-orgs-big-and-small/">Progress</a>. These devices are ideal targets because they sit at the edge of a network, provide a direct pipeline to its most sensitive resources, and interact with virtually all incoming communications.</p>
<h2>Cisco ASA likely one of several targets</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, it was Cisco’s turn to warn that its ASA products have received such treatment. Since November, a previously unknown actor tracked as UAT4356 by Cisco and STORM-1849 by Microsoft has been exploiting two zero-days in attacks that go on to install two pieces of never-before-seen malware, researchers with Cisco’s Talos security team <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/arcanedoor-new-espionage-focused-campaign-found-targeting-perimeter-network-devices/">said</a>. Notable traits in the attacks include:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019790#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019790&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Friday, a federal judicial panel convened in Washington, DC, to discuss the challenges of policing AI-generated evidence in court trials, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-judicial-panel-wrestles-with-how-police-ai-generated-evidence-2024-04-19/">Reuters report</a>.

<p>The meeting took place amid <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/wary-courts-confront-ai-pitfalls-2024-promises-2023-12-27/">broader efforts</a> by federal and state courts nationwide to address the rise of generative AI models (such as those that power OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> or Stability AI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/stability-announces-stable-diffusion-3-a-next-gen-ai-image-generator/">Stable Diffusion</a>), which can be trained on large datasets with the aim of producing realistic text, images, audio, or videos.</p>

<p>The US Chamber of Commerce and other business groups sued the Federal Trade Commission and FTC Chair Lina Khan today in an attempt to block a newly issued ban on noncompete clauses.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txed.229626/gov.uscourts.txed.229626.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> was filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The US Chamber of Commerce was joined in the suit by Business Roundtable, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce. The suit seeks a court order that would vacate the rule in its entirety.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claimed that noncompete clauses "benefit employers and workers alike—the employer protects its workforce investments and sensitive information, and the worker benefits from increased training, access to more information, and an opportunity to bargain for higher pay."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019787#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019787&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"<a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6554-ED29-FBDB-1612">Early Access</a>" was once a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/03/valve-lets-you-pay-for-the-beta-with-steam-early-access-program/">novel, quirky thing</a>, giving a select set of Steam PC games a way to involve enthusiastic fans in pre-alpha-level play-testing and feedback. Now loads of games launch in various forms of Early Access, in a wide variety of readiness. It's been a boon for games like <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-early-impressions-youll-spend-whole-weeks-in-here-and-love-it/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, </em>which came a long way across <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/baldurs-gate-3-early-access-mediocre-rpg-amazing-rendering-engine/">years of Early Access</a>.</p>
<p>Early Access, and the "<a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/453F-5C96-EAC2-9145">Advanced Access</a>" provided for complete games by major publishers for "Deluxe Editions" and the like, has also been a boon to freeloaders. Craven types could play a game for hours and hours, then demand a refund within <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/valve-begins-offering-refunds-for-all-steam-games/">the standard two hours of play, 14 days after the purchase window</a> of the game's "official" release. Steam-maker Valve has noticed and, as of Tuesday night, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4195741362094579141">updated its refund policy</a>.</p>
<p>"Playtime acquired during the Advanced Access period will now count towards the Steam refund period," reads the update. In other words: Playtime is playtime now, so if you've played more than two hours of a game in any state, you don't get a refund. That closes at least one way that people could, with time-crunched effort, play and enjoy games for free in either Early or Advanced access.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019648#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019648&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Will Chrome, the world's most popular browser, ever kill third-party cookies? Apple and Mozilla both killed off the user-tracking technology <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking">in 2020</a>. Google, the world's largest advertising company, originally said it wouldn't kill third-party cookies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/google-plans-to-drop-chrome-support-for-tracking-cookies-by-2022/">until 2022</a>. Then in 2021, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/google-delays-floc-rollout-until-2023/">it delayed</a> the change until 2023. In 2022, it delayed everything again, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/google-delays-death-of-tracking-cookies-again-wants-more-time-for-testing/">until 2024</a>. It's 2024 now, and guess what? Another delay. Now Google says it won't turn off third-party cookies until 2025, five years after the competition.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/update-on-the-plan-for-phase-out-of-third-party-cookies-on-chrome/">new blog post</a> cites UK regulations as the reason for the delay, saying, "We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem." The post comes as part of the quarterly reports the company is producing with the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the UK’s CMA isn't concerned about user privacy but instead is worried about other web advertisers that compete with Google. The UK wants to make sure that Google isn't making changes to Chrome to prop up its advertising business at the expense of competitors. While other browser vendors shut down third-party cookies without a second thought, Google said it wouldn't turn off the user-tracking feature until it built an alternative advertising feature directly into Chrome, so it can track user interests to serve them relevant ads. The new advertising system, called the Topics API and "Privacy Sandbox," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/">launched in Chrome</a> in 2023. Google AdSense is <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/12567752?hl=en">already compatible</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019664#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019664&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>California's electric grid, with its massive solar production and booming battery installations, is already on the cutting edge of the US's energy transition. And it's likely to stay there, as the state will require that all passenger vehicles be electric by 2035. Obviously, that will require a grid that's able to send a lot more electrons down its wiring and a likely shift in the time of day that demand peaks.</p>
<p>Is the grid ready? And if not, how much will it cost to get it there? Two researchers at the University of California, Davis—Yanning Li and Alan Jenn—have determined that nearly two-thirds of its feeder lines don't have the capacity that will likely be needed for car charging. Updating to handle the rising demand might set its utilities back as much as 40 percent of the existing grid's capital cost.</p>
<h2>The lithium state</h2>
<p>Li and Jenn aren't the first to look at how well existing grids can handle growing electric vehicle sales; other research has found various ways that different grids fall short. However, they have access to uniquely detailed data relevant to California's ability to distribute electricity (they do not concern themselves with generation). They have information on every substation, feeder line, and transformer that delivers electrons to customers of the state's three largest utilities, which collectively cover nearly 90 percent of the state's population. In total, they know the capacity that can be delivered through over 1,600 substations and 5,000 feeders.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019669#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019669&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggFOq7Q1e04?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Ryan Gosling hosts a round of carpool karaoke with his stuntmen for the forthcoming action comedy <em>The Fall Guy</em>. </p></div>
<p>Universal Studios has been <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/the-fall-guy-cast-mocks-ryan-gosling-in-new-promos/">going meta</a> with its marketing for its forthcoming action comedy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/11/ryan-gosling-is-a-wise-cracking-stuntman-with-a-mission-in-the-fall-guy-trailer/"><em>The Fall Guy</em></a>. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are the marquee stars; Gosling plays a Hollywood stuntman trying to make a movie with his estranged ex-girlfriend (Blunt). But it's the actual stuntmen standing in for Gosling during action sequences who get the spotlight in a new promotional video for the film.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/11/ryan-gosling-is-a-wise-cracking-stuntman-with-a-mission-in-the-fall-guy-trailer/">previously reported</a>, <em>The Fall Guy</em> is directed by David Leitch, who also brought us the glorious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick_(film)"><em>John Wick</em></a> (his uncredited directorial debut with <a title="Chad Stahelski" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Stahelski">Chad Stahelski</a>). It's a loose adaptation of the popular 1980s TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_Guy">of the same name</a> starring Lee Majors. Per the official synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie—being directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt—goes missing. While the film’s ruthless producer (Hannah Waddingham), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film’s most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody’s good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this incarnation, Gosling's Colt Seavers isn't a bounty hunter on the side; he's just a stuntman—a bit past his prime—who stumbles into solving a mystery. Blunt costars as Jody Moreno, Colt's ex-girlfriend and a former camera operator who finally gets the chance to direct her first film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays movie star Tom Ryder, who goes missing mid-shoot. Stephanie Hsu plays Ryder's personal assistant, and Winston Duke plays Colt's stunt coordinator and BFF. <em>Ted Lasso</em>'s Hannah Waddingham appears as Gail, the producer of Jody's film. And OG Fall Guy Lee Majors (now in his 80s) is expected to have a cameo; perhaps he'll perform the theme song, "Unknown Stuntman," that he wrote and recorded for the original series.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018198#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018198&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Senate last night approved a bill that orders TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the company within 270 days or lose access to the US market. The House had already passed the bill, and President Biden signed it into law today.</p>
<p>The "Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act" was approved as part of a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/815/text">larger appropriations bill</a> that provides aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. It passed in a <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00154.htm">79-18 vote</a>. Biden last night issued a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/23/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-senate-passage-of-the-national-security-package/">statement</a> saying he will sign the appropriations bill into law "as soon as it reaches my desk." He signed the bill into law today, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/04/24/bill-signed-h-r-815/">announced</a>.</p>
<p>The bill classifies TikTok as a "foreign adversary controlled application" and gives the Chinese company ByteDance 270 days to sell it to another entity. Biden can extend the deadline by up to 90 days if a sale is in progress.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019651#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019651&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Elite: Dangerous</em> players will soon be able to pay real money for access to in-game ships for the first time, a major change that already has some long-time players raging about a "pay-to-win" shift for the long-running game.</p>
<p>Since <em>Elite Dangerous</em> launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/review-elite-dangerous-is-the-best-damn-spaceship-game-ive-ever-played/">over nine years ago</a>, the game has sold ships in exchange for in-game credits earned through gameplay. The separate ARX currency, which <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/store/arx">can be purchased with real money</a>, has been reserved for cosmetic upgrades such as paint jobs.</p>
<p>That's all set to change next month, though, when owners of the Odyssey expansion will be able to <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/news/python-mk-ii-updates-gamestore">purchase early access to the Python Mk II variant ship for 16,250 ARX</a> (the equivalent of about $11 to $13, depending on how much ARX is purchased in bulk). Non-Odyssey owners won't be able to purchase the Python Mk II with regular credits until three months later, on August 7. At that point, the ship will also be available as an ARX-denominated "pre-built ship package" that "allow[s] you to kickstart your career in the latest ship, including a brand-new paintjob and ship kit."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019650#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019650&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX launches have become extremely routine. On Tuesday evening, SpaceX launched its 42nd rocket of the year, carrying yet another passel of Starlink satellites into orbit. Chances are, you didn't even notice.</p>
<p>All the same, the cumulative numbers are mind-boggling. SpaceX is now launching at a rate of one mission every 2.7 days this year. Consider that, from the mid-1980s through the 2010s, the record for the total number of launches worldwide in any given year was 129. This year alone, SpaceX is on pace for between 130 and 140 total launches.</p>
<p>But with Tuesday evening's mission, there was a singular number that stood out: 300. The Falcon family, which includes the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, recorded its 300th successful first-stage landing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019591#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019591&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Mercedes-Benz provided flights from San Francisco to Los Angeles and accommodation so Ars could attend the G-Wagon event. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>The Mercedes G-Wagon, a very capable off-roader typically purchased by people who never intend to take it anywhere near dirt, is getting an electric upgrade.</p>
<p>Unveiled in Beverly Hills—the most fitting of locations—the 2025 G 580 with EQ Technology spun its way onto the scene. The all-electric G-Wagon sports a 116 kWh capacity battery pack, four motors (one for each wheel), and a new sound system to replace the gas motor, called the G-Roar. Sadly, there's no word on price, delivery date, or range. But on paper, its impressive specs make it better than the ICE version off-road.</p>
<p>For serious off-roaders likely not residing in Beverly Hills, the luxury off-roader's four independent motors offer true torque vectoring and electronic differential locks. Each motor is coupled with a two-speed transmission for a reduced gear low range. The ideal use for this is rock crawling. In fact, there's an actual "Rock" crawling mode in the G 580. Mercedes is not playing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019623#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019623&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cyber attackers are experimenting with their latest ransomware on businesses in Africa, Asia, and South America before targeting richer countries that have more sophisticated security methods.</p>
<p>Hackers have adopted a “strategy” of infiltrating systems in the developing world before moving to higher-value targets such as in North America and Europe, according to a report published on Wednesday by cyber security firm Performanta.</p>
<p>“Adversaries are using developing countries as a platform where they can test their malicious programs before the more resourceful countries are targeted,” the company told Banking Risk and Regulation, a service from FT Specialist.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019608#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019608&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Tesla had a terrible first quarter of 2024, according to its financial results <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q1-2024-Update.pdf">posted yesterday</a>. We already knew that it was a bad three months in terms of delivering cars—the automaker built tens of thousands of cars it couldn't sell <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-deliveries-drop-8-5-percent-year-over-year-in-first-decline-since-2020/">as deliveries dropped by 8.5 percent</a> year over year. If anything, the quarterly results paint an even worse picture.</p>
<p>The company has been engaged in a series of heavy price cuts, and that's showing up on the balance sheet. For all of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's statements about artificial intelligence being the future of the company, the vast majority of its income is still derived from automotive sales. These amounted to $16.5 billion in Q1, nearly $2.5 billion less than for Q1 2023. (Regulatory credits remain pretty steady at $442 million for the quarter.)</p>
<p>Total revenues were down by 9 percent year over year, with gross profits down 18 percent. But the net profit, once generally accepted accounting measures were applied, fell by 55 percent to $1.1 billion. (Non-GAAP net profit was down 48 percent.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019595#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019595&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Signs point to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite processors showing up in actual, real-world, human-purchasable computers in the next couple of months after years of speculation and another year or so of hype.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t been following along, this will allegedly be Qualcomm’s first Arm processor for Windows PCs that does for PCs what Apple’s M-series chips did for Macs, promising both better battery life and better performance than equivalent Intel chips. This would be a departure from past Snapdragon chips for PCs, which have performed worse than (or, at best, similarly to) existing Intel options, barely improved battery life, and come with a bunch of software incompatibility problems to boot.</p>
<p>Early benchmarks that have trickled out look promising for the Snapdragon X. And there are other reasons to be optimistic—the Snapdragon X Elite’s design team is headed up by some of the same people who made Apple Silicon so successful in the first place.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015658#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015658&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced that genetic fragments from the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 have been detected in the pasteurized, commercial milk supply. However, the testing completed so far—using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)—only detects the presence of viral genetic material and cannot tell whether the genetic material is from live and infectious viral particles or merely remnants of dead ones killed by the pasteurization process.</p>
<p>Testing is now ongoing to see if viable, infectious H5N1 can be identified in milk samples.</p>
<p>So far, the FDA still believes that the milk supply is safe. "To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe," the agency said in <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/updates-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai">a lengthy explanation of the finding and ongoing testing</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019552#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019552&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The modern "smart" TV asks a lot of us. In exchange for connecting you to a few streaming services you use, a TV will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/walmart-buying-tv-brand-vizio-for-its-ad-fueling-customer-data/">collect data</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/after-luring-customers-with-low-prices-amazon-stuffs-fire-tvs-with-ads/">show ads</a>, and serve as another <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/roku-forcing-2-factor-authentication-after-breach-of-600k-accounts/">vector</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/patches-released-for-as-many-as-91000-hackable-lg-tvs-exposed-to-the-internet/">bad actors</a>. In a few reported cases, though, a modern connected TV has been blamed for attacks not on privacy, eyeballs, or passwords but on an entirely different computer.</p>
<p>The TV in question is a Hisense TV, and the computer is a Windows PC, specifically one belonging to Priscilla Snow, a <a href="https://ghoulnoise.bandcamp.com/">musician</a> and audio designer in Montreal, Quebec. Her <a href="https://cohost.org/ghoulnoise/post/5286766-do-not-buy-hisense-t">post about her Hisense experience</a> reads like a mystery novel. Of course, because you already know the crime and the culprit, it's more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo">a <em>Columbo</em> episode</a>. Either way, it's thrilling in a very specific I-can't-believe-that-fixed-it kind of way.</p>
<h2>Disappearing Settings, keyboards, remote desktops, and eventually taskbars</h2>
<p>Snow's Windows PC had "a few hiccups over the past couple of years," Snow wrote on April 19. She couldn't open display settings, for one. A MIDI keyboard interface stopped working. Task manager would start to hang until force-closed. Video-capture cards had trouble connecting. As Snow notes, any veteran of a Windows computer that has had lots of stuff installed on it can mentally write off most of these things, or at least stash them away until the next reinstall.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019333#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019333&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
