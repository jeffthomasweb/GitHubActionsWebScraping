                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon announced in September that it will require workers to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/amazon-kills-remote-working-tells-workers-to-be-in-office-5-days-a-week/">in the office five days a week</a> starting in January. Employee backlash ensued, not just because return-to-office (RTO) mandates can be unpopular but also because Amazon is using some of the worst strategies for issuing RTO mandates.</p>
<p>Ahead of the mandate, Amazon had been letting many employees work remotely for two days a week, with a smaller number of workers being totally remote. But despite saying that employees would have to commute five days per week, the conglomerate doesn’t have enough office space to accommodate over 350,000 employees. Personnel in “at least seven cities,” including Phoenix and Austin, Texas, have had their RTO dates delayed until after January, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-18/amazon-delays-return-to-office-mandate-for-thousands-of-workers">Bloomberg</a> reported today, citing “people familiar with the situation." Employees in Dallas won’t have enough space until March or April, and an office in New York City won’t have sufficient space until May, per Bloomberg's sources.</p>
<p>RTO dates are also delayed in Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville, Tennessee, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-delays-full-rto-some-staff-workspace-shortages-2024-12">Business Insider</a> reported this week, citing “internal Amazon notifications.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/amazons-rto-delays-highlight-why-workers-get-so-mad-about-mandates/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An AT&amp;T customer who switched to the company's <a href="https://www.firstnet.com/">FirstNet</a> service for first responders got quite the shock when his bill came in at $6,223.60, instead of the roughly $260 that his four-line plan previously cost each month.</p>
<p>The Texas man described his experience in a now-deleted Reddit post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comments/1hf14qw/622360_wireless_bill/">three days ago</a>, saying he hadn't been able to get the obviously incorrect bill reversed despite calling AT&amp;T and going to an AT&amp;T store in Dallas. The case drew plenty of attention and the bill was finally wiped out several days after the customer contacted the AT&amp;T president's office.</p>
<p>The customer said he received the billing email on December 11. An automatic payment was scheduled for December 15, but he canceled the autopay before the money was charged. The whole mess took a week to straighten out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/2-per-megabyte-att-mistakenly-charged-customer-6223-for-3-1gb-of-data/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The health department had reported the presumptive positive case on Friday and noted the person was hospitalized, as Ars reported. But a spokesperson had, at the time, declined to provide Ars with the patient's condition or further details, citing patient confidentiality and an ongoing public health investigation.</p>
<p>This morning, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it had confirmed the state's H5N1 testing and determined that the case "marks the first instance of severe illness linked to the virus in the United States."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/bird-flu-case-in-louisiana-is-in-critical-condition-health-officials-reveal/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In theory, it ought to be as good a time as ever to be a gamer on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Classic console emulators have rolled out to the platform for the first time, and they work great. There are strong libraries of non-skeezy mobile games on Apple Arcade and Netflix Games, streaming via Xbox and PlayStation services is continuing apace, and there are even a few AAA console games now running natively on the platform, like Assassin's Creed and Resident Evil titles.</p>
<p>Some of those games need a traditional, dual-stick game controller to work well, though, and Apple bafflingly offers no first-party solution for this.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/iphone-gaming-controller/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Arm and Qualcomm's dispute over Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips is continuing in court this week, with executives from each company taking the stand and attempting to downplay the accusations from the other side.</p>
<p>If you haven't been following along, the crux of the issue is Qualcomm's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/qualcomm-closes-nuvia-deal-promises-in-house-laptop-cpus-by-2h-2022/">purchase</a> of a chip design firm called Nuvia in 2021. Nuvia was originally founded by ex-Apple chip designers to create high-performance Arm chips for servers, but Qualcomm took an interest in Nuvia's work and acquired the company to help it create high-end Snapdragon processors for consumer PCs instead. Arm claims that this was a violation of its licensing agreements with Nuvia and is seeking to have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/arm-sues-qualcomm-over-its-1-4-billion-nuvia-acquisition/">all chips based on Nuvia technology destroyed</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/arm-qualcomm-trial-set-begin-over-chip-contract-dispute-2024-12-16/">According to Reuters</a>, Arm CEO Rene Haas testified this week that the Nuvia acquisition is depriving Arm of about $50 million a year, on top of the roughly $300 million a year in fees that Qualcomm already pays Arm to use its instruction set and some elements of its chip designs. This is because Qualcomm pays Arm lower royalty rates than Nuvia had agreed to pay when it was still an independent company.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/arm-and-qualcomm-fight-in-court-over-the-future-of-snapdragon-x-elite-chips/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121824zr1_p86b.pdf">confirmed</a> it would review whether a federal law that could ban or force a sale of TikTok is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The announcement came just one day after TikTok and its owner ByteDance <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/facing-ban-next-month-tiktok-begs-scotus-for-help/">petitioned SCOTUS for a temporary injunction</a> to halt the ban until the high court could consider what TikTok claimed is "a massive and unprecedented speech restriction" ahead of a change in US presidential administrations.</p>
<p>“We’re pleased with today’s Supreme Court order," TikTok said in a statement. "We believe the Court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/supreme-court-to-decide-if-tiktok-should-be-banned-or-sold/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI launched a 1-800-CHATGPT (1-800-242-8478) telephone number that anyone in the US can call to talk to ChatGPT via voice chat for up to 15 minutes for free. The company also says that people outside the US can send text messages to the same number for free using WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Upon calling, users hear a voice say, "Hello again, it's ChatGPT, an AI assistant. Our conversation may be reviewed for safety. How can I help you?" Callers can ask ChatGPT anything they would normally ask the AI assistant and have a live, interactive conversation.</p>
<p>During a livestream demo of "Calling with ChatGPT" during Day 10 of "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 Days of OpenAI</a>," OpenAI employees demonstrated several examples of the telephone-based voice chat in action, asking ChatGPT to identify a distinctive house in California and for help in translating a message into Spanish for a friend. For fun, they showed calls from an iPhone, a flip phone, and a vintage rotary phone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-launches-free-phone-hotline-to-let-anyone-call-chatgpt/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US government authorities are reportedly investigating whether to ban TP-Link wireless routers, which have been targeted in some high-profile attacks linked to the Chinese government. TP-Link, which was founded in China in 1996 and said it <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/press/news/21390/">relocated</a> its headquarters to the US in October this year, has racked up significant market share in US homes and businesses.</p>
<p>US authorities are investigating whether TP-Link "poses a national-security risk and are considering banning the devices," The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/us-ban-china-router-tp-link-systems-7d7507e6">reported</a> today. The WSJ notes that TP-Link is "the top choice on Amazon.com, and powers Internet communications for the Defense Department and other federal government agencies."</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Z-Wave can be a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/i-was-wrong-to-ignore-zigbee-and-z-wave-theyre-the-best-part-of-my-smart-home/">very robust automation network</a>, free from the complications and fragility of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Just how robust, you ask? More than a mile long, under the right circumstances, as hardware soon to hit the market promises.</p>
<p>All claims of radio distances should be taken with amounts of salt unhealthy for consumption. What can be accomplished across an empty field is not the same as what can be done through buildings, interference, and scatter. But Z-Wave Long Range (or Z-Wave LR), operating "in long range mode at full power," can hit 1.5 miles, <a href="https://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave-long-range/">according to the Z-Wave Alliance</a>, presuming you've got the right star-shaped hub network.</p>
<p>By using a star network topology instead of a more traditional mesh, Z-Wave LR reduces the need for hubs and repeaters, relying instead on a central hub. It can be more reliable for larger commercial spaces, security setups, and bigger homes, and also more power efficient. Devices automatically adjust their signal strength while on Z-Wave networks, extending the battery life of a single coin cell up to 10 years—again, under best-case circumstances. If you're really a glutton for punishment, you can fit up to 4,000 devices on a network running Z-Wave LR, because LR can co-exist on the same network as standard Z-Wave meshes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/z-wave-long-range-and-its-mile-long-capabilities-will-arrive-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Sony <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">revealed the PlayStation 5 Pro a few months ago</a>, some wondered just how many people would be willing to spend $700 for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-ps5-pros-biggest-problem-is-that-the-ps5-is-already-very-good/">a marginal upgrade</a> to the already quite powerful graphical performance of the PS5. Now, initial sales reports suggest there's still a substantial portion of the console market that's willing to shell out serious money for top-of-the-line console graphics.</p>
<p>Circana analyst Matt Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dap62o">shared on Bluesky this morning</a> that the PS5 Pro accounted for a full 19 percent of US PS5 sales in its launch month of November. That sales ratio puts initial upgrade interest in the PS5 Pro roughly in line with <em>lifetime</em> interest in the PS4 Pro, which <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1834785622541975897">recent reports suggest</a> was responsible for about 20 percent of all PS4 sales <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1834878244509647327">following its launch</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>That US sales ratio also lines up with international sales reports for the PS5 Pro launch. In the UK, GfK ChartTrack <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/black-friday-video-game-sales-dip-in-the-uk-uk-monthly-charts">reports</a> that the PS5 Pro was responsible for 26 percent of all console sales for November. And in Japan, Famitsu sales data suggests the PS5 Pro was responsible for a full 63 percent of the PS5's November sales after <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/famitsu-sales-11-4-24-11-10-24">selling an impressive 78,000 units in its launch week alone</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Today, the US Environmental Protection Agency granted a pair of waivers to California, allowing the Golden State to continue regulating vehicle-caused air pollution within its borders. The first is for the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, which apply to light- and medium-duty vehicles like passenger cars, SUVs, and smaller trucks. The second waiver is for regulations that control the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) that can be emitted by heavy-duty vehicles as well as off-road vehicles.</p>
<p>The Clean Air Act allows states to apply for a waiver from the EPA to set their own emissions standards in cases where the federal regulations are insufficient to prevent deleterious pollution. The state applied for the latest waivers late in 2023, and after a public comment period and then a review by the agency, the EPA decided to approve them.</p>
<p>"California has longstanding authority to request waivers from EPA to protect its residents from dangerous air pollution coming from mobile sources like cars and trucks," said EPA Administrator Michael Regan. "Today's actions follow through on EPA's commitment to partner with states to reduce emissions and act on the threat of climate change."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/epa-lets-california-set-its-own-stricter-emissions-standards-until-2035/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>General Motors might have scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions in favor of more hybrids, but it's still accelerating its plans to build out EV charging infrastructure. Today, together with ChargePoint, GM revealed that it will deploy "hundreds" of new DC fast chargers under the GM Energy brand in 2025.</p>
<p>"The transition to electric mobility continues to be driven by leaders such as General Motors offering innovative EVs and committing to make chargers as ubiquitous as possible," said Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint. "Our collaboration with GM represents a significant investment in the infrastructure to enable fast and easy charging for all. Together, ChargePoint and GM will deliver a seamless fast charging experience via reliable charging hardware managed by our industry-leading software platform."</p>
<p>Many (but not all) of the new chargers will be capable of delivering up to 500 kW, a higher power level than any EV currently on the market is able to charge. Many of the chargers will also feature ChargePoint's "Omni Port," which has both CCS1 and NACS (J3400) plugs, allowing almost all EV drivers to make use of them.

<p>In the first week or so of the drive, nearly 180 readers have contributed almost $16,000 to either the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is barely hanging on to a small donation lead at the moment). That's a long way off from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/">2020's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Thursday, January 2, 2025.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/reminder-donate-to-win-swag-in-our-annual-charity-drive-sweepstakes-15/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For every illegal drug, there is a combination of emojis that dealers and consumers use to evade detection on social media and messaging platforms. Snowflakes, snowfall, and snowmen symbolize cocaine. Love hearts, lightning bolts, and pill capsules mean MDMA, or molly. Brown hearts and dragons represent heroin. Grapes and baby bottles are the calling cards for codeine-containing cough syrup, or lean. The humble maple leaf, meanwhile, is the universal symbol for all drugs.</p>
<p>The proliferation of open drug dealing on Instagram, Snapchat, and X—as well as on encrypted messaging platforms Telegram and WhatsApp—has transformed the fabric of illegal substance procurement, gradually making it more convenient, and arguably safer, for consumers, who can receive packages in the mail without meeting people on street corners or going through the rigmarole of the dark web. There is no reliable way to gauge drug trafficking on social media, but the European Union Drugs Agency acknowledged in its <a href="https://www.euda.europa.eu/publications/eu-drug-markets/drivers-and-facilitators/technology-and-innovation_en#box_edmrdrivers_motivations">latest report</a> on the drivers of European drug sales that purchases brokered through such platforms “appear to be gaining in prominence.”</p>
<p>Initial studies into drug sales <a href="https://www.euda.europa.eu/publications/technical-reports/internet-drug-markets_en">on social media</a> began to be published <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35362-8_7">in 2012</a>. Over the next decade, piecemeal studies began to reveal a notable portion of drug sales were being mediated by social platforms. In 2021, it was estimated some 20 percent of drug purchases in Ireland were <a href="https://www.unodc.org/res/WDR-2023/WDR23_B3_CH7_darkweb.pdf">being arranged</a> through social media. In the US in 2018 and Spain in 2019, a tenth of young people who used drugs appear to have connected with dealers through the internet, with the large majority doing so through social media, according to <a href="https://journals.copmadrid.org/ejpalc/art/ejpalc2021a5">one small study</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/who-needs-the-dark-web-drug-sales-flourish-on-social-media/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/interview/technology_and_media/09/12/2024/675671c39a794769f2b2d272">a wide-ranging interview</a> with a Russian television station, the chief executive of Russia's main space corporation said the country is now planning to participate in the International Space Station project all the way to NASA's desired goal of 2030.</p>
<p>"In coordination with our American colleagues, we plan to de-orbit the station sometime around the beginning of 2030," the country's chief space official, Yuri Borisov, said during the interview. "The final scenario will probably be specified after the transition to a new NASA administration."</p>
<p>While the documents for such an extension have not been signed, these comments appear to represent a change in tone from Russia. When he first became head of Roscosmos in 2022, Borisov said Russia would leave the station partnership "after" 2024, which was interpreted as shortly thereafter. Later, Russia committed to working with NASA to keep the orbital outpost flying only through 2028. The US space agency has expressed a consistent desire to keep flying the station until 2030, after which point it hopes that private space station operators can provide one or more replacement facilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/russian-space-chief-says-country-will-fly-on-space-station-until-2030/">Read full article</a></p>

      They seem so sweet and innocent but these squirrels are also opportunistic killers.

<p>We think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel">squirrels</a> as adorably harmless creatures, admiring their bushy tails and twitchy little noses and the way they cram their cheeks with nuts or seeds to bring back to their nests for later. But the rodents turn out to be a bit more bloodthirsty than we thought. According to a new paper published in the Journal of Ethology, California ground squirrels have been caught in the act—many times over—of chasing, killing, and eating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vole">voles</a>.</p>
<p>Co-author Jennifer Smith, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/carnivorous-feeding-squirrels-documented-california">described</a> the behavior as "shocking," given the sheer number of times they watched squirrels do this. “We had never seen this behavior before," <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/carnivorous-feeding-squirrels-documented-california">she said</a>. "Squirrels are one of the most familiar animals to people. We see them right outside our windows; we interact with them regularly. Yet here’s this never-before-encountered-in-science behavior that sheds light on the fact that there’s so much more to learn about the natural history of the world around us.”</p>
<p>Squirrels mainly consume acorns, seeds, nuts, and fruits, but they have been known to supplement that diet with insects and, occasionally, by stealing eggs or young hatchlings from nests. And back <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/gbn/vol53/iss2/5/">in 1993</a>, biologist J.R Callahan caused a stir by reporting that as many as 30 species of squirrel could be preying on smaller creatures: namely, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and the occasional small mammal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/watch-carnivorous-squirrels-chow-down-on-tasty-voles/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>But, according to <a href="https://news.umich.edu/missing-rebound-youth-drug-use-defies-expectations-continues-historic-decline/">data released Tuesday</a>, the number of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders who collectively abstained from the use of alcohol, marijuana, or nicotine hit a new high this year. Use of illicit drugs also fell on the whole and use of non-heroin narcotics (Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet) hit an all-time low.</p>
<p>"Many experts in the field had anticipated that drug use would resurge as the pandemic receded and social distancing restrictions were lifted," Richard Miech, team lead of the Monitoring the Future survey at the University of Michigan, said in a statement. "As it turns out, the declines have not only lasted but have dropped further."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/the-kids-are-maybe-alright-teen-drug-use-hits-new-lows-in-ongoing-decline/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Nvidia replaced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/latest-nvidia-drivers-to-be-locked-behind-geforce-experience-app/">the longstanding GeForce Experience App</a> with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">a new, unified Nvidia App</a> last month, most GPU owners probably noted the refresh and rebranding with nothing more than bemusement (though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/nvidias-new-app-doesnt-require-you-to-log-in-to-update-your-gpu-driver/">the new lack of an account login requirement</a> was a nice improvement). Now, testing shows that running the new app with default settings can lead to some significant frame rate dips on many high-end games, even when the app's advanced AI features aren't being actively used.</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/we-tested-nvidia-app-performance-problems-games-run-up-to-15-percent-slower-with-the-app">noted the performance dip</a> after reading reports of related problems around the web. The site's testing with and without the Nvidia App installed confirms that, across five games running on an RTX 4060, the app reduced average frame rates by around 3 to 6 percent, depending on the resolution and graphical quality level.</p>
<p>The site's measured frame rate drop peaked at 12 percent for <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> running at 1080p Ultra settings; other tested games (including <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>, and <em>Stalker 2</em>) showed a smaller drop at most settings.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-new-nvidia-app-is-probably-hurting-your-pc-gaming-performance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>How do you fit 32 terabytes of storage into a hard drive? With a HAMR.</p>
<p>Seagate has been experimenting with heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, since at least 2002. The firm has occasionally popped up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/hamr-time-seagate-demos-terabyte-per-inch-hard-disk-technology/">offer a demonstration</a> or make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/hamr-dont-hurt-em-laser-assisted-hard-drives-are-coming-in-2020/">yet another</a> "around the corner" pronouncement. The press has enjoyed myriad chances to celebrate the wordplay of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer">Stanley Kirk Burrell</a>, but new qualification from large-scale customers might mean HAMR drives will be actually available, to buy, as physical objects, for anyone who can afford the most magnetic space possible. Third decade's the charm, perhaps.</p>
<p>HAMR works on the principle that, when heated, a disk's magnetic materials can hold more data in smaller spaces, such that you can fit more overall data on the drive. It's not just putting a tiny hot plate inside an HDD chassis; as <a href="https://www.seagate.com/www-content/ti-dm/tech-insights/en-us/docs/TP707-1-1712US_HAMR.pdf">Seagate explains in its technical paper</a>, "the entire process—heating, writing, and cooling—takes less than 1 nanosecond." Getting from a physics concept to an actual drive involved adding a laser diode to the drive head, optical steering, firmware alterations, and "a million other little things that engineers spent countless hours developing." Seagate has a lot more about Mozaic 3+ <a href="https://www.seagate.com/innovation/mozaic/">on its site</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/after-decades-of-talk-seagate-seems-ready-to-actually-drop-the-hamr-hard-drives/">Read full article</a></p>
