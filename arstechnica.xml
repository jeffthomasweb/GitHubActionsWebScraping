                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, classic computer collector Joe Strosnider <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/museumjoe.bsky.social/post/3lqq3v43hh52b">announced</a> the availability of a new 3D-printer filament that replicates the iconic "<a href="https://vintagemacmuseum.com/when-the-mac-plus-changed-from-beige-to-platinum/">Platinum</a>" color scheme used in classic Macintosh computers from the late 1980s through the 1990s. The PLA filament (PLA is short for polylactic acid) allows hobbyists to 3D-print nostalgic novelties, replacement parts, and accessories that match the original color of vintage Apple computers.</p>
<p>Hobbyists commonly feed this type of filament into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-my-first-few-months-with-a-bambu-lab-a1-3d-printer-part-1/">commercial desktop 3D printers</a>, which heat the plastic and extrude it in a computer-controlled way to fabricate new plastic parts.</p>
<p>The Platinum color, which Apple used in its desktop and portable computer lines starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS">Apple IIgs</a> in 1986, has become synonymous with a distinctive era of classic Macintosh aesthetic. Over time, original Macintosh plastics have become <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/189/what-happened-to-my-snes-case-discoloration-in-classic-machines">brittle and discolored</a> with age, so matching the "original" color can be a somewhat challenging and subjective experience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/06/new-filament-lets-you-3d-print-parts-in-authentic-1980s-apple-computer-color/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, DC—The general outline of the Trump administration's proposed 2026 budget was released a few weeks back, and it included massive cuts for most agencies, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trumps-2026-budget-proposal-crippling-cuts-for-science-across-the-board/">every one that funds scientific research</a>. Late last week, those agencies began releasing details of what the cuts would mean for the actual projects and people they support. And the results are as bad as the initial budget had suggested: one-of-a-kind scientific experiment facilities and hardware retired, massive cuts in supported scientists, and entire areas of research halted.</p>
<p>And this comes in an environment where previously funded grants are being terminated, funding is being held up for ideological screening, and universities have been subject to arbitrary funding freezes. Collectively, things are heading for damage to US science that will take decades to recover from. It's a radical break from the trajectory science had been on.</p>
<p>That's the environment that the US's National Academies of Science found itself in yesterday while hosting the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/44894_06-2025_the-state-of-the-science-address-2025">State of the Science</a> event in Washington, DC. It was an obvious opportunity for the nation's leading scientific organization to warn the nation of the consequences of the path that the current administration has been traveling. Instead, the event largely ignored the present to worry about a future that may never exist.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/us-science-is-being-wrecked-and-its-leadership-is-fighting-the-last-war/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a revealing interview published by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YdOjoaQTOQ">the <em>All-In Podcast</em></a> on Wednesday, the private astronaut nominated to lead NASA, Jared Isaacman, spoke at length on what he thought about the nomination process, how he would have led NASA, and the factors that led to the abrupt rescission of his nomination by President Trump.</p>
<p>"I got a call Friday, of last week, that the president has decided to go in a different direction," Isaacman said. "It was a real bummer."</p>
<p>It was a real bummer for most of the space community, myself included. To be clear, I am biased. I have gotten to know Isaacman over the last five years rather well, talking with him about his passion for spaceflight, what is working, and what is not. What I have discovered in Isaacman is a person who cares deeply about the future of US spaceflight and wants to make a meaningful contribution to its advancement. To see him done wrong like this, well, it's a very sordid affair.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/jared-isaacman-speaks-out-and-its-clear-that-nasa-lost-a-visionary-leader/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Two commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission are resigning at the end of this week. For at least a little while, the FCC will have just two members: Chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican chosen by Trump to lead the agency, and Anna Gomez, a Democratic commissioner.</p>
<p>Democrat Geoffrey Starks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-democrat-to-resign-cementing-republican-majority-for-chairman-carr/">announced in March</a> that he would leave in the near future, and <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-411805A1.pdf">today</a> he said that Friday will be his final day. Starks' departure could have given Carr a 2-1 Republican majority, but it turns out Republican Commissioner Nathan Simington will leave at the same time as Starks.</p>
<p>"I will be concluding my tenure at the Federal Communications Commission at the end of this week," Simington <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-411800A1.pdf">announced</a> today. "It has been the greatest honor of my professional life to serve the American people as a Commissioner. I am deeply honored to have been entrusted with this responsibility by President Donald J. Trump during his first term."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/two-fcc-commissioners-resign-trumps-chair-still-lacks-republican-majority/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">OpenAI is now fighting a court <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Preservation-Order-5-13-25.pdf">order</a> to preserve all ChatGPT user logs—including deleted chats and sensitive chats logged through its API business offering—after news organizations suing over copyright claims accused the AI company of destroying evidence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"Before OpenAI had an opportunity to respond to those unfounded accusations, the court ordered OpenAI to 'preserve and segregate all output log data that would otherwise be deleted on a going forward basis until further order of the Court (in essence, the output log data that OpenAI has been destroying)," OpenAI explained in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Preservation-Order-5-13-25.pdf">court filing</a> demanding oral arguments in a bid to block the controversial order.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the filing, OpenAI alleged that the court rushed the order based only on a hunch raised by The New York Times and other news plaintiffs. And now, without "any just cause," OpenAI argued, the order "continues to prevent OpenAI from respecting its users’ privacy decisions." That risk extended to users of ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro, as well as users of OpenAI’s application programming interface (API), OpenAI said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-says-court-forcing-it-to-save-all-chatgpt-logs-is-a-privacy-nightmare/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p class="p1">It was shortly after moving into Chicago's Jefferson Park neighborhood that I saw the sign for the first time: American Science &amp; Surplus. My curiosity piqued, I pulled into the strip mall and walked into a store filled with an unimaginable variety of lab equipment, military surplus, tools, electronics, toys, and so much more.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, nearly 90 years after its launch selling "reject lenses" as American Lens &amp; Photo, <a href="https://sciplus.com">American Science &amp; Surplus</a> is facing an existential threat. The COVID-19 pandemic and increased costs hit the business hard, so the store has launched a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/keep-american-science-surplus-alive">GoFundMe campaign looking to raise $200,000</a> from customers and fans alike. What's happening in suburban Chicago is a microcosm of the challenges facing local retail, with big-box retailers and online behemoths overwhelming beloved local institutions. It's a story that has played out countless times in the last two-plus decades, and owner Pat Meyer is hoping this tale has a different ending.</p>

<p class="p1">Launching a fundraiser was a tough choice for Meyer. "I don't like asking people for money," he said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/american-science-surplus-is-fighting-for-its-life-heres-why-you-should-care/">Read full article</a></p>

Today, though, with the June 5 launch of the Switch 2 having already arrived in regions like Japan and Australia, the ever-efficient UPS driver delivered final retail hardware straight from Nintendo of America to the Ars Orbiting HQ.</p>

<p>The 14-hour lead time between our receipt of the hardware and the midnight launch of the Switch 2 on the US East Coast isn't close to enough time to put together a comprehensive review. For now, though, we thought we'd take you through a pictorial journey of our unboxing and initial setup process, ahead of much more coverage to come.</p>
<p>And while you peruse the images, we recommend listening to the absolute bop that is the Switch 2 setup music, which we've embedded below:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/its-here-unboxing-and-setting-up-our-switch-2-review-unit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) teamed up with DOGE to fire 10,000 employees while relying on "hopelessly error-ridden" personnel records, a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.281208/gov.uscourts.dcd.281208.1.0_3.pdf">class-action complaint</a> filed yesterday alleged. The lawsuit said the HHS terminated thousands of workers on April 1, shortly after sharing the flawed personnel records with the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>"These agencies knew that the records were hopelessly error-ridden, and that the records should have been used, if at all, with great caution," said the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the District of Columbia. "Instead of taking steps to verify the contents of the records and correct the systemic inaccuracies, the agencies promptly used them to fire 10,000 employees."</p>
<p>The case was filed by a law firm founded by former Justice Department attorneys on behalf of seven named plaintiffs and all others who were laid off as part of the April 1 Reduction in Force (RIF). It alleges that the government violated the Privacy Act, which <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552a">requires</a> agencies to verify the accuracy of information used as the basis for adverse actions against employees.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/lawsuit-doge-hhs-used-hopelessly-error-ridden-data-to-fire-10000-workers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the years, scholars of the Dead Sea Scrolls have analyzed the ancient parchments with various methods: for example, X-rays, multispectral imaging, "virtual unfolding," and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeography">paleography</a>, i.e., studying elements in their writing styles. The scrolls are believed to date back to between the third century BCE and the first century CE, but those dates rely largely on paleography, since only a handful of the scrolls have calendar dates written on them.</p>
<p>However, the traditional paleographic method is inherently subjective and based on a given scholar's experience. A team of scientists has combined radiocarbon dating from 24 scroll samples and machine-learning-based handwriting analysis to create their own AI program—dubbed Enoch. The objective was to achieve more accurate date estimates, according to a <a href="https://plos.io/44KpPfy">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE. Among the findings: Many of the scrolls are older than previously thought.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/scientists-discover-that-four-blank-dead-sea-scrolls-actually-have-text/">reported earlier</a>, these ancient Hebrew texts—roughly <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2019-09/miot-htm083019.php">900 full and partial scrolls</a> in all, stored in clay jars—were first discovered scattered in various caves near what was once the settlement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qumran_Caves">Qumran</a>, just north of the Dead Sea, by Bedouin shepherds in 1946–1947. (Apparently, a shepherd threw a rock while searching for a lost member of his flock and accidentally shattered one of the clay jars, leading to the discovery.) Qumran was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qumran">destroyed by the Romans</a>, circa 73 CE, and historians believe the scrolls were hidden in the caves by a sect called the Essenes to protect them from being destroyed. The natural limestone and conditions within the caves helped preserve the scrolls for millennia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/are-dead-sea-scrolls-older-than-we-thought/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Now that most of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have been released, it's clear that they give AMD and Intel their best opportunity this decade to claw back some market share and make the dedicated graphics card business a little less lopsided.</p>
<p>It's not that the 50-series GPUs have been <em>bad</em> cards, but a focus on sometimes-useful, sometimes-not AI-generated frames and a lack of major manufacturing advancements relative to the 40-series have eroded Nvidia's usual lead in performance and power efficiency.</p>
<p>That's the advantage AMD is trying to press with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/amds-299-radeon-rx-9060-xt-brings-8gb-or-16gb-of-ram-to-fight-the-rtx-5060/">the new Radeon RX 9060 XT graphics cards</a>, which at $299 and $349 for 8GB and 16GB are both priced and configured to comprehensively undercut Nvidia's RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti. As with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/">RX 9070 series</a> earlier this year, the RDNA 4 architecture goes a long way toward addressing the RX 6000 and RX 7000-series' lackluster ray-tracing performance and mediocre power efficiency, and a relatively affordable 16GB version will help insulate buyers from the RAM limitations that are slowly but surely becoming more of a problem for 8GB cards.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/review-at-349-amds-16gb-radeon-rx-9060-xt-is-the-new-midrange-gpu-to-beat/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk's big government adventure appears to be at an end. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/teslas-death-is-not-close-says-musk-as-operating-margin-drops-to-2/">As promised in April</a>, Musk has returned his attention to his car company, which is facing serious headwinds. In the first quarter of the year, Tesla sold tens of thousands fewer electric vehicles than it did the year before, despite a rise in worldwide EV sales. Data from April looked even worse, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-sales-fall-by-62-in-the-uk-46-in-germany/">substantial sales declines in Europe</a> and China. May's numbers don't look much better.</p>
<p>Although Tesla only publishes its global production and sales numbers—and only at the end of each quarter—some countries provide monthly new car registration information, making it possible to track sales on a national level. And according to Germany's KBA, in May, Tesla sales fell by just over 36 percent year over year, even as overall EV registrations increased by 45 percent. At least that's a few hundred more cars than it managed in April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-german-car-sales-continue-decline-may-2025-06-04/">Similar trends</a> were seen in the UK and Italy. In the UK, Tesla sales decreased by 45 percent, even as overall EV sales increased by 28 percent. In Italy, EV sales increased by almost 41 percent, but Tesla's deliveries dropped by 20 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/tesla-shows-no-sign-of-improvement-in-may-sales-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On an average day, you might unlock or look at your phone dozens of times, which makes the lock screen a hot property for advertising. Ad tech company Glance has been taking advantage of that for years with its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/coming-soon-to-a-carrier-phone-near-you-lock-screen-ads/">ad-laden lock screen experiences</a>, but it's going further in the age of AI. Samsung and Glance have teamed up to deliver a new "AI shopping" experience that uses a selfie to create custom fashion ads. This feature is rolling out to numerous Samsung phones in the next month.</p>
<p>Glance has been around for a while—its non-AI lock screen experience has been bundled on various phones from Samsung, Motorola, and others. Before the AI era, Glance lured people in with promises of pretty pictures and news alerts, which came with a side of ads and tracking. The new Glance AI feature has all that, but it adds an unsettling face-stealing layer to the experience.</p>
<p>The AI-infused Glance will arrive on Samsung phones as both a standalone app and a fully integrated lock screen. Thankfully, this is a fully opt-in experience. If you never open or set up Glance, you can keep using the normal lock screen on your phone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/samsung-teams-up-with-glance-to-use-your-face-in-ai-generated-lock-screen-ads/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A top expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was overseeing the process to update COVID-19 vaccine recommendations resigned on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The resignation, first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cdc-expert-resigns-covid-vaccines-advisory-role-sources-say-2025-06-03/">The Associated Press</a> and confirmed by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-official-overseeing-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations-resigns/">CBS News</a>, comes just a week after health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unilaterally <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-axes-covid-shot-guidance-for-pregnant-people-kids/">revoked and altered some of the CDC's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines</a>, restricting access to children and pregnant people. The resignation also comes three weeks before CDC's experts and advisors are scheduled to meet to publicly evaluate data and discuss the recommendations for this season—a long-established process that was disrupted by Kennedy's announcement.</p>
<p>The departing CDC official, Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a pediatric infectious disease expert, was a co-leader of a working group on COVID-19 vaccines who advised experts on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). She informed her ACIP colleagues of her resignation in an email on Tuesday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/top-cdc-covid-vaccine-expert-resigns-after-rfk-jr-unilaterally-restricts-access/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Since the National Science Foundation first started collecting postgraduation data nearly 70 years ago, the number of PhDs awarded in the United States has consistently risen. Last year, more than 45,000 students <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25300">earned</a> doctorates in science and engineering, about an eight-fold increase compared to 1958.</p>
<p>But this level of production of science and engineering PhD students is now in question. Facing significant cuts to federal science funding, some universities have <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/02/25/facing-nih-cuts-colleges-restrict-grad-student">reduced or paused</a> their PhD admissions for the upcoming academic year. In response, experts are beginning to wonder about the short and long-term effects those shifts will have on the number of doctorates awarded and the consequent <a href="https://undark.org/2025/05/01/opinion-shrinking-science-jenga/">impact on science</a> if PhD production does drop.</p>
<p>Such questions touch on longstanding debates about academic labor. PhD training is a crucial part of nurturing scientific expertise. At the same time, some analysts have worried about an <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/06/22/how-phd-job-crisis-built-system-and-what-can-be-done-about-it-opinion">oversupply of PhDs</a> in some fields, while students have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/04/we-must-stop-universities-exploiting-the-unpaid-labour-of-phd-students">suggested</a> that universities are exploiting them as <a href="https://hechingerreport.org/oversupply-phds-threaten-american-science/">low-cost labor</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/science-phds-face-a-challenging-and-uncertain-future/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week an in-space propulsion company, Impulse Space, announced that it had raised a significant amount of money, $300 million. This follows a fundraising round just last year in which the Southern California-based company raised $150 million.</p>
<p>This is one of the largest capital raises in space in a while, especially for a non-launch company. To understand why Impulse was able to raise so much additional money so quickly, Ars caught up with founder Tom Mueller and the company's chief executive, Eric Romo. They explained that demand for Impulse's efficient in-space vehicles is high, and since early missions have worked well, the company wants to seize the moment to scale up its operations.</p>
<p>"We had been operating relatively conservatively, in how many people we were allowing ourselves to hire and capital expenditures," Romo said. "This will allow us to release a little bit of that conservatism and lean into some stuff like electric propulsion and potentially other vehicles that are going to allow us to grow long-term."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/an-in-space-propulsion-company-just-raised-a-staggering-amount-of-money/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google says its Chrome browser will stop trusting certificates from two certificate authorities after “patterns of concerning behavior observed over the past year” diminished trust in their reliability.</p>
<p>The two organizations, Taiwan-based Chunghwa Telecom and Budapest-based Netlock, are among the dozens of certificate authorities trusted by Chrome and most other browsers to provide digital certificates that encrypt traffic and certify the authenticity of sites. With the ability to mint cryptographic credentials that cause address bars to display a padlock, assuring the trustworthiness of a site, these certificate authorities wield significant control over the security of the web.</p>
<h2>Inherent risk</h2>
<p>“Over the past several months and years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports,” members of the Chrome security team <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/sustaining-digital-certificate-security-chrome-root-store-changes.html">wrote Tuesday</a>. “When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the internet, continued public trust is no longer justified.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/chrome-boots-2-certificate-authorities-citing-a-lack-of-trust-and-confidence/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge ruled today that Florida cannot enforce a law that requires social media platforms to block kids from using their platforms. The state law "is likely unconstitutional," US Judge Mark Walker of the Northern District of Florida <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.527923/gov.uscourts.flnd.527923.94.0.pdf">ruled</a> while granting the tech industry's request for a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>The Florida law "prohibits some social media platforms from allowing youth in the state who are under the age of 14 to create or hold an account on their platforms, and similarly prohibits allowing youth who are 14 or 15 to create or hold an account unless a parent or guardian provides affirmative consent for them to do so," Walker wrote.</p>
<p>The law is subject to intermediate scrutiny under the First Amendment, meaning it must be "narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest," must "leave open ample alternative channels for communication," and must not "burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests," the ruling said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/federal-judge-blocks-florida-law-that-bans-kids-from-social-media/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 1979, Atari released the Atari <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/how-a-1980s-atari-creator-with-cystic-fibrosis-crafted-a-story-of-salmon-survival/">400 and 800</a>, groundbreaking home computers that included custom graphics and sound chips, four joystick ports, and the ability to run the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Raiders">most advanced</a> home video games of their era. These machines, which retailed for $549 and $999, respectively, represented a leap in consumer-friendly personal computing, with their modular design and serial I/O bus that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432140/how-atari-took-on-apple-in-the-1980s-home-pc-wars">presaged USB</a>. Now, 46 years later, a hobbyist has shrunk down the system hardware to a size that would have seemed like science fiction in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Polish engineer Piotr "Osa" Ostapowicz <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/381202-the-new-extraordinary-a8-clone-platform/">recently unveiled</a> "Atarino," which may be the world's smallest 8-bit Atari computer re-creation, according to retro computing site <a href="https://www.atariteca.net.pe/2025/05/atarino-el-atari-8-bits-mas-pequeno.html">Atariteca</a>. The entire system—processor, graphics chips, sound hardware, and memory controllers—fits on a module measuring just 2×1.5 centimeters (about 0.79×0.59 inches), which is roughly the size of a postage stamp.</p>
<p>Ostapowicz's creation reimplements the classic Atari XL/XE architecture using modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> (field-programmable gate array) technology. Unlike software emulators that simulate old hardware (and modern recreations that run them, like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/why-i-hope-the-atari-400-mini-will-bring-respect-to-ataris-most-underrated-platform/">Atari 400 Mini</a> console) on a complete computer system of another architecture, Atarino reproduces the original Atari components faithfully at the logic level, allowing it to run vintage software while maintaining compatibility with original peripherals.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/polish-engineer-creates-postage-stamp-sized-1980s-atari-computer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Senate Democrats are pleading with the Trump administration to stop delaying distribution of $42 billion in grants for construction of broadband networks in areas with poor Internet access.</p>
<p>The Biden administration spent about three years developing rules and procedures for the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) fund and then evaluating plans submitted by each US state and territory. Republicans repeatedly alleged that Democrats should have distributed the grants more quickly, but the Trump administration halted progress after taking over.</p>
<p>"States are ready to put shovels in the ground and have been waiting for months to get started... Additional delays and onerous changes to the program at this stage threaten to further stall urgently needed deployment and leave communities behind," Senate Democrats wrote in a May 30 <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/with-over-42-billion-in-vital-broadband-funding-still-held-up-by-trump-administration-leader-schumer-ranking-member-cantwell-and-senator-lujan-demand-admin-stop-the-delays-and-immediately-release-the-funding-into-american-communities-senators-say-25-million-americans-still-lack-high-speed-internet-as-bipartisan-funding-lingers">letter</a> to President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Many Arsians are the go-to IT support representative for family and friends. If you're lucky, your loved ones' problems are easily resolved with a reset, update, or new cable. That wasn't the case for a son who recently had to break the news to his father that the 20TB portable hard drive he purchased for about $50 was mostly just a plastic box with weights and a PCB.</p>
<p>Ars Technica spoke with the Reddit user who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1iur7hv/dad_dropped_off_his_new_20tb_hdd_to_see_if_i/">posted about</a> his father bringing him a "new 20T[B] HDD to see if I could figure out what was wrong with it." The Redditor, who asked that we refer to him by his first name, Martin, revealed that his dad paid £38 (about $51.33) for what he thought was a portable HDD. That's a red flag. HDDs have gotten cheaper over the years, but not <em>that cheap</em>. A 20TB external HDD <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/external-hard-drives/expansion-desktop-hard-drive/?sku=STKP6000400">typically</a> costs over $200, and they’re usually much larger than the portable-SSD-sized device that Martin’s father received. A 20TB HDD in a portable form factor is <a href="https://oyendigital.com/novus-20tb-external-usb-c-rugged-desktop-hard-drive.html?srsltid=AfmBOopFp8DUqHef7CH_ioNWQMiXjaEveGF43GpOTe3hhs03GxrW80Zy">rarer</a> and can cost well <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-easystore-20tb-external-usb-3-0-hard-drive-black/6500985.p?skuId=6500985">over $300</a>.</p>
<p>Taking a hammer to the device revealed that the chassis was nearly empty, save for some iron wheel weights sloppily attached to the black plastic with hefty globs of glue and a small PCB with some form of flash storage that could connect to a system via USB-A.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/man-buys-20tb-portable-hdd-for-51-son-breaks-the-news-that-its-a-fake/">Read full article</a></p>
