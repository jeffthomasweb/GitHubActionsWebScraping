                            <![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I go longer than I intend without writing an updated version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/ars-technica-system-guide-falling-prices-are-more-exciting-than-new-parts/">our PC building guide</a>. And while I could just claim to be too busy to spend hours on Newegg or Amazon or other sites digging through dozens of near-identical parts, the lack of updates <em>usually </em>correlates with "times when building a desktop PC is actually a pain in the ass."</p>
<p>Through most of 2025, fluctuating and inflated graphics card pricing and limited availability have once again conspired to make a normally fun hobby an annoying slog—and honestly kind of a bad way to spend your money, relative to just buying a Steam Deck or something and ignoring your desktop for a while.</p>
<p>But three things have brought me back for another round. First, GPU pricing and availability have improved a <em>little</em> since early 2025. Second, as unreasonable as pricing is for PC parts, pre-built PCs with worse specs and other design compromises are unreasonably priced, too, and people should have some sense of what their options are. And third, I just have the <em>itch</em>—it's been a while since I built (or helped someone else build) a PC, and I need to get it out of my system.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/ars-technica-system-guide-back-to-pc-building-for-back-to-school/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every dog owner knows that canines are natural scavengers and that vigilance is required to ensure they don't eat toxic substances. But accidental ingestions still happen—like the chihuahua who vets discovered had somehow managed to ingest a significant quantity of cocaine, according to a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2025.1622850/full">case study</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science.</p>
<p>There have been several studies investigating the bad effects cocaine can have on the cardiovascular systems of both humans and animals. However, these controlled studies are primarily done in laboratory settings and often don't match the messier clinical realities. "Case reports are crucial in veterinary medicine by providing real-world examples," <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/08/18/what-do-dog-ingests-cocaine">said co-author Jake Johnson</a> of North Carolina State University. "They capture clinical scenarios that larger studies might miss, preserve unusual presentations for future reference, and help build our collective understanding of rare presentations, ultimately improving emergency preparedness and treatment protocols."</p>
<p>In the case of a male 2-year-old chihuahua, the dog presented as lethargic and unresponsive. His owners had found him with his tongue sticking out and unable to focus visually. The chihuahua was primarily an outdoor dog but was also allowed inside, and all its vaccines were up to date. Examination revealed bradycardia, i.e., a slow heart rate, a blue tinge to the dog's mucus membranes—often a sign of too much unoxygenated hemoglobin circulating through the system—and dilated pupils. The dog's symptoms faded after the vet administered a large dose of atropine, followed by epinephrine.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/the-case-of-the-coke-snorting-chihauhua/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show"><em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em></a> premiered in 1975, no one could have dreamed that it would become the longest-running theatrical release film in history. But that's what happened. Thanks to a killer soundtrack, campy humor, and a devoted cult following, <em>Rocky Horror</em> is still a mainstay of midnight movie culture. In honor of its 50th anniversary, Disney/20th Century Studios is releasing a newly restored 4K HDR version in October, along with deluxe special editions on DVD and Blu-ray. And the film has inspired not one, but two documentaries marking its five decades of existence: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Journey:_The_Story_of_Rocky_Horror"><em>Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror</em></a> and <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5733218/">Sane Inside Insanity: The Phenomenon of Rocky Horror</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below, because it's been 50 years.)</strong></p>
<p>The film is an adaption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_O%27Brien">Richard O'Brien</a>'s 1973 musical for the stage, <em>The Rocky Horror Show</em>. At the time, he was a struggling actor and wrote the musical as an homage to the science fiction and B horror movies he'd loved since a child. In fact, the opening song ("<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKhPVHoodrU">Science Fiction/Double Feature</a>") makes explicit reference to many of those, including 1951's <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still, Flash Gordon</em> (1936), <em>King Kong</em> (1933), <em>The Invisible Man</em> (1933), <em>Forbidden Planet</em> (1956), and <em>The Day of the Triffids</em> (1962), among others.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/celebrating-50-years-of-the-rocky-horror-picture-show/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After several days of working its way across the open and at times hostile Atlantic Ocean this week, Hurricane Erin found more favorable conditions and exploded in intensity on Friday night. Shortly before noon on Saturday, the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCUAT5+shtml/161520.shtml">National Hurricane Center declared</a> that Erin had reached Category 5 status, the most powerful kind of hurricane.</p>
<p>This determination is based on sustained winds, which were measured by a US Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft on Saturday at 160 mph.</p>
<p>There is some good news: Erin is threading a needle with its projected track. Although it should pass close to several landmasses between now and next Thursday, Erin should remain far enough away to avoid catastrophic damage. Erin is presently passing to the north of the Caribbean islands, and will turn northward before reaching the Bahamas and the Eastern United States. Later next week it should follow a path that takes it between Atlantic Canada and Bermuda.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/hurricane-erin-sets-early-season-intensification-record-becomes-category-5-storm/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Everything we see around us, from the ground beneath our feet to the most remote galaxies, is made of matter. For scientists, that has long posed a problem: According to physicists’ best current theories, matter and its counterpart, antimatter, ought to have been created in equal amounts at the time of the Big Bang. But antimatter is vanishingly rare in the universe. So what happened?</p>
<p>Physicists don’t know the answer to that question yet, but many think the solution must involve some subtle difference in the way that matter and antimatter behave. And right now, the most promising path into that unexplored territory centers on new experiments involving the mysterious subatomic particle known as the neutrino.</p>
<p>“It’s not to say that neutrinos are definitely the explanation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry, but a very large class of models that can explain this asymmetry are connected to neutrinos,” says <a href="https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/profile/turner/">Jessica Turner</a>, a theoretical physicist at Durham University in the United Kingdom.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/how-a-mysterious-particle-could-explain-the-universes-missing-antimatter/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Engineers completed a final test of Starship's propulsion system with a so-called "spin prime" test Wednesday at the launch site in South Texas. Ground crews then rolled the ship back to a nearby hangar for engine inspections, touchups to its heat shield, and a handful of other chores to ready it for liftoff.</p>
<p>SpaceX has announced the launch is scheduled for no earlier than next Sunday, August 24, at 6:30 pm local time in Texas (23:30 UTC).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacex-reveals-why-the-last-two-starships-failed-as-another-launch-draws-near/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">helped popularize the microSD Express standard</a> by requiring it for the new Switch 2 console. Created in 2019, the specification had languished in relative obscurity for years because the cheap, plentiful non-Express microSD cards were generally fast enough for the things that people were using them for, and because most hardware didn't support microSD Express cards in the first place.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo's console needed performance closer to that of an internal SSD to run games, given that the more powerful Switch 2 can run more of the titles being developed for SSD-equipped systems such as the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series S and X, and the PC. And now other companies are trying to push the "fast, removable storage" envelope even further.</p>
<p>The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/759624/china-is-about-to-launch-ssds-so-small-you-insert-them-like-a-sim-card">reports</a> that a Chinese company called Biwin has developed the "Mini SSD," a 15 by 17 mm-thick card that supports read speeds of up to 3,700MB per second due to a two-lane PCI Express 4.0 interface. The current microSD Express standard <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/press/thoughtleadership/sd-9-1-specification-introduces-new-speed-classes-and-next-level-performance-features-2/">can support roughly the same peak speeds</a> when connected to two PCIe 4.0 lanes. But in reality, most of today's cards top out around 900MB per second, roughly the amount of bandwidth available from a single PCI Express 3.0 lane.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/tiny-removable-mini-ssd-could-eventually-be-a-big-deal-for-gaming-handhelds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The recent rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-gpt-5-rollout-has-been-a-big-mess/">has not been going well</a>, to say the least. Users have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/chatgpt-users-outraged-as-gpt-5-replaces-the-models-they-love/">made vociferous complaints</a> about everything from the new model's more sterile tone to its supposed lack of creativity, increase in damaging confabulations, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mn8t5e/gpt5_is_a_mess/">and more</a>. The user revolt got so bad that OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/openai-brings-back-gpt-4o-after-user-revolt/">brought back the previous GPT-4o model as an option</a> in an attempt to calm things down.</p>
<p>To see just how much the new model changed things, we decided to put both GPT-5 and GPT-4o through our own gauntlet of test prompts. While we reused some of the standard prompts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">compare ChatGPT to Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">Deepseek</a>, for instance, we've also replaced some of the more outdated test prompts with new, more complex requests that reflect how modern users are likely to use LLMs.</p>
<p>These eight prompts are obviously far from a rigorous evaluation of everything LLMs can do, and judging the responses obviously involves some level of subjectivity. Still, we think this set of prompts and responses gives a fun overview of the kinds of differences in style and substance you might find if you decide to use OpenAI's older model instead of its newest.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/is-gpt-5-really-worse-than-gpt-4o-ars-puts-them-to-the-test/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration has ended potential enforcement actions against dozens of tech firms and 165 corporations overall, delivering on promises to end the alleged "weaponization" of the federal government, a <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/deleting-enforcement-trump-big-tech-billion-report/">report by nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen</a> said.</p>
<p>"In six months, the Trump administration has already withdrawn or halted enforcement actions against 165 corporations of all types—and one in four of the corporations benefiting from halted or dropped enforcement is from the technology sector, which has spent $1.2 billion on political influence during and since the 2024 elections," the report published on Wednesday said. The political spending includes $352 million that "is attributable to Elon Musk."</p>
<p>At the beginning of Trump's second term, there were at least 104 tech companies facing at least 142 federal investigations and enforcement actions, Public Citizen reported. The Trump administration has halted or withdrawn about one-third of the "targeted investigations into suspected misconduct and enforcement actions against technology corporations... So far, 47 enforcement actions (against 45 tech corporations) have been withdrawn or halted (38 withdrawn, nine halted)," the report said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/trump-admin-ranks-companies-on-loyalty-while-handing-out-favors-to-big-tech/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Zealous anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reviving a long-defunct federal vaccine panel that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/anti-vaccine-group-founded-by-rfk-jr-sues-rfk-jr-over-vaccine-task-force/">anti-vaccine advocates, including Kennedy, have long sought</a> and health experts fear will be used to dismantle evidence-based recommendations for life-saving childhood shots.</p>
<p>The panel is a task force outlined in the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/title-xxi-phs-vaccines-1517.pdf">National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986</a>, which is best known for setting up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The law states that the task force's goal is to "promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines on the market on the effective date of this part and promote the refinement of such vaccines."</p>
<p>The federal government has multiple overlapping procedures and systems that evaluate, review, and continuously monitor the safety of childhood vaccines, which have gone through rigorous testing and are well-established to be safe. Further, the government does, in effect, promote improved vaccines by providing grants to academic and industry researchers to develop advanced shots. It also conducts its own vaccine research toward that goal. For instance, researchers at the National Institutes of Health were critical in developing the mRNA vaccine technology that enabled the swift creation of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that saved millions of lives at the height of the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/anti-vaccine-rfk-jr-ominously-creates-panel-on-childhood-vaccines/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/president-trump-says-intels-new-ceo-must-resign-immediately/">meddling with Intel</a>, which now apparently includes mulling "the possibility of the US government taking a financial stake in the troubled chip maker," The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/us-stake-intel-1ff24500">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan weighed the option during a meeting on Monday at the White House, people familiar with the matter told WSJ. These talks have only just begun—with Intel branding them a rumor—and sources told the WSJ that Trump has yet to iron out how the potential arrangement might work.</p>
<p>The WSJ's report comes after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/president-trump-says-intels-new-ceo-must-resign-immediately/">Trump called for Tan to "resign immediately"</a> last week. Trump's demand was seemingly spurred by a <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-to-intel-ceos-ties-to-china-are-concerning">letter</a> that Republican senator Tom Cotton sent to Intel, accusing Tan of having "concerning" ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/us-may-purchase-stake-in-intel-after-trump-attacked-ceo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.06 of the Rocket Report! Two of the world's most storied rocket builders not named SpaceX achieved major successes this week. Arianespace's Ariane 6 rocket launched from French Guiana on its third flight Tuesday night with a European weather satellite. Less than 20 minutes later, United Launch Alliance's third Vulcan rocket lifted off from Florida on a US military mission. These are two of the three big rockets developed in the Western world that have made their orbital debuts in the last two years, alongside Blue Origin's New Glenn launcher. Ariane 6 narrowly won the "race" to reach its third orbital flight, but if you look at it another way, Ariane 6 reached its third flight milestone 13 months after its inaugural launch. It took Vulcan more than 19 months, and New Glenn has flown just once. SpaceX's Super Heavy/Starship rocket has flown nine times but has yet to reach orbit.</p>

<p><b>Sixth success for sea-launched Chinese rocket. </b>Private Chinese satellite operator Geespace added 11 spacecraft to its expanding Internet of Things constellation on August 8, aiming to boost low-power connectivity in key emerging markets, <a href="https://spacenews.com/chinas-geespace-expands-iot-constellation-with-11-satellite-sea-launch/">Space News reports</a>. The 11 satellites rode into orbit aboard a solid-fueled Jielong 3 (Smart Dragon 3) rocket lifting off from an ocean platform in the Yellow Sea off the coast of Rizhao, a city in eastern China's Shandong province. This was the sixth flight of the Jielong 3, a rocket developed by a commercially oriented spinoff of the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/rocket-report-big-success-for-big-rockets-artemis-crew-trains-for-night-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Acura's next RSX crossover has broken cover. The automaker has used this year's Monterey Car Week as a stage to show off a bright yellow prototype—the color is called Propulsion Yellow Pearl—ahead of the production car going on sale next year. And unlike the current generation (which Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/fast-and-fun-but-flawed-the-acura-rdx-reviewed/">last tested in 2019</a>) RDX, this crossover will be fully electric.</p>
<p>It will be built at the Honda Marysville Auto Plant <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/honda-cleans-greens-its-ohio-factories-to-add-evs-to-the-mix/">that we checked out in January</a>. The 40-year-old factory has undergone a high-tech refit that has not only made the factory more energy efficient and a better working environment for employees but also prepared it to incorporate electric vehicles into the assembly line.</p>
<p>In recent years, Acura has grappled with its self-image. Although it's often perceived as a luxury brand, Acura has always been more of a North American performance arm of Honda, and the automaker wants to lean into that. Unlike the brand's first battery electric vehicle <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/software-can-make-a-difference-the-acura-zdx-type-s-review/">the ZDX</a>, which is a rebadged General Motors EV, the RSX was designed entirely in-house.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/acura-unveils-next-rdx-crossover-will-feature-asimo-os/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Porsche 911 enthusiasts tend to be obsessive about their engines. Some won't touch anything that isn't air-cooled, convinced that everything went wrong when emissions and efficiency finally forced radiators into the car. Others love the "Mezger" engines; designed by engineer Hans Mezger, they trace their roots to the 1998 Le Mans-winning car, and no Porschephile can resist the added shine of a motorsports halo.</p>
<p>I'm quite sure none of them will feel the same way about the powertrain in the new 911 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid (MSRP: $175,900), and I think that's a crying shame. Because not only is the car's technology rather cutting-edge—you won't find this stuff <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/06/high-tech-hybrids-are-2014s-hottest-race-cars/">outside an F1 car</a>—but having spent several days behind the wheel, I can report it might just be one of the best-driving, too.</p>

<p>This is not just one of Porsche's existing flat-six engines with an electric motor bolted on; it's an all-new 3.6 L engine designed to comply with new European legislation that no longer lets automakers rich out a fuel mixture under high load to improve engine cooling. Instead, the engine has to maintain the same 14.7:1 stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (also known as <a href="https://www.avl.com/documents/10138/8682805/14+Baumgarten.pdf">lambda = 1</a>) across the entire operating range, thus allowing the car's catalytic converters to work most efficiently.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/porsches-best-daily-driver-911-the-2025-carrera-gts-t-hybrid-review/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>xAI apparently lost a government contract after a tweak to Grok's prompting triggered an antisemitic meltdown where the chatbot <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/grok-praises-hitler-gives-credit-to-musk-for-removing-woke-filters/">praised Hitler</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/groks-mechahitler-meltdown-didnt-stop-xai-from-winning-200m-military-deal/">declared itself MechaHitler</a> last month.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Starlink operator SpaceX is fighting Virginia's plan to deploy fiber Internet service to residents, claiming that federal grant money should be given to Starlink instead. SpaceX is already in line to win over $3 million in grant money in the state but is seeking $60 million.</p>
<p>Starlink is poised to benefit from the Trump administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/">rewriting rules</a> for the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program. While the Biden administration decided that states should prioritize fiber in order to build more future-proof networks, the Trump administration ordered states to revise their plans with a "tech-neutral approach" and lower the average cost of serving each location.</p>
<p>With the Trump administration backing its attempt to obtain more federal funding for Starlink, SpaceX is likely to object to state plans that still include significant fiber builds. That's what happened yesterday when SpaceX filed <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SpaceX-Comments-to-VA-Final-Proposal-Final.pdf">comments</a> on Virginia's final proposal, which will be reviewed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-tries-to-block-virginias-plan-to-bring-fiber-internet-to-residents/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Big tech has spent the last few years creating ever-larger AI models, leveraging rack after rack of expensive GPUs to provide generative AI as a cloud service. But tiny AI matters, too. Google has announced a tiny version of its Gemma open model designed to run on local devices. Google says the new Gemma 3 270M can be tuned in a snap and maintains robust performance despite its small footprint.</p>
<p>Google released its first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-new-gemma-3-ai-model-is-optimized-to-run-on-a-single-gpu/">Gemma 3 open models</a> earlier this year, featuring between 1 billion and 27 billion parameters. In generative AI, the parameters are the learned variables that control how the model processes inputs to estimate output tokens. Generally, the more parameters in a model, the better it performs. With just 270 million parameters, the new Gemma 3 can run on devices like smartphones or even entirely inside a web browser.</p>
<p>Running an AI model locally has numerous benefits, including enhanced privacy and lower latency. Gemma 3 270M was designed with these kinds of use cases in mind. In testing with a Pixel 9 Pro, the new Gemma was able to run 25 conversations on the Tensor G4 chip and use just 0.75 percent of the device's battery. That makes it by far the most efficient Gemma model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/08/google-releases-pint-size-gemma-open-ai-model/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/">reviewing</a> an internal document that Meta verified as authentic, Reuters revealed that by design, Meta allowed its chatbots to engage kids in "sensual" chat. Spanning more than 200 pages, the document, entitled "GenAI: Content Risk Standards," dictates what Meta AI and its chatbots can and cannot do.</p>
<p>The document covers more than just child safety, and Reuters breaks down several alarming portions that Meta is not changing. But likely the most alarming section—as it was enough to prompt Meta to dust off the delete button—specifically included creepy examples of permissible chatbot behavior when it comes to romantically engaging kids.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/meta-backtracks-on-rules-letting-chatbots-be-creepy-to-kids/">Read full article</a></p>
