<p>Drug shortages in the US have reached an all-time high, with 323 active and ongoing shortages already tallied this year, according to <a href="https://www.ashp.org/drug-shortages/shortage-resources/drug-shortages-statistics">data collected by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists</a> (ASHP).</p>
<p>The current drug shortage total surpasses the previous record of 320, set in 2014, and is the highest recorded since ASHP began tracking shortages in 2001.</p>
<p>"All drug classes are vulnerable to shortages," ASHP CEO Paul Abramowitz said in <a href="https://www.ashp.org/about-ashp/ceo-blogs/recent-blogs/ashp-calls-for-policy-solutions-as-drug-shortages-reach-all-time-high?loginreturnUrl=SSOCheckOnly">a statement</a> Thursday. "Some of the most worrying shortages involve generic sterile injectable medications, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/dire-shortage-of-cancer-drugs-in-us-forces-doctors-to-ration-doses/2/">cancer chemotherapy drugs</a> and emergency medications stored in hospital crash carts and procedural areas. Ongoing national shortages of therapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] also remain a serious challenge for clinicians and patients."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017093#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017093&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Western Digital plans to release the first 4TB SD card next year. On Thursday, the storage firm announced plans to demo the product in person next week.</p>
<p>Western Digital will launch the SD card, which follows the SD Association's Secure Digital Ultra Capacity (SDUC) standard, under its SanDisk brand and market it toward "complex media and entertainment workflows," such as high-resolution video with high framerates, using cameras and laptops, the announcement said.</p>
<p>The spacious card will use the Ultra High Speed-1 (UHS-1) bus interface, supporting max theoretical transfer rates of up to 104 MB per second. It will support minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21349/western-digital-rollsout-4-tb-sd-card-worlds-highestcapacity">AnandTech </a>reported. Minimum sequential write speeds are expected to reach 30 MB/s, the publication said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016986#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016986&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Highly capable hackers are rooting multiple corporate networks by exploiting a maximum-severity zero-day vulnerability in a firewall product from Palo Alto Networks, researchers said Friday.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, which has been under active exploitation for at least two weeks now, allows the hackers with no authentication to execute malicious code with root privileges, the highest possible level of system access, researchers said. The extent of the compromise, along with the ease of exploitation, has earned the CVE-2024-3400 vulnerability the maximum severity rating of 10.0. The ongoing attacks are the latest in a rash of attacks aimed at firewalls, VPNs, and file-transfer appliances, which are popular targets because of their wealth of vulnerabilities and direct pipeline into the most sensitive parts of a network.</p>
<h2>“Highly capable” UTA0218 likely to be joined by others</h2>
<p>The zero-day is present in PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, and/or PAN-OS 11.1 firewalls when they are configured to use both the GlobalProtect gateway and device telemetry. Palo Alto Networks has yet to patch the vulnerability but is urging affected customers to follow the workaround and mitigation guidance provided <a href="https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-3400">here</a>. The advice includes enabling Threat ID 95187 for those with subscriptions to the company’s Threat Prevention service and ensuring vulnerability protection has been applied to their GlobalProtect interface. When that’s not possible, customers should temporarily disable telemetry until a patch is available.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017043#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017043&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Some weeks in AI news are eerily quiet, but during others, getting a grip on the week's events feels like trying to hold back the tide. This week has seen three notable large language model (LLM) releases: Google Gemini Pro 1.5 hit <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemini-15-pro-in-public-preview-with-new-features.html">general availability</a> with a free tier, OpenAI shipped a <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1777772582680301665">new version</a> of GPT-4 Turbo, and Mistral released a new openly licensed LLM, <a href="https://x.com/sophiamyang/status/1777945947764297845">Mixtral 8x22B</a>. All three of those launches happened within 24 hours starting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With the help of software engineer and independent AI researcher Simon Willison (who also <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/10/weeknotes-llm-releases/">wrote about</a> this week's hectic LLM launches on his own blog), we'll briefly cover each of the three major events in roughly chronological order, then dig into some additional AI happenings this week.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning Pacific time, Google <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemini-15-pro-in-public-preview-with-new-features.html">announced</a> that its Gemini 1.5 Pro model (which we first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/">covered</a> in February) is now available in 180-plus countries, excluding Europe, via the Gemini API in a public preview. This is Google's most powerful public LLM so far, and it's available in a free tier that permits up to 50 requests a day.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016005#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016005&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>An accomplished and prominent transplant surgeon in Texas allegedly falsified patient data in a government transplant waiting list, which may have prevented his own patients from receiving lifesaving liver transplants, according to media reports and hospital statements.</p>
<p>Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center halted its liver transplant program on April 3 after finding "irregularities" with donor acceptance criteria, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/health/article/memorial-hermann-stops-liver-transplants-19386403.php">the Houston Chronicle reported</a> based on a statement from the hospital. At the time there were 38 patients on the hospital's wait list for a liver. Earlier this week, the hospital also halted its kidney transplant program, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/health/article/houston-s-memorial-hermann-hospital-stops-kidney-19393554.php">telling the Chronicle</a> that it was pausing operations to "evaluate a new physician leadership structure."</p>
<p>Memorial Hermann has not named the surgeon behind the "inappropriate changes," but The New York Times identified him as Dr. Steve Bynon, a surgeon who has received numerous accolades and, at one point, appears to have been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/uthealth-houston_dr-steve-bynon-of-mcgovern-medical-school-activity-6222488620519997440-njsY/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">featured on a billboard.</a> Bynon oversaw both the liver and kidney transplant programs at Memorial Hermann.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017017#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017017&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Epic Games has filed a <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lgpdnbeenpo/Epic%20v%20Google%20-%20injunction%20proposal%20-%2020240411.pdf">proposed injunction</a> that would stop Google from restricting third-party app distribution outside Google Play Store on Android devices after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">proving that Google had an illegal monopoly</a> in markets for Android app distribution.</p>
<p>Epic is suggesting that competition on the Android mobile platform would be opened up if the court orders Google to allow third-party app stores to be distributed for six years in the Google Play Store and blocks Google from entering any agreements with device makers that would stop them from pre-loading third-party app stores. This would benefit both mobile developers and users, Epic argued in a wide-sweeping proposal that would greatly limit Google's control over the Android app ecosystem.</p>
<p>US District Court Judge James Donato will ultimately decide the terms of the injunction. Google has until May 3 to respond to Epic's filing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016966#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016966&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There is the mental image that most people have of electronics recycling, and then there is the reality, which is shredding.</p>
<p><a href="https://earth.org/what-is-e-waste-recycling/">Less than 20 percent of e-waste</a> even makes it to recycling. That which does is, if not acquired through IT asset disposition (ITAD) or spotted by a worker who sees some value, heads into the shredder for raw metals extraction. If you've ever toured an electronics recycling facility, you can see for yourself <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/03/i-spot-brand-new-tvs-here-to-be-shredded-the-truth-about-our-electronic-waste">how much of your stuff eventually gets chewed into little bits</a>, whether due to design, to unprofitable reuse markets, or sheer volume concerns.</p>
<p>Traditional hard drives have some valuable things inside them—case, cover, circuit boards, drive assemblies, actuators, and rare-earth magnets—but only if they avoid the gnashing teeth. That's where the DiskMantler comes in. Garner Products, a data elimination firm, has a machine that it claims can process 500 hard drives (the HDD kind) per day in a way that leaves a drive separated into those useful components. And <a href="https://garnerproducts.com/products/hard-drive-destroyers-solid-state-destroyers/diskmantler">the DiskMantler</a> does this by <a href="https://garnerproducts.com/hubfs/Videos/DiskMantler-Garner.mp4">shaking the thing to death</a> (video).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016916#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016916&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the first time, SpaceX will launch one of its reusable Falcon 9 boosters for a 20th time Friday night on a flight to deliver 23 more Starlink Internet satellites to orbit.</p>
<p>This milestone mission is scheduled to lift off at 9:22 pm EDT Friday (01:22 UTC Saturday) from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Forecasters from the US Space Force predict "excellent" weather for the primetime launch.</p>
<p>Falcon 9 will blaze a familiar trail into space, following the same profile as dozens of past Starlink missions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016882#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016882&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another day, another dead Google product. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/users-say-googles-vpn-app-breaks-the-windows-dns-settings/">Google One VPN service</a> we complained about last week is headed to the chopping block. Google's <a href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/7582172?hl=en-GB&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">support documents</a> haven't been updated yet, but <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vpn-by-google-one-shut-down-3433530/">Android Authority</a> reported on an email going out to Google One users informing them of the shutdown. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/google-one-vpn-discontinued/">9to5Google</a> also got confirmation of the shutdown from Google.</p>
<p>The Google One VPN <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-one/new-vpn-by-google-one/">launched in 2020</a> as a bonus feature for paying Google One subscribers. Google One is Google's cloud storage subscription plan that allows users to buy extra storage for Gmail, Drive, and Google Photos. In 2020, the plan was exclusive to the expensive 2TB tier for $10 a month, but later, it was brought down to all Google One tiers, including the entry-level $2-per-month option.</p>
<p>By our count, Google has <em>three</em> VPN products, though "products" might be too strong a word since they are all essentially the same thing—VPN market segments? There's the general Google One VPN for Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac—this is the one that's dying. There's also the "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.privacy.wildlife">Pixel VPN by Google One</a>," which came with Pixel phones (the "Google One" branding here makes no sense since you didn't have to subscribe to Google One) and the Google Fi VPN that's exclusive to Google Fi Android and iOS customers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016925#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016925&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Influential US Senator Sherrod Brown (D–Ohio) has called on US President Joe Biden to ban electric vehicles from Chinese brands. Brown calls Chinese EVs "an existential threat" to the US automotive industry and says that allowing imports of cheap EVs from Chinese brands "is inconsistent with a pro-worker industrial policy."</p>
<p>Brown's <a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/04112024evlettertopresidentbiden.pdf">letter to the president</a> is the most recent to sound alarms about the threat of heavily subsidized Chinese EVs moving into established markets. Brands like BYD and MG have been on sale in the European Union for some years now, and last October, the EU <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202300160">launched an anti-subsidy investigation</a> into whether the Chinese government is giving Chinese brands an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>The EU probe won't wrap until November, but another report published this week found that government subsidies for green technology companies are prevalent in China. BYD, which now sells more EVs than Tesla, has benefited from almost $4 billion (3.7 billion euro) in direct help from the Chinese government in 2022, <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/chinas-massive-subsidies-for-green-technologies/">according to a study by the Kiel Institute</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016899#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016899&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo continues to use DMCA requests to halt projects it says aid in the piracy of Switch content. Discord has shut down the discussion servers associated with two prominent Yuzu forks—<a href="https://suyu.dev/">Suyu</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sudachi-emu/sudachi">Sudachi</a>—while GitHub has removed a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/commit/f4c2c915c058e01d70d7671668b4c12a4b0e45b5">couple</a> of <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/commit/ccb374868b46ad19371d9f96cccdd6c8fc689cba">projects</a> related to the decryption of Switch software for use with emulators or hacked consoles.</p>
<p>The takedowns are the latest aftershocks from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/how-strong-is-nintendos-legal-case-against-switch-emulator-yuzu/">Nintendo's federal lawsuit against Switch emulator Yuzu</a>, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-makers-agree-to-pay-2-4-million-to-settle-nintendo-lawsuit/">led to a $2.4 million settlement</a> weeks later. Yuzu voluntarily shut down its GitHub page and Discord server as part of that settlement, though archived discussions from Discord are still accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.56980/gov.uscourts.rid.56980.10.1.pdf">That settlement</a> includes a section prohibiting the makers of Yuzu from "acting in active concert and participation" with third parties in the distribution or promotion of Yuzu or any clones that make use of its code. But there's no evidence that anyone enjoined by that settlement is actively working with Suyu or Sudachi on their projects.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016897#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016897&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>X will soon stop allowing users to hide their blue checkmarks, and some users are not happy.</p>
<p>Previously, a blue tick on Twitter was a mark of a notable account, providing some assurance to followers of the account's authenticity. But then Elon Musk decided to start charging for the blue tick instead, and mayhem ensued as a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/twitter-scammers-use-musks-paid-checkmarks-to-spread-official-looking-fake-news/">wave of imposter accounts began jokingly posing as brands</a>.</p>
<p>After that, paying for a blue checkmark began to attract derision, as non-paying users passed around a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2475688-mannequin-pointing-at-crying-mannequin-this-mf-paid-for-twitter">meme</a> under blue-checked posts, saying, "This MF paid for Twitter." To help spare paid subscribers this embarrassment, X began allowing users to hide their blue check last August, turning "hide your checkmark" into a feature of paid subscriptions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016878#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016878&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s decision to bring its latest technology to America is a big step forward for US President Joe Biden’s quest for security in the vital tech supply chain—but still leaves Washington short of being able to completely produce the most complex chips in the US.</p>
<p>The world’s biggest chipmaker by sales must also pull off an intricate balancing act as it steps up its US presence, satisfying customers such as Nvidia without damaging its highly profitable business model, which has underpinned the development of the global semiconductor industry for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>TSMC’s planned $65 billion of investments in Arizona are part of a construction race in the US that involves other global chipmakers such as Samsung and Intel, which are also taking big subsidies from Washington.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016859#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016859&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a deckbuilding game, you start out with a basic set of cards, then upgrade it over time, seeking synergies and compounding effects. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/ascii-art-permadeath-the-history-of-roguelike-games/">Roguelikes</a> are games where death happens quite often, but each randomized "run" unlocks options for the future. In both genres, and when they're fused together, the key is staying lean, trimming your deck and refining your strategy so that every card and upgrade works toward unstoppable momentum.</p>
<p>“Lean” does not describe the current scene for roguelike deckbuilder games, but they certainly have momentum. As of this writing, Steam has 2,599 titles tagged by users with “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?tags=32322">deckbuilding</a>” and 861 with “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?tags=1091588">roguelike deckbuilder</a>” in all languages, more than enough to feed a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/deckbuilders">Deckbuilders Fest</a>. The glut has left some friends and co-workers grousing that every indie game these days seems to be either a cozy farming sim or a roguelike deckbuilder.</p>
<p>I, an absolute sucker for deckbuilders for nearly five years, wanted to know why this was happening.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014427#p3">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014427&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.39 of the Rocket Report! The big news this week came from United Launch Alliance, and the final mission of its Delta IV Heavy rocket. Both Stephen and I had thoughts about this launch, which is bittersweet, and we expressed them in stories linked below. It's been a little less than 20 years since this big rocket debuted, and interesting to think how very much the launch industry has changed since then.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In October 2022, several space-based detectors picked up a powerful gamma-ray burst so energetic that astronomers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/its-the-boat-astronomers-observe-brightest-of-all-time-gamma-ray-burst/">nicknamed it the BOAT</a> (Brightest Of All Time). Now they've confirmed that the GRB came from a supernova, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy. However, they did not find evidence of heavy elements like platinum and gold one would expect from a supernova explosion, which bears on the longstanding question of the origin of such elements in the universe.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/its-the-boat-astronomers-observe-brightest-of-all-time-gamma-ray-burst/">reported previously</a>, gamma-ray bursts are extremely high-energy explosions in distant galaxies lasting between mere milliseconds to several hours. There are two classes of gamma-ray bursts. Most (70 percent) are long bursts lasting more than two seconds, often with a bright afterglow. These are usually linked to galaxies with rapid star formation. Astronomers think that long bursts are tied to the deaths of massive stars collapsing to form a neutron star or black hole (or, alternatively, a newly formed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/behold-the-magnetar-natures-ultimate-superweapon/">magnetar</a>). The baby black hole would produce jets of highly energetic particles moving near the speed of light, powerful enough to pierce through the remains of the progenitor star, emitting X-rays and gamma rays.</p>
<p>Those gamma-ray bursts lasting less than two seconds (about 30 percent) are deemed short bursts, usually emitting from regions with very little star formation. Astronomers think these gamma-ray bursts are the result of mergers between two neutron stars, or a neutron star merging with a black hole, comprising a "kilonova." That hypothesis was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.119.161101" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.119.161101" data-ml-id="1" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1712864073745bcc" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1712864073745bcc">confirmed in 2017</a> when the LIGO collaboration picked up the gravitational wave signal of two neutron stars merging, accompanied by the powerful gamma-ray bursts associated with a kilonova.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016267#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016267&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Space Force announced Thursday it is partnering with two companies, Rocket Lab and True Anomaly, for a first-of-its-kind mission to demonstrate how the military might counter "on-orbit aggression."</p>
<p>On this mission, a spacecraft built and launched by Rocket Lab will chase down another satellite made by True Anomaly, a Colorado-based startup. "The vendors will exercise a realistic threat response scenario in an on-orbit space domain awareness demonstration called Victus Haze," the Space Force's Space Systems Command said in a statement.</p>
<p>This threat scenario could involve a satellite performing maneuvers that approach a US spacecraft or a satellite doing something else unusual or unexpected. In such a scenario, the Space Force wants to have the capability to respond, either to deter an adversary from taking action or to defend a US satellite from an attack.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016629#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016629&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The complex cells that underlie animals and plants have a large collection of what are called organelles—compartments surrounded by membranes that perform specialized functions. Two of these were formed through a process called endosymbiosis, in which a once free-living organism is incorporated into a cell. These are the mitochondrion, where a former bacteria now handles the task of converting chemical energy into useful forms, and the chloroplast, where photosynthesis happens.</p>
<p>The fact that there are only a few cases of organelles that evolved through endosymbiosis suggests that it's an extremely rare event. Yet researchers may have found a new case in which an organelle devoted to fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere is in the process of evolving. The resulting organelle, termed a nitroplast, is still in the process of specialization.</p>
<h2>Getting nitrogen</h2>
<p>Nitrogen is one of the elements central to life. Every DNA base, every amino acid in a protein contains at least one, and often several, nitrogen atoms. But nitrogen is remarkably difficult for life to get ahold of. N<sub>2</sub> molecules might be extremely abundant in our atmosphere, but they're extremely difficult to break apart. The enzymes that can, called nitrogenases, are only found in bacteria, and they don't work in the presence of oxygen. Other organisms have to get nitrogen from their environment, which is one of the reasons we use so much energy to supply nitrogen fertilizers to many crops.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016827#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016827&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sketchy cosmetic injections of what seem to be counterfeit Botox are behind a multistate outbreak of botulism-like illnesses, state health officials report.</p>
<p>So far, at least six people have fallen ill in two states: <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/news/2024/4/5/tdh-investigating-cases-of-botulism-like-illness-following-cosmetic-injections.html">four in Tennessee</a> and <a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/resource-center/news/2024/april/2024-04-08---idph-alerts-healthcare-providers-to-cluster-of-illn.html">two in Illinois</a>. Four of the six people required hospitalization for their condition (two in Tennessee and both cases in Illinois).</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/botulism-botox-fake-us-states-cdc-rcna147275">reportedly planning a nationwide alert</a> to notify clinicians of the potentially counterfeit Botox and advise them to be on the lookout for botulism-like illnesses.
