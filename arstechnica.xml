<p>It's cliché to describe an Italian automaker as operating on a slower, more laid-back timetable than its rivals, but that seems to be the case with Fiat's North American product planning.</p>
<p>The outgoing Fiat 500 brought the brand back to the United States in 2011, but it had been on sale in Europe since 2007. An electric 500e arrived after the gasoline models, but as then-CEO Sergio Marchionne was quick to point out, that was only to satisfy California's zero-emission vehicle mandate.</p>
<p>Now the 500e is back, once again later than the European version (which was first shown in 2020), but this time, Fiat is skipping the gasoline engines for the line. The 2024 Fiat 500e is no compliance car—it's now the only version of this retro hatchback you can get and the only Fiat model available in the US—nor is it a mass-market item.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015720#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015720&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The final flight of United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy rocket took off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a classified spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office.</p>
<p>The Delta IV Heavy, one of the world's most powerful rockets, launched for the 16th and final time Tuesday. It was the 45th and last flight of a Delta IV launcher and the final rocket named Delta to ever launch, ending a string of 389 missions dating back to 1960.</p>
<p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) tried to launch this rocket on March 28 but aborted the countdown about four minutes prior to liftoff due to trouble with nitrogen pumps at an off-site facility at Cape Canaveral. The nitrogen is necessary for purging parts inside the Delta IV rocket before launch, reducing the risk of a fire or explosion during the countdown.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015864#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015864&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs">Peter Higgs</a>, the shy, somewhat reclusive physicist who won a Nobel Prize for his theoretical work on how the Higgs boson gives elementary particles their mass, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/apr/09/peter-higgs-physicist-who-discovered-higgs-boson-dies-aged-94">has died at the age of 94</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2024/statement-on-the-death-of-professor-peter-higgs">statement from</a> the University of Edinburgh, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/science/peter-higgs-dead.html">physicist passed</a> "peacefully at home on Monday 8 April following a short illness."</p>
<p>“Besides his outstanding contributions to particle physics, Peter was a very special person, a man of rare modesty, a great teacher and someone who explained physics in a very simple and profound way," Fabiola Gianotti, director general at CERN and former leader of one of the experiments that helped discover the Higgs particle in 2012, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/apr/09/peter-higgs-physicist-who-discovered-higgs-boson-dies-aged-94">told The Guardian</a>. "An important piece of CERN’s history and accomplishments is linked to him. I am very saddened, and I will miss him sorely.”</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/07/cern-celebrates-as-higgs-signal-reaches-significance/">a manifestation</a> of the Higgs field, an invisible entity that pervades the Universe. Interactions between the Higgs field and particles help provide particles with mass, with particles that interact more strongly having larger masses. The Standard Model of Particle Physics describes the fundamental particles that make up all matter, like quarks and electrons, as well as the particles that mediate their interactions through forces like electromagnetism and the weak force. Back in the 1960s, theorists extended the model to incorporate what has become known as the Higgs mechanism, which provides many of the particles with mass. One consequence of the Standard Model's version of the Higgs boson is that there should be a force-carrying particle, called a boson, associated with the Higgs field.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015827#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015827&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-stronger-clean-air-standards-chemical-plants">announced</a> new rules that are intended to cut emissions of two chemicals that have been linked to elevated incidence of cancer: ethylene oxide and chloroprene. While production and use of these chemicals takes place in a variety of locations, they're particularly associated with an area of petrochemical production in Louisiana that has become known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Alley">Cancer Alley</a>."</p>
<p>The new regulations would require chemical manufacturers to monitor the emissions at their facilities and take steps to repair any problems that result in elevated emissions. Despite extensive evidence linking these chemicals to elevated risk of cancer, industry groups are signaling their opposition to these regulations, and the EPA has seen two previous attempts at regulation set aside by courts.</p>
<h2>Dangerous stuff</h2>
<p>The two chemicals at issue are primarily used as intermediates in the manufacture of common products. Chloroprene, for example, is used for the production of neoprene, a synthetic rubber-like substance that's probably familiar from products like insulated sleeves and wetsuits. It's a four-carbon chain with two double-bonds that allow for polymerization and an attached chlorine that alters its chemical properties.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015882#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015882&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Google's "video editor" feels more like a souped-up version of Google Slides. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap">





<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
  <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">
          <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eIy6lVihbf-980x551.png" alt=""></div>
          <p>
            Is that Google Slides? Nope it's Google Vids, the new video editor that seems to just make souped-up slideshows.                           [credit:
                              Google                            ]
                      </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>If you had asked me before what Google's video editor app was, I would say "YouTube Studio," but now Google Workspace has a new productivity app called "Google Vids." Normally a video editor is considered a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/clipchamp">secondary application</a> in many productivity suites, but Google apparently imagines Vids as a major pillar of Workspace, saying Vids is an "all-in-one video creation app for work that will sit alongside Docs, Sheets and Slides." So, that is an editor for documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and videos?</p>
<p>Google's demo of the new video editor pitches the product not for YouTube videos or films but more as a corporate super slideshow for things like training materials or product demos. Really, this "video editor" almost looks like it could completely replace Google Slides since the interface is just Slides but with a video timeline instead of a slideshow timeline.</p>
<p>Google's example video creates a "sales training video" that starts with a Slides presentation as the basic outline. You start with an outline editor, where each slideshow page gets its own major section. Google then has video "styles" you can pick from, which all seem very Powerpoint-y with a big title, subheading, and a slot for some kind of video. Google then wants you to write a script and either read it yourself or have a text-to-speech voice <em>read</em> the script. A "stock media" library lets you fill in some of those video slots with generic corporate imagery like a video of a sunset, choose background music, and use a few pictures. You can also fire up your webcam and record something, sort of like a pre-canned Zoom meeting. After that it's a lot of the usual Google productivity app features: real-time editing collaboration with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/google-slides-adds-live-collaborative-mouse-pointers/">visible mouse cursors</a> from each participant and a stream of comments.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015804#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015804&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As many as 91,000 LG TVs face the risk of being commandeered unless they receive a just-released security update patching four critical vulnerabilities discovered late last year.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities are found in four LG TV models that collectively comprise slightly more than 88,000 units around the world, <a href="https://www.shodan.io/search?query=product%3A%22LG+webOs+TV%22">according to</a> results returned by the Shodan search engine for Internet-connected devices. The vast majority of those units are located in South Korea, followed by Hong Kong, the US, Sweden, and Finland. The models are:</p>

<p>A report published today describes how Russia obtained Starlink terminals for its war in Ukraine despite US sanctions and SpaceX's insistence that Russia hasn't bought the terminals either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/telecom/starlink-musk-ukraine-russia-sudan-satellite-communications-technology-f4fc79d9">report</a> describes black market sales to Russians and a Sudanese paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently determined that the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/dec-06-2023-designation-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity-committed-sudan">committed war crimes</a> and are responsible for ethnic cleansing in Darfur.</p>
<p>The WSJ said it "tracked Starlink sales on numerous Russian online retail platforms," "interviewed Russian and Sudanese middlemen and resellers, and followed Russian volunteer groups that deliver SpaceX hardware to the front line."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015840#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015840&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1777413085843570940">predicted</a> the imminent rise in AI superintelligence during a live interview streamed on the social media platform X. "My guess is we'll have AI smarter than any one human probably around the end of next year," Musk said in his <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/no/podcast/in-good-company-with-nicolai-tangen/id1614211565?i=1000651843541">conversation</a> with hedge fund manager <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolai_Tangen">Nicolai Tangen</a>.</p>
<p>Just prior to that, Tangen had asked Musk, "What's your take on where we are in the AI race just now?" Musk told Tangen that AI "is the fastest advancing technology I've seen of any kind, and I've seen a lot of technology." He described computers dedicated to AI increasing in capability by "a factor of 10 every year, if not every six to nine months."</p>

<p>Musk made the prediction with an asterisk, saying that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/openai-may-jump-into-ai-hardware-amid-high-costs-supply-constraints/">shortages of AI chips</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/artificial-intelligences-insatiable-energy-needs-not-sustainable-arm-ceo-says-a11218c9?mod=rss_Technology">high AI power demands</a> could limit AI's capability until those issues are resolved. “Last year, it was chip-constrained,” Musk told Tangen. “People could not get enough Nvidia chips. This year, it’s transitioning to a voltage transformer supply. In a year or two, it’s just electricity supply.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015706#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015706&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you own a recent high-end Intel desktop CPU and you've been running into weird game crashes lately, you're not alone.</p>
<p>Scattered reports from Core i9-13900K and i9-14900K users over the last couple of months have pointed to processor power usage as a possible source of crashes even in relatively undemanding games like <em>Fortnite</em>. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/outpost-infinity-siege-devs-ask-13900k-14900k-owners-to-downclock-their-chips-to-prevent-crashing">Games like</a> <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, <em>Remnant 2</em>, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em>, <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em>, and <em>Outpost: Infinity Siege</em> have also <a href="https://twitter.com/Sebasti66855537/status/1760034497045623121">reportedly</a> been <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/outpost-infinity-siege-devs-ask-13900k-14900k-owners-to-downclock-their-chips-to-prevent-crashing">affected</a>; the problem primarily seems to affect titles made with Epic's Unreal Engine. Intel said in a statement to <a href="https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20240408160200">ZDNet Korea</a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation">The Verge</a>) that it's looking into the problems, escalating it from an "isolated issue" to something that may be more widespread and could require a more systemic fix.</p>

<p>Related CPUs like the i9-13900KF, i9-14900KF, i9-13900KS, and i9-14900KS may be affected, too, since they're all the same basic silicon. Some user reports have also indicated that the i7-13700K and i7-14700K series may also be affected.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015702#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015702&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More than 2,000 older Swiss women have won a landmark European case proving that government climate inaction violates human rights.</p>
<p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#%7B%22languageisocode%22:%5B%22ENG%22%5D,%22appno%22:%5B%2253600/20%22%5D,%22documentcollectionid2%22:%5B%22GRANDCHAMBER%22%5D,%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-233206%22%5D%7D">ruled</a> Tuesday that Switzerland had not acted urgently to achieve climate targets, leading victims, who are mostly in their 70s, to suffer physically and emotionally while potentially placed at risk of dying.</p>
<p>The women, part of a group called KlimaSeniorinnen (Senior Women for Climate Protection), filed the lawsuit nine years ago. They presented medical documents and scientific evidence that older women are more vulnerable to climate impacts, arguing that "their health and daily routines were affected" by Swiss heatwaves connected to climate change.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015786#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015786&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beeper, the multinetwork messaging app that recently gave up on trying to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/beepers-esoteric-fix-for-imessage-access-suggests-why-its-pushing-politically/">engineer around Apple's walled-off iMessage service</a>, has been <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-joining-automattic/">acquired by Automattic</a>, the company behind WordPress. It is now open to everyone and has a completely revamped Android app.</p>
<p>All of Beeper's workers will join <a href="https://automattic.com/about/">Automattic</a> and will continue operating as an independent team, according to a press release. Eric Migicovsky, creator of the Pebble smartwatch and co-founder of Beeper, will become Automattic's head of messaging. Beeper and <a href="http://texts.com">Texts.com</a>, acquired last year by Automattic, will work together.</p>
<p>Given that Texts.com provides a similar "all your chats in one place" function but also an iMessage bridge using an app you run on your own Apple computers, it's likely that Beeper and Texts will consolidate into one platform that more closely hews to the "all" part of the companies' mission statements.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015698#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015698&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Aruba has long been a special place for Stacy Argondizzo. For years, her family has vacationed on the tiny Caribbean Island every July. More recently it’s been more than just a place to take a break from her work as a digital archivist—becoming wholly a part of that work.</p>
<p>A project Argondizzo galvanized comes to full fruition this week. The Internet Archive is now home to the <a href="https://coleccion.aw/">Aruba Collection</a>, which hosts digitized versions of Aruba’s National Library, National Archives, and other institutions including an archaeology museum and the University of Aruba. The collection comprises 101,376 items so far—roughly one for each person who lives on the Island—including 40,000 documents, 60,000 images, and seven 3D objects.</p>

<p>Yesterday, trial was due to begin in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-goes-on-trial-for-apple-engineers-fatal-2018-autopilot-crash/">the case of <em>Huang v. Tesla</em></a>, a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of a man killed in his Tesla Model X in 2018. But the case will now not be heard by a judge—Tesla has settled with the family for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Walter Huang was driving to work in his Model X on March 23, 2018, when his car drove headlong into a concrete divider at an exit on US Highway 101 in California. Tesla's partially automated driving system, Autopilot, was active at the time, and Huang trusted it enough to play video games on his phone despite having noticed that the car got confused at that particular intersection more than once.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board investigated Huang's death and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/02/ntsb-blasts-tesla-caltrans-and-nhtsa-for-autopilot-death/">published its findings in 2020</a>. The NTSB found plenty of parties to blame. Tesla's misleading marketing of Autopilot, such as video interviews where the Tesla CEO operated the system <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-autopilot-60-minutes-interview/">without keeping his hands or eyes on the road</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/musk-oversaw-staged-tesla-self-driving-video-emails-show/">a staged self-driving demonstration</a> contributed to Huang's mistaken trust in Autopilot.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015691#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015691&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."</em></p>
<p>The steady rhythm of the night-day, dark-light progression is a phenomenon acknowledged in ancient sacred texts as a given. When it's interrupted, people take notice. In the days leading up to the eclipse, excitement within the Ars Orbiting HQ grew, and plans to experience the last total eclipse in the continental United States until 2045 were made. Here's what we saw across the country.</p>

<p>Most of the time, when kids accidentally gulp down a non-edible object, it travels toward the stomach. In the best-case scenarios for these unfortunate events, it's a small, benign object that safely sees itself out in a day or two. But in the worst-case scenarios, it can go down an entirely different path.</p>
<p>That was the case for a poor teen in California, who somehow swallowed a quarter. The quarter didn’t head down the esophagus and toward the stomach, but veered into the airway, sliding past the vocal cords like they were a vending-machine coin slot.</p>

<p>We've come a long way since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/riffusions-ai-generates-music-from-text-using-visual-sonograms/">primitive AI music generators</a> in 2022. Today, AI tools like <a href="https://www.suno.ai/">Suno.ai</a> allow any series of words to become song lyrics, including inside jokes (as you'll see below). On Wednesday, prompt engineer Riley Goodside <a href="https://x.com/goodside/status/1775713487529922702">tweeted</a> an AI-generated song created with the prompt "sad girl with piano performs the text of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a>," and it began to circulate widely in the AI community online.</p>
<p>The MIT License is a famous permissive software license created in the late 1980s, frequently used in open source projects. "My favorite part of this is ~1:25 it nails 'WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY' with a beautiful Imogen Heap-style glissando then immediately pronounces 'FITNESS' as 'fistiff,'" Goodside <a href="https://x.com/goodside/status/1775736282586427632">wrote</a> on X.</p>

<p>Suno (which means "listen" in Hindi) was formed in 2023 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It's the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/20/suno-gen-ai-music-microsoft">brainchild</a> of Michael Shulman, Georg Kucsko, Martin Camacho, and Keenan Freyberg, who formerly worked at companies like Meta and TikTok. Suno has already attracted big-name partners, such as Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24008279/microsoft-copilot-suno-ai-music-generator-extension">announced</a> the integration of an earlier version of the Suno engine into Bing Chat last December. Today, Suno is on v3 of its model, which can create temporally coherent two-minute songs in many different genres.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015379#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015379&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Former Apple design lead Jony Ive and current OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are seeking funding for a new company that will produce an "artificial intelligence-powered personal device," according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jony-ive-and-sam-altmans-ai-device-startup-in-funding-talks-with-emerson-thrive">The Information</a>'s sources, who are said to be familiar with the plans.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the device is unknown, but it will not look anything like a smartphone, according to the sources. We first heard tell of this venture in the fall of 2023, but The Information's story reveals that talks are moving forward to get the company off the ground.</p>
<p>Ive and Altman hope to raise at least $1 billion for the new company. The complete list of potential funding sources they've spoken with is unknown, but The Information's sources say they are in talks with frequent OpenAI investor Thrive Capital as well as Emerson Collective, a venture capital firm founded by Laurene Powell Jobs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015528#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015528&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission chair decided not to impose Universal Service fees on Internet service, rejecting arguments for new assessments to shore up an FCC fund that subsidizes broadband network expansions and provides discounts to low-income consumers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/027-5183">$8 billion-a-year</a> Universal Service Fund (USF) pays for FCC programs such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/poor-americans-will-get-9-a-month-to-buy-broadband-or-mobile-data/">Lifeline</a> discounts and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/internet-providers-that-won-fcc-grants-try-to-escape-broadband-commitments/">Rural Digital Opportunity Fund</a> deployment grants for ISPs. Phone companies must <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/contribution-methodology-administrative-filings">pay a percentage</a> of their revenue into the fund, and telcos generally pass those fees on to consumers with a "Universal Service" line item on telephone bills.</p>
<p>Imposing similar assessments on broadband could increase the Universal Service Fund's size and/or reduce the charges on phone service, spreading the burden more evenly across different types of telecommunications services. Some consumer advocates want the FCC to increase the fund in order to replace the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), a different government program that gives $30 monthly broadband discounts to people with low incomes but is about to run out of money because of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/fcc-to-halt-sign-ups-for-internet-discounts-as-republicans-threaten-funding/">inaction by Congress</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015506#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015506&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hackers are actively exploiting a pair of recently discovered vulnerabilities to remotely commandeer network-attached storage devices manufactured by D-Link, researchers said Monday.</p>
<p>Roughly 92,000 devices are vulnerable to the remote takeover exploits, which can be remotely transmitted by sending malicious commands through simple HTTP traffic. The vulnerability <a href="https://github.com/netsecfish/dlink">came to light</a> two weeks ago. The researcher said they were making the threat public because D-Link said it had no plans to patch the vulnerabilities, which are present only in end-of-life devices, meaning they are no longer supported by the manufacturer.</p>
<h2>An ideal recipe</h2>
