<p>In recent years, the Arctic has become a magnet for <a href="https://sustainability.yale.edu/explainers/yale-experts-explain-climate-anxiety">climate change anxiety</a>, with scientists nervously <a href="https://nsidc.org/ice-sheets-today">monitoring the Greenland ice sheet</a> for signs of melting and <a href="https://undark.org/2023/09/26/arctic-lakes-carbon/">fretting</a> over rampant <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/wwii-era-arctic-military-base-polluting-greenland-1.3756786">environmental degradation</a>. It wasn’t always that way.</p>
<p>At the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, as the fear of nuclear Armageddon hung over American and Soviet citizens, ­idealistic scientists and engineers saw the vast Arctic region as a place of unlimited potential for creating a bold new future. Greenland emerged as the most tantalizing proving ground for their research.</p>
<p>Scientists and engineers working for and with the US military cooked up a rash of audacious cold-region projects—some innovative, many spit-balled, and most quickly abandoned. They were the stuff of science fiction: disposing of nuclear waste by letting it melt through the ice; moving people, supplies, and missiles below the ice using subways, some perhaps atomic powered; testing hovercraft to zip over impassable crevasses; making furniture from a frozen mix of ice and soil; and even building a nuclear-powered city under the ice sheet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048154#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048154&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As our climate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/the-climate-is-changing-so-fast-that-we-havent-seen-how-bad-extreme-weather-could-get/">warms beyond its historical range</a>, scientists increasingly need to study climates deeper in the planet’s past to get <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aay3701">information about our future</a>. One object of study is a warming event known as the Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO) from about 17 to 15 million years ago. It coincided with floods of basalt lava that covered a large area of the Northwestern US, creating what are called the “Columbia River Basalts.” This timing suggests that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL096519">volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> was the cause</a> of the warming.</p>
<p>Those eruptions were the most recent example of a “Large Igneous Province,” a phenomenon that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/when-will-the-earth-try-to-kill-us-again/">repeatedly triggered climate upheavals</a> and mass extinctions throughout Earth’s past. The Miocene version was relatively benign; it saw <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aba6853">CO<sub>2</sub> levels</a> and global temperatures rise, causing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018218308332">ecosystem changes</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X24002577">significant melting of Antarctic ice,</a> but didn’t trigger a mass extinction.</p>
<p>A paper <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52255.1/645502/High-precision-U-Pb-geochronology-for-the-Miocene">just published in Geology</a>, led by <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/dr-jennifer-kasbohm">Jennifer Kasbohm</a> of the Carnegie Science’s Earth and Planets Laboratory, upends the idea that the eruptions triggered the warming while still blaming them for the <em>peak</em> climate warmth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047424#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047424&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Roughly 70 percent of 22,000 people polled online earlier this year agreed that human activities were pushing the Earth past “<a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Space_for_our_climate/Understanding_climate_tipping_points" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tipping points</a>,” thresholds beyond which nature cannot recover, like loss of the Amazon rainforest or collapse of the <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_currents/05conveyor2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlantic Ocean’s currents</a>.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Boeing's Starliner spacecraft sailed to a smooth landing in the New Mexico desert Friday night, an auspicious end to an otherwise disappointing three-month test flight that left the capsule's two-person crew stuck in orbit until next year.</p>
<p>Cushioned by airbags, the Boeing crew capsule descended under three parachutes toward an on-target landing at 10:01 pm local time Friday (12:01 am EDT Saturday) at White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico. From the outside, the landing appeared just as it would have if the spacecraft brought home NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who became the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-successful-launch-boeings-starliner-runs-into-more-helium-leaks/">first people to launch on a Starliner capsule on June 5</a>.</p>
<p>But Starliner's cockpit was empty as it flew back to Earth Friday night. Last month, NASA managers decided to keep Wilmore and Williams on the International Space Station (ISS) until next year after agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/">officials determined it was too risky for the astronauts to return to the ground on Boeing's spaceship</a>. Instead of coming home on Starliner, Wilmore and Williams will fly back to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft in February. NASA has incorporated the Starliner duo into the space station's long-term crew.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048167#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048167&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The three princes of Sarandib—an ancient Persian name for Sri Lanka—get exiled by their father the king. They are good boys, but he wants them to experience the wider world and its peoples and be tested by them before they take over the kingdom. They meet a cameleer who has lost his camel and tell him they’ve seen it—though they have not—and prove it by describing three noteworthy characteristics of the animal: it is blind in one eye, it has a tooth missing, and it has a lame leg.</p>
<p>After some hijinks the camel is found, and the princes are correct. How could they have known? They used their keen observational skills to notice unusual things, and their wit to interpret those observations to reveal a truth that was not immediately apparent.</p>
<p>It is a very old tale, sometimes involving an elephant or a horse instead of a camel. But this is the version written by Amir Khusrau in Delhi in 1301 in his poem <i>The Eight Tales of Paradise</i>, and this is the version that one Christopher the Armenian clumsily translated into the Venetian novel <i>The Three Princes of Serendip</i>, published in 1557; a publication that, in a roundabout way, brought the word “serendipity” into the English language.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047035#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047035&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A person in Missouri with no reported exposure to animals was confirmed to have been infected with H5-type bird flu, <a href="https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/0ca9d648-cb9b-4eca-99a8-f9a1c96a01bd/human-h5-bird-flu-case-confirmed-in-missouri?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (MDHSS) announced late Friday</a>.</p>
<p>MDHSS reported that the person, who has underlying medical conditions, was hospitalized on August 22 and tested positive for an influenza A virus. Further testing at the state's public health laboratory indicated that the influenza A virus was an H5-type bird flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now confirmed that finding and is carrying out further testing to determine if it is the H5N1 strain currently causing a widespread outbreak among US dairy cows.</p>
<p>It remains unclear if the person's bird flu infection was the cause of the hospitalization or if the infection was discovered incidentally. The person has since recovered and was discharged from the hospital. In its announcement, MDHSS said no other information about the patient will be released to protect the person's privacy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048150#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048150&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Boeing's Starliner spacecraft will gently back away from the International Space Station Friday evening, then fire its balky thrusters to rapidly depart the vicinity of the orbiting lab and its nine-person crew.</p>
<p>NASA asked Boeing to adjust Starliner's departure sequence to get away from the space station faster and reduce the workload on the thrusters to reduce the risk of overheating, which caused some of the control jets to drop offline as the spacecraft approached the outpost for docking in June.</p>
<p>The action begins at 6:04 pm EDT (22:04 UTC) on Friday, when hooks in the docking mechanism connecting Starliner with the International Space Station (ISS) will open, and springs will nudge the spacecraft away its mooring on the forward end of the massive research complex.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048125#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048125&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA and Blue Origin <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/escapade/2024/09/06/nasa-stands-down-from-october-launch-for-escapade-to-mars/">announced Friday</a> that they have agreed to delay the launch of the ESCAPADE mission to Mars until at least the spring of 2025.</p>
<p>The decision to stand down from a launch attempt in mid-October was driven by a deadline to begin loading hypergolic propellant on the two small ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) spacecraft. While it is theoretically possible to offload fuel from these vehicles for a future launch attempt, multiple sources told Ars that such an activity would incur significant risk to the spacecraft.</p>
<p>Forced to make a call on whether to fuel, NASA decided not to. Although the two spacecraft were otherwise ready for launch, it was not clear the New Glenn rocket would be similarly ready to go.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048029#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048029&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Researchers have discovered more than 280 malicious apps for Android that use optical character recognition to steal cryptocurrency wallet credentials from infected devices.</p>
<p>The apps masquerade as official ones from banks, government services, TV streaming services, and utilities. In fact, they scour infected phones for text messages, contacts, and all stored images and surreptitiously send them to remote servers controlled by the app developers. The apps are available from malicious sites and are distributed in phishing messages sent to targets. There’s no indication that any of the apps were available through Google Play.</p>
<h2>A high level of sophistication</h2>
<p>The most notable thing about the newly discovered malware campaign is that the threat actors behind it are employing optical character recognition software in an attempt to extract cryptocurrency wallet credentials that are shown in images stored on infected devices. Many wallets allow users to protect their wallets with a series of random words. The mnemonic credentials are easier for most people to remember than the jumble of characters that appear in the private key. Words are also easier for humans to recognize in images.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047970#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047970&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to the complaint, the New Mexico Department of Justice launched an undercover investigation in recent months to prove that Snapchat "is a primary social media platform for sharing child sexual abuse material (CSAM)" and sextortion of minors, because its "algorithm serves up children to adult predators."</p>
<p>As part of their probe, an investigator "set up a decoy account for a 14-year-old girl, Sexy14Heather."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047932#p3">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047932&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While supplies of Adderall and its generic versions are finally recovering after a yearslong shortage, the Drug Enforcement Administration is now working to curb the short supply of another drug for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) and its generic versions.</p>

The DEA also allowed for a corresponding increase in d-amphetamine, which is needed for production of lisdexamfetamine.</p>
<p>"These adjustments are necessary to ensure that the United States has an adequate and uninterrupted supply of lisdexamfetamine to meet legitimate patient needs both domestically and globally," the DEA said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047969#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047969&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>China plans to launch two heavy-lift Long March 5 rockets with elements of the Tianwen-3 Mars sample return mission in 2028, the mission's chief designer said Thursday.</p>
<p>In a presentation at a Chinese space exploration conference, the chief designer of China's robotic Mars sample return project described the mission's high-level design and outlined how the mission will collect samples from the Martian surface. Reports from the talk published on Chinese social media and by state-run news agencies were short on technical details and did not discuss any of the preparations for the mission.</p>
<p>Public pronouncements by Chinese officials on future space missions typically come true, but China is embarking on challenging efforts to explore the Moon and Mars. China aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030 in a step toward eventually building a Moon base called the International Lunar Research Station.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047760#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047760&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A leak of data from Disney points to the Disney+ streaming service making about $2.4 billion in revenue in its fiscal quarter ending on March 30. Disney doesn't normally share how much revenue its individual streaming services generate, making this figure particularly interesting.</p>
<h2>Leaked data</h2>
<p>In August, Disney <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000232/dis-20240629.htm">confirmed</a> that it was investigating the leak of "over a terabyte of data from one of the communication systems" it uses. In a report this week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/leaked-disney-data-reveals-financial-and-strategy-secrets-56573020">The Wall Street Journal</a> (WSJ) said it looked over files leaked by a hacking group called Nullbulge that include "a range of financial and strategy information," apparent login credentials for parts of Disney's cloud infrastructure, and more. The leak includes over "44 million messages from Disney’s Slack workplace communications tool, upward of 18,800 spreadsheets, and at least 13,000 PDFs," WSJ said.</p>
<p>"We decline to comment on unverified information The Wall Street Journal has purportedly obtained as a result of a bad actor’s illegal activity,” a Disney spokesperson told WSJ.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047904#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047904&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The cost of renting cloud services using Nvidia’s leading artificial intelligence chips is lower in China than in the US, a sign that the advanced processors are easily reaching the Chinese market despite Washington’s export restrictions.</p>
<p>Four small-scale Chinese cloud providers charge local tech groups roughly $6 an hour to use a server with eight Nvidia A100 processors in a base configuration, companies and customers told the Financial Times. Small cloud vendors in the US charge about $10 an hour for the same setup.</p>
<p>The low prices, according to people in the AI and cloud industry, are an indication of plentiful supply of Nvidia chips in China and the circumvention of US measures designed to prevent access to cutting-edge technologies.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047945#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047945&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, in his first public comments since being arrested by French authorities, said that Telegram is not an "anarchic paradise" but promised that the platform will enhance its moderation of harmful content.</p>
<p>While Telegram has room for improvement, "the claims in some media that Telegram is some sort of anarchic paradise are absolutely untrue," <a href="https://t.me/durov/342">Durov wrote</a> on Telegram yesterday. "We take down millions of harmful posts and channels every day. We publish daily transparency reports (like <a href="http://t.me/stopCA">this</a> or <a href="https://t.me/isiswatch">this</a>).

<p>You can't just <em>ask</em> the Internet to vote on something and assume you'll get a "normal" result.</p>
<p>The town of Fort Wayne, Indiana, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna41480994#.WwzTfdMvzVp">learned this the hard way</a> in 2011, when an online vote to name a new government center in town went with "Harry Baals." Though Mr. Baals was in fact a respected former mayor of the town back in the 1930s, contemporary officials weren't convinced that his name was chosen out of merely historical interest.</p>
<p>Or there was the time in 2015 when the British Columbia Ferry Service asked Internet users to name its newest ships and perhaps win a $500 prize.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Hyundai's transformation over the past decade and a half has been one to watch. The automaker went on a hiring spree, luring design and engineering talent away from the likes of BMW and Audi to grow its own competency in these areas. It worked—few can rival the efficiency or charging speed of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/everything-we-know-about-hyundai-and-kias-new-electric-vehicle-platform/">current crop of Korean electric vehicles</a>, for instance. And Hyundai's N division has shown it can turn <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/the-2021-hyundai-veloster-n-sometimes-america-does-get-the-good-one/">prosaic underpinnings</a> into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-refreshed-2024-hyundai-elantra-n-remains-a-darn-good-enthusiast-car/">performance cars</a> that push all the right buttons. Both of those things are on vivid display with the Ioniq 5 N.</p>
<p>The regular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/">Ioniq 5</a> has been on sale for a while now, long enough to have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/hyundai-ioniq-5s-will-be-made-in-usa-with-native-tesla-style-ports/">just received a facelift</a>. It's one of our favorite EVs, with styling that calls back to the angular hatchbacks of the 1980s and an 800 V powertrain that's easily best-in-class. Now, the company's in-house tuners have had their way with it, applying lessons learned from rallying and touring car racing to up the fun factor.</p>
<p>It's not exactly a novel approach, even for EVs. Kia beat Hyundai to the punch with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/the-2023-ev6-gt-we-determine-its-fun-formula/">the EV6 GT</a>; the car is fearsomely fast, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/an-electric-kia-thats-faster-than-a-lamborghini-the-2023-ev6-gt-driven/">I found it less compelling</a> than the normal version, which is cheaper, less powerful, and more efficient. In fact, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/looking-for-a-new-ev-dont-get-suckered-by-the-top-of-the-line-model/">I'm on record</a> as saying that when looking at EVs, the cheapest, least-powerful version is almost always the one to get.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047845#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047845&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One issue in getting office buildings networked that you don't typically face at home is concrete—and lots of it. Concrete walls are an average of 8 inches thick inside most commercial real estate.</p>
<p>Keeping a network running through them is not merely a matter of running cord. Not everybody has the knowledge or tools to punch through that kind of wall. Even if they do, you can't just put a hole in something that might be load-bearing or part of a fire control system without imaging, permits, and contractors. The bandwidths that can work through these walls, like 3G, are being phased out, and the bandwidths that provide enough throughput for modern systems, like 5G, can't make it through.</p>
<p>That's what <a href="https://airvine.com/introducing-wavecore-wireless-gigabit-backbone-from-airvine/">WaveCore, from Airvine Scientific</a>, aims to fix, and I can't help but find it fascinating after <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/06/wavecore_can_beam_a_gigabit/">originally seeing it on The Register</a>. The company had previously taken on lesser solid obstructions, like plaster and thick glass, with its <a href="https://airvine.com/products/wavetunnel/">WaveTunnel</a>. Two WaveCore units on either side of a wall (or on different floors) can push through a stated 12 inches of concrete. In their in-house testing, Airvine reports pushing just under 4Gbps through 12 inches of garage concrete, and it can bend around corners, even 90 degrees. Your particular cement and aggregate combinations may vary, of course.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047825#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047825&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More so than most other forms of bicycle, cargo bikes are specifically designed to make ditching a car easier. Whether hauling groceries or kids, they can handle a lot more of the day-to-day errand running than most other forms of two-wheeled transport. The problem with some of the higher-end cargo bikes is that the upfront costs can be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/haul-it-all-treks-latest-e-bike-offering-is-a-cargo-bike/3/">competitive with a decent used car</a> (although operating costs will be dramatically lower) without offering quite the flexibility that a car might.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as Beth Mole discovered, you don't necessarily have to spend that much to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/a-cycling-newb-tries-a-cargo-e-bike-the-user-friendly-maven/">a decent riding experience</a>, putting cars at a further disadvantage. That left me curious as to what the price floor for a decent cargo bike might be—how little can you pay and still get a satisfactory experience? I was also keen for a second try on my experiment of going a month without using a car, meant to happen during my earlier review but interrupted by wildfire smoke.</p>
<p>All of which explains why I took delivery of a $1,500 cargo bike <a href="https://www.cycrown.com/products/cycwagen-dual-battery-cargo-ebike">called the CycWagon</a>, from a company called Cycrown. It's currently well on its way toward getting me through a car-free month, but it has... well, a lot of issues.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044077#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044077&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.10 of the Rocket Report! It has been a big week for seeing new hardware from Blue Origin. We've observed the second stage of New Glenn rolling out to its launch pad in Florida, and the rocket's first stage recovery ship, Jacklyn, arriving at a nearby port. It looks like the pieces are finally coming into place for the debut launch of the massive new rocket.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Vega rocket makes its final flight</strong>. The final flight of Europe's Vega rocket lifted off Wednesday night from French Guiana, carrying an important environmental monitoring satellite for the European Union's flagship Copernicus program, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/09/the-vega-rocket-never-found-its-commercial-niche-after-tonight-its-gone/">Ars reports</a>. About an hour after liftoff, the Vega rocket's upper stage released Sentinel-2C into an on-target orbit. Then, Sentinel-2C radioed its status to ground controllers, confirming the satellite was healthy in space. The Vega rocket will be replaced by the larger Vega-C rocket, with a more powerful booster stage and a wider payload fairing. One of the primary purposes of the Vega-C will be to launch future Copernicus satellites for Europe.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047432#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047432&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
