      <p><em>Welcome to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/daily-telescope/">Daily Telescope</a>. There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>

<p>Good morning. It's May 21, and today's photo comes from the James Webb Space Telescope. It showcases the coming together of two massive black holes in the early Universe, just 740 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Each of the black holes has an estimated mass of roughly 50 million times the mass of our star, the Sun. The discovery of this merger so early in the Universe indicates that the growth of these objects in the centers of galaxies occurred very rapidly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025716#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025716&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Federal authorities have arrested a 23-year-old Taiwanese national and charged him with running an online market that sold $100 million worth of illicit narcotics, including fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, LSD, and ketamine.</p>
<p>The authorities said that for almost four years, Rui-Siang Lin operated and owned the Incognito Market, an online marketplace on the dark web that users worldwide visited to buy and sell illegal narcotics. The marketplace facilitated transactions with many of the same features provided by legitimate e-commerce sites, including buyer and user registration, branding, advertising, and customer service. When registered buyers visited the site using the Tor browser, they were presented with the following graphic:</p>

<p>The site allowed buyers to search through thousands of listings for narcotics of their choice. It opened in October 2020 and, as <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/incognito-darknet-market-mass-extorts-buyers-sellers/">reported</a> by KrebsOnSecurity, closed last March when its operators extorted both buyers and sellers of fees ranging from $100 to $2,000 in exchange for not revealing text messages and transaction records showing their participation in the marketplace. In the 41 months that Incognito Market was open, it facilitated the sale of more than $100 million of narcotics. By June 2023, the site was generating sales of $5 million per month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025786#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025786&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI has paused a voice mode option for ChatGPT-4o, Sky, after backlash accusing the AI company of intentionally ripping off Scarlett Johansson's critically acclaimed voice-acting performance in the 2013 sci-fi film <em>Her</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://openai.com/index/how-the-voices-for-chatgpt-were-chosen/">blog</a> defending its casting decision for Sky, OpenAI went into great detail explaining its process for choosing the individual voice options for its chatbot. But ultimately, the company seemed pressed to admit that Sky's voice was just too similar to Johansson's to keep using it, at least for now.</p>
<p>"We believe that AI voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity's distinctive voice—Sky’s voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice," OpenAI's blog said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025464#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025464&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Just a couple of years ago, companies like Nvidia were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/500-hz-asus-monitor-promises-fewer-visual-artifacts-less-latency-than-ever/">talking up prototype 500 Hz gaming monitors</a> as having "benefits [for] every game and gamer, not just competitive games and esports pros." Now, the high frame rate experts at Blur Busters <a href="https://blurbusters.com/displayweek-2024-news-4k-1000hz-monitor-exhibited-and-new-blur-busters-display-tester/">bring word</a> of a 4K, 1,000 Hz prototype screen being shown off by <a href="https://en.tclcsot.com/">Chinese panel-maker TCL CSOT</a> at <a href="https://www.displayweek.org/">the manufacturer-focused DisplayWeek 2024 conference</a>.</p>
<p>TCL's proof-of-concept panel is all the more impressive for not sacrificing resolution in the name of its high frame rate—many current 480 Hz monitors tend to top out at 1080p resolutions or offer "dual mode" options for higher resolutions at lower maximum refresh rates. And while <a href="https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?t=8388#p64988">recent advancements in pixel-flipping times</a> have enabled TCL's LCD prototype, Blur Busters estimates that 1,000 Hz OLED displays could be commercialized as soon as 2027.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The apparent impending breaking of the four-digit refresh rate threshold got us thinking: Are we finally approaching a point of diminishing returns in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/480-hz-desktop-laptop-displays-teased-by-pc-panel-pusher-auo/">monitor-makers' long-running battle of the Hz</a>? Or is 1,000 Hz just the latest stepping stone to realms of motion smoothness yet unimagined by most gamers?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025737#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025737&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If things work out as hoped, brain implants will ultimately restore communication for those who have become paralyzed due to injury or disease. But we're a long way from that future, and the implants are currently limited to testing in clinical trials.</p>
<p>One of those clinical trials, based at the University of California, San Francisco, has now inadvertently revealed something about how the brain handles language, because one of the patients enrolled in the trial was bilingual, using English and Spanish. By tracking activity in the area of the brain where the intention to speak gets translated into control over the vocal tract, researchers found that both languages produce consistent signals in this area, so training the system to pick up English phrases would help improve its recognition of Spanish.</p>
<h2>Making some noise</h2>
<p>Understanding bilingualism is obviously useful for understanding how the brain handles language in general. The new paper describing the work also points out that restoring communications in multiple languages should be a goal for restoring communications to people. Bilingual people will often change languages based on different social situations or sometimes do so within a sentence in order to express themselves more clearly. They often describe bilingual abilities as a key component of their personalities.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025698#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025698&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>At a Build conference event on Monday, Microsoft revealed a new AI-powered feature called "Recall" for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">Copilot+ PCs</a> that will allow Windows 11 users to search and retrieve their past activities on their PC. To make it work, Recall records everything users do on their PC, including activities in apps, communications in live meetings, and websites visited for research. Despite encryption and local storage, the new feature raises privacy concerns for certain Windows users.</p>

<p>"Recall uses Copilot+ PC advanced processing capabilities to take images of your active screen every few seconds," Microsoft says on its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/copilot-plus-pcs">website</a>. "The snapshots are encrypted and saved on your PC’s hard drive. You can use Recall to locate the content you have viewed on your PC using search or on a timeline bar that allows you to scroll through your snapshots."</p>
<p>By performing a Recall action, users can access a snapshot from a specific time period, providing context for the event or moment they are searching for. It also allows users to search through teleconference meetings they've participated in and videos watched using an AI-powered feature that transcribes and translates speech.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025690#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025690&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has announced a pair of new devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors. They're far from Microsoft's first PCs with Arm processors in them—2012's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/microsofts-first-stab-at-a-pc-surface-reviewed/">original Surface</a>, the Surface Pro X, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/surface-pro-9-comes-in-both-intel-and-arm-flavors-absorbing-the-surface-pro-x/">Surface Pro 9 with 5G</a> have all shipped with Arm's chips instead of Intel's or AMD's. But today's new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are the first Arm devices to be the <em>primary</em> Surface offerings rather than a side offering, and they're the first to credibly claim that they can both outperform comparable Intel- and AMD-designed chips while offering better battery life, a la Apple's M1 chip in 2020.</p>
<p>One caveat that I hadn't seen mentioned in Microsoft's presentation or in other coverage of the announcement, though—Microsoft says that both of these devices have fans. Apple still uses fans for the MacBook Pro lineup, but the MacBook Air is totally fanless. Bear that in mind when reading Microsoft's claims about performance.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025365#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025365&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Since the launch of its latest AI language model, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>, OpenAI has found itself on the defensive over the past week due to a string of bad news, rumors, and ridicule circulating on traditional and social media. The negative attention is potentially a sign that OpenAI has entered a new level of public visibility—and is more prominently receiving pushback to its AI approach beyond tech pundits and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/chasing-defamatory-hallucinations-ftc-opens-investigation-into-openai/">government regulators</a>.</p>

<p>OpenAI's rough week started last Monday when the company previewed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">a flirty AI assistant</a> with a voice seemingly inspired by Scarlett Johansson from the 2013 film <em>Her</em>. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666">alluded to</a> the film himself on X just before the event, and we had previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/people-are-speaking-with-chatgpt-for-hours-bringing-2013s-her-closer-to-reality/">made that comparison</a> with an earlier voice interface for ChatGPT that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/chatgpt-goes-multimodal-with-image-recognition-and-speech-synthesis/">launched</a> in September 2023.</p>
<p>While that September update included a voice called "Sky" that some have said sounds like Johansson, it was GPT-4o's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/is-the-world-ready-for-an-ai-assistant-that-can-laugh-in-your-face/">seemingly lifelike</a>, new conversational interface, complete with laughing and emotionally charged tonal shifts, that led to a widely circulated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVMNvm67Y-A"><em>Daily Show</em> segment</a> ridiculing the demo for its perceived flirty nature. Next, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPH0HgotIE4"><em>Saturday Night Live</em> joke</a> reinforced an implied connection to Johansson's voice.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025400#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025400&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has released its first bug fix update for iOS and iPadOS. The 17.5.1 release claims to fix a bug that saw some users' deleted photos resurface long after deletion.</p>
<p>The release notes list just one bullet point:</p>
<blockquote><p>This update provides important bug fixes and addresses a rare issue where photos that experienced database corruption could reappear in the Photos library even if they were deleted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Users started reporting the issue after iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 were released on May 13. The optics certainly weren't great for Apple, as some users assumed that the company was keeping their long-lost deleted photos (sometimes nude photos, as some reported seeing those pop up again) in the cloud without telling them.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025622#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025622&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A British judge found that Craig Wright "lied repeatedly and extensively" in a case related to Wright's claim that he is bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. "Dr. Wright's attempts to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto represent a most serious abuse of this Court's process," Justice James Mellor of England's High Court of Justice wrote in a <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/copa-v-wright/">ruling published today</a>.</p>
<p>Wright's evidence for being Nakamoto "is at best questionable or of very dubious relevance or entirely circumstantial and at worst, it is fabricated and/or based on documents I am satisfied have been forged on a grand scale by Dr. Wright," Mellor's ruling said.</p>
<p>Today's written ruling came two months after Mellor delivered an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/overwhelming-evidence-shows-craig-wright-did-not-create-bitcoin-judge-says/">oral verdict</a> in which he said the evidence shows Wright is not the person who created bitcoin. The written ruling said, "it is clear that Dr. Wright engaged in the deliberate production of false documents to support false claims and use the Courts as a vehicle for fraud. Despite acknowledging in this Trial that a few documents were inauthentic (generally blamed on others), he steadfastly refused to acknowledge any of the forged documents. Instead, he lied repeatedly and extensively in his attempts to deflect the allegations of forgery."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025608#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025608&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Does anyone want to buy a humanoid robot for $16,000? The latest product from Unitree hopes that you will: Meet the <a href="https://www.unitree.com/g1/">Unitree G1,</a> a "Humanoid agent AI avatar," aka a robot. If you haven't heard of Unitree, it's sort of the go-to "budget Chinese option" in the robot space. You're going to have to deal with company promotional materials that are <em>just barely</em> written in English, but you get some impressive bang-for-your-buck robots. You may have seen the Spot-knockoff Unitree Go2, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/this-lidar-equipped-30-pound-robot-dog-can-be-yours-for-1600/">a $1,600 robot dog</a> that various resellers have equipped with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/you-can-now-buy-a-flame-throwing-robot-dog-for-under-10000/">a flamethrower</a> or just straight-up <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/robot-dogs-armed-with-ai-targeting-rifles-undergo-us-marines-special-ops-evaluation/">military rifles</a>.</p>
<p>Unitree's promo video shows some impressive capabilities for such a cheap robot. It can stand up on its own from a flat-on-the-floor position. Just like the recent<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/boston-dynamics-debuts-humanoid-robot-destined-for-commercialization/"> Boston Dynamics Atlas video</a>, the G1 stands up in probably the strangest way possible. While lying face-up on the floor, the G1 brings its knees up, puts its feet flat on the floor, and then pushes up on the feet to form a tripod with the head still on the ground. From there, it uses a limbo-like move to lean its knees forward, bringing up its head and torso with all core strength.</p>
<p>The G1 is a budget robot, so the walk cycle is kind of primitive. It walks, stands, and "runs" in a permanent half-squat with its legs forward and knees bent all the time. The balance looks great though—at one point a person shows up and roughs up the robot a bit, kicking it in the back and punching it in the chest. In both cases, it absorbs the abuse with just a step back or two and keeps on trucking.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025436#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025436&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>HP is rebranding its consumer and commercial computers. The company will no longer use branding like Spectre and instead use Omni for all of its consumer-facing laptops, desktops, and all-in-ones (AIOs). Similarly, it will no longer refer to its commercial laptops as Dragonfly.</p>
<p>HP announced today that it will no longer release computers under consumer PC series names like Pavilion. Instead, every consumer computer from HP will be called either an OmniBook for laptops, an OmniDesk for desktops, or an OmniStudio for AIOs. The computers will also have a modifier, ranging from 3 up to 5, 7, X, or Ultra to denote computers that are entry-level all the way up to advanced. For instance, an HP OmniBook Ultra would represent HP's highest-grade consumer laptop.</p>

<p>"For example, an HP OmniBook 3 will appeal to customers who prioritize entertainment and personal use, while the OmniBook X will be designed for those with higher creative and technical demands," Stacy Wolff, SVP of design and sustainability at HP, said via a press announcement today.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025414#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025414&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Right on schedule for past releases, iFixit has done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8oN2CjJeoE">a teardown of Apple's new, redesigned iPad Pro</a>. It found that the iPad itself has one big improvement in repairability over its predecessor but that the Apple Pencil Pro is basically unserviceable.</p>
<p>The first step in the teardown video revealed arguably Apple's most interesting new tech: the "Tandem OLED" screen. It doesn't reveal anything we didn't already know and describe in our review last week, but it's neat to see what it all looks like up close.</p>
<p>The teardown also found that there are not one but two metal brackets all the way through the middle of the iPad to help with durability. Some worried that the new, thinner iPad Pro would be thinner than past models to snap in half, but durability tests have shown that's not the case. This could be part of why.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025552#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025552&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft is announcing some fairly major changes for Windows and the Surface lineup as part of its Build developer conference this week, but there’s one thing that’s definitely <em>not</em> coming, at least not right now: a Windows 12 update.</p>
<p>Speculation about the “Windows 12” update began propagating at some point last year in reports that suggested that Microsoft was shifting back to a three-year release cycle like the ones used for Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 10 in the late 2000s and early 2010s.</p>
<p>And Microsoft may have intended to call this fall’s release “Windows 12” at some point, and it does come with substantial changes both above and under the hood to better support Arm systems and to emphasize Microsoft’s AI focus.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021701#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021701&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft is using its new Surface launch and this week’s Build developer conference as a platform to launch its new “Copilot+" PC initiative, which comes with specific hardware requirements that systems will need to meet to be eligible. Copilot+ PCs will be able to handle some AI-accelerated workloads like chatbots and image generation locally instead of relying on the cloud, but new hardware will generally be required to run these workloads quickly and power efficiently.</p>

<p>At a minimum, systems will need 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, to accommodate both the memory requirements and the on-disk storage requirements needed for things like large language models (LLMs; even so-called “small language models” like Microsoft’s Phi-3, still use several billion parameters). Microsoft says that all of the Snapdragon X Plus and Elite-powered PCs being announced today will come with the Copilot+ features pre-installed, and that they'll begin shipping on June 18th.</p>
<p>But the biggest new requirement, and the blocker for virtually every Windows PC in use today, will be for an integrated neural processing unit, or NPU. Microsoft requires an NPU with performance rated at 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS), a high-level performance figure that Microsoft, Qualcomm, Apple, and others use for NPU performance comparisons. Right now, that requirement can only be met by a single chip in the Windows PC ecosystem, one that isn't even quite available yet: Qualcomm's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/">Snapdragon X Elite</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/qualcomm-preps-lower-end-snapdragon-x-plus-chips-to-compete-with-intel-and-apple/">X Plus</a>, launching in the new Surface and a number of PCs from the likes of Dell, Lenovo, HP, Asus, Acer, and other major PC OEMs in the next couple of months. All of those chips have NPUs capable of 45 TOPS, just a shade more than Microsoft's minimum requirement.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025348#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025348&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft is going all-in on Arm-powered Windows PCs today with the introduction of a Snapdragon X Elite-powered Surface Pro convertible and Surface Laptop, and there are inevitable comparisons to draw with another big company that recently shifted from Intel’s processors to Arm-based designs: Apple.</p>
<p>A huge part of the Apple Silicon transition’s success was <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527">Rosetta 2</a>, a translation layer that makes it relatively seamless to run most Intel Mac apps on an Apple Silicon Mac with no extra effort required from the user or the app’s developer. Windows 11 has similar translation capabilities, and with the Windows 11 24H2 update, that app translation technology is getting a name: Prism.</p>
<p>Microsoft says that Prism isn’t just a new name for the same old translation technology. Translated apps should run between 10 and 20 percent faster on the same Arm hardware after installing the Windows 11 24H2 update, offering some trickle-down benefits that users of the handful of Arm-based Windows 11 PCs should notice even if they don’t shell out for new hardware. The company says that Prism's performance should be similar to Rosetta's, though obviously this depends on the speed of the hardware you're running it on.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025352#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025352&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Only about 15 percent of the electrode-bearing threads implanted in the brain of Neuralink's first human brain-chip patient continue to work properly, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/neuralink-gets-fda-green-light-for-second-patient-as-first-describes-his-emotional-journey-a2707584">according to a report from The Wall Street Journal</a>. The remaining 85 percent of the threads became displaced, and many of the threads that were left receiving little to no signals have been shut off.</p>
<p>In a May 8 blog post, Neuralink had disclosed that "a number" of the chip's 64 thinner-than-hair threads <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/elon-musks-neuralink-reports-trouble-with-first-human-brain-chip/">had retracted</a>. Each thread carries multiple electrodes, totaling 1,024 across the threads, which are surgically implanted near neurons of interest to record signals that can be decoded into intended actions.</p>
<p>Neuralink was quick to note that it was able to adjust the algorithm used for decoding those neuronal signals to compensate for the lost electrode data. The adjustments were effective enough to regain and then exceed performance on at least one metric—the bits-per-second (BPS) rate used to measure how quickly and accurately a patient with an implant can control a computer cursor.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025511#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025511&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Bureau of Land Management announced Thursday that it would no longer make federally managed lands in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin available for new coal mining leases, drawing condemnation from the fossil fuel industry in the region that produces the most coal in the country, but delivering a boon to the nation’s clean energy transition.</p>
<p>The Powder River Basin, a geological formation that covers much of northeast Wyoming and a portion of southeast Montana, has been the nation’s largest source of coal for decades, with production there peaking in 2008. Since then, demand for coal has plummeted, largely due to the rise of natural gas and renewable energy. Taking federal coal off the table in the basin could all but put an expiration date on the nation’s thermal coal industry.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025541#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025541&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More than 60 years after he was denied an opportunity to become America's first Black astronaut, Ed Dwight finally traveled into space Sunday with five other passengers on a 10-minute flight inside a Blue Origin capsule.</p>
<p>Dwight, a retired Air Force captain and test pilot, had a chance to become the first African American astronaut. He was one of 26 pilots the Air Force recommended to NASA for the third class of astronauts in 1963, but the agency didn't select him. It took another 20 years for America's first Black astronaut, Guion Bluford, to fly in space in 1983.</p>
<p>“Everything they did, I did, and I did it well," Dwight said in a video released by Blue Origin. "If politics had changed, I would have gone to space in some kind of capacity.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025415#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025415&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Later this week, the US federal agency charged with weather forecasting <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-advisory/noaa-to-announce-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season-outlook">will release its outlook</a> for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season at a news conference in Washington, DC. But we already know what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecast will say: This year will likely be extremely active in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>The Atlantic season formally begins on June 1, and based on current trends, the first named storm may not develop until the middle of the month or later. But make no mistake—when the light switches on later this summer, the season is likely to be a blockbuster.</p>
<p>Why? Because the oceans are screaming at us.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025368#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025368&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
