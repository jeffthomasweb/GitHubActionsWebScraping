              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/drug-makers-sue-fda-so-they-can-keep-making-knockoff-weight-loss-drugs/">Facing a lawsuit</a>, the Food and Drug Administration has decided to reconsider its decision to take popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs off of the national shortage list, which will allow compounding pharmacies to continue selling cheaper copycat versions—at least for now.</p>
<p>A trade organization representing compounding pharmacies sued the agency last week over its <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-clarifies-policies-compounders-national-glp-1-supply-begins-stabilize">October 2 announcement</a> that there was no longer a shortage of tirzepatide drugs, branded as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. The products, members of the extremely popular and effective class of GLP-1 drugs, had been on the shortage list since December 2022.</p>
<p>Being on the list meant that compounding pharmacies were legally allowed to make "<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/98964/download">essentially copies</a>" of the products; the only time these pharmacies—also called outsourcing facilities—can make imitation versions of approved drugs, such as tirzepatide, is when the products appear on the shortage list. So, with the FDA's announcement, compounders were immediately barred from making any more of the lucrative drugs and had 60 days to fulfill existing orders.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/drugmakers-can-keep-making-off-brand-weight-loss-drugs-as-fda-backpedals/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is taking a closer look at how broadband data caps affect consumers, and is considering whether it has authority to regulate how Internet service providers impose such caps. Democrats are spearheading the effort over the opposition of the FCC's Republican minority.</p>
<p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel floated a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/fcc-chair-to-investigate-exactly-how-much-everyone-hates-data-caps/">plan to open a formal inquiry</a> into data caps in June 2023, and the FCC is finally moving ahead. A Notice of Inquiry <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-explores-how-broadband-data-caps-impact-competition-and-consumers">announced</a> today "explores how broadband data caps impact competition and consumers," the FCC said.</p>
<p>"During the last year, nearly 3,000 people have gotten so aggravated by data caps on their Internet service that they have reached out the Federal Communications Commission to register their frustration," Rosenworcel said in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-106A2.pdf">statement</a> issued today. "We are listening. Today, we start an inquiry into the state of data caps. We want to shine a light on what they mean for Internet service for consumers across the country."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-republican-opposes-regulation-of-data-caps-with-analogy-to-coffee-refills/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In the beginning, North Korean hackers compromised the banking infrastructure running AIX, IBM’s proprietary version of Unix. Next, they hacked infrastructure running Windows. Now, the state-backed bank robbers have expanded their repertoire to include Linux.</p>
<p>The malware, tracked under the name FASTCash, is a remote access tool that gets installed on payment switches inside compromised networks that handle payment card transactions. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency first warned of FASTCash in 2018 in an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2018/10/02/hidden-cobra-fastcash-campaign">advisory</a> that said the malware was infecting AIX-powered switches inside retail payment networks. In 2020, the agency updated its guidance to <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-239a">report</a> FASTCash was now infecting switches running Windows as well. Besides embracing Windows, FASTCash had also expanded its net to include not just switches for retail payments but those handled by regional interbank payment processors as well.</p>
<h2>Tampering with transaction messages on the fly</h2>
<p>Over the weekend, a researcher <a href="https://doubleagent.net/fastcash-for-linux/">reported</a> finding two samples of FASTCash for switches running on Linux. One sample is compiled for Ubuntu Linux 20.04 and was likely developed sometime after April 21, 2022. The other sample was likely not used. As of the time this post went live, only four anti-malware engines <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f34b532117b3431387f11e3d92dc9ff417ec5dcee38a0175d39e323e5fdb1d2c">detected</a> each <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7f3d046b2c5d8c008164408a24cac7e820467ff0dd9764e1d6ac4e70623a1071">sample</a>. The number of detections as of Sunday was zero. The Linux version was uploaded to VirusTotal in June 2023.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/north-korean-hackers-use-newly-discovered-linux-malware-to-raid-atms/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At the University of Toronto, just across the street from the football stadium, workers are putting up a 14-story building with space for classrooms and faculty offices. What’s unusual is how they’re building it — by bolting together giant beams, columns, and panels made of manufactured slabs of wood.</p>
<p>As each wood element is delivered by flatbed, a tall crane lifts it into place and holds it in position while workers attach it with metal connectors. In its half-finished state, the building resembles flat-pack furniture in the process of being assembled.</p>
<p>The tower uses a new technology called mass timber. In this kind of construction, massive, manufactured wood elements that can extend more than half the length of a football field replace steel beams and concrete. Though still relatively uncommon, it is growing in popularity and beginning to pop up in skylines around the world.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/sustainable-building-effort-reaches-new-heights-with-wooden-skyscrapers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX is seeking approval for changes to Starlink that the company says will enable gigabit-per-second broadband service.

<p>SpaceX said it is seeking "several small-but-meaningful updates to the orbital configuration and operational parameters for its Gen2 space station authorization to improve space sustainability, better respond to evolving demand, and more efficiently share spectrum with other spectrum users."</p>
<p>SpaceX wants to lower the altitudes of satellites "at 525 km, 530 km, and 535 km to 480 km, 485 km, and 475 km altitude, respectively."

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>After Elon Musk provided his "long-term" vision for autonomous, humanoid robots at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/">last week's "We, Robot" event</a>, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/are-teslas-robot-prototypes-ai-marvels-or-remote-controlled-toys/">expressed some skepticism</a> about the autonomy of the Optimus prototypes sent out for a post-event mingle with the assembled, partying humans. Now, there's been a raft of confirmation that human teleoperators were indeed puppeting the robot prototypes for much of the night.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-14/tesla-s-optimus-robots-were-remotely-operated-at-cybercab-event">cites</a> unnamed "people familiar with the matter" in reporting that Tesla "used humans to remotely control some capabilities" of the prototype robots at the event. The report doesn't specify which demonstrated capabilities needed that human assistance, but it points out that the robots "were able to walk without external control using artificial intelligence" (the lack of a similar AI call-out for any other robot actions that night seems telling).</p>
<p>That lines up with reporting from tech blogger Robert Scoble, who <a href="https://twitter.com/Scobleizer/status/1844617018760364256">posted on social media</a> that he had "talked with an engineer" who confirmed that "when it walked, that is AI running Optimus." For other tasks—like pouring drinks from a tap, playing Rock Paper Scissors, or chatting with nearby attendees—Scoble <a href="https://x.com/Scobleizer/status/1844593576040333767">noted</a> that "a human is remote assisting."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/reports-teslas-prototype-optimus-robots-were-controlled-by-humans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>This fall, thousands of fake albums were added to Spotify, with some appearing on real artist pages, where they're positioned to lure unsuspecting listeners into streaming by posing as new releases from favorite bands.</p>
<p>An Ars reader flagged the issue after finding a fake album on the Spotify page of an UK psych rock band called Gong. The Gong fan knew that the band had begun touring again after a surprise new release last year, but the "latest release" listed by Spotify wasn't that album. Instead, at the top of Gong's page was a fake self-titled album supposedly released in 2024.</p>
<p>The real fan detected the fake instantly, and not just because the generic electronic music sounded nothing like Gong's experimental sounds. The album's cover also gave the scheme away, using a generic font and neon stock image that invoked none of the trippy imagery that characterized Gong's typical album covers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/spotify-criticized-for-letting-fake-albums-appear-on-real-artist-pages/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Google <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/">announced</a> an agreement with <a href="https://kairospower.com/">Kairos Power</a> to purchase nuclear energy from multiple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/what-the-us-needs-for-future-nuclear-power-tech-to-get-off-the-ground/">small modular reactors</a> (SMRs), marking the first deal of its kind. The partnership aims to bring Kairos Power's initial SMR online by 2030, with additional reactor deployments planned through 2035, though no working SMR has yet been constructed in the US. With the energy demands of AI growing, Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/re-opened-three-mile-island-will-power-ai-data-centers-under-new-deal/">not been alone</a> in encouraging new development of alternative, no-emission power sources.</p>
<p>"The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies," Google Senior Director of Energy and Climate Michael Terrell said in a press statement. "This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone."</p>
<p>If the Google-Kairos plan succeeds in creating working reactors, it will reportedly enable up to 500 MW of carbon-free power to be added to US electricity grids. For Google, it's a key step toward making its headlong rush into power-hungry (and sometimes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/">dubious</a>) AI applications seem environmentally clean and ethical at a time when the world has seen devastating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/climate-change-boosted-miltons-landfall-strength-from-category-2-to-3/">meteorological effects</a> from climate change.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-and-kairos-sign-nuclear-reactor-deal-with-aim-to-power-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The birth of a planet starts with a microscopic grain floating in a protoplanetary disk, a swirling cloud of gas and other particles surrounding a young star. How the gas and dust interact has implications for the formation of new worlds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Those teeny grains—those are the building blocks of planets,” said Zhe-Yu Daniel Lin, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science. He describes the shape of the grains as “potatoes.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hot and breezy in the interstellar cloud, but it's not entirely chaotic. Astronomical observations have found that the grains, instead of tumbling through space, are oriented neatly along their orbital trajectories. To explain how the grains float in formation, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae2248">new research led by Lin</a> leans on the working principle behind an Earthly object: the badminton shuttle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/what-badminton-can-teach-us-about-planetary-formation/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The seventh-generation iPad mini looks mostly identical to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/the-more-pricey-2021-ipad-mini-is-the-best-one-apple-has-ever-made/">the sixth-generation version</a>, with a power-button-mounted Touch ID sensor and a slim-bezeled display. But Apple has swapped out the A15 Bionic chip for the Apple A17 Pro, the same processor it used in the iPhone 15 Pro last year.</p>
<p>The new iPad mini is available for preorder now and starts at $499 for 128GB (an upgrade over the previous base model's 64GB of storage). 256GB and 512GB versions are available for $599 and $799, and cellular connectivity is an additional $150 on top of any of those prices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/first-ipad-mini-update-since-2021-gets-a-faster-chip-and-apple-intelligence/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Porsche provided flights from Washington to Stuttgart and accommodation so Ars could drive the Macan and Macan 4S. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>STUTTGART, Germany—Porsche made its reputation with its rear-engined sports cars, but today it's the SUVs that even make that possible. But it makes those SUVs in order to appeal to Porsche drivers, offering five-door practicality but with driver-engaging handling, and a certain level of fit and finish. I've always thought of the Macan as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/review-the-porsche-macan-gts-might-be-an-suv-but-its-all-porsche/">Porsche's answer to the hot hatch</a>, and now it's gone electric. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/the-2024-porsche-macan-ev-has-character-pace-and-the-right-badge/">We tested two variants</a> of the new Macan EV earlier this year, and came away impressed. Now we've had seat time in another pair: the $75,300 rear-wheel drive Macan, and the $84,900 Macan 4S.</p>
<p>Ars has written <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/porsches-macan-ev-comes-out-in-2024-we-drive-the-prototype/">quite a lot</a> about the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/porsche-gives-ars-a-look-inside-its-next-ev-the-all-electric-macan/">development</a> of the Macan's Premium Platform Electric, which it helped develop with VW sibling Audi. Porsche has a lot of history adapting VW group platforms, from the previous generations of Cayenne and Macan all the way back to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/driving-a-priceless-historic-porsche-meet-the-very-first-356-from-1948/">the very first car to wear the family name</a>, 356/1, which spiced up some Beetle bits in a handsome roadster body.</p>
<h2>Macan</h2>
<p>The entry level Macan is unique among the range for having just a single electric motor, which drives the rear wheels. With a nominal 335 hp (250 kW)—boosted to 355 hp (265 kW) with launch control—and 415 lb-ft (562 Nm), it's the least-powerful Macan but also the lightest (by 242 lbs/110 kg) and the most efficient, with an EPA range estimate of 315 miles (506 km) from the 100 kWh (95 kWh useable) battery pack.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/we-drive-the-two-sweet-spots-in-porsches-2025-macan-ev-lineup/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft lifted off Monday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, kicking off a $5.2 billion robotic mission to explore one of the most promising locations in the Solar System for finding extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>The Falcon Heavy rocket fired its 27 kerosene-fueled engines and vaulted away from Launch Complex 39A at 12:06 pm EDT (16:06 UTC) Monday. Delayed several days due to Hurricane Milton, which passed through Central Florida late last week, the launch of Europa Clipper signaled the start of a five-and-a-half- year journey to Jupiter, where the spacecraft will settle into an orbit taking it repeatedly by one of the giant planet's numerous moons.</p>
<p>The moon of Jupiter that has most captured scientists' interest, Europa, is sheathed in ice. There's strong evidence of a global ocean of liquid water below Europa's frozen crust, and Europa Clipper is going there to determine if it has the ingredients for life.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/nasa-launches-mission-to-explore-the-frozen-frontier-of-jupiters-moon-europa/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Adobe <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/2024/10/101424-adobe-launches-firefly-video-model">announced</a> Firefly Video Model, a new AI-powered text-to-video generation tool that can create novel videos from written prompts. It joins similar offerings from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/we-made-a-cat-drink-a-beer-with-runways-ai-video-generator-and-it-sprouted-hands/">Runway</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/google-unveils-veo-a-high-definition-ai-video-generator-that-may-rival-sora/">Google</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/metas-new-movie-gen-ai-system-can-deepfake-video-from-a-single-photo/">Meta</a> in an increasingly crowded field. Unlike the competition, Adobe claims that Firefly Video Model is trained exclusively on licensed content, potentially sidestepping ethical and copyright issues that have plagued other generative AI tools.</p>
<p>Because of its licensed training data roots, Adobe calls <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly/features/ai-video-generator.html">Firefly Video Model</a> "the first publicly available video model designed to be commercially safe." However, the San Jose, California-based software firm hasn't announced a general release date, and during a beta test period, it's only granting access to people on a waiting list.</p>

<p>In the works since at least <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/adobe-teases-generative-ai-video-tools/">April 2023</a>, the new model builds off of techniques Adobe developed for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ethical-ai-art-generation-adobe-firefly-may-be-the-answer/">Firefly</a> image synthesis models. Like its text-to-image generator, which the company later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/adobe-photoshops-new-generative-fill-ai-tool-lets-you-manipulate-photos-with-text/">integrated</a> into Photoshop, Adobe hopes to aim Firefly Video Model at media professionals, such as video creators and editors. The company claims its model can produce footage that blends seamlessly with traditionally created video content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/adobe-unveils-ai-video-generator-trained-on-licensed-content/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For a while now, companies like OpenAI and Google have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">touting advanced "reasoning" capabilities</a> as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/google-ai-earns-silver-medal-equivalent-at-international-mathematical-olympiad/">the next big step</a> in their latest artificial intelligence models. Now, though, a new study from six Apple engineers shows that the mathematical "reasoning" displayed by advanced large language models can be extremely brittle and unreliable in the face of seemingly trivial changes to common benchmark problems.</p>
<p>The fragility highlighted in these new results helps support previous research suggesting that LLMs use of probabilistic pattern matching is missing the formal understanding of underlying concepts needed for truly reliable mathematical reasoning capabilities. "Current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning," the researchers hypothesize based on these results. "Instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data."</p>
<h2>Mix it up</h2>
<p>In "GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models"—currently available <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229">as a pre-print paper</a>—the six Apple researchers start with <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k">GSM8K's standardized set of over 8,000 grade-school level mathematical word problems</a>, which is <a href="https://klu.ai/glossary/GSM8K-eval">often used as a benchmark</a> for modern LLMs' complex reasoning capabilities. They then take the novel approach of modifying a portion of that testing set to dynamically replace certain names and numbers with new values—so a question about Sophie getting 31 building blocks for her nephew in GSM8K could become a question about Bill getting 19 building blocks for his brother in the new GSM-Symbolic evaluation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/llms-cant-perform-genuine-logical-reasoning-apple-researchers-suggest/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A New York judge recently called out an expert witness for using Microsoft's Copilot chatbot to inaccurately estimate damages in a real estate dispute that partly depended on an accurate assessment of damages to win.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2024/2024-ny-slip-op-24258.html">order</a> Thursday, judge Jonathan Schopf warned that "due to the nature of the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and its inherent reliability issues" that any use of AI should be disclosed before testimony or evidence is admitted in court. Admitting that the court "has no objective understanding as to how Copilot works," Schopf suggested that the legal system could be disrupted if experts started overly relying on chatbots en masse.</p>
<p>His warning came after an expert witness, Charles Ranson, dubiously used Copilot to cross-check calculations in a dispute over a $485,000 rental property in the Bahamas that had been included in a trust for a deceased man's son. The court was being asked to assess if the executrix and trustee—the deceased man's sister—breached her fiduciary duties by delaying the sale of the property while admittedly using it for personal vacations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-confronts-expert-witness-who-used-copilot-to-fake-expertise/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ward Christensen, co-inventor of the computer bulletin board system (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/my-secret-life-as-an-11-year-old-bbs-sysop/">BBS</a>), has died at age 78 in Rolling Meadows, Illinois. He was found deceased at his home on Friday after friends requested a wellness check. Christensen, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Suess">Randy Suess</a>, created the first BBS in Chicago in 1978, leading to an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/">important cultural era</a> of digital community-building that presaged much of our online world today.</p>

<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, BBSes introduced many home computer users to multiplayer online gaming, message boards, and online community building in an era before the Internet became widely available to people outside of science and academia. It also gave rise to the <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/728527/what-is-shareware-and-why-was-it-so-popular-in-the-1990s/">shareware gaming scene</a> that led to companies like <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/713532/before-fortnite-there-was-zzt-meet-epics-first-game/">Epic Games</a> today.</p>
<p>Friends and associates remember Christensen as humble and unassuming, a quiet innovator who never sought the spotlight for his groundbreaking work. Despite creating one of the foundational technologies of the digital age, Christensen maintained a low profile throughout his life, content with his long-standing career at IBM and showing no bitterness or sense of missed opportunity as the Internet age dawned.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/ward-christensen-bbs-inventor-and-architect-of-our-online-age-dies-at-age-78/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Internet Archive has brought its Wayback Machine back online "in a provisional, read-only manner" as it continues to recover from attacks that took the site down last week, founder Brewster Kahle said in a <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1845688309085065571">post</a> last night. The <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> home page points users to the now-functional <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> but notes that other Internet Archive services are temporarily offline.</p>
<p>Kahle said it was "safe to resume" the Wayback Machine's operations, but that it "might need further maintenance, in which case it will be suspended again." The Wayback Machine's "Save Page Now" feature that lets users capture a webpage manually is currently unavailable. The related <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">openlibrary.org</a> book-preservation website was still offline today.</p>
<p>Founded in 1996, the nonprofit Internet Archive <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/wayback-machine-general-information/">crawls the web</a> to preserve pages that are publicly available and has captured 916 billion web pages so far. It has a <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/where-does-my-donation-go/">staff of 150 people</a> and also provides free access to many videos, audio files, and books (though it was recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/internet-archive-forced-to-remove-500000-books-after-publishers-court-win/">forced to delete 500,000 books</a> after losing a copyright case).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/the-internet-archive-and-its-916-billion-saved-webpages-are-back-online/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Has your dentist ever told you that it's recommended to get routine dental X-rays every year? My (former) dentist's office did this year—in writing, even. And they claimed that the recommendation came from the American Dental Association.</p>
<p>It's a common refrain from dentists, but it's false. The American Dental Association <em>does not</em> recommend annual routine X-rays. And this is not new; it's been that way for well over a decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-org/files/resources/library/oral-health-topics/dental_radiographic_examinations_2012.pdf?rev=fd33893f4d634cbaab92733c2313c354&amp;hash=45F728CEF900B5B654539635A9147AA9">The association's guidelines from 2012</a> recommended that adults who don't have an increased risk of dental caries (myself included) need only bitewing X-rays of the back teeth every two to three years. Even people with a higher risk of caries can go as long as 18 months between bitewings. The guidelines also note that X-rays should not be preemptively used to look for problems: "Radiographic screening for the purpose of detecting disease before clinical examination should not be performed," the guidelines read. In other words, dentists are supposed to examine your teeth <em>before</em> they take any X-rays.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/do-you-really-need-those-routine-dental-x-rays-probably-not/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What if there was a way to sneak malicious instructions into Claude, Copilot, or other top-name AI chatbots and get confidential data out of them by using characters large language models can recognize and their human users can’t? As it turns out, there was—and in some cases still is.</p>
<p>The invisible characters, the result of a quirk in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> text encoding standard, create an ideal covert channel that can make it easier for attackers to conceal malicious payloads fed into an LLM. The hidden text can similarly obfuscate the exfiltration of passwords, financial information, or other secrets out of the same AI-powered bots. Because the hidden text can be combined with normal text, users can unwittingly paste it into prompts. The secret content can also be appended to visible text in chatbot output.</p>
<p>The result is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganographic</a> framework built into the most widely used text encoding channel.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/ai-chatbots-can-read-and-write-invisible-text-creating-an-ideal-covert-channel/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The world is full of people who have excessive confidence in their own abilities. This is famously described as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/11/revisiting-why-incompetents-think-theyre-awesome/">the Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, which describes how people who lack expertise in something will necessarily lack the knowledge needed to recognize their own limits. Now, a different set of researchers has come out with what might be viewed as a corollary to Dunning-Kruger: People have a strong tendency to believe that they always have enough data to make an informed decision—regardless of what information they actually have.</p>
<p>The work, done by Hunter Gehlbach, Carly Robinson, and Angus Fletcher, is based on an experiment in which they intentionally gave people only partial, biased information, finding that people never seemed to consider they might only have a partial picture. "Because people assume they have adequate information, they enter judgment and decision-making processes with less humility and more confidence than they might if they were worrying whether they knew the whole story or not," they write. The good news? When given the full picture, most people are willing to change their opinions.</p>
<h2>Ignorant but confident</h2>
<p>The basic setup of the experiment is very straightforward. The researchers developed a scenario where an ongoing water shortage was forcing a school district to consider closing one of its schools and merging its students into another existing school. They then wrote an article that described the situation and contained seven different pieces of information: three that favored merging, three that disfavored it, and one that was neutral. Just over half of the control group that read the full article favored merging the two schools.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/people-think-they-already-know-everything-they-need-to-make-decisions/">Read full article</a></p>
