                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI and Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/11/a-joint-statement-from-microsoft-and-openai/">announced</a> they have signed a non-binding agreement to revise their partnership, marking the latest development in a relationship that has grown increasingly complex as both companies compete for customers in the AI market and seek new partnerships for growing infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>"Microsoft and OpenAI have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our partnership," the companies wrote in a joint statement. "We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety."</p>
<p>The announcement comes as OpenAI seeks to restructure from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity, a transition that requires Microsoft's approval, as the company is OpenAI's largest investor with more than $13 billion committed since 2019.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-and-microsoft-sign-preliminary-deal-to-revise-partnership-terms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A child in Los Angeles has died of a measles-related brain disorder stemming from an infection in infancy, <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135">the Los Angeles County health department reported Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the child died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare, but always fatal complication that strikes years after an initial measles infection. The health department's announcement offered few details about the child, including the child's age, but said that the child had contracted the virus before they were old enough to be vaccinated against measles. The first of two <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html">recommended doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine</a> is given between 12 and 15 months.</p>
<p>"This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members," Muntu Davis, a Los Angeles County health officer, said in a statement. "Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity. Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself—it's about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/child-dies-of-horrifying-measles-complication-in-los-angeles/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA's interim administrator Sean Duffy was fired up on Wednesday when he joined a teleconference <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/has-perseverance-found-a-biosignature-on-mars/">to talk about new scientific findings</a> that concerned the potential for life to have once existed on Mars.</p>
<p>"This is exciting news," said Duffy about an arrow-shaped rock on Mars found by NASA's Perseverance rover. The rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. The findings were intriguing, but not conclusive. Further study of the rocks in an advanced lab on Earth might prove more definitive.</p>
<p>Duffy was ready, he said, to discuss the scientific results along with NASA experts on the call with reporters. However, the very first question—and for any space reporter, the obvious one—concerned NASA's on-again, off-again plan to return rocks from the surface of Mars for study on Earth. This mission, called Mars Sample Return, has been on hold for nearly two years after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/independent-review-finds-mars-sample-return-mission-important-but-broken/">an independent analysis found</a> that NASA's bloated plan would cost at least $8 billion to $11 billion. President Trump has sought to cancel it outright.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/nasa-found-intriguing-rocks-on-mars-so-where-does-that-leave-mars-sample-return/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We're one month away from the theatrical release of <em>TRON: Ares</em>, and Disney is seeking to stoke interest with a new trailer that shows the titular program going back to the original 1984 grid—and encountering an unexpected figure: the one and only Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges).</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for <em>Tron</em> and <em>Tron: Legacy</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/go-back-to-the-grid-in-tron-ares-trailer/">previously reported</a>, <em>TRON: Legacy</em> ended with Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), son of Kevin Flynn, preventing the digital world from bleeding into the real world, as planned by the Grid's malevolent ruling program, Clu. He brought with him Quorra (Olivia Wilde), a naturally occurring isomorphic algorithm targeted for extinction by Clu.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/latest-tron-ares-trailer-takes-us-back-to-1982/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Back in 1971, the late physicist Stephen Hawking made an intriguing prediction: The total surface area of a black hole cannot decrease, only increase or remain stable. So if two black holes combine, the newly formed black hole will have a larger surface area. This became known as Hawking's area theorem. Analysis of the gravitational signal from a black hole merger detected in January provides the best observational evidence to date in support of Hawking's theorem, according to a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/kw5g-d732">new paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Letters.</p>
<p>The breakthrough just happens to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of the LIGO collaboration's Nobel Prize-winning first detection of a black hole merger. A second paper has been submitted (but not yet accepted), placing theoretical limits on a predicted third tone at a higher pitch that could be lurking in the event's gravitational wave signal.</p>
<p>Now known as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK), the collaboration searches the Universe for gravitational waves produced by the mergers of black holes and neutron stars. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/danish-physicists-claim-to-cast-doubt-on-detection-of-gravitational-waves/">LIGO detects</a> gravitational waves via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/ligos-gravitational-wave-detection-takes-home-a-nobel/">laser interferometry</a>, using high-powered lasers to measure tiny changes in the distance between two objects positioned kilometers apart. LIGO has detectors in Hanford, Washington, and in Livingston, Louisiana. A third detector in Italy, Advanced Virgo, came online in 2016. In Japan, KAGRA is the first gravitational-wave detector in Asia and the first to be built underground. Construction began on LIGO-India in 2021, and physicists expect it will turn on sometime after 2025.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/new-black-hole-merger-bolsters-hawking-area-theorem/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Critics are slamming Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) new <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/50958F76-A64C-418A-8FCA-650D9DE2602B">AI policy framework</a>, which they claim would give the White House unprecedented authority to allow Big Tech companies to make "sweetheart" deals with the Trump administration to void laws designed to protect the public from reckless AI experiments.</p>
<p>Under the framework, Cruz calls for a "light-touch" regulatory approach to "advance American leadership" in AI and ensure that "American values" are at the heart of the world's leading technology—not Chinese values.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the framework requires blocking "burdensome" state AI regulations, as well as foreign ones. Cruz unsuccessfully helped push for a similar <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">decadelong moratorium on state AI laws</a> as part of Republicans' "big beautiful" budget bill.

                            <![CDATA[<p>VMware will lose a significant chunk of business over the next three years, according to Gartner research VP Julia Palmer.</p>
<p>Of course, some organizations have already <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/01/a-long-costly-road-ahead-for-customers-abandoning-broadcoms-vmware/">abandoned VMware</a> or are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">plotting partial or total migrations</a>. Broadcom acquired the virtualization business in November 2023 and made sweeping changes that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/vmware-cloud-partners-demand-firm-regulatory-action-on-broadcom/">alienated many customers</a>. The biggest concerns have been higher costs driven by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/some-vmware-perpetual-license-owners-are-unable-to-download-security-patches/">shift from perpetual licenses</a> to subscriptions and the bundling of products into fewer, more expensive SKUs and a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/more-vmware-cloud-partners-axed-as-broadcom-launches-new-invite-only-program/">reduction in the number of channel partners</a> that are allowed to resell VMware technologies. The new VMware business model favors large organizations, forcing many small- to medium-sized businesses to explore alternatives.</p>
<p>However, the wave of departures that Palmer spoke of today at Gartner’s IT Symposium in Gold Coast, Australia, comes from customers who use VMware technology through hyperscalers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), as reported by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/11/gartner_vmware_migration_advice/">The Register</a>. Soon after its acquisition, Broadcom made it so that hyperscalers are unable to resell VMware subscriptions to customers using hyperscaler cloud services that rely on VMware. Because of this change, 35 percent of VMware workloads will migrate elsewhere by 2028, Palmer predicted, noting that hyperscalers will push their customers to the public cloud.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/35-percent-of-vmware-workloads-expected-to-migrate-elsewhere-by-2028/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>For seven years, the discussion around <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> focused on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/explaining-the-internets-obsession-with-silksong-which-finally-comes-out-sept-4/">the cult-like levels of devotion among fans patiently waiting for the sequel</a>. Now that <em>Silksong</em> has been available for about a week, though, that discussion has turned decisively toward <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/criticism-isnt-hate-hollow-knight-silksong-sparks-debate-about-difficulty-runbacks-and-the-dreaded-git-gud-comments">seemingly endless takes</a> on <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-more-difficult-player-complaints/">the game's</a> relative <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-difficult">difficulty</a> (or lack thereof). The discussion has gotten so loud that the developers at Team Cherry have vowed to implement a "slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">in a coming patch</a>.</p>
<p>So is <em>Silksong</em> too difficult for its own good? Or do players just have to "get good" and stop whining?</p>
<p>To help answer those questions, we felt it was a good time to bust out the Ars Difficulty Matrix (ADM<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;">), which we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">first used to analyze <em>Elden Ring</em>'s difficulty in 2022</a>. By breaking down the various ways a game can be "difficult," the ADM<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"> can more precisely critique the ways <em>Silksong</em> is and is not designed to challenge players, both for good and for ill.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-hard-well-it-depends-on-what-you-mean-by-hard/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An update to Gmail begins rolling out soon, readying Google's premier email app for all your upcoming holiday purchases. Gmail has been surfacing shipment tracking for some time now, but Google will now add a separate view just for remembering the things you have ordered. And if you want to buy more things, there's a new interface for that, too. Yay, capitalism.</p>
<p>Gmail is quite good at recognizing purchase information in the form of receipts and shipping notifications. Currently, the app (and web interface) lists upcoming shipments at the top of the inbox. It will continue to do that when you have a delivery within the next 24 hours, but the new Purchases tab brings it all together in one glanceable view.</p>
<p>Purchases will be available in the navigation list alongside all the other stock Gmail labels. When selected, Gmail will filter your messages to only show receipts, order status, and shipping details. This makes it easier to peruse your recent orders and search within this subset of emails. This could be especially handy in this day and age of murky international shipping timelines.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/gmail-gets-a-dedicated-place-to-track-all-your-purchases/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The United States has emerged as the largest investor in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-the-vogel-group-lobbying-trump-administration/">commercial spyware</a>—a global industry that has enabled the covert surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, politicians, diplomats, and others, posing grave threats to human rights and <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/national-security/">national security</a>.</p>
<p>In 2024, 20 new US-based spyware investors were identified, bringing the total number of American backers of this technology to 31. This growth has largely outpaced other major investing countries such as Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom, according to a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/mythical-beasts-diving-into-the-depths-of-the-global-spyware-market/">new report</a> published today by the Atlantic Council.</p>
<p>The study <a href="https://staging--atlantic-council-spyware.netlify.app/">surveyed</a> 561 entities across 46 countries between 1992 and 2024, identifying 34 new investors.

<p>The Falcon 9 took off from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, at 7:12 am PDT (10:12 am EDT; 14:12 UTC) and headed south over the Pacific Ocean, heading for an orbit over the poles before releasing the 21 military-owned satellites to begin several weeks of activations and checkouts.</p>
<p>These 21 satellites will boost themselves to a final orbit at an altitude of roughly 600 miles (1,000 kilometers). The Pentagon plans to launch 133 more satellites over the next nine months to complete the build-out of the Space Development Agency's first-generation, or Tranche 1, constellation of missile-tracking and data-relay satellites.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/pentagon-begins-deploying-new-satellite-network-to-link-sensors-with-shooters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon lost an attempt to overturn a $46.9 million fine for selling customer location data without its users' consent. The US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected Verizon's challenge in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.3faa6ebe-fa32-ef11-a296-001dd804fa85/gov.uscourts.ca2.3faa6ebe-fa32-ef11-a296-001dd804fa85.107.0.pdf">ruling</a> issued today.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As part of its unprovoked invasion, Russia has been firing massed waves of drones and missiles into Ukraine for years, though the tempo has been raised dramatically in recent months. Barrages of 700-plus drones now regularly attack Ukraine during overnight raids. Russia also appears to have upped the ante dramatically by sending at least 19 drones into Poland last night, some of which were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/world/europe/poland-russia-drones-ukraine-attack.html">shot down by NATO forces</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these drones are Shahed/Geran types built with technology imported from Iran, and they have recently gained the ability to fly higher, making shootdowns more difficult. Given the low cost of the drones (estimates suggest they cost a few tens of thousands of dollars apiece, and many are simply decoys without warheads), hitting them with multimillion-dollar missiles from traditional air-defense batteries makes little sense and would quickly exhaust missile stocks.</p>
<p>So Ukraine has adopted widespread electronic warfare to disrupt control systems and navigation. Drones not forced off their path are fought with <a href="https://defence-blog.com/video-shows-gepard-shooting-down-russian-suicide-drone/">mobile anti-aircraft guns</a>, aircraft, and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/war-in-ukraine-interceptor-drones-russia-shahed-drones/">interceptor drones</a>, many launched from mobile fire teams patrolling Ukraine during the night.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/after-ukrainian-testing-drone-detection-radar-doubles-range-with-simple-software-patch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Someone might want to tell David Zaslav to read the room. Despite people’s ongoing frustration with the rising prices of streaming services—and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/price-tracker/">just about everything else</a>—the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) thinks that there is reason for HBO Max to charge more.</p>
<p>Zaslav shared his sentiments while speaking at the Goldman Sachs Cornucopia + Technology conference today in San Francisco. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/david-zaslav-tv-terrible-hbo-max-password-sharing-crackdown-1236367283/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> quoted Zaslav as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that this is quality—and that’s true across our company, motion picture, TV production [and] streaming quality—we all ... think that gives us a chance to raise price. We think we’re way underpriced.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, HBO Max starts at $10 per month with ads, $17/month for no ads, and $21/month for no ads and premium features (4K streaming, Dolby Atmos, and the ability to stream from more devices simultaneously and perform more downloads). The streaming platform has raised prices twice since launching (as Max) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/warner-bros-discovery-will-launch-new-max-streaming-service-may-23/">in May 2023</a>. In June 2024, the Standard, ad-free plan went from $16/month to $17/month, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/lawsuit-against-prime-video-ads-shows-perils-of-annual-streaming-subscriptions/">annual subscription fees</a> went up by $20 or $10, depending on the plan. Subscription fees also increased in January 2023.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/hbo-max-is-way-underpriced-warner-bros-discovery-ceo-says/">Read full article</a></p>

While senators clearly struggled to believe that explanation, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) wryly noted that Kennedy should have asked her the question before having the Senate confirm her for the role.</p>
<p>In an<a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa"> op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal</a> the same day as Kennedy's testimony, Monarez gave a different account of her firing—one corroborated by independent reporting—saying that she was ousted after she refused Kennedy's directives to fire senior CDC staff and pre-approve vaccine recommendations from an advisory committee he had stacked with fellow anti-vaccine advocates.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/ousted-cdc-director-to-testify-before-senate-after-rfk-jr-called-her-a-liar/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A prominent US senator has called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Microsoft for “gross cybersecurity negligence,” citing the company’s continued use of an obsolete and vulnerable form of encryption that Windows supports by default.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_ftc_on_microsoft_kerberoasting_ransomwarepdf.pdf">letter</a> to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Sen. Ron Wyden (D–Ore.) said an investigation his office conducted into the 2024 ransomware breach of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/health-care-giant-ascension-says-5-6-million-patients-affected-in-cyberattack/">health care giant Ascension</a> found that the default support of the RC4 encryption cipher was a direct cause. The breach led to the theft of medical records of 5.6 million patients.</p>
<p>It's the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/us-senator-blasts-microsoft-for-negligent-cybersecurity-practices/">second time</a> in as many years that Wyden has used the word “negligence” to describe Microsoft's security practices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/senator-blasts-microsoft-for-making-default-windows-vulnerable-to-kerberoasting/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is one of the most ardent proponents of generative AI technology, as evidenced by the recent launch of the Pixel 10 series. The phones were announced with more than 20 new AI experiences, according to Google. However, one of them is already being pulled from the company's phones. If you go looking for your Daily Hub, you may be disappointed. Not <em>that</em> disappointed, though, as it has been pulled because it didn't do very much.</p>
<p>Many of Google's new AI features only make themselves known in specific circumstances, for example when Magic Cue finds an opportunity to suggest an address or calendar appointment based on your screen context. The Daily Hub, on the other hand, asserted itself multiple times throughout the day. It appeared at the top of the Google Discover feed, as well as in the At a Glance widget right at the top of the home screen.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks after release, Google has pulled the Daily Hub preview from Pixel 10 devices. You will no longer see it in Google Discover nor in the home screen widget. After being spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/08/pixel-10-daily-hub-pause/">9to5Google</a>, the company has issued a statement explaining its plans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/google-pulls-daily-hub-ai-feature-from-pixel-10-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Anthropic <a href="https://status.anthropic.com/incidents/k6gkm2b8cjk9">experienced</a> a brief but complete service outage that took down its AI infrastructure, leaving developers unable to access Claude.ai, the API, Claude Code, or the management console for around half an hour. The outage affected all three of Anthropic's main services simultaneously, with the company posting at 12:28 pm Eastern that "APIs, Console, and Claude.ai are down. Services will be restored as soon as possible." As of press time, the services appear to be restored.</p>
<p>The disruption, though lasting only about 30 minutes, quickly took the top spot on tech link-sharing site Hacker News for a short time and inspired immediate reactions from developers who have become increasingly reliant on AI coding tools for their daily work. "Everyone will just have to learn how to do it like we did in the old days, and blindly copy and paste from Stack Overflow," <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200522">joked</a> one Hacker News commenter. Another user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200398">recalled</a> a joke from a previous AI outage: "Nooooo I'm going to have to use my brain again and write 100% of my code like a caveman from December 2024."</p>
<p>The most recent outage came at an inopportune time, affecting developers across the US who have integrated Claude into their workflows. One Hacker News user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200333">observed</a>: "It's like every other day, the moment US working hours start, AI (in my case I mostly use Anthropic, others may be better) starts dying or at least getting intermittent errors. In EU working hours there's rarely any outages." Another user also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200449">noted</a> this pattern, saying that "early morning here in the UK everything is fine, as soon as most of the US is up and at it, then it slowly turns to treacle."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/developers-joke-about-coding-like-cavemen-as-ai-service-suffers-major-outage/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has a simple request for the Trump administration: Don't take our broadband money away.</p>
<p>Trump's Commerce Department rewrote the rules of the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program, forcing states to change how they spend money earmarked for expanding broadband access. The overhaul led states to reduce spending on fiber networks and increase spending on satellite—although not to the extent sought by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-wants-billions-in-grants-but-state-governments-arent-cooperating/">demanding more money</a> for his Starlink network.</p>
<p>Since states are spending less on deployment, and the program still has the $42 billion allocated by Congress, what happens to the leftover amount after money is spent on deploying broadband networks? Amid speculation that the Trump administration wants to return that money to the US Treasury, Louisiana's Republican governor is worried that states won't be able to use the full $42 billion. It's possible that half or more of the $42 billion won't be used to expand broadband.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/can-we-please-keep-our-broadband-money-republican-governor-asks-trump-admin/">Read full article</a></p>
