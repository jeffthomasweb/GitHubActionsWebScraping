                            <![CDATA[<p>Amid the chaos of the Trump administration’s haphazard job cuts and a mass exodus of leadership, the Food and Drug Administration is experiencing a slowdown of drug reviews and approvals, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/10/20/fda-drug-approvals-slowing-rejections-rising/">an analysis reported by Stat News</a>.</p>
<p>An assessment of metrics by RBC Capital Markets analysts found that FDA drug approvals dropped 14 percentage points in the third quarter compared to the average of the six previous quarters—falling from an average of 87 percent to 73 percent this past quarter. In line with that finding, analysts noted that the delay rate in meeting deadlines for drug application reviews rose from an average of 4 percent to 11 percent.</p>
<p>The FDA also rejected more applications than normal, going from a historical average of 10 percent to 15 percent in the third quarter. A growing number of rejections relate to problems at manufacturing plants, which in turn could suggest problems with the FDA’s inspection and auditing processes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/fda-slows-down-on-drug-reviews-approvals-amid-trump-admin-chaos/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Norwegian director Roar Uthaug's sequel to his 2022 film <em>Troll</em> knows to not take itself too seriously.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hzk4ovnGOyw?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Netflix’s international offerings include some entertaining Norwegian fare, such as the series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/review-ragnorak-updates-norse-mythology-for-the-modern-age/"><em>Ragnarok</em></a> (2020–2023), a surprisingly engaging reworking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k">Norse mythology</a> brought into the 21st century that ran for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_(TV_series)">three seasons</a>. Another enjoyable offering was a 2022 monster movie called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(2022_film)"><em>Troll</em></a>, essentially a Norwegian take on the classic <em>Godzilla</em> formula. Netflix just dropped a trailer for the sequel, <em>Troll 2,</em> which looks to be very much in the same vein as its predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first <em>Troll</em> movie below.)</strong></p>
<p>Don’t confuse the Netflix franchise with 2010’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollhunter"><em>Trollhunter</em></a>, shot in the style of a found footage mockumentary. A group of college students sets off into the wilds of the fjordland to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher named Hans. They discover that Hans is actually hunting down trolls and decide to document those endeavors instead, but soon realize they are very much out of their depth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/troll-2-trailer-is-a-godzilla-inspired-monster-mash/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple’s new Liquid Glass user interface design was one of the most noticeable and divisive features of its major software updates this year. It added additional fluidity and translucency throughout iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Apple’s other operating systems, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/macos-26-tahoe-the-ars-technica-review/#toc-h9">as we noted in our reviews</a>, the default settings weren’t always great for readability.</p>
<p>The upcoming 26.1 update for all of those OSes is taking a step toward addressing some of the complaints, though not by changing things about the default look of Liquid Glass. Rather, the update is adding a new toggle that will let users choose between a Clear and Tinted look for Liquid Glass, with Clear representing the default look and Tinted cranking up the opacity and contrast.</p>

<p>The new toggle adds a half-step between the default visual settings and the “reduce transparency” setting, which, aside from changing a bunch of other things about the look and feel of the operating system, is buried further down inside the Accessibility options. The Tinted toggle does make colors and vague shapes visible beneath the glass panes, preserving the general look of Liquid Glass while also erring on the side of contrast and visibility, where the “reduce transparency” setting is more of an all-or-nothing blunt instrument.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/new-ios-and-macos-betas-add-tinted-toggle-to-tone-down-liquid-glass/">Read full article</a></p>

Today, OpenAI announced the Atlas browser that it hopes will do something similar for its ChatGPT large language model, answering the question “What if I could chat with a browser?” as the OpenAI team put it.</p>
<p>OpenAI Founder and CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UWKxJbjriY">said in a live stream announcement</a> that Atlas will let users “chat with a page,” helping ChatGPT become a core way that users interact with the place where “a ton of work and life happens” online. “The way that we hope people will use the Internet in the future… is that the chat experience and a web browser can be a great analogue,” he said.</p>
<p>The new browser is <a href="https://chatgpt.com/atlas">available for download now on macOS</a>, and Altman promised Windows and mobile versions would be rolled out “as quick as we can.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openais-new-atlas-web-browser-wants-to-let-you-chat-with-a-page/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AI content has proliferated across the Internet over the past few years, but those early confabulations with mutated hands have evolved into synthetic images and videos that can be hard to differentiate from reality. Having helped to create this problem, Google has some responsibility to keep AI video in check on YouTube. To that end, the company has started rolling out its promised likeness detection system for creators.</p>
<p>Google’s powerful and freely available AI models have helped fuel the rise of AI content, some of which is aimed at spreading misinformation and harassing individuals. Creators and influencers fear their brands could be tainted by a flood of AI videos that show them saying and doing things that never happened—even lawmakers are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/senates-no-fakes-act-hopes-to-make-unauthorized-digital-replicas-illegal/">fretting about this</a>. Google has placed a large bet on the value of AI content, so banning AI from YouTube, as many want, simply isn’t happening.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, YouTube promised tools that would flag face-stealing AI content on the platform. The likeness detection tool, which is similar to the site’s copyright detection system, has now expanded beyond the initial small group of testers. YouTube says the first batch of eligible creators have been notified that they can use likeness detection, but interested parties will need to hand Google even more personal information to get protection from AI fakes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/youtube-rolls-out-likeness-detection-to-help-creators-combat-ai-fakes/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, a group of researchers won the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634021001537">for discovering</a> that many mammals are capable of breathing through their anus. But as with many Ig Nobel awards, there is a serious side to the seeming silliness. The same group has conducted <a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666634025003149%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">a new study</a> on the feasibility of adapting this method to treat people with blocked airways or clogged lungs, with promising results that bring rectal oxygen delivery one step closer to medical reality.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/meet-the-winners-of-the-2024-ig-nobel-prizes/">previously reported</a>, this is perhaps one of the more unusual research developments to come out of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated shortages of ventilators and artificial lungs to assist patients’ breathing and prevent respiratory failure. The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center team took their inspiration from the humble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loach">loach</a>, a freshwater bottom-dwelling fish found throughout Eurasia and northern Africa. The loach (along with sea cucumbers) employs intestinal breathing (i.e., through the anus) rather than gills to survive under hypoxic conditions, thanks to having lots of capillary vessels in its intestine. The technical term is enteral ventilation via anus (EVA).</p>
<p>Would such a novel breathing method work in mammals? The team thought it might be possible and undertook experiments with mice and micro-pigs to test that hypothesis. They drew upon earlier research by Leland Clark, also of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, who invented a perfluorocarbon liquid called Oxycyte as a possible form of artificial blood. That vision never materialized, although it did provide a handy plot point for the 1989 film <em>The Abyss</em>, in which a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFFpMqs9kbI">rat is able to “breathe”</a> in a similar liquid.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/butt-breathing-might-soon-be-a-real-medical-treatment/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A year after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/cards-against-humanity-sues-spacex-alleges-invasion-of-land-on-us-mexico-border/">suing SpaceX</a> for “invading” a plot of land on the US/Mexico border, Cards Against Humanity says it has obtained a settlement and will provide supporters with a new pack of cards about Elon Musk.</p>
<p>The party-game company bought the land in 2017 in an attempt to stymie President Trump’s wall-building project, but alleged that SpaceX illegally took over the land and filled it with construction equipment and materials. A <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cah-vs-spacex.pdf">September 2024 lawsuit</a> filed against SpaceX in Cameron County District Court in Texas sought up to $15 million to cover the cost of restoring the property and other damages.</p>
<p>Cards Against Humanity, which bought the property with donations from supporters, told Ars today that “we’ve been in negotiations with SpaceX for much of the last year. We held out for the best settlement we could get—almost until the trial was supposed to start—and unfortunately part of that negotiation was that we’re not allowed to discuss specific settlement terms. They did admit to trespassing during the discovery phase, which was very validating.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/cards-against-humanity-gets-settlement-from-spacex-plans-pack-of-elon-musk-cards/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[It's a gorgeous tablet, but what does an iPad need with more processing power?]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>This year’s iPad Pro is what you might call a “chip refresh” or an “internal refresh.” These refreshes are what Apple generally does for its products for one or two or more years after making a larger external design change. Leaving the physical design alone preserves compatibility with the accessory ecosystem.</p>
<p>For the Mac, chip refreshes are still pretty exciting to me, because many people who use a Mac will, very occasionally, assign it some kind of task where they need it to work as hard and fast as it can, for an extended period of time. You could be a developer compiling a large and complex app, or you could be a podcaster or streamer editing or exporting an audio or video file, or maybe you’re just playing a game. The power and flexibility of the operating system, and first- and third-party apps made to take advantage of that power and flexibility, mean that “more speed” is still exciting, even if it takes a few years for that speed to add up to something users will consistently notice and appreciate.</p>
<p>And then there’s the iPad Pro. Especially since Apple shifted to using the same M-series chips that it uses in Macs, most iPad Pro reviews contain some version of “this is great hardware that is much faster than it needs to be for anything the iPad does.” To wit, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/m4-ipad-pro-review-well-now-youre-just-showing-off/">our review of the M4 iPad Pro</a> from May 2024:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/testing-apples-m5-ipad-pro-future-proofing-for-apples-perennial-overkill-tablet/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>When I’m asked to recommend a Mac laptop for people, Apple’s low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro usually gets lost in the shuffle. It competes with the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air, significantly cheaper computers that meet or exceed the “good enough” boundary for the vast majority of computer users. The basic MacBook Pro also doesn’t have the benefit of Apple’s Pro or Max-series chips, which come with many more CPU cores, substantially better graphics performance, and higher memory capacity for true professionals and power users.</p>
<p>But the low-end Pro makes sense for a certain type of power user. At $1,599, it’s the cheapest way to get Apple’s best laptop screen, with mini LED technology, a higher 120 Hz ProMotion refresh rate for smoother scrolling and animations, and the optional but lovely nano-texture (read: matte) finish. Unlike the MacBook Air, it comes with a cooling fan, which has historically meant meaningfully better sustained performance and less performance throttling. And it’s also Apple’s cheapest laptop with three Thunderbolt ports, an HDMI port, and an SD card slot, all genuinely useful for people who want to plug lots of things in without having multiple dongles or a bulky dock competing for the Air’s two available ports.</p>
<p>If you don’t find any of those arguments in the basic MacBook Pro’s favor convincing, that’s fine. The new M5 version makes almost no changes to the laptop other than the chip, so it’s unlikely to change your calculus if you already looked at the M3 or M4 version and passed it up. But it <em>is</em> the first Mac to ship with <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/">the M5</a>, the first chip in Apple’s fifth-generation chip family and a preview of what’s to come for (<a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">almost</a>?) every other Mac in the lineup. So you can at least be interested in the 14-inch MacBook Pro as a showcase for a new processor, if not as a retail product in and of itself.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/m5-macbook-pro-review-fifth-generation-apple-silicon-in-a-familiar-wrapper/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google’s Fi cellular service is <a href="http://blog.google/products/google-fi-wireless/ai-updates-auto-connect-bill-summaries">getting an upgrade</a>, and since this is 2025, there’s plenty of AI involved. You’ll be able to ask Google AI questions about your bill, and a different variation of AI will improve call quality. AI haters need not despair—there are also some upgrades to connectivity and Fi web features.</p>
<p>As part of this update, a new Gemini-powered chatbot will soon be turned loose on your billing statements. The idea is that you can get bill summaries and ask specific questions of the robot without waiting for a real person. Google claims that testers have had positive experiences with the AI billing bot, so it’s rolling the feature out widely.</p>
<p>Next month, Google also plans to flip the switch on an AI audio enhancement. The new “optimized audio” will use AI to filter out background sounds like wind or crowd noise. If you’re using a Pixel, you already have a similar feature for your end of the call. However, this update will reduce background noise on the other end as well. Google’s MVNO has also added support for HD and HD+ calling on supported connections.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-fi-is-getting-enhanced-web-calls-and-messaging-ai-bill-summaries/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday afternoon, <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">Amazon confirmed</a> that an outage affecting Amazon Web Services’ cloud hosting, which had impacted millions across the Internet, had been resolved.</p>
<p>Considered the worst outage since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">last year’s CrowdStrike chaos</a>, Amazon’s outage caused “global turmoil,” Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazons-cloud-unit-reports-outage-several-websites-down-2025-10-20/">reported</a>. AWS is the world’s largest cloud provider and, therefore, the “backbone of much of the Internet,” ZDNet <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/the-massive-aws-outage-that-broke-half-the-internet-is-finally-over-heres-what-happened/">noted</a>. Ultimately, more than 28 AWS services were disrupted, causing perhaps billions in damages, one analyst <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/amazon-tech-outage-10-20-25-intl">estimated</a> for CNN.</p>
<p>Popular apps like Snapchat, Signal, and Reddit went dark. Flights got delayed. Banks and financial services went down. Massive games like <em>Fortnite</em> could not be accessed. Some of Amazon’s own services were hit, too, including its e-commerce platform, Alexa, and Prime Video. Ultimately, millions of businesses simply stopped operating, unable to log employees into their systems or accept payments for their goods.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/amazons-dns-problem-knocked-out-half-the-web-likely-costing-billions/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In May 2025, the European Parliament changed the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20250502IPR28221/wolves-meps-agree-to-change-eu-protection-status">status of wolves</a> in the EU from “strictly protected” to “protected,” which opened the way for its member states to allow hunting under certain conditions, such as protecting livestock. One of the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/5d017e4e-9efc-11ee-b164-01aa75ed71a1/language-en">arguments</a> behind this change was that the “tolerance of modern society towards wolves” led to the emergence of “fearless wolves” that are no longer afraid of people.</p>
<p>“Regulators made it clear, though, that there is no scientific evidence to back this up,” says Michael Clinchy, a zoologist at Western University in London, Canada. “So we did the first-of-its-kind study to find out if wolves have really lost their fear of humans. We proved there is no such thing as a fearless wolf.”</p>
<h2>Red riding hood</h2>
<p>The big bad wolf trope is found in plenty of our myths and fables, with Little Red Riding Hood being probably the most famous example. This mythical fear of wolves, combined with real damage to livestock, led to extensive hunting. By the mid-20th century, we’d pushed wolves to the verge of extinction in Western and Central Europe. Human-wolf encounters became very rare, and the big bad wolf myth faded away. But starting in the 1970s, wolves became a protected species across Europe and North America, which caused wolf populations to bounce back and reoccupy some of their old habitats.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/even-with-protections-wolves-still-fear-humans/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This week, the Protocol proposed the first update in a decade to how it measures power-sector emissions, in a move that would upend the way many tech, industrial, and utilities groups account for clean energy investments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/big-tech-may-fall-short-of-green-energy-targets-due-to-proposed-rule-changes/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>However the question of what happened to flight 1093, and its severely damaged front window, appears to be answered in the form of a weather balloon.</p>
<p>“I think this was a WindBorne balloon,” Kai Marshland, co-founder of the weather prediction company WindBorne Systems, told Ars in an email on Monday evening. “We learned about UA1093 and the potential that it was related to one of our balloons at 11 pm PT on Sunday and immediately looked into it. At 6 am PT, we sent our preliminary investigation to both NTSB and FAA, and are working with both of them to investigate further.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/the-mystery-object-that-struck-a-plane-in-flight-it-was-probably-a-weather-balloon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge has ordered spyware maker <a href="https://www.nsogroup.com/">NSO</a> to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.350613/gov.uscourts.cand.350613.802.0.pdf">ruling</a>, issued Friday by Phyllis J. Hamilton of the US District Court of the District of Northern California, grants a permanent injunction sought by WhatsApp owner Meta in a case it brought against NSO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">in 2019</a>. The lawsuit alleged that Meta caught NSO trying to surreptitiously infect about 1,400 mobile phones—many belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials—with Pegasus. As part of the campaign, NSO created fake WhatsApp accounts and targeted Meta infrastructure. The suit sought monetary awards and an injunction against the practice.</p>
<h2>Setting a precedent</h2>
<p>Friday’s ruling ordered NSO to permanently cease targeting WhatsApp users, attempting to infect their devices, or intercepting WhatsApp messages, which are end-to-end encrypted using the open source <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/why-signals-post-quantum-makeover-is-an-amazing-engineering-achievement/">Signal Protocol</a>. Hamilton also ruled that NSO must delete any data it obtained when targeting the WhatsApp users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/nso-permanently-barred-from-targeting-whatsapp-users-with-pegasus-spyware/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA acting Administrator Sean Duffy made two television appearances on Monday morning in which he shook up the space agency’s plans to return humans to the Moon.</p>
<p>Speaking on Fox News, where the secretary of transportation frequently appears in his acting role as NASA chief, Duffy said SpaceX has fallen behind in its efforts to develop the Starship vehicle as a lunar lander. Duffy also indirectly acknowledged that NASA’s projected target of a 2027 crewed lunar landing is no longer achievable. Accordingly, he said he intended to expand the competition to develop a lander capable of carrying humans down to the Moon from lunar orbit and back.</p>
<p>“They’re behind schedule, and so the President wants to make sure we beat the Chinese,” <a href="https://x.com/SecDuffyNASA/status/1980243865400701369">Duffy said</a> of SpaceX. “He wants to get there in his term. So I’m in the process of opening that contract up. I think we’ll see companies like Blue [Origin] get involved, and maybe others. We’re going to have a space race in regard to American companies competing to see who can actually lead us back to the Moon first.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/nasas-acting-leader-seeks-to-keep-his-job-with-new-lunar-lander-announcement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic has <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-on-the-web">added web and mobile interfaces</a> for Claude Code, its immensely popular command-line interface (CLI) agentic AI coding tool.</p>
<p>The web interface appears to be well-baked at launch, but the mobile version is limited to iOS and is in an earlier stage of development.</p>
<p>The web version of Claude Code can be given access to a GitHub repository. Once that’s done, developers can give it general marching orders like “add real-time inventory tracking to the dashboard.” As with the CLI version, it gets to work, with updates along the way approximating where it’s at and what it’s doing. The web interface supports the recently implemented Claude Code capability to take suggestions or requested changes while it’s in the middle of working on a task. (Previously, if you saw it doing something wrong or missing something, you often had to cancel and start over.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">Read full article</a></p>
