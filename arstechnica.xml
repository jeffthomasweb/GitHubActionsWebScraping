              <![CDATA[<p>Some electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are set to get less affordable from next year, it seems. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/">As expected</a>, the incoming Trump administration has set its sights on killing off the IRS clean vehicle tax credit, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/">a report in Reuters</a> this afternoon.</p>
<p>The clean vehicle tax credit was overhauled as part of President Joe Biden's signature climate legislation. Until then, the size of a plug-in vehicle's tax credit was based on its battery capacity, with a credit of up to $7,500 available. But from 2023 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-ev-tax-credit-for-2023/">the rules changed</a>, requiring a certain amount of domestic production to qualify, as well as adding price and income caps to address criticism that the tax credit mostly subsidized the already-wealthy.</p>
<p>Far fewer vehicles are now eligible for the rebate at time of purchase, particularly after the US Treasury Department <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/its-a-new-year-and-these-are-now-the-only-evs-that-get-a-tax-credit/">got tougher about Chinese content</a>, although a loophole means that none of these conditions apply to leased EVs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/trump-team-puts-ev-tax-credit-on-the-block-tesla-is-on-board-report/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Generic install media brings Arm PCs closer to feeling like any old x86 PC. ]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>For some PC buyers, doing a clean install of Windows right out of the box is part of the setup ritual. But for Arm-based PCs, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">the Copilot+ PCs</a> with Snapdragon X Plus and Elite chips in them, it hasn't been possible in the same way. Microsoft (mostly) hasn't offered generic install media that can be used to reinstall Windows on an Arm PC from scratch.</p>
<p>Microsoft is fixing that today—the company finally has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11arm64">a download page</a> for the official Arm release of Windows 11, linked to but separate from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11">the ISOs for the x86 versions of Windows</a>. These are useful not just for because-I-feel-like-it clean installs, but for reinstalling Windows after you've upgraded your SSD and setting up Windows virtual machines on Arm-based PCs and Macs.</p>
<p>Previously, Microsoft did offer install media for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso">some Windows Insider Preview Arm builds</a>, though these are for beta versions of Windows that may or may not be feature-complete or stable. Various apps, scripts, and websites also exist to grab files from Microsoft's servers and build "unofficial" ISOs for the Arm version of Windows, though obviously this is more complicated than just downloading a single file directly.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-makes-it-easier-to-do-a-clean-windows-install-on-arm-based-pcs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Without question, inactivity is bad for us. Prolonged sitting is <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2793521">consistently linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and death</a>. The obvious response to this frightful fate is to not sit— move. Even <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069820">a few moments of exercise</a> can have benefits, <a href="https://exerciseismedicine.gr/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Breaking_Up_Prolonged_Sitting.pdf">studies suggest</a>. But in our modern times, sitting is hard to avoid, especially at the office. This has led to a range of strategies to get ourselves up, including the rise of standing desks. If you have to be tethered to a desk, at least you can do it while on your feet, the thinking goes.</p>
<p>However, studies on whether standing desks are beneficial have been sparse and sometimes inconclusive. Further, prolonged standing can have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076480/">its own risks,</a> and data on work-related sitting has also been mixed. While the final verdict on standing desks is still unclear, two studies out this year offer some of the most nuanced evidence yet about the potential benefits and risks of working on your feet.</p>
<h2>Take a seat</h2>
<p>For years, studies have pointed to standing desks improving markers for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33813968/">cardiovascular and metabolic health</a>, such as lipid levels, insulin resistance, and arterial flow-mediated dilation (the ability of arteries to widen in response to increased blood flow). But it's unclear how significant those improvements are to averting bad health outcomes, such as heart attacks. One 2018 analysis <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7749276/">suggested the benefits might be minor</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/a-standing-desk-wont-improve-your-heart-health-but-it-wont-hurt-it-either/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 2017, eight machine-learning researchers at Google released a groundbreaking research paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"><em>Attention Is All You Need</em></a>, which introduced the <a href="https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding/">Transformer</a> AI architecture that underpins almost all of today's high-profile generative AI models.</p>
<p>The Transformer has made a key component of the modern AI boom possible by translating (or transforming, if you will) input chunks of data called "tokens" into another desired form of output using a neural network. Variations of the Transformer architecture power language models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>), audio synthesis models that run Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/">NotebookLM</a> and OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/when-counting-quickly-openais-new-voice-mode-stops-to-catch-its-breath/">Advanced Voice Mode</a>, video synthesis models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">Sora</a>, and image synthesis models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/a-crazy-update-midjourney-v6-upgrade-heaps-on-ai-generated-detail/">Midjourney</a>.</p>

Amazon's <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/kindle-colorsoft/">Colorsoft</a> began shipping on October 30, but shipments were paused after some customers complained about a yellow bar at the bottom of the screen and discoloration around the edges. Amazon is working on a fix and is offering a replacement or refund.</p>
<p>That's where another problem comes in. Leading up to the launch, Amazon ran a promotion advertising that its customers could trade in their old Kindle for a 20 percent discount on the Colorsoft. And some of those customers are now returning their new Colorsoft due to the yellow bar defect—leaving them without an e-reader altogether. Amazon has yet to provide any concrete information on when the fix will be ready for the Colorsoft and when it will resume shipping. It's a mess.</p>
<p>It started with an advertisement for a limited-time discount on the Colorsoft via Amazon's <a href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6WnbuGMnBi62tSK9b8oR7uNhrHV4j3k9iATSKivYVBSW5vrF6WM2kmYUub5NPUSzucdp3bW9PCx9uQUFWP6Uz6AxD2wj97bLFKEAfoCbzYRfk9W6e42c8nBwgXFCP3MH1H53g7VHkJU7W5DbepVHHRKwnjrfhGZPBaSZJUiciDZnr18QPQoBnt7ibQiGpU?xid=fr1731593242757ggf">trade-in program</a>. If the <a href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6hMwZ5F1cAhMhWTh1Cy9zckK5s32FHG2g9LbXqGHtPEfJcKwfBBSdkEHD7Any28cJBGrKE1bXSXS7TAkEBmTPdzJNaMx59kLtVUwtybgWwYFEYJrPxb9Z2QVonYS7gZJ4tnfaC?xid=fr1731593242758jjb">device was eligible</a>, you had to answer a few questions about its condition and then ship it off. Once Amazon appraises it, the trade-in value appears in the form of an Amazon gift card. Amazon also offered an additional 20 percent off the Colorsoft along with the trade-in credit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/faulty-colorsofts-have-left-some-kindle-owners-without-an-e-reader/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>It's Half-Life 2 week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of Half-Life 2—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day leading up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>When millions of eager gamers first installed <i>Half-Life 2</i> 20 years ago, many, if not most, of them found they needed to install another piece of software alongside it. Few at the time could imagine that piece of companion software–with the pithy name Steam–would eventually become the key distribution point and social networking center for the entire PC gaming ecosystem, making the idea of physical PC games an anachronism in the process.</p>
<p>While <i>Half-Life 2</i> wasn’t the first Valve game released on Steam, it was the first high-profile title to require the platform, even for players installing the game from physical retail discs. That requirement gave Valve access to millions of gamers with new Steam accounts and helped the company bypass traditional retail publishers of the day by directly marketing and selling its games (and, eventually, games from other developers). But 2004-era Steam also faced a vociferous backlash from players who saw the software as a piece of nuisance DRM (digital rights management) that did little to justify its existence at the time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The holiday season is fast approaching, and with it, all manner of uncomfortable conversations with relatives who think they know a lot about a lot but are in fact just walking examples of Dunning-Kruger in action. Not going home is always an option—there's no reason you should spend your free time with people you can't stand, after all. But if you are headed home and are not looking forward to having to converse with your uncle or parent over heaped plates of turkey and potatoes, we put together some talking points to debunk their more nonsensical claims about electric vehicles.</p>
<h2>Charging an EV takes too long</h2>
<p>The No. 1 complaint from people with no experience with driving or living with an electric car, cited as a reason for why they will never get an EV, is that it takes too long to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/">recharge them</a>. On the one hand, this attitude is understandable. For more than a century, humans have become accustomed to vehicles that can be refueled in minutes, using very energy-dense liquids that can be pumped into a fuel tank at a rate of up to 10 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>By contrast, batteries are not at all fast to recharge, particularly if you plug into an AC charger. Even the fastest fast-charging EVs connected to a fast DC fast charger will still need between 18–20 minutes to go from 10 to 80 percent state of charge, and that, apparently, is more time than some curmudgeons are prepared to wait as they drive from coast to coast as fast as they possibly can.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/heres-how-to-survive-your-relatives-ignorant-anti-ev-rant-this-thanksgiving/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Having two displays in a single device is a growing trend that appeals to people with limited desk space or who need extra pixels to work with when on the go. But often, dual-screen devices, like laptops, are loaded with trade-offs that detract from the convenience two screens should provide.</p>
<p>I've tried using dual-screen laptops as my primary display/computing device before. But if I were to buy a dual-screen gadget today, it would be a dual-screen portable monitor. After spending the last month using a dual-screen portable monitor as my main work display, I believe that laptops should leave the dual-display thing to portable monitors. At least for now.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>BioWare’s reputation as a AAA game development studio is built on three pillars: world-building, storytelling, and character development. <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Codex">In-game codices</a> offer textual support for fan theories, replays are kept fresh by systems that encourage experimenting with alternative quest resolutions, and players get so attached to their characters that an entire fan-built ecosystem of player-generated fiction and artwork has sprung up over the years.</p>
<p>After two very publicly disappointing releases with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/early-review-mass-effect-andromeda-is-dragon-age-inquisition-in-space/"><i>Mass Effect: Andromeda</i></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/"><i>Anthem</i></a>, BioWare pivoted back to the formula that brought it success, but I’m wrapping up the first third of <i>The Veilguard</i>, and it feels like there’s an ingredient missing from the special sauce. Where are the quests that really let me agonize over the potential repercussions of my choices?</p>
<p>I love <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Thedas">Thedas</a>, and I love the ragtag group of friends my hero has to assemble anew in each game, but what really gets me going as a roleplayer are the morally ambiguous questions that make me squirm: the dreadful and delicious BioWare decisions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-the-choices-you-make-while-saving-the-world/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Incremental improvements across the hardware and software stacks add up.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>There's a general consensus that we won't be able to consistently perform sophisticated quantum calculations without the development of error-corrected quantum computing, which is unlikely to arrive until the end of the decade. It's still an open question, however, whether we could perform limited but useful calculations at an earlier point. IBM is one of the companies that's betting the answer is yes, and on Wednesday, it announced a series of developments aimed at making that possible.</p>
<p>On their own, none of the changes being announced are revolutionary. But collectively, changes across the hardware and software stacks have produced much more efficient and less error-prone operations. The net result is a system that supports the most complicated calculations yet on IBM's hardware, leaving the company optimistic that its users will find some calculations where quantum hardware provides an advantage.</p>
<h2>Better hardware and software</h2>
<p>IBM's early efforts in the quantum computing space saw it ramp up the qubit count rapidly, being one of the first companies to reach the 1,000 qubit count. However, each of those qubits had an error rate that ensured that any algorithms that tried to use all of these qubits in a single calculation would inevitably trigger one. Since then, the company's focus has been on improving the performance of smaller processors. Wednesday's announcement was based on the introduction of the second version of its Heron processor, which has 156 qubits (up from an earlier 133 in Revision 1). That's still beyond the capability of simulations on classical computers, should it be able to operate with sufficiently low errors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/ibm-boosts-the-amount-of-computation-you-can-get-done-on-quantum-hardware/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump today <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113472884874740859">announced</a> that a new Department of Government Efficiency—or "DOGE"—will be led by Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk and Ramaswamy, who founded pharma company Roivant Sciences, "will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies," according to the Trump statement on Truth Social.</p>
<p>DOGE apparently will not be an official federal agency, as Trump said it will provide advice "from outside" of government. But Musk, who has frequently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/12/musk-embraces-trump-and-scorns-subsidies-but-tesla-still-lobbies-for-us-benefits.html">criticized government subsidies</a> despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/spacex-blasts-fcc-as-it-refuses-to-reinstate-starlinks-886-million-grant/">seeking public money</a> and obtaining various subsidies for his <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html">own companies</a>, will apparently have significant influence over spending in the Trump administration. Musk has also had numerous legal disputes with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/court-orders-elon-musk-to-testify-for-sec-rejects-his-claim-of-harassment/">regulators</a> at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/us-government-slams-musk-in-court-filing-describing-chaotic-environment-at-x/">agencies</a> that regulate his companies.</p>
<p>"Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of 'DOGE' for a very long time," Trump said. "To drive this kind of drastic change, the Department of Government Efficiency will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &amp; Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-says-elon-musk-will-lead-doge-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>By now, it has been firmly established that the Earth went through a series of global glaciations around 600 million to 700 million years ago, shortly before complex animal life exploded in the Cambrian. Climate models have confirmed that, once enough of a dark ocean is covered by reflective ice, it sets off a cooling feedback that turns the entire planet into an icehouse. And we've found glacial material that was deposited off the coasts in the tropics.</p>
<p>We have an extremely incomplete picture of what these snowball periods looked like, and Antarctic terrain provides different models for what an icehouse continent might look like. But now, researchers have found deposits that they argue were formed beneath a massive ice sheet that was being melted from below by volcanic activity. And, although the deposits are currently in Colorado's Front Range, at the time they resided much closer to the equator.</p>
<h2>In the icehouse</h2>
<p>Glacial deposits can be difficult to identify in deep time. Massive sheets of ice will scour the terrain down to bare rock, leaving behind loosely consolidated bits of rubble that can easily be swept away after the ice is gone. We can spot when that rubble shows up in ocean deposits to confirm there were glaciers along the coast, but rubble can be difficult to find on land.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/what-did-the-snowball-earth-look-like/">Read full article</a></p>

This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of </em>Half-Life 2<em>—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>There has been some debate about which product was the first modern “triple-A” video game, but ask most people and one answer is sure to at least be a contender: Valve’s <em>Half-Life 2</em>.</p>
<p>For Western PC games, <em>Half-Life 2</em> set a standard that held strong in developers’ ambitions and in players’ expectations for well over a decade. Despite that, there’s only so much new ground it truly broke in terms of how games are made and designed—it’s just that most games didn’t have the same commitment to scope, scale, and polish all at the same time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-valve-made-half-life-2-and-set-a-new-standard-for-future-games/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The classic PC games market is "in a sorry state," according to DRM-free and classic-minded storefront GOG. Small games that aren't currently selling get abandoned, and compatibility issues arise as technology moves forward or as one-off development ideas age like milk.</p>
<p>Classic games are only 20 percent of GOG's catalog, and the firm hasn't actually called itself "Good Old Games" in 12 years. And yet, today, GOG announces that it is making "a significant commitment of resources" toward a new GOG Preservation Program. It starts with 100 games for which GOG's own developers are working to create current and future compatibility, keeping them DRM-free and giving them ongoing tech support, along with granting them a "Good Old Game: Preserved by GOG" stamp.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Firefly Aerospace, a Texas-based company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/firefly-returns-from-the-dead-with-a-larger-rocket-and-lunar-aspirations/">resurrected from bankruptcy</a>, is riding high these days. In a few months, Firefly will attempt to become the second company to safely place a commercial lander on the Moon. Firefly's Alpha rocket has reached orbit four times, and engineers are developing a larger medium-class rocket in partnership with Northrop Grumman, one of the largest US aerospace and defense contractors.</p>
<p>There's also an orbital transfer vehicle, named Elytra, in Firefly's diversified portfolio. This diversification is proving attractive to investors. Firefly announced Tuesday that it completed a $175 million Series D fundraising round, resulting in a valuation of more than $2 billion. This follows a banner year of fundraising in 2023, when Firefly reported investors funneled approximately $300 million into the company at a valuation of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>"Firefly is extremely grateful for our existing and new investors whose support demonstrates a huge vote of confidence in our capabilities and future," said Jason Kim, who took over as the company's CEO in October. He replaced Bill Weber, who resigned as chief executive after reports of an alleged inappropriate relationship with a female employee.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/firefly-aerospace-rakes-in-more-cash-as-competitors-struggle-for-footing/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Tesla has issued yet another recall for the angular, unpainted Cybertruck. This is the sixth recall affecting the model-year 2024 Cybertruck to be issued since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/tesla-under-new-nhtsa-investigation-fined-for-dumping-toxic-waste/">January</a>, and it affects 2,431 vehicles in total. And this time, there's no fix being delivered by a software update over the air—owners will need to have their pickup trucks physically repaired.</p>
<p>The problem is <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V832-7628.PDF">a faulty drive unit inverter</a>, which stranded a Cybertruck at the end of July. Tesla says it started investigating the problem a week later and by late October arrived at the conclusion that it had made a bad batch of inverters that it used in production vehicles from November 6, 2023, until July 30, 2024. After a total of five failures and warranty claims that the company says "may be related to the condition," Tesla issued a recall.</p>
<p>Tesla is often able to fix defects in its products by pushing out new software, something that leads many fans of the brand to get defensive over the topic. Although there is no requirement for a safety recall to involve some kind of hardware fix—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/more-than-20-of-vehicle-recalls-are-software-fixes-now/">20 percent of all car recalls are now software fixes</a>—in this case, the solution to the failing inverters very much requires a technician to work on the affected trucks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/tesla-recalls-cybertrucks-for-faulty-inverter-the-6th-recall-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Teixeira was arrested last year for sharing hundreds of pages of information online, some of which detailed national security secrets tied to US foreign adversaries and allies, including Russia, China, Ukraine, and South Korea. He secured the documents through his position at a Massachusetts military base, hoping to impress his young military-obsessed friends in a Discord group called "Thug Shaker Central."</p>
<p>Back in March, Teixeira <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/discord-leaker-jack-teixeira-pleads-guilty-seeks-light-11-year-sentence/">pled guilty</a> to six counts of “willful retention and transmission of national defense information." But in taking a plea deal, he got the government's bigger spy charges tossed, avoiding a much longer possible maximum sentence of 60 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/discord-admin-gets-15-years-for-one-of-the-most-significant-leaks-in-us-history/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A British Columbia teen who contracted Canada's first known human case of H5 bird flu has deteriorated swiftly in recent days and is now in critical condition, health officials reported Tuesday.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2024HLTH0152-001583">The teen's case was announced Saturday</a> by provincial health officials, who noted that the teen had no obvious exposure to animals that could explain an infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza. The teen tested positive for H5 bird flu at BC's public health laboratory, and the result is currently being confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>The teen's case reportedly began with conjunctivitis, echoing the H5N1 human case reports in the US. The case then progressed to fever and cough, and the teen was admitted to BC's Children's hospital late Friday. The teen's condition varied throughout the weekend but had taken a turn for the worse by Tuesday, according to BC provincial health officer Bonnie Henry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/teen-in-critical-condition-with-canadas-first-human-case-of-h5-bird-flu/">Read full article</a></p>
