                            <![CDATA[<p>Breast cancer. Colon cancer. An enlarged thyroid gland. A family history of tumors and cancers as well. It wasn't until the woman developed an annoying case of dry mouth that doctors put it all together. By then, she was in her 60s.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2835072">a new case study in JAMA Dermatology</a>, the woman presented to a dermatology clinic in Spain after three months of oral unpleasantness. They noted the cancers in her medical history. When she opened wide, doctors immediately saw the problem: Her tongue was covered in little wart-like bumps that resembled a slippery, flesh-colored cobblestone path. (Image <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dim250007f1_1748619232.52078.png">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Such a cobblestone tongue is a telltale sign of a rare genetic condition called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525984/">Cowden syndrome</a>. It's caused by inherited mutations that break a protein, called PTEN, leading to tumors and cancers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/after-a-series-of-tumors-womans-odd-looking-tongue-explains-everything/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nearly two weeks have passed since Jared Isaacman received a fateful, brief phone call from two officials in President Trump's Office of Personnel Management. In those few seconds, the trajectory of his life over the next three and a half years changed dramatically.</p>
<p>The president, the callers said, wanted to go in a different direction for NASA's administrator. At the time, Isaacman was within days of a final vote on the floor of the US Senate and assured of bipartisan support. He had run the gauntlet of six months of vetting, interviews, and a committee hearing. He expected to be sworn in within a week. And then, it was all gone.</p>
<p>"I was very disappointed, especially because it was so close to confirmation and I think we had a good plan to implement," Isaacman told Ars on Wednesday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/what-might-have-been-at-jared-isaacmans-nasa/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple this week provided a glimpse into a feature that solves one of the biggest drawbacks of passkeys, the industry-wide standard for website and app authentication that isn't susceptible to credential phishing and other attacks targeting passwords.</p>
<p>The import/export feature, which Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/279/?time=1152">demonstrated</a> at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference, will be available in the next major releases of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. It aims to solve one of the biggest shortcomings of passkeys as they have existed to date. Passkeys created on one operating system or credential manager are largely bound to those environments. A passkey created on a Mac, for instance, can sync easily enough with other Apple devices connected to the same iCloud account. Transferring them to a Windows device or even a dedicated credential manager installed on the same Apple device has been impossible.</p>
<h2>Growing pains</h2>
<p>That limitation has led to criticisms that passkeys are a power play by large companies to lock users into specific product ecosystems. Users have also rightly worried that the lack of transferability increases the risk of getting locked out of important accounts if a device storing passkeys is lost, stolen, or destroyed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/apple-previews-new-import-export-feature-to-make-passkeys-more-interoperable/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, electronics engineer Lorentio Brodesco <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/psx/comments/1l47s0o/for_the_first_time_ever_a_ps1_motherboard_not/">announced</a> the completion of a mock-up for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brodesco/nsone-playstation-1-custom-motherboard">nsOne</a>, reportedly the first custom PlayStation 1 motherboard created outside of Sony in the console's 30-year history. The fully functional board accepts original PlayStation 1 chips and fits directly into the original console case, marking a milestone in reverse-engineering for the classic console released in 1994.</p>
<p>Brodesco's motherboard isn't an emulator or FPGA-based re-creation—it's a genuine circuit board designed to work with authentic PlayStation 1 components, including the CPU, GPU, SPU, RAM, oscillators, and voltage regulators. The board represents over a year of <a href="https://x.com/LBrodesco44460/status/1769683646150008938">reverse-engineering work</a> that began in March 2024 when Brodesco discovered incomplete documentation while repairing a PlayStation 1.</p>
<p>"This isn't an emulator. It's not an FPGA. It's not a modern replica," Brodesco wrote in a Reddit post about the project. "It's a real motherboard, compatible with the original PS1 chips."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/engineer-creates-first-custom-motherboard-for-1990s-playstation-console/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>When major events occur, most people rush to Google to find information. Increasingly, the first thing they see is an AI Overview, a feature that already has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">reputation for making glaring mistakes</a>. In the wake of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/12/world/india-plane-crash-ahmedabad">tragic plane crash in India</a>, Google's AI search results are spreading misinformation claiming the incident involved an Airbus plane—it was actually a Boeing 787.</p>
<p>Travelers are more attuned to the airliner models these days after a spate of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/initial-findings-put-boeings-software-at-center-of-ethiopian-737-crash/">crashes involving Boeing's 737 lineup</a> several years ago. Searches for airline disasters are sure to skyrocket in the coming days, with reports that more than 200 passengers and crew lost their lives in the Air India Flight 171 crash. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/">The way generative AI operates</a> means some people searching for details may get the wrong impression from Google's results page.</p>
<p>Not all searches get AI answers, but Google has been steadily <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/">expanding this feature</a> since it debuted last year. One searcher on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1l9lymm/google_is_showing_it_was_an_airbus_aircraft_that/">spotted a troubling confabulation</a> when searching for crashes involving Airbus planes. AI Overviews, apparently overwhelmed with results reporting on the Air India crash, stated confidently (and incorrectly) that it was an Airbus A330 that fell out of the sky shortly after takeoff. We've run a few similar searches—some of the AI results say Boeing, some say Airbus, and some include a strange mashup of both Airbus and Boeing. It's a mess.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-ai-mistakenly-says-fatal-air-india-crash-involved-airbus-instead-of-boeing/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration has upended plans that state governments made to distribute $42 billion in federal broadband funding, forcing state officials to scrap much of the preparation work they did over the previous couple of years.</p>
<p>Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick essentially put the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program on hold earlier this year and last week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/ted-cruz-bill-states-that-regulate-ai-will-be-cut-out-of-42b-broadband-fund/">announced</a> details of a rules overhaul that requires states to change how they distribute money to Internet service providers. To find out how this affects states, we spoke with Andrew Butcher, president of the Maine Connectivity Authority (MCA).</p>
<p>"We had been in position to be making awards this month, but for [the Trump administration's] deliberations and program changes, so it's pretty unfortunate," Butcher told Ars. Established by a 2021 state law, the MCA is a quasi-governmental agency that oversees Maine's BEAD planning and other programs that increase broadband access.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/us-states-were-ready-to-spend-42-billion-on-broadband-then-trump-took-over/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's Pixel phones got a big update this week with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-begins-rolling-out-today-to-pixel-devices/">release of Android 16</a> and a batch of Pixel Drop features. Pixels now have enhanced security, new contact features, and improved button navigation. However, some of the most interesting features, like desktop windowing and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-reveals-vibrant-material-3-expressive-coming-soon-to-a-pixel-near-you/">Material 3 Expressive</a>, are coming later. Another thing that's coming later, it seems, is a fix for an annoying bug Google introduced a few months back.</p>
<p>Google broke the system dark mode schedule <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/329802543/schedule-dark-theme-is-not-working?hl=en">in its March Pixel update</a> and did not address it in time for Android 16. The company confirms a fix is coming, though.</p>
<p>The system-level dark theme arrives in Android 10 to offer a less eye-searing option, which is particularly handy in dark environments. It took a while for even Google's apps to fully adopt this feature, but support is solid five years later. Google even offers a scheduling feature to switch between light and dark mode at custom times or based on sunrise/sunset. However, the scheduling feature was busted in the March update.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/google-left-months-old-dark-mode-bug-in-android-16-fix-planned-for-next-pixel-drop/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Do you remember the Pirelli Cyber Tire? No, it's not an angular nightmare clad in stainless steel. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Rather, it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/heres-why-pirelli-is-putting-sensors-inside-its-new-tire-for-mclaren/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sensor-equipped tire that can </a><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/heres-why-pirelli-is-putting-sensors-inside-its-new-tire-for-mclaren/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inform the car</a> it's fitted to what's happening</span>, both with the tire itself and the road it's passing over.</span> The technology has slowly been making its way into the real world, starting with rarified stuff like the McLaren Artura. Now, Pirelli is going to put some Cyber Tires to work for everybody, not just supercar drivers, in a new pilot program with the regional government of Apulia in Italy.</p>
<p>The Cyber Tire has a sensor to monitor temperature and pressure, using Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with the car. The electronics are able to withstand more than 3,500 G as part of life on the road, and a 0.3-oz (10 g) battery keeps everything running for the life of the tire.</p>
<p>The idea was to develop a better tire pressure monitoring system, one that could tell the car exactly what kind of tire—summer, winter, all-season, and so on—was fitted, and even its state of wear, allowing the car to adapt its settings appropriately. But other applications suggested themselves—at a recent CES, Pirelli showed how a Cyber Tire could warn other road users about aquaplaning. Then again, we've been waiting more than a decade for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/potholes-abound-on-the-road-to-car-to-car-communication/">vehicle-to-vehicle communication</a> to make a difference in daily driving to no avail.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/smart-tires-will-report-on-the-health-of-roads-in-new-pilot-program/">Read full article</a></p>

Now, the tech giant is reportedly showing twice as many ads to subscribers as it did when it started selling ad-based streaming subscriptions.</p>
<p>Currently, anyone who signs up for Amazon Prime (which is $15 per month or $139 per year) gets Prime Video with ads. If they don’t want to see commercials, they have to pay an extra $3 per month. One can also subscribe to Prime Video alone for $9 per month with ads or $12 per month without ads.</p>
<p>When Amazon originally announced the ad tier, it said it would deliver “meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers." Based on “six ad buyers and documents” ad trade publication <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-doubles-prime-video-ad-load/">AdWeek</a> reported viewing, Amazon has determined the average is four to six minutes of advertisements per hour.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/amazon-prime-video-subscribers-sit-through-up-to-6-minutes-of-ads-per-hour/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Human vision relies on photoreceptor cells in the retina that react to visible light and trigger neurons in the optic nerve to send signals to the brain. Degradation of these photoreceptors is the leading cause of vision impairments, including blindness.</p>
<p>However, a team of scientists at China’s Fudan University has recently built prototype retinal implants that can replace the failing photoreceptors and potentially provide infrared vision as a bonus. Sadly, they’ve only been tested in animals, so we’re still rather far away from making them work like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>-style eye augments.</p>
<h2>Vision on chip</h2>
<p>Earlier work on retinal implants that restored at least some degree of vision to the blind involved using electrode arrays that electrically stimulated neurons in the back of the retina, taking the place of the damaged photoreceptor cells. A patient had to wear a camera mounted on a pair of glasses that sent signals to the implant to activate this signaling. These implants required a power source to work, were unreliable, difficult to use, and had limited resolution, and the surgical procedure necessary to put them in the eye was extremely complicated.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/experimental-retina-implants-give-mice-infrared-vision/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—When Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi introduced the new multitasking UI in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apple-aims-for-more-personal-and-expressive-ios-26-with-new-liquid-glass-design/">iPadOS 26</a> at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference this week, he did it the same way he introduced the Calculator app for the iPad last year or timers in the iPad's Clock app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/ipados-18-could-ship-with-built-in-calculator-app-after-14-calculator-less-years/">the year before</a>—with a hint of sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Wow," Federighi enthuses in a lightly exaggerated tone about an hour and 19 minutes into <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/101/">a 90-minute presentation</a>. "More windows, a pointier pointer, and a menu bar? Who would've thought? We've <em>truly</em> pulled off a <em>mind-blowing </em>release!"</p>
<p>This elicits a sensible chuckle from the gathered audience of developers, media, and Apple employees watching the keynote on the Apple Park campus, where I have grabbed myself a good-but-not-great seat to watch the largely pre-recorded keynote on a gigantic outdoor screen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apples-craig-federighi-on-the-long-road-to-the-ipads-mac-like-multitasking/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In early June, Apple researchers <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">released</a> a study suggesting that simulated reasoning (SR) models, such as OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">o1</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">o3</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">DeepSeek-R1</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking</a>, produce outputs consistent with pattern-matching from training data when faced with novel problems requiring systematic thinking. The researchers found similar results to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/">recent study by the United States of <span data-huuid="4951512150826999828">America Mathematical Olympiad</span></a> (USAMO) in April, showing that these same models achieved low scores on novel mathematical proofs.</p>
<p>The new study, titled "The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity," comes from a team at Apple led by Parshin Shojaee and Iman Mirzadeh, and it includes contributions from Keivan Alizadeh, Maxwell Horton, Samy Bengio, and Mehrdad Farajtabar.</p>
<p>The researchers examined what they call "large reasoning models" (LRMs), which attempt to simulate a logical reasoning process by producing a deliberative text output sometimes called "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">chain-of-thought</a> reasoning" that ostensibly assists with solving problems in a step-by-step fashion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/new-apple-study-challenges-whether-ai-models-truly-reason-through-problems/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>This coming weekend will see the annual 24 Hours of Le Mans take place in France. In total, <a href="https://assets.lemans.org/explorer/pdf/courses/2025/24-heures-du-mans/Affiches/guide-spotter-24h-2025.pdf">62 cars will compete</a>, split into three different classes. At the front of the field are the very fastest hypercars—wickedly fast prototypes that are also all hybrids, with the exception of the V12 Aston Martin Valkyries. In the middle are the pro-am LMP2s, followed by 24 GT3 cars—modified versions of performance cars that include everything from Ford Mustangs to McLaren 720s. It is racing nirvana. But with so many different makes and models of cars in the Hypercar class, some two-wheel drive, others with all-wheel drive, how do they ensure it's a fair race?</p>
<h2>Get ready for some acronyms</h2>
<p>Sports car racing can be (needlessly) complicated at times. Take the Hypercar class at Le Mans. The 21 cars that will contest it are actually built to two separate rulebooks.</p>
<p>One, called LMH (for Le Mans Hypercar), was written by the organizers of Le Mans and the World Endurance Championship. These prototypes can be hybrids, with the electric motor on the front axle: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/the-499p-meet-ferraris-beautiful-new-le-mans-hybrid-prototype/">Ferrari</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/peugeot-plans-to-win-le-mans-in-2022-with-this-9x8-hybrid-prototype/">Peugeot</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/toyota-wants-to-win-le-mans-with-its-new-gr010-hybrid-prototype/">Toyota</a> have all taken this route. But they don't have to be; the Aston Martin Valkyrie already had to lose a lot of power to meet the rules, so it just relies on its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/12-cylinders-11000rpm-aston-martins-new-engine-is-a-monster/">big V12</a> to do all the work.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Generative AI is permeating the Internet, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/cursor-ai-support-bot-invents-fake-policy-and-triggers-user-uproar/">chatbots</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/the-gmail-app-will-now-create-ai-summaries-whether-you-want-them-or-not/">AI summaries</a> popping up faster than we can keep track. Even Wikipedia, the vast repository of knowledge famously maintained by an army of <em>volunteer</em> human editors, is looking to add robots to the mix. The site began testing AI summaries in some articles over the past week, but the project has been frozen after editors voiced their opinions. And that opinion is: "yuck."</p>
<p>The seeds of this project were planted at Wikimedia's 2024 conference, where foundation representatives and editors <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Readers/2024_Reader_and_Donor_Experiences/Content_Discovery/Wikimania_2024,_%22Written_by_AI%22_How_do_editors_and_machines_collaborate_to_create_content">discussed</a> how AI could advance Wikipedia's mission. The wiki on the so-called "Simple Article Summaries" notes that the editors who participated in the discussion believed the summaries could improve learning on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/">404 Media</a>, Wikipedia announced the opt-in AI pilot on June 2, which was set to run for two weeks on the mobile version of the site. The summaries appeared at the top of select articles in a collapsed form. Users had to tap to expand and read the full summary. The AI text also included a highlighted "Unverified" badge.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/yuck-wikipedia-pauses-ai-summaries-after-editor-revolt/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Disney and <span data-schema="smart-brevity">NBCUniversal</span> filed a lawsuit against AI image-synthesis company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/midjourney-introduces-first-new-image-generation-model-in-over-a-year/">Midjourney</a>, accusing the company of copyright infringement for allowing users to create images of characters like Darth Vader and Shrek, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-universal-midjourney-1236262563/">reports</a> The Hollywood Reporter. The complaint, filed in US District Court in Los Angeles, marks the first major legal action by Hollywood studios against a generative AI company.</p>
<p>Midjourney is a subscription image-synthesis service and community that allows its users to submit written descriptions called prompts to an AI model that generates new images based on them. It has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/">well-known for years</a> that AI image-synthesis models such as the ones that power Midjourney have been trained on copyrighted artworks without rights holder permission.</p>
<p>The lawsuit describes San Francisco-based Midjourney as a "bottomless pit of plagiarism" that enables users to generate what the studios call "AI slop"—personalized images of copyrighted characters. Disney Enterprises, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century, Universal City Studios Productions, and DreamWorks Animation joined forces in the legal filing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/in-landmark-suit-disney-and-universal-sue-midjourney-for-ai-character-theft/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Outrage has been swift after Kennedy announced the "clean sweep" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). He made the announcement in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112">a Wall Street Journal op-ed</a>.</p>
<p>Open protest erupted at the CDC on Tuesday, with staff calling for Kennedy's resignation.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's strategy of suing or threatening to sue companies that don't buy advertising on X has reportedly paid off in at least a few cases. A Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/x-twitter-ad-revenue-campaign-lawsuit-a882b5c6">report</a> yesterday said that Verizon and other companies started advertising on X after lawsuit threats.</p>
<p>X <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/elon-musk-declares-it-is-war-on-ad-industry-as-x-sues-over-illegal-boycott/">sued some advertisers</a> last year over what it claims is an illegal boycott and reportedly threatened to add other companies to the lawsuit if they didn't buy ads. The WSJ article said that Verizon, which hadn't advertised on X since 2022, was told late last year that it would be added to the lawsuit if it didn't buy ads. Verizon subsequently pledged to spend at least $10 million on the platform this year, the article said.</p>
<p>"Fashion company Ralph Lauren also agreed to resume buying ads on X after receiving a lawsuit threat, people familiar with the matter said," according to the report. "All told, at least six companies that had either received lawsuit threats or were motivated in part by pressure tactics have struck ad deals with X, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The agreements include both firm ad-spending commitments and nonbinding targets."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/verizon-bought-10m-in-ads-on-x-to-avoid-lawsuit-from-musk-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">announced</a> that o3-pro, a new version of its most capable simulated reasoning model, is now available to ChatGPT Pro and Team users, replacing o1-pro in the model picker. The company also reduced API pricing for o3-pro by 87 percent compared to o1-pro while cutting o3 prices by 80 percent. While "reasoning" is useful for some analytical tasks, new studies have posed fundamental questions about what the word actually means when applied to these AI systems.</p>
<p>We'll take a deeper look at "reasoning" in a minute, but first, let's examine what's new. While OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-releases-new-simulated-reasoning-models-with-full-tool-access/">originally launched</a> o3 (non-pro) in April, the o3-pro model focuses on mathematics, science, and coding while adding new capabilities like web search, file analysis, image analysis, and Python execution. Since these tool integrations slow response times (longer than the already slow o1-pro), OpenAI recommends using the model for complex problems where accuracy matters more than speed. However, they do not necessarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/">confabulate less</a> than "non-reasoning" AI models (they still introduce factual errors), which is a significant caveat when seeking accurate results.</p>
<p>Beyond the reported performance improvements, OpenAI announced a substantial price reduction for developers. O3-pro costs $20 per million input tokens and $80 per million output tokens in the API, making it 87 percent cheaper than o1-pro. The company also reduced the price of the standard o3 model by 80 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">Read full article</a></p>
