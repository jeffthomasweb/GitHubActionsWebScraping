<p>Nothing has a new smartphone—the Phone (2a) Plus—nearly identical to the Phone (2a) it released earlier this year, but with slightly beefed-up specs. It costs $399 and is available in the US through the same beta program. But it isn't the new Android handset we find most interesting, it's the company's new widget.</p>
<p>The “News Reporter” widget, available by default on all Nothing and CMF smartphones plus other Android and iOS devices via the Nothing X app, lets you quickly play a news bulletin summarized by artificial intelligence. It is read out by the synthesized voice of Tim Holbrow, the company's chief financial officer. (Nothing is using ElevenLabs' tech for sound synthesis and output.) As soon as you tap the widget, you're greeted by a soothing British voice:</p>
<p>"Welcome to Nothing News, where the only thing we take seriously is not taking anything seriously. I'm Tim, your CFO and reluctant news reader. Today, we're making something out of nothing, because that's literally our job.” </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040429#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040429&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Boeing announced another financial charge Wednesday for its troubled Starliner commercial crew program, bringing the company's total losses on Starliner to $1.6 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/87a08bef-13bf-4f61-98db-438eab7f8b0f.pdf">In its quarterly earnings report</a>, Boeing registered a $125 million loss on the Starliner program, blaming delays on the spacecraft's still-ongoing Crew Flight Test, the program's first mission to carry astronauts into orbit. This is not the first time Boeing has reported a financial loss on Starliner. Including the new charge announced Wednesday, Boeing has now suffered an overall loss on the program of nearly $1.6 billion since 2016.</p>
<p>These losses have generally been caused by schedule delays and additional work to solve problems on Starliner. When NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to complete development of the Starliner spacecraft a decade ago, the aerospace contractor projected the capsule would be ready to fly astronauts by the end of 2017.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040414#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040414&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Over 7 million pounds of Boar's Head brand deli meats are being recalled amid a bacterial outbreak that has killed two people. The outbreak, which began in late May, has sickened a total of 34 people across 13 states, leading to 33 hospitalizations, <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/boars-head-provisions-co--expands-recall-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due">according to the US Department of Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>On June 26, Boar's Head recalled 207,528 pounds of products, including liverwurst, beef bologna, ham, salami, and "heat and eat" bacon. On Tuesday, the Jarratt, Virginia-based company expanded the recall to include about 7 million additional pounds of meat, including <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/food_label_pdf/2024-07/Recall-023-2024-EXP-Labels.pdf">71 different products</a> sold on the Boar's Head and Old Country brand labels. The products were sold nationwide.</p>
<p>The meats may be contaminated with <em>Listeria monocytogenes, </em>a foodborne pathogen that is particularly dangerous to pregnant people, people over the age of 65, and people with compromised immune systems. Infections during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or a life-threatening infection in newborns. For others who develop invasive illness, the fatality rate is nearly 16 percent. Symptoms of listeriosis can include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions that are sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040456#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040456&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A familiar debate is once again surrounding Cloudflare, the content delivery network that provides a free service that protects websites from being taken down in denial-of-service attacks by masking their hosts: Is Cloudflare a bastion of free speech or an enabler of spam, malware delivery, harassment and the very DDoS attacks it claims to block?</p>
<p>The controversy isn't new for Cloudflare, a network operator that has often taken a hands-off approach to moderating the enormous amount of traffic flowing through its infrastructure. With Cloudflare helping deliver <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/browser-market-share-2023-q3">16 percent</a> of global Internet traffic, processing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/about-overview/">57 million</a> web requests per second, and serving anywhere from <a href="https://backlinko.com/cloudflare-users">7.6 million</a> to <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-websites-use-cloudflare/">15.7 million</a> active websites, the decision to serve just about any actor, regardless of their behavior, has been the subject of intense disagreement, with many advocates of free speech and Internet neutrality applauding it and people fighting crime and harassment online regarding it as a pariah.</p>
<h2>Content neutral or abuse enabling?</h2>
<p>Spamhaus—a nonprofit organization that provides intelligence and blocklists to stem the spread of spam, phishing, malware, and botnets—has become the latest to criticize Cloudflare. On Tuesday, the project said Cloudflare provides services for 10 percent of the domains listed in its domain block list and, to date, serves sites that are the subject of more than 1,200 unresolved complaints regarding abuse.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040424#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040424&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've used Microsoft's Skype in recent years, you've probably noticed that the user experience is less than ideal because of the pervasiveness of ads in the software. Fortunately, that's going to change in a new update coming to all platforms in the near future.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/skype-insider-release-notes-for-skype-812576201/70072f8d-3a54-4739-ad2f-dd0cdc665a6f">release notes for Skype Insider build 8.125</a>, product manager Irene Namuganyi writes, "We’re excited to announce that Skype is now ad-free! Our latest update removes all ads from Skype channels and the entire Skype platform, ensuring a smoother, decluttered, and more enjoyable user experience."</p>
<p>Whereas there were previously ads in the "today" section of the application, it will now be ad-free, showing just the relevant newsfeed content. There won't be any ads in conversation views, either.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040411#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040411&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is standing by Reddit’s decision to block companies from scraping the site without an AI agreement.</p>
<p>Last week, 404 Media noticed that search engines that weren't Google were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/non-google-search-engines-blocked-from-showing-recent-reddit-results/">no longer listing recent Reddit posts</a> in results. This was because Reddit updated its Robots Exclusion Protocol (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1doc3pt/updating_our_robotstxt_file_and_upholding_our/?share_id=LWheQDxb-1jML29ocrt4T&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">txt file</a>) to block bots from scraping the site. The file reads: "Reddit believes in an open Internet, but not the misuse of public content." Since the news broke, OpenAI announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/openai-hits-google-where-it-hurts-with-new-searchgpt-prototype/">SearchGPT</a>, which can show recent Reddit results.</p>
<p>The change came a year after Reddit began its efforts to stop free scraping, which Huffman initially framed as an attempt to stop AI companies from making money off of Reddit content for free. This endeavor also led Reddit to begin charging for API access (the high pricing led to many <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/exploring-reddits-third-party-app-environment-7-months-after-the-apicalypse/">third-party Reddit apps</a> closing).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040398#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040398&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Because of "a concerning increase in generated images and videos that portray people in sexually explicit contexts, distributed on the web without their consent," Google said that it consulted with "experts and victim-survivors" to make some "significant updates" to its widely used search engine to "further protect people."</p>
<p>Specifically, Google made it easier for targets of fake explicit images—which experts have said are overwhelmingly women—to report and remove deepfakes that surface in search results. Additionally, Google took steps to downrank explicit deepfakes "to keep this type of content from appearing high up in Search results," the world's leading search engine said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040372#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040372&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A team of Japanese and Belgian astronomers has re-examined the sunspot drawings made by 17th century astronomer Johannes Kepler with modern analytical techniques. By doing so, they resolved a long-standing mystery about solar cycles during that period, according to a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad57c9">recent paper</a> published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>
<p>Precisely who first observed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot">sunspots</a> was a matter of heated debate in the early 17th century. We now know that ancient Chinese astronomers between 364 and 28 BCE observed these features and included them in their official records. A Benedictine monk in 807 thought he'd observed Mercury passing in front of the Sun when, in reality, he had witnessed a sunspot; similar mistaken interpretations were also common in the 12th century. (An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Worcester">English monk</a> made the first known drawings of sunspots in December 1128.)</p>
<p>English astronomer Thomas Harriot made the first telescope observations of sunspots in late 1610 and recorded them in his notebooks, as did Galileo around the same time, although the latter did not publish a scientific paper on sunspots (accompanied by sketches) until 1613. Galileo also argued that the spots were not, as some believed, solar satellites but more like clouds in the atmosphere or the surface of the Sun. But he was not the first to suggest this; that credit belongs to Dutch astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Fabricius">Johannes Fabricus</a>, who published his scientific treatise on sunspots in 1611.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039961#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039961&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the most unlikely passengers on the<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/ai-marketing-hype-is-coming-for-your-favorite-gadgets/"> AI gadgets hype train</a> is the toothbrush. With claims of using advanced algorithms and companion apps to help you brush your teeth better, toothbrushes have become a tech product for some brands.</p>
<p>So-called "AI toothbrushes" have become more common since debuting in 2017. Numerous brands now market AI capabilities for toothbrushes with three-figure price tags. But there's limited scientific evidence that AI algorithms help oral health, and companies are becoming more interested in using tech-laden toothbrushes to source user data.</p>
<h2>AI toothbrushes</h2>
<p>Kolibree was the first company to announce a "toothbrush with artificial intelligence." The French company debuted its Ara brush at CES 2017, with founder and CEO Thomas Serval saying, "Patented deep learning algorithms are embedded directly inside the toothbrush on a low-power processor. Raw data from the sensors runs through the processor, enabling the system to learn your habits and refine accuracy the more it’s used."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039809#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039809&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of the things that the James Webb Space Telescope was designed to do was look at some of the earliest objects in the Universe. And it has already succeeded spectacularly, imaging galaxies as they existed just 250 million years after the Big Bang. But these galaxies were small, compact, and similar in scope to what we'd consider a dwarf galaxy today, which made it difficult to determine what was producing their light: stars or an actively feeding supermassive black hole at their core.</p>
<p>This week, Nature is publishing confirmation that some additional galaxies we've imaged also date back to just 300 million years after the Big Bang. Critically, one of them is bright and relatively large, allowing us to infer that most of its light was coming from a halo of stars surrounding its core, rather than originating in the same area as the central black hole. The finding implies that it formed through a continuing burst of star formation that started just 200 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<h2>Age checks</h2>
<p>The galaxies at issue here were first imaged during the JADES (JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey) imaging program, which includes part of the area imaged for the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Initially, old galaxies were identified by using a combination of filters on one of Webb's infrared imaging cameras.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040341#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040341&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>'s head of community has a radical idea: Stop caring about how many people are playing a game at the same time as you. It's pitched mostly at developers and games media, but John Buckley also wants players to let go of the "dead game" mentality.</p>
<p>"Who cares if there's only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself. Just enjoy games. I don't think it needs to be any more complex than that," Buckley said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO38QvKraTQ">an interview on the Going Indie YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The people at <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair, in particular, would have reason for panic, if they subscribed to the mentality that active online players are the key benchmark for modern gaming. The game launched into Early Access in January 2024 at rocket speed, selling 5 million copies and reaching 1.3 million concurrent Steam players, surpassing <em>Elden Ring </em>and <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.

<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1818353580279316863">began rolling out</a> an alpha version of its new Advanced Voice Mode to a small group of ChatGPT Plus subscribers. This feature, which OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">previewed in May</a> with the launch of GPT-4o, aims to make conversations with the AI more natural and responsive. In May, the feature <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/is-the-world-ready-for-an-ai-assistant-that-can-laugh-in-your-face/">triggered criticism</a> of its simulated emotional expressiveness and prompted a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/sky-voice-actor-says-nobody-ever-compared-her-to-scarjo-before-openai-drama/">public dispute</a> with actress Scarlett Johansson over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/openai-pauses-chatgpt-4o-voice-that-fans-said-ripped-off-scarlett-johansson/">accusations</a> that OpenAI copied her voice. Even so, early tests of the new feature shared by users on social media have been largely enthusiastic.</p>

<p>In early tests reported by users with access, Advanced Voice Mode allows them to have real-time conversations with ChatGPT, including the ability to interrupt the AI mid-sentence almost instantly. It can sense and respond to a user's emotional cues through vocal tone and delivery, and provide sound effects while telling stories.</p>
<p>But what has caught many people off-guard initially is how the voices simulate <a href="https://x.com/GregHarbour/status/1818485287003341034">taking a breath</a> while speaking.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040213#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040213&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Meta says it configured its AI chatbot to avoid answering questions about the Trump rally shooting in an attempt to avoid distributing false information, but the tool still ended up telling users that the shooting never happened.</p>
<p>"Rather than have Meta AI give incorrect information about the attempted assassination, we programmed it to simply not answer questions about it after it happened—and instead give a generic response about how it couldn't provide any information," Meta Global Policy VP Joel Kaplan wrote in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/review-of-fact-checking-label-and-meta-ai-responses/">blog post</a> yesterday.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Intel <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">announced today that it plans to launch its next-generation Core Ultra laptop chips on September 3, just ahead of <a href="https://www.ifa-berlin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year's IFA conference</a> in Berlin</span>.</p>

<p>This announcement-of-an-announcement offers few specifics on what the next-gen chips will be like beyond promising "breakthrough x86 power efficiency, exceptional core performance, massive leaps in graphics performance and... unmatched AI computing power." But we do already know a few things about the next-generation CPUs, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/intels-new-lunar-lake-chips-promise-big-gpu-and-npu-upgrades-minor-cpu-boosts/">codenamed Lunar Lake</a>.</p>
<p>We know that, like current-generation Meteor Lake chips, Lunar Lake will combine multiple silicon "tiles" into one large die thanks to Intel's Foveros packaging technology. We know that Intel will use a mix of up to four E-cores and four P-cores in the CPU, a step down in core count from what was available in Meteor Lake. We know Lunar Lake includes a next-generation Arc GPU based on the "Battlemage" architecture that promises up to 1.5 times better performance than the current Arc-integrated GPU.

<p>Microsoft's revenue from Xbox console sales was down a whopping 42 percent on a year-over-year basis for the quarter ending in June, the company announced in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q4/press-release-webcast">its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>The massive drop continues a long, pronounced slide for sales of Microsoft's gaming hardware—the Xbox line has now shown year-over-year declines in hardware sales revenue in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/putting-microsofts-cratering-xbox-console-sales-in-context/">six of the last seven calendar quarters</a> (and seven of the last nine). And Microsoft CFO Amy Hood told investors in a follow-up call (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activison-continues-to-boost-xbox-revenues-but-hardware-sees-further-decline">as reported by GamesIndustry.biz</a>) to expect hardware sales to decline yet again in the coming fiscal quarter, which ends in September.</p>
<p>The 42 percent drop for quarterly hardware revenue—by far the largest such drop since the introduction of the Xbox Series X/S in 2020—follows an 11 percent year-over-year decline in the second calendar quarter of 2023.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040267#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040267&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ford is giving its Maverick pickup truck a midlife refresh for model year 2025. And while the changes aren't earth-shattering, they will probably pique your interest. The headline news for Ars readers is probably this: The hybrid is back, and now you can spec an all-wheel drive hybrid Maverick as well as a front-wheel-drive electrified model.</p>
<p>When we tested the Maverick in 2021, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-2022-ford-maverick-is-a-cheap-cheerful-diy-friendly-pickup-truck/">we were very impressed with it</a>, particularly the front-wheel drive hybrid powertrain. The 191 hp (142 kW) pickup was capable of exceeding 42 mpg (5.6 L/100 km). It was the right size, as opposed to being gargantuan like almost every other pickup on sale, yet it still had the ability to carry 1,500 lbs (680 kg) in the bed or tow 2,000 lb (907 kg) trailers. All for a starting price of just under $20,000, assuming you ignored the destination charge.</p>
<p>Even better, the 2.5 L hybrid powertrain was the standard option, with the more powerful 2.0 L EcoBoost as a cost-option, either with front- or all-wheel drive. Sadly, more recent supply chain issues got in the way of that, with Ford <a href="https://fordauthority.com/2023/07/2024-ford-maverick-to-drop-2-5l-hybrid-as-standard-engine/">dropping the hybrid as standard for MY24</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040229#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040229&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The emails from United Launch Alliance started popping into the inboxes of photographers a few days after the Fourth of July holiday. Although that day is meant to celebrate freedom and the red glare of rockets, the communication threatened to strip both from some of the company's most ardent devotees.</p>
<p>The message from the launch company announced the implementation of a new "annual agreement" between ULA and all people who place remote cameras at Space Launch Complex-41, the company's active launch site at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Anyone interested in setting remotes for future launch dates had 11 days to review and sign the agreement.</p>
<p>The language was clear: Photographers were welcome to set up remote shots at ULA launches if they worked for the media or wanted to post their work on social media. However, photographers could not sell this work independently, including as prints for fellow enthusiasts or for use in annual calendars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040039#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040039&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington to Munich and accommodation so Ars could be briefed about the A6 e-tron as well as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/heres-audis-next-a5-and-all-the-stuff-we-wont-get-in-the-us/">A5</a> we wrote about several weeks ago, and another model you can read about in the coming weeks. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>MUNICH—The sedan is not quite dead—at least not yet. While it's true that car buyers are <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americas-love-affair-with-the-suv-is-killing-the-trusty-sedan-150138154.html">voting with their wallets</a> and <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/heres-the-exact-year-suv-sales-overtook-sedan-sales-in-america/">opting for crossovers and SUVs</a>, not every automaker has given up on the form factor, even when it comes to electric vehicles. For example, Audi's next EV will be the new A6 e-tron, which goes on sale in the US next year.</p>
<p>The pedants might quibble with calling the A6 e-tron a sedan, as the one we're getting here is a midsize five-door, meaning it has a rear hatch instead of a trunk. In Audi lingo, that means it's an A6 Sportback e-tron, with more of a two-box rather than three-box shape like the outgoing (internal combustion engine-powered) A6. Not that that's a bad thing in our eyes—the rear hatch will make it easier to load or unload larger items (like a bicycle) into the cargo area.</p>
<p>"We were determined to give the A6 e-tron <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/this-electric-fastback-is-the-next-audi-a6-e-tron-due-in-late-2022/">the attractive proportions of the concept car,</a>" said Audi designer Wolf Seebers. "I'm talking about the classic Sportback silhouette that Audi fans are familiar with," Seebers said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040162#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040162&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Extreme weather is, by definition, rare on our planet. Ferocious storms, searing heatwaves, and biting cold snaps illustrate what the climate is capable of at its worst. However, since Earth’s climate is rapidly warming, predominantly due to <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change#:%7E:text=Fossil%20fuels%20%E2%80%93%20coal%2C%20oil%20and,they%20trap%20the%20sun's%20heat.">fossil fuel burning</a>, the range of possible weather conditions, including extremes, is changing.</p>
<p>Scientists define “climate” as the distribution of possible weather events observed over a length of time, such as the range of temperatures, rainfall totals, or hours of sunshine. From this, they construct statistical measures, such as the average (or normal) temperature. Weather varies on several timescales—from <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL075483">seconds to decades</a>—so the longer the period over which the climate is analyzed, the more accurately these analyses capture the infinite range of possible configurations of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Typically, meteorologists and climate scientists use a 30-year period to represent the climate, which is updated every 10 years. The most recent climate period is 1991–2020. The difference between each successive 30-year climate period serves as a very literal record of climate change.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040166#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040166&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A mysterious family of Android malware with a demonstrated history of effectively concealing its myriad spying activities has once again been found in Google Play after more than two years of hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>The apps, disguised as file-sharing, astronomy, and cryptocurrency apps, hosted Mandrake, a family of highly intrusive malware that security firm Bitdefender <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/329/Bitdefender-PR-Whitepaper-Mandrake-creat4464-en-EN-interactive.pdf">called out</a> in 2020. Bitdefender said the apps appeared in two waves, one in 2016 through 2017 and again in 2018 through 2020. Mandrake’s ability to go unnoticed then was the result of some unusually rigorous steps to fly under the radar. They included:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Not working in 90 countries, including those comprising the former Soviet Union</li>
<li aria-level="1">Delivering its final payload only to victims who were extremely narrowly targeted</li>
<li aria-level="1">Containing a kill switch the developers named seppuku (Japanese form of ritual suicide) that fully wiped all traces of the malware</li>
<li aria-level="1">Fully functional decoy apps in categories including finance, Auto &amp; Vehicles, Video Players &amp; Editors, Art &amp; Design, and Productivity</li>
<li aria-level="1">Quick fixes for bugs reported in comments</li>
<li aria-level="1">TLS <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning">certificate pinning</a> to conceal communications with command and control servers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lurking in the shadows</h2>
<p>Bitdefender estimated the number of victims in the tens of thousands for the 2018 to 2020 wave and “probably hundreds of thousands throughout the full 4-year period.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040171#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040171&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
