              <![CDATA[<p>You likely have never heard of Babel Street or Location X, but chances are good that they know a lot about you and anyone else you know who keeps a phone nearby around the clock.</p>
<p>Reston, Virginia-located Babel Street is the little-known firm behind Location X, a service with the capability to track the locations of hundreds of millions of phone users over sustained periods of time. Ostensibly, Babel Street limits the use of the service to personnel and contractors of US government law enforcement agencies, including state entities. Despite the restriction, an individual working on behalf of a company that helps people remove their personal information from consumer data broker databases recently was able to obtain a two-week free trial by (truthfully) telling Babel Street he was considering performing contracting work for a government agency in the future.</p>
<h2>Tracking locations at scale</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity, one of five news outlets that obtained access to the data produced during the trial, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/the-global-surveillance-free-for-all-in-mobile-ad-data/">said</a> that one capability of Location X is the ability to draw a line between two states or other locations—or a shape around a building, street block, or entire city—and see a historical record of Internet-connected devices that traversed those boundaries.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/phone-tracking-tool-lets-government-agencies-follow-your-every-move/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SAN FRANCISCO—On Tuesday, <a href="https://tedai-sanfrancisco.ted.com/ai-conferences/">TED AI 2024</a> kicked off its first day at San Francisco's Herbst Theater with a lineup of speakers that tackled AI's impact on science, art, and society. The two-day event brought a mix of researchers, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and other experts who painted a complex picture of AI with fairly minimal hype.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The second annual conference, organized by Walter and Sam De Brouwer, marked a notable shift from last year's broad existential debates and proclamations of AI as being "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/ted-ai-2023-a-historic-symposium-on-benefits-risks-and-applications-of-ai/">the new electricity</a>." Rather than sweeping predictions about, say, looming artificial general intelligence (although there was still some of that, too), speakers mostly focused on immediate challenges: battles over training data rights, proposals for hardware-based regulation, debates about human-AI relationships, and the complex dynamics of workplace adoption.</p>
<p>The day's sessions covered a wide breadth: physicist Carlo Rovelli explored consciousness and time, Project CETI researcher Patricia Sharma demonstrated attempts to use AI to decode whale communication, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. outlined music industry adaptation strategies, and even a few robots made appearances.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/at-ted-ai-2024-experts-grapple-with-ais-growing-pains/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a rocky first half of the year, Tesla enjoyed a much healthier third quarter in 2024. As we learned <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/tesla-reverses-sales-slump-sees-modest-growth-in-q3/">earlier this month</a>, it arrested a slide in sales, delivering 6 percent more electric vehicles year over year. But the automotive side of the business was essentially flat—<a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q3-2024-Update.pdf">Tesla attributes its success</a> to its second-best quarter ever for regulatory credits, as well as making it cheaper to build the cars it sells.</p>
<p>Automotive revenues grew by 2 percent to $20 billion for the third quarter, less than the growth in deliveries. But Tesla's static battery and solar operations grew by 52 percent year over year, bringing in $2.4 billion. Services and other revenue-generating activities brought in another $2.8 billion, growing 29 percent compared to Q3 2023.</p>
<p>Cutting operating expenses by 6 percent helped a lot, as did increasing income from operations, up 54 percent to $2.7 billion. Some of that income has come from the Supercharger network, though it's still mostly from Tesla drivers—so far, only a few of the OEMs that have announced a switch to the Tesla-style NACS plug <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/superchargers-are-the-reliable-fast-charging-backup-my-chevy-bolt-always-needed/">have gained access</a> to Tesla's chargers. But Tesla says part sales have been strong, and its increased its margins at its service centers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/teslas-q3-buoyed-by-credits-cost-cutting-as-auto-revenue-stays-flat/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fourteen-year-old Sewell Setzer III loved interacting with Character.AI's hyper-realistic chatbots—with a limited version available for free or a "supercharged" version for a $9.99 monthly fee—most frequently chatting with bots named after his favorite <em>Game of Thrones</em> characters.</p>
<p>Within a month—his mother, Megan Garcia, later realized—these chat sessions had turned dark, with chatbots insisting they were real humans and posing as therapists and adult lovers seeming to proximately spur Sewell to develop suicidal thoughts. Within a year, Setzer "died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head," a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Garcia-v-Character-Technologies-Complaint-10-23-24.pdf">lawsuit</a> Garcia filed Wednesday said.</p>
<p>As Setzer became obsessed with his chatbot fantasy life, he disconnected from reality, her complaint said. Detecting a shift in her son, Garcia repeatedly took Setzer to a therapist, who diagnosed her son with anxiety and disruptive mood disorder. But nothing helped to steer Setzer away from the dangerous chatbots. Taking away his phone only intensified his apparent addiction.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/chatbots-posed-as-therapist-and-adult-lover-in-teen-suicide-case-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Zachary Lindsey, a physicist at Berry College in Georgia, decided to run an experiment on how to get the best speed and torque while playing disc golf (aka Frisbee golf), he had no trouble recruiting 24 eager participants keen on finding science-based tips on how to improve their game. Lindsey and his team determined the optimal thumb distance from the center of the disc to increase launch speed and distance, according to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0229599">new paper</a> published in the journal AIP Advances.</p>
<p>Disc golf first emerged in the 1960s, but "Steady" Ed Hendrick, inventor of the modern Frisbee, is widely considered the "father" of the sport since it was he who coined and trademarked the name "disc golf" in 1975. He and his son founded their own company to manufacture the equipment used in the game. As of 2023, the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) had over 107,000 registered members worldwide, with players hailing from 40 countries.</p>
<p>A disc golf course typically has either nine or 18 holes or targets, called "baskets." There is a tee position for starting play, and players take turns throwing discs until they catch them in the basket, similar to how golfers work toward sinking a golf ball into a hole. The expected number of throws required of an experienced player to make the basket is considered "par."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-physics-can-improve-your-disc-golf-game/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's been just a week since US telecom regulators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-republican-opposes-regulation-of-data-caps-with-analogy-to-coffee-refills/">announced a formal inquiry</a> into broadband data caps, and the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(proceedings.name:(%2223-199%22))">docket</a> is filling up with comments from users who say they shouldn't have to pay overage charges for using their Internet service. The docket has about 190 comments so far, nearly all from individual broadband customers.</p>
<p>Federal Communications Commission dockets are usually populated with filings from telecom companies, advocacy groups, and other organizations, but some attract comments from individual users of telecom services. The data cap docket probably won't break any records given that the FCC has fielded <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/biggest-isps-paid-for-8-5-million-fake-fcc-comments-opposing-net-neutrality/">many millions</a> of comments on net neutrality, but it currently tops the agency's <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/rulemaking/most-active-proceedings">list of most active proceedings</a> based on the number of filings in the past 30 days.</p>
<p>"Data caps, especially by providers in markets with no competition, are nothing more than an arbitrary money grab by greedy corporations. They limit and stifle innovation, cause undue stress, and are unnecessary," <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/filing/1023429916741">wrote Lucas Landreth</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/please-ban-data-caps-internet-users-tell-fcc/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Today, Apple released the first developer beta of iOS 18.2 for supported devices. This beta release marks the first time several key AI features that Apple teased at its developer conference this June are available.</p>
<p>Apple is marketing a wide range of generative AI features under the banner "Apple Intelligence." Initially, Apple Intelligence was planned to release as part of iOS 18, but some features slipped to iOS 18.1, others to iOS 18.2, and a few still to future undisclosed software updates.</p>
<p>iOS 18.1 has been in beta for a while and includes improvements to Siri, generative writing tools that help with rewriting or proofreading, smart replies for Messages, and notification summaries. That update is expected to reach the public next week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/ios-18-2-developer-beta-adds-chatgpt-and-image-generation-features/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Trying to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-sports-fans-guide-to-streaming-services/#page-4">watch your favorite NFL team's games throughout a season</a> is a fiendish logistics puzzle, one that doesn't even have a "just pay for it" shortcut.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/with-apple-bowing-out-youtube-is-close-to-scoring-nfl-sunday-ticket/">buy a Sunday Ticket package from YouTube</a>, but that only covers games on Sunday and only those not shown in your local TV market. You can pay for cable or set up an HDTV antenna, but you have to hope it catches NBC, CBS, and Fox for Sunday games (if your local station chooses to carry your team), and for Monday night games, ABC (though most are on ESPN and some even exclusive to ESPN+). Thursday nights? That's Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>Oh, and this year's Christmas Day games are on Netflix. And the games played in London and Germany are on the NFL Network, which requires either cable or an NFL+ subscription. And Peacock also had that one game in Brazil and is getting another playoff game this year. Many of these games get broadcast options in their home regions, though that doesn't much help ex-pat fans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/nfl-player-illegally-streams-his-own-teams-game-garners-mostly-sympathy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Any company that makes Arm chips must license technology from Arm Holdings plc, the British company that develops the instruction set.

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/arm-to-cancel-qualcomm-chip-design-license-in-escalation-of-feud">reports</a> that Arm is canceling Qualcomm's license, an escalation of a fight that began in late 2022 when Arm sued Qualcomm over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/qualcomm-closes-nuvia-deal-promises-in-house-laptop-cpus-by-2h-2022/">its acquisition of Nuvia in 2021</a>. Arm has given Qualcomm 60 days' notice of the cancellation, giving the companies two months to come to some kind of agreement before Qualcomm is forced to stop manufacturing and selling its Arm chips.</p>
<p>A Qualcomm spokesperson told Bloomberg that Arm Holdings plc was attempting to "strong-arm a longtime partner" and that Qualcomm was "confident that Qualcomm’s rights under its agreement with Arm will be affirmed."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/report-arm-cancels-qualcomms-architecture-license-endangering-its-chip-business/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) board has agreed to spend $212 million to get its Muni Metro light rail off floppy disks.</p>
<p>The Muni Metro’s Automatic Train Control System (ATCS) has required <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/5-25-inch-floppy-disks-expected-to-help-run-san-francisco-trains-until-2030/">5¼-inch floppy disks</a> since 1998, when it was installed at San Francisco’s Market Street subway station. The system uses three floppy disks for loading DOS software that controls the system’s central servers. Michael Roccaforte, an SFMTA spokesperson, gave further details on how the light rail operates to Ars Technica in April, saying: “When a train enters the subway, its onboard computer connects to the train control system to run the train in automatic mode, where the trains drive themselves while the operators supervise. When they exit the subway, they disconnect from the ATCS and return to manual operation on the street." After starting initial planning in 2018, the SFMTA originally expected to move to a floppy-disk-free train control system by 2028. But with COVID-19 preventing work for 18 months, the estimated completion date was delayed.</p>
<p>On October 15, the SFMTA moved closer to ditching floppies when its board approved a contract with Hitachi Rail for implementing a new train control system that doesn't use floppy disks, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/muni-board-approves-new-train-control-system-19846976.php">the San Francisco Chronicle</a> reported. Hitachi Rail tech is said to power train systems, including Japan’s bullet train, in more than 50 countries. The $212 million contract includes support services from Hitachi for "20 to 25 years," the Chronicle said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/212-million-contract-will-finally-get-san-francisco-trains-off-floppy-disks/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One person is dead and 48 others across 10 states have been sickened in an <em>E. coli </em>O157:H7 outbreak that appears to be linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders and the slivered onions used on the burgers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>McDonald's has paused distribution of the slivered onions and removed Quarter Pounders from the menus of restaurants in areas known to be affected. As of now, those areas include Colorado, Kansas, Utah, and Wyoming, as well as portions of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>However, the CDC was quick to note that the size and span of the outbreak are likely larger than is currently known. "This outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses, and the true number of sick people is likely much higher than the number reported," the agency said in its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/e-coli-O157.html">outbreak notice</a> posted Tuesday afternoon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-one-dead-49-sickened-across-10-states-so-far/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Canadian developer Peter Todd found out that a new HBO documentary, <i>Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery,</i> was set to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/unmasking-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-again/">identify him as Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, the creator of bitcoin, he was mostly just pissed. “This was clearly going to be a circus,” Todd told WIRED in an email.</p>
<p>The identity of the person—or people—who created bitcoin has been the subject of speculation since December 2010, when they disappeared from public view. The mystery has proved all the more irresistible for the trove of bitcoin Satoshi is widely believed to have controlled, <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/">suspected to be worth many billions of dollars</a> today. When the documentary was released on October 8, Todd joined a long line of alleged Satoshis.</p>
<p>Documentary maker Cullen Hoback, who in a previous film claimed to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrgFyRrSk8Q">identified the individual behind QAnon</a>, laid out his theory to Todd on camera. The confrontation would become the climactic scene of the documentary. But Todd nonetheless claims he didn’t see it coming; he alleges he was left with the impression the film was about the history of bitcoin, not the identity of its creator.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/peter-todd-in-hiding-after-being-unmasked-as-bitcoin-creator/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile promised users who bought certain mobile plans that it would never raise their prices for as long as they lived—but then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/">raised their prices</a> this year. So it's no surprise that 2,000 T-Mobile customers complained to the government about a price hike on plans that were advertised as having a lifetime price lock.</p>
<p>"I am still alive and T-Mobile is increasing the price for service by $5 per line. How is this a lifetime price lock?" one customer in Connecticut asked the Federal Communications Commission in a complaint that we obtained through a public records request.</p>
<p>"I am not dead yet," a customer in New York wrote bluntly, saying they had bought a plan with a "guarantee for life."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/i-am-still-alive-users-say-t-mobile-must-pay-for-killing-lifetime-price-lock/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>United Launch Alliance has started assembling its next Vulcan rocket—the first destined to launch a US military payload—as the Space Force prepares to certify it to loft the Pentagon's most precious national security satellites.</p>
<p>Space Force officials expect to approve ULA's Vulcan rocket for military missions without requiring another test flight, despite an unusual problem on the rocket's second demonstration flight earlier this month.</p>
<p>ULA has launched two Vulcan test flights. Military officials watched closely, gathering data to formally certify the rocket is reliable enough to launch national security missions. The first test flight in January, designated Cert-1, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/ulas-vulcan-rocket-shot-for-the-moon-on-debut-launch-and-hit-a-bullseye/">was nearly flawless</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>Colossal, the company founded to try to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/de-extinction-company-manages-to-generate-first-elephant-stem-cells/">restore the mammoth</a> to the Arctic tundra, has also decided to tackle a number of other species that have gone extinct relatively recently: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/the-next-de-extinction-target-the-dodo/">the dodo</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/de-extinction-company-sets-its-next-first-target-the-thylacine/#page-2">the thylacine</a>. Because of significant differences in biology, not the least of which is the generation time of Proboscideans, these other efforts may reach many critical milestones well in advance of the work on mammoths.</p>
<p>Late last week, Colossal released a progress report on the work involved in resurrecting the thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, which went extinct when the last known survivor died in a zoo in 1936. Marsupial biology has some features that may make de-extinction somewhat easier, but we have far less sophisticated ways of manipulating it compared to the technology we've developed for working with the stem cells and reproduction of placental mammals. But, based on these new announcements, the technology available for working with marsupials is expanding rapidly.</p>
<h2>Cane toad resistance</h2>
<p>Colossal has branched out from its original de-extinction mission to include efforts to keep species from ever needing its services. In the case of marsupial predators, the de-extinction effort is incorporating work that will benefit existing marsupial predators: generating resistance to the toxins found on the cane toad, an invasive species that has spread widely across Australia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/effort-to-bring-back-the-tasmanian-tiger-builds-steam/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[After cease-and-desist letter, Pivotal Peptides allegedly sold mix-your-own tirzepatide as "11 mg."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Amid ongoing legal battles over coveted GLP-1 therapies, a drug vendor in Washington state is accused of running an outlandish scheme to sell do-it-yourself kits to make illicit knockoff versions of weight-loss and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro.</p>
<p>For the alleged scheme, vendor Pivotal Peptides has customers buy a set of ingredients they have to mix together to create their own injectable versions of the drugs. Customers don't need a prescription or even a medical consultation to order the kit, even though the brand-name drugs are prescription-only. That may not be surprising, though, since the dubious white powder customers receive is stated to be "a research chemical for lab research and veterinary purposes only." Once purchased, the kit's instructions recommend users disinfect their home work surface before beginning and stress the importance of using the sterile water included in the kit to dissolve the powder to the desired concentration. The instructions then explain how to inject oneself with the homemade mixture using a 30-gauge syringe.</p>
<p>That's all according to <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/0001.00_2024-10-21-Complaint-for-False-Advertising-and-Promotion-Pivotal-1.pdf">a lawsuit filed Monday by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly</a>, maker of tirzepatide-based Zepbound and Mounjaro, which are sold as ready-to-use medicines in single-dose pens or vials. The lawsuit against Pivotal Peptides is one of three that Lilly filed this week, all accusing questionable drugmakers of unlawfully selling knockoff versions of its tirzepatide drugs that have not been tested or approved. But the one against Pivotal Peptides stands out for the scheme the owners allegedly used to sell their knockoff version.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/shady-drugmaker-sold-diy-weight-loss-drug-marked-for-animal-use-suit-alleges/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Subscription fees for video streaming services have been on a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/disney-made-2-4-billion-in-revenue-in-3-months-leak-claims/">steady incline</a>. But despite subscribers paying more, surveys suggest they're becoming less satisfied with what's available to watch.</p>
<p>At the start of 2024, the industry began declaring <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/01/23/why-peak-tv-may-have-reached-its-end-after-a-decade-of-success/">the end of Peak TV</a>, a term coined by FX Networks Chairman John Landgraf that refers to an era of rampant content spending that gave us shows like <em>The Wire</em>, <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and <em>Game of Thrones</em>. For streaming services, the Peak TV era meant trying to lure subscribers with original content that was often buoyed by critical acclaim and/or top-tier actors, writers, and/or directors. However, as streaming services struggle to reach or maintain profitability, 2024 saw a drop in the number of new scripted shows for the first time in at least 10 years, FX Research <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/12/peak-tv-decline-scripted-shows-low">found</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, overall satisfaction with the quality of content available on streaming services seems to have declined for the past couple of years. Most surveys suggest a generally small decline in perceived quality, but that’s still perturbing considering how <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/subscribing-to-max-just-got-up-to-20-more-expensive/">frequently</a> streaming services <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/so-tired-disney-hulu-espn-prices-increase-by-up-to-25-percent-in-october/">increase subscription fees</a>. There was a time when a streaming subscription represented an exclusive ticket to viewing some of the best new TV shows and movies. But we’ve reached a point where the most streamed TV show last year <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/nielsen-2023-streaming-report-suits-the-office-record-1235890306/">was <em>Suits</em></a>—an original from the USA Network cable channel that ended in 2019.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/subscribers-are-paying-more-for-streaming-content-that-they-are-enjoying-less/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A stunning image of differentiated mouse brain tumor cells has won the 2024 Nikon Small World photomicrography contest, yielding valuable insight into how degenerate diseases like Alzheimer's and ALS can arise from disruption in the cytoskeleton of brain cells. The image was taken by Bruno Cisterna, with assistance from Eric Vitriol, both with Augusta University in Georgia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"One of the main problems with neurodegenerative diseases is that we don't fully understand what causes them,” Cisterna said in a statement. “To develop effective treatments, we need to figure out the basics first. Our research is crucial for uncovering this knowledge and ultimately finding a cure. Differentiated cells could be used to study how mutations or toxic proteins that cause Alzheimer's or ALS alter neuronal morphology, as well as to screen potential drugs or gene therapies aimed at protecting neurons or restoring their function.”</p>
<p>It's the 50th anniversary of Nikon's annual contest, which was founded back in 1974 "to showcase the beauty and complexity of things seen through the light microscope." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrograph">Photomicrography</a> involves attaching a camera to a microscope (either an optical microscope or an electron microscope) so that the user can take photographs of objects at very high resolutions. British physiologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hill_Norris">Richard Hill Norris</a> was one of the first to use it for his studies of blood cells in 1850, and the method has increasingly been highlighted as art since the 1970s. There have been many groundbreaking technological advances in the ensuing decades, particularly with the advent of digital imaging methods.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/photomicrography-contest-winners-showcase-beauty-at-tiny-scales/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AI software company Anthropic has announced a new tool that can take control of the user's mouse cursor and perform basic tasks on their computer.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use">alongside</a> other improvements to Anthropic's Claude and Haiku models, the tool is straightforwardly called "Computer Use." It's available exclusively with the company's mid-range 3.5 Sonnet model right now, via the API. Users can give multi-step instructions (Anthropic claims it can go for tens or even hundreds of steps) to accomplish tasks on the user's computer by "looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text."</p>
<p>Here's how Anthropic says it works:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/anthropic-publicly-releases-ai-tool-that-can-take-over-the-users-mouse-cursor/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Police use of automated license-plate reader cameras is being challenged in a lawsuit alleging that the cameras enable warrantless surveillance in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The city of Norfolk, Virginia, was sued yesterday by plaintiffs represented by the <a href="https://ij.org/about-us/">Institute for Justice</a>, a nonprofit public-interest law firm.</p>
<p>Norfolk, a city with about 238,000 residents, "has installed a network of cameras that make it functionally impossible for people to drive anywhere without having their movements tracked, photographed, and stored in an AI-assisted database that enables the warrantless surveillance of their every move. This civil rights lawsuit seeks to end this dragnet surveillance program," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.562101/gov.uscourts.vaed.562101.1.0.pdf">complaint</a> filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>
<p>Like many other cities, Norfolk uses cameras made by the company Flock Safety. A <a href="https://www.404media.co/lawsuit-argues-warrantless-use-of-flock-surveillance-cameras-is-unconstitutional/">404 Media article</a> said Institute for Justice lawyer Robert Frommer "told 404 Media that the lawsuit could have easily been filed in any of the more than 5,000 communities where Flock is active, but that Norfolk made sense because the Fourth Circuit of Appeals—which Norfolk is part of—recently held that persistent, warrantless drone surveillance in Baltimore is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment in a case called <em><a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-135/leaders-of-a-beautiful-struggle-v-baltimore-police-department/?ref=404media.co">Beautiful Struggle v Baltimore Police Department</a></em>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/lawsuit-city-cameras-make-it-impossible-to-drive-anywhere-without-being-tracked/">Read full article</a></p>
