                            <![CDATA[<p>KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—Preparations for the first human spaceflight to the Moon in more than 50 years took a big step forward this weekend with the rollout of the Artemis II rocket to its launch pad.</p>
<p>The rocket reached a top speed of just 1 mph on the four-mile, 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At the end of its nearly 10-day tour through cislunar space, the Orion capsule on top of the rocket will exceed 25,000 mph as it plunges into the atmosphere to bring its four-person crew back to Earth.</p>
<p class="p1">"This is the start of a very long journey," said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. "We ended our last human exploration of the moon on Apollo 17."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-artemis-ii-rocket-rolls-to-launch-pad-but-key-test-looms-ahead/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It's been nearly three years now since <em>Destiny</em> maker (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/sony-to-acquire-bungie-destiny-series-for-3-6-billion/">Sony subsidiary</a>) Bungie <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/remember-marathon-bungies-pre-halo-and-destiny-shooter-its-back-kind-of/">formally announced</a> a revival of the storied <em>Marathon</em> FPS franchise. And it has been about seven months since the game's original announced release date of September 23, 2025 was <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">pushed back indefinitely</a> after a reportedly poor response to the game's first Alpha test.</p>
<p>But today, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/bungie-unveils-marathon/">a post on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Bungie revealed that the new <em>Marathon</em> would finally be hitting PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on March 5, narrowing down the month-long March release window <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">announced back in December</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Destiny 2</em>, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/destiny-2-will-become-free-to-play-later-this-year-fully-cross-platform/">transitioned to a free-to-play model in 2019</a>, the new <em>Marathon</em> sells for $40 in a Standard Edition or a $60 Deluxe Edition that includes some digital rewards and cosmetics. That mirrors the pricing of the somewhat similar <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which recently hit 12 million sales in less than 12 weeks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/bungies-delayed-marathon-revival-will-finally-launch-march-5/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Mac power users waiting on new high-end MacBook Pro models may have been disappointed last fall, when Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/m5-macbook-pro-review-fifth-generation-apple-silicon-in-a-familiar-wrapper/">released an M5 upgrade for the low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> without touching the M4 Pro or Max versions of the laptop. But the wait for M5 Pro and M5 Max models may be nearing its end.</p>
<p>The tea-leaf readers at MacRumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/18/macbook-pro-up-to-two-month-wait/">noticed</a> that shipping times for a handful of high-end MacBook Pro configurations have slipped into mid-to-late February, rather than being available immediately as most Mac models are. This is often, though not always, a sign that Apple has slowed down or stopped production of an existing product in anticipation of an update.</p>
<p>Currently, the shipping delays affect the M4 Max versions of both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. If you order them today, these models will arrive sometime between February 3 and February 24, depending on the configuration you choose; many M4 Pro versions are still available for same-day shipping, though adding a nano-texture display or upgrading RAM can still add a week or so to the shipping time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/signs-point-to-a-sooner-rather-than-later-m5-macbook-pro-refresh/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk is going for some substantial damages in his lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/openai-wouldnt-exist-without-me-elon-musk-says-reviving-lawsuit/">making a fool out of him" as an early investor</a>.</p>
<p>On Friday, Musk filed a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Musk-v-Altman-Notice-of-Remedies.pdf">notice</a> on remedies sought in the lawsuit, confirming that he's seeking damages between $79 billion and $134 billion from OpenAI and its largest backer, co-defendant Microsoft.</p>
<p>Musk hired an expert he has never used before, C. Paul Wazzan, who reached this estimate by concluding that Musk's early contributions to OpenAI generated 50 to 75 percent of the nonprofit's current value. He got there by analyzing four factors: Musk's total financial contributions before he left OpenAI in 2018, Musk's proposed equity stake in OpenAI in 2017, Musk's current equity stake in xAI, and Musk's nonmonetary contributions to OpenAI (like investing time or lending his reputation).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/elon-musk-accused-of-making-up-math-to-squeeze-134b-from-openai-microsoft/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>An unconfirmed report early this month suggested Asus was pulling back on its smartphone plans, but the company declined to comment at the time. Asus chairman Jonney Shih has now confirmed the wind-down of its smartphone business during an event in Taiwan. Instead, Asus will focus on AI products like robots and smart glasses.</p>
<p>Shih addressed the company's future plans during a 2026 kick-off event in Taiwan, as reported by <a href="https://www.inside.com.tw/article/40522-asus-phone-nomore">Inside</a>. "Asus will no longer add new mobile phone models in the future," said Shih (machine translated).</p>
<p>So don't expect a new Zenfone or ROG Phone from Asus in 2026. That said, very few phone buyers were keeping tabs on the latest Asus phones anyway, which is probably why Asus is throwing in the towel. Shih isn't saying Asus won't ever release a new phone, but the company will take an "indefinite wait-and-see" approach. Again, this is a translation and could be interpreted in multiple ways.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/asus-confirms-its-smartphone-business-is-on-indefinite-hiatus/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Currently, Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/project-xcloud-preview-serves-as-a-passable-portable-xbox-one/">long-running</a> Cloud Gaming service is limited to players that have a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">Microsoft's Game Pass subscription</a>. Now, new reporting suggests Microsoft is planning to offer non-subscribers access to game streams paid for by advertising in the near future, but only in extremely limited circumstances.</p>
<p>The latest wave of rumors was set off late last week when The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomwarren.co.uk/post/3mcljqyff4k2d">shared an Xbox Cloud Gaming loading screen</a> with a message mentioning "1 hour of ad supported playtime per session." That leaked message comes after <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-getting-next-gen-treatment-too">Windows Central reported last summer</a> that Microsoft has been "exploring video ads for free games for quite some time," à la <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/faq/#nv-accordion-f0f63b4f7a-item-28f64413e6">the two-minute sponsorships that appear before free-tier game streams on Nvidia's GeForce Now service</a>.</p>
<p>Don't get your hopes up for easy, free, ad-supported access to the entire Xbox Cloud Gaming library, though. Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-cloud-gaming-will-get-an-ad-supported-tier-this-year-rumors-coalesce-after-ad-support-notices-appear-prematurely">now reports</a> that Microsoft will be using ads merely to slightly expand access to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/buy-and-stream">its "Stream your own game" program</a>. That program currently offers subscribers to the Xbox Game Pass Essentials tier (or higher) the privilege of streaming versions of some of the Xbox games they've already purchased digitally. Windows Central's unnamed sources suggest a "session-based ad-supported access tier" to stream those purchased games will be offered to non-subscribers as soon as "this year."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/reports-of-ad-supported-xbox-game-streams-show-microsofts-lack-of-imagination/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I have been writing about the Giant Magellan Telescope for a long time. <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/time-running-out-in-race-to-build-largest-1791289.php">Nearly two decades ago</a>, for example, I wrote that time was "running out" in the race to build the next great optical telescope on the ground.</p>
<p>At the time the proposed telescope was one of three contenders to make a giant leap in mirror size from the roughly 10-meter diameter instruments that existed then, to approximately 30 meters. This represented a huge increase in light-gathering potential, allowing astronomers to see much further into the universe—and therefore back into time—with far greater clarity.</p>
<p>Since then the projects have advanced at various rates. An international consortium to build the Thirty Meter Telescope in Hawaii ran into local protests that have bogged down development. Its future came further into question when the US National Science Foundation <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2025/05/funding-cuts-may-doom-the-long-stalled-thirty-meter-telescope/">dropped support</a> for the project in favor of the Giant Magellan Telescope. Meanwhile the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) has advanced on a faster schedule, and this 39.5-meter telescope could observe its first light in 2029.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/as-europes-large-ground-telescope-project-advances-how-is-its-us-competitor-faring/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bAk4PFEuWKQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p><em>Far Side</em> fans might recall a classic 1982 cartoon called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools">Cow Tools</a>," featuring a cow standing next to a jumble of strange objects—the joke being that cows don't use tools. That's why a pet Swiss brown cow in Austria named Veronika has caused a bit of a sensation: she likes to pick up random sticks and use them to scratch herself. According to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01597-0">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, this is a form of multipurpose tool use and suggests that the cognitive capabilities of cows have been underestimated by scientists.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/11/parrot-in-captivity-manufactures-tools-something-not-seen-in-the-wild/">previously reported</a>, tool use was once thought to be one of the defining features of humans, but examples of it were eventually observed in primates and other mammals. Dolphins can toss objects as a form of play which some scientists consider to be a type of tool use, particularly when it involves another member of the same species. Potential purposes include a means of communication, social bonding, or aggressiveness. (Octopuses have also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/take-that-octopuses-caught-on-camera-vigorously-throwing-debris-at-each-other/">been observed</a> engaging in similar throwing behavior.)</p>
<p>But the biggest surprise came when birds were observed using tools in the wild. After all, birds are the only surviving dinosaurs, and mammals and dinosaurs hadn’t shared a common ancestor for hundreds of millions of years. In the wild, observed <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2010/09/for-crows-a-little-tool-use-goes-a-long-way/">tool use has been limited</a> to the corvids (crows and jays), which show a variety of other complex behaviors—they’ll <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/bird-brains-crows-remember-your-face-and-know-youre-hiding-in-there/">remember your face</a> and recognize the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/birds-of-a-feather-flock-together-even-in-death/">passing of their dead</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/meet-veronika-the-tool-using-cow/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you've ever used a 3D printer, you may recall the wondrous feeling when you first printed something you could have never sculpted or built yourself. Download a model file, load some plastic filament, push a button, and almost like magic, a three-dimensional object appears. But the result isn't polished and ready for mass production, and creating a novel shape requires more skills than just pushing a button. Interestingly, today's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">AI coding agents</a> feel much the same way.</p>
<p>Since November, I have used <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">Claude Code</a> and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">Codex</a> in a similar way, though not as frequently). Fifty projects later, I'll be frank: I have not had this much fun with a computer since I learned BASIC on my <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/440/shining-a-rotten-apple">Apple II Plus</a> when I was 9 years old. This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic's premium AI plans.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people's code for my needs. Since 1990, I've programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The global cost of greenhouse gas emissions is nearly double what scientists previously thought, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02533-5">study</a> published Thursday by researchers at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>
<p>It is the first time a social cost of carbon (SCC) assessment—a key measure of economic harm caused by climate change—has included damages to the ocean. Global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction are estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion annually, fundamentally changing how we measure climate finance.</p>
<p>“For decades, we’ve been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,” said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. “Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/ocean-damage-nearly-doubles-the-cost-of-climate-change/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tencia Benavidez, a Supernatural user who lives in New Mexico, started her VR workouts during the Covid pandemic. She has been a regular user in the five years since, calling the ability to work out in VR ideal, given that she lives in a rural area where it’s hard to get to a gym or work out outside during a brutal winter. She stuck with Supernatural because of the community and the eagerness of Supernatural’s coaches.</p>
<p>“They seem like really authentic individuals that were not talking down to you,” Benavidez says. “There's just something really special about those coaches.”</p>
<p>Meta bought Supernatural in 2022, folding it into its then-heavily-invested-in metaverse efforts. The purchase was not a smooth process, as it triggered a lengthy legal battle in which the US Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/07/ftc-seeks-block-virtual-reality-giant-metas-acquisition-popular-app-creator-within">tried to block Meta</a> from purchasing the service due to antitrust concerns about Meta “trying to buy its way to the top” of the VR market. Meta ultimately prevailed. At the time, some Supernatural users were cautiously optimistic, hoping that big bag of Zuckerbucks could keep its workout juggernaut afloat.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/metas-layoffs-leave-supernatural-fitness-users-in-mourning/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—The rocket NASA is preparing to send four astronauts on a trip around the Moon will emerge from its assembly building on Florida's Space Coast early Saturday for a slow crawl to its seaside launch pad.</p>
<p>Riding atop one of NASA's diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world's heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours.</p>
<p>The rollout marks a major step for NASA's Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/managers-on-alert-for-launch-fever-as-pressure-builds-for-nasas-moon-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Archaeologists recently found the wreck of an enormous medieval cargo ship lying on the seafloor off the Danish coast, and it reveals new details of medieval trade and life at sea.</p>
<p>Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE.</p>

<h2><b>A medieval megaship</b></h2>
<p>Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/archaeologists-find-a-supersized-medieval-shipwreck-in-denmark/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The operator of WorldCat won a default judgment against Anna's Archive, with a federal judge ruling yesterday that the shadow library must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data.</p>
<p>Anna's Archive is a shadow library and search engine for other shadow libraries that was launched in 2022. It archives books and other written materials and makes them available via torrents, and recently expanded its ambitions by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">scraping Spotify to make a 300TB copy</a> of the most-streamed songs. Anna's Archive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-says-suspension-likely-unrelated-to-spotify-piracy/">lost its .org domain</a> a couple of weeks ago but remains online at other domains.</p>
<p>Yesterday's ruling is in a case filed by OCLC, a nonprofit that operates the WorldCat library catalog on behalf of member libraries. OCLC alleged that Anna’s Archive “illegally hacked WorldCat.org” to steal 2.2TB of data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-annas-archive-to-delete-scraped-data-no-one-thinks-it-will-comply/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A generally healthy 63-year-old man in the New England area went to the hospital with a fever, cough, and vision problems in his right eye. His doctors eventually determined that a dreaded hypervirulent bacteria—which is rising globally—was ravaging several of his organs, including his brain.</p>
<p>According to the man, the problems started three weeks before his hospital visit, when he said he ate some bad meat and started vomiting and having diarrhea. Those symptoms faded after about two weeks, but then new problems began—he started coughing and having chills and a fever. His cough only worsened from there.</p>
<p>At the hospital, doctors took X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest and abdomen. The images revealed over 15 nodules and masses in his lungs. But that's not all they found. The imaging also revealed a mass in his liver that was 8.6 cm in diameter (about 3.4 inches). Lab work pointed toward an infection, so doctors admitted him to the hospital and provided oxygen to help with his breathing, as well as antibiotics. But his chills and cough continued.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/01/this-may-be-the-grossest-eye-pic-ever-but-the-cause-is-whats-truly-horrifying/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">announced</a> it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVRHTWWEIz4&amp;t=2267s">described</a> advertising in ChatGPT as a "last resort" and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.</p>
<p>The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/">ChatGPT Go</a> plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.</p>
<p>Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/openai-to-test-ads-in-chatgpt-as-it-burns-through-billions/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Security firm Mandiant has released a database that allows any administrative password protected by Microsoft’s NTLM.v1 hash algorithm to be hacked in an attempt to nudge users who continue using the deprecated function despite known weaknesses.</p>
<p>The database comes in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow table</a>, which is a precomputed table of hash values linked to their corresponding plaintext. These generic tables, which work against multiple hashing schemes, allow hackers to take over accounts by quickly mapping a stolen hash to its password counterpart. NTLMv1 rainbow tables are particularly easy to construct because of NTLMv1’s limited keyspace, meaning the relatively small number of possible passwords the hashing function allows for. NTLMv1 rainbow tables have existed for two decades but typically require large amounts of resources to make any use of them.</p>
<h2>New ammo for security pros</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Mandiant <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/net-ntlmv1-deprecation-rainbow-tables/">said</a> it had <a href="https://research.google/resources/datasets/?dataset_types=other&amp;search=Net-NTLMv1&amp;">released</a> an NTLMv1 rainbow table that will allow defenders and researchers (and, of course, malicious hackers, too) to recover passwords in under 12 hours using consumer hardware costing less than $600 USD. The table is hosted in Google Cloud. The database works against Net-NTLMv1 passwords, which are used in network authentication for accessing resources such as SMB network sharing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/mandiant-releases-rainbow-table-that-cracks-weak-admin-password-in-12-hours/">Read full article</a></p>

Standalone, direct-to-consumer RAM kits were some of the first products to feel the bite, with prices spiking by 300 or 400 percent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/for-just-a-couple-of-months-in-the-middle-of-2025-it-was-an-ok-time-to-build-a-pc/">by the end of 2025</a>; prices for SSDs had also increased noticeably, albeit more modestly.</p>
<p>The rest of 2026 is going to be all about where, how, and to what extent those price spikes flow downstream into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/the-ram-shortages-silver-lining-less-talk-about-ai-pcs/">computers</a>, phones, and other components that use RAM and NAND chips—areas where the existing supply of products and longer-term supply contracts negotiated by big companies have helped keep prices from surging too noticeably so far.</p>
<p>This week, we're seeing signs that the RAM crunch is starting to affect the GPU market—Asus made some waves when it inadvertently <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/110943-rtx-5070-ti-effectively-dead-gpu-market-worse.html">announced</a> that it was discontinuing its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-an-rtx-4080-for-749-at-least-in-theory/">GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/ram-shortage-chaos-expands-to-gpus-high-capacity-ssds-and-even-hard-drives/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon has received all approvals it needs for a $9.6 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications, an Internet service provider with about 3.3 million broadband customers in 25 states. Verizon said it expects to complete the merger on January 20.</p>
<p>The last <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M595/K063/595063475.PDF">approval</a> came from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which allowed the deal in a 5–0 vote yesterday. There were months of negotiations that resulted in requirements to deploy more fiber and wireless infrastructure, offer $20-per-month Internet service to people with low incomes for the next decade, and other commitments, including some designed to replace the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policies that Verizon had to end because of demands by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>"The approval follows extensive public participation, testimony from multiple parties, and negotiated settlement agreements with consumer advocates and labor organizations," the CPUC <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-approves-verizon-frontier-acquisition-with-strong-consumer-protections-and-oversight">said yesterday</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-frontier-to-complete-10b-merger-after-approvals-from-fcc-and-states/">Read full article</a></p>
