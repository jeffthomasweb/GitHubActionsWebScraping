              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.21 of the Rocket Report! We're publishing the Rocket Report a little early this week due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. We don't expect any Thanksgiving rocket launches this year, but still, there's a lot to cover from the last six days. It seems like we've seen the last flight of the year by SpaceX's Starship rocket. A NASA filing with the Federal Aviation Administration requests approval to fly an aircraft near the reentry corridor over the Indian Ocean for the next Starship test flight. The application suggests the target launch date is January 11, 2025.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>Another grim first in Ukraine. </b>For the first time in warfare, Russia launched an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile against a target in Ukraine, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/russian-ballistic-missile-attack-on-ukraine-portends-new-era-of-warfare/">Ars reports</a>. This attack on November 21 followed an announcement from Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier the same week that the country would change its policy for employing nuclear weapons in conflict.

            <![CDATA[Scientists studied trace fossils called bromalites to reconstruct critical food webs in late Triassic, early Jurassic.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Paleontologists have long puzzled over how the dinosaurs—originally relatively small and of minor importance to the broader ecosystem—evolved to become the dominant species some 30 million years later. Fossilized feces and vomit from dinosaurs might hold important clues to how and why this evolutionary milestone came about, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature.</p>
<p>Co-author Martin Qvarnström, an evolutionary biologist with Uppsala University in Sweden, and his collaborators studied trace fossils known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromalite">bromalites</a>, a designation that includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolite">coprolites</a> as well as vomit or other fossilized matter from an organism's digestive tract. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-fossilized-fishs-skull-is-filled-with-feces/">previously reported</a>, coprolites aren't quite the same as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleofeces">paleofeces</a>, which retain a lot of organic components that can be reconstituted and analyzed for chemical properties. Coprolites are fossils, so most organic components have been replaced by mineral deposits like silicate and calcium carbonates.</p>
<p>For archaeologists keen on learning more about the health and diet of past populations—as well as how certain parasites evolved in the evolutionary history of the microbiome—coprolites and paleofeces can be a veritable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/gut-check-fossil-finds-give-us-a-history-of-life-and-what-it-ate/">goldmine of information</a>. For instance, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/the-proofs-in-the-poop-austrians-have-loved-beer-blue-cheese-for-2700-years/">in 2021 we reported</a> on an <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01271-9">analysis of preserved paleo-poop</a> revealing that ancient Iron Age miners in what is now Austria were fond of beer and blue cheese.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/what-fossilized-dino-feces-can-tell-us-about-their-rise-to-dominance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><b>UPDATE: November 28, 3:20 PM California time.</b> The headline of this post has been changed. This update is adding the following further details: this threat is not a UEFI firmware implant or rootkit, it's a UEFI bootkit attacking the bootloader. The Bootkitty sample analyzed by ESET was not unkillable. Below is the article with inaccurate details removed.</p>
<p>Researchers at security firm ESET said Wednesday that they found the first UEFI bootkit for Linux. The discovery may portend that UEFI bootkits that have targeted Windows systems in recent years may soon target Linux too.</p>
<p>Bootkitty—the name unknown threat actors gave to their Linux bootkit—was uploaded to VirusTotal earlier this month. Compared to many Windows UEFI bootkits, Bootkitty is still relatively rudimentary, containing imperfections in key under-the-hood functionality and lacking the means to infect all Linux distributions other than Ubuntu. That has led the company researchers to suspect the new bootkit is likely a proof-of-concept release. To date, ESET has found no evidence of actual infections in the wild.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/found-in-the-wild-the-worlds-first-unkillable-uefi-bootkit-for-linux/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Most airplanes in the world have vertical tails or rudders to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_roll">Dutch roll</a> instabilities, a combination of yawing and sideways motions with rolling that looks a bit like the movements of a skater. Unfortunately, a vertical tail adds weight and generates drag, which reduces fuel efficiency in passenger airliners. It also increases the radar signature, which is something you want to keep as low as possible in a military aircraft.</p>
<p>In the B-2 stealth bomber, one of the very few rudderless airplanes, Dutch roll instabilities are dealt with using drag flaps positioned at the tips of its wings, which can split and open to make one wing generate more drag than the other and thus laterally stabilize the machine. “But it is not really an efficient way to solve this problem,” says David Lentink, an aerospace engineer and a biologist at the University of Groningen, Netherlands. “The efficient way is solving it by generating lift instead of drag. This is something birds do.”</p>
<p>Lentink led the study aimed at better understanding birds’ rudderless flight mechanics.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/getting-a-drone-to-fly-like-a-pigeon/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Starlink yesterday obtained federal approval to provide service to cell phones, with some limits. The Federal Communications Commission issued an <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-1193A1.pdf">order</a> that partially grants SpaceX's application while imposing conditions and deferring a decision on some aspects of the application.</p>
<p>Starlink received approval to provide Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) within the United States. This means that in areas not covered by terrestrial cellular networks, Starlink satellites can provide service to cell phones. SpaceX already had approval to launch 7,500 second-generation satellites for its existing broadband service, and the new approval allows mobile service from those satellites.</p>
<p>The approval lets Starlink and T-Mobile move ahead with their plan to provide satellite service to phones in cellular dead spots. SpaceX is authorized to use the 1910–1915 MHz (Earth-to-space) and 1990–1995 MHz (space-to-Earth) bands for SCS pursuant to its lease agreement with T-Mobile. The lease covers the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/fcc-approves-starlink-plan-for-cellular-phone-service-with-some-limits/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Makers of smart devices that fail to disclose how long they will support their products with software updates may be breaking the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law">Magnuson Moss Warranty Act</a>, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned this week.</p>
<p>The FTC released its statement after examining 184 smart products across 64 product categories, including soundbars, video doorbells, breast pumps, smartphones, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/half-of-smart-appliances-remain-disconnected-from-internet-makers-lament/">home appliances</a>, and<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/i-too-installed-an-open-source-garage-door-opener-and-am-loving-it/"> garage door opener controllers</a>. Among devices researched, the majority—or 163 to be precise—"did not disclose the connected device support duration or end date" on their product webpage, per the FTC's report [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/smart-device-makers-failure-to-provide-software-updates-may-leave-you-smarting.pdf">PDF</a>]. Contrastingly, 11.4 percent of devices examined shared a software support duration or end date on their product page.</p>
<h2>Elusive information</h2>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has cut off testing access to its Sora video generation platform after a group of artists briefly shared their own early access in a publicly usable webpage Tuesday. The group, going by the moniker PR Puppets, claims the stunt was a protest against being asked to work as unpaid R&amp;D and bug testers while participating in "art washing" of AI tools. But OpenAI says participation in the early alpha test is voluntary and has no requirements that testers provide feedback.</p>
<p>PR Puppets <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/PR-Puppets/PR-Puppet-Sora">posted its "Generate with Sora" access point to Hugging Face</a> at about 8:30 Eastern time Tuesday morning, according to Git commit logs. Quickly, AI experts on social media noticed the posting and <a href="https://twitter.com/btibor91/status/1861435635891917100">confirmed</a> that the page connected to endpoints on OpenAI's actual Sora API and hosting on a videos.openai.com domain, presumably with authentication tokens provided to testers by OpenAI itself.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">OMG OpenAI Sora has been leaked!</p>
<p>Free to use now on Huggingface, link in comment</p>
<p>It can be shut down anytime, try it now! It can generate 1080P and up to 10s video! And the results are incredible!</p>

<p>That access was revoked within hours, but not before <a href="https://twitter.com/EHuanglu/status/1861446152924864908">plenty</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/BEAST_OFFICIIAL/status/1861450783377539416">eager</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/koltregaskes/status/1861436467936985190">followers</a> managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/1861440503864049800">generate their own videos</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/slow_developer/status/1861440783867388298">share them on social media</a>.

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google got some disappointing news at a status conference Tuesday, where US District Judge Amit Mehta suggested that Google's AI products may be restricted as an appropriate remedy following the government's win in the search monopoly trial.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.law360.com/competition/articles/2266076">According to Law360</a>, Mehta said that "the recent emergence of AI products that are intended to mimic the functionality of search engines" is rapidly shifting the search market. Because the judge is now weighing preventive measures to combat Google's anticompetitive behavior, the judge wants to hear much more about how each side views AI's role in Google's search empire during the remedies stage of litigation than he did during the search trial.</p>
<p>"AI and the integration of AI is only going to play a much larger role, it seems to me, in the remedy phase than it did in the liability phase," Mehta said. "Is that because of the remedies being requested? Perhaps. But is it also potentially because the market that we have all been discussing has shifted?"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/google-drags-ai-rivals-into-search-trial-as-judge-entertains-ai-remedies/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-27939.pdf">The proposals</a> fit into the administration's existing aims to improve and protect access to care in Medicare and Medicaid programs. But, the future of the proposals is uncertain, as it will be up to the Trump administration to finalize the policies.</p>
<h2>Anti-obesity drugs</h2>
<p>The flashiest of the proposals is to reinterpret existing law in such a way as to allow Medicare and Medicaid coverage of anti-obesity drugs—particularly the extremely popular and pricy GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound. Existing policy excludes coverage of drugs used for "weight loss" or "weight gain."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/biden-proposes-guardrails-on-health-care-ai-upping-weight-loss-drug-access/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The United States will have a second team competing in Formula 1 from 2026, when Cadillac Formula 1 will join the sport as its 11th team. The result is a complete 180 for the sport's owner, which was highly resistant to the initial bid, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/cadillac-wants-to-enter-formula-1-with-andretti-global/">first announced</a> at the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>"As the pinnacle of motorsports, F1 demands boundary-pushing innovation and excellence. It's an honor for General Motors and Cadillac to join the world's premier racing series, and we're committed to competing with passion and integrity to elevate the sport for race fans around the world," said GM President Mark Reuss.

      Lee Jung-Jae returns as Player 456 in the second season of <em>Squid Game</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>The 2021 Korean series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game"><em>Squid Game</em></a> was a massive hit for Netflix, racking up 1.65 billion viewing hours in its first four weeks and snagging 14 Emmy nominations. Fans have been longing for a second season ever since, and we're finally getting it this year for Christmas. Netflix just released the official trailer.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>The first season followed Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-Jae, seen earlier this year in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/disney-cancels-the-acolyte-after-one-season/"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>), a down-on-his-luck gambler who has little left to lose when he agrees to play children's playground games against 455 other players for money. The twist? If you lose a game, you die. If you cheat, you die. And if you win, you might also die.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/player-456-is-back-for-revenge-in-squid-game-s2-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Lobby groups for Internet service providers claim that ISPs' customer service is so good already that the government shouldn't consider any new regulations to mandate improvements. They also claim ISPs face so much competition that market forces require providers to treat their customers well or lose them to competitors.</p>
<p>Cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association told the Federal Communications Commission in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1122573117031/1">filing</a> that "providing high-quality products and services and a positive customer experience is a competitive necessity in today's robust communications marketplace. To attract and retain customers, NCTA's cable operator members continuously strive to ensure that the customer support they provide is effective and user-friendly. Given these strong marketplace imperatives, new regulations that would micromanage providers’ customer service operations are unnecessary."</p>
<p>Lobby groups filed comments in response to an FCC review of customer service that was <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-review-customer-support-offered-consumers">announced last month</a>, before the presidential election. While the FCC's current Democratic leadership is interested in regulating customer service practices, the Republicans who will soon take over opposed the inquiry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/isps-say-their-excellent-customer-service-is-why-users-dont-switch-providers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Virtual reality (VR) technology has long sought to incorporate the human senses into virtual and mixed-reality environments. In addition to sight and sound, researchers have been trying to add the sensation of human touch and smell via various user interfaces, as well as taste. But the latter has proved to be quite challenging. A team of Hong Kong scientists has now developed a handheld user interface shaped like a lollipop capable of re-creating several different flavors in a virtual environment, according to a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2412116121">new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>
<p>It's well established that human taste consists of sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami—five basic flavors induced by chemical stimulation of the tongue and, to a lesser extent, in parts of the pharynx, larynx, and epiglottis. Recreating those sensations in VR has resulted in a handful of attempts at a flavor user interface, relying on such mechanisms as chemical, thermal, and electrical stimulation, as well as iontophoresis.</p>
<p>The chemical approach usually involves applying flavoring chemicals directly onto the tongue, but this requires room for bulk storage of said chemicals, and there is a long delay time that is not ideal for VR applications. Thermal variations applied directly to the tongue can stimulate taste sensations but require a complicated system incorporating a cooling subsystem and temperature sensors, among other components.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/licking-this-lollipop-will-let-you-taste-virtual-flavors/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like a lot of children of the '80s, my early gaming nostalgia has a huge hole where the Atari 7800 might have lived. While <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/retro-colored-glasses/">practically everyone I knew had an NES</a> during my childhood—and a few uncles and friends' older siblings even had an Atari 2600 gathering dust in their dens—I was only vaguely aware of the 7800, Atari's backward compatible, late '80s attempt to maintain relevance in the quickly changing console market.</p>
<p>Absent that kind of nostalgia, the Atari 7800+ comes across as a real oddity. Fiddling with the system's extremely cumbersome controllers and pixelated, arcade-port-heavy software library from a modern perspective is like peering into a fallen alternate universe, one where Nintendo wasn't able to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/war-stories-how-nintendo-sold-the-nes-to-a-skeptical-country/">swoop in and revive a flailing Western home video game industry</a> with the NES.</p>
<p>Even for those with fond memories of Atari 7800-filled childhoods, I'm not sure that this bare-bones package justifies its $130 price. There are many more full-featured ways to get your retro gaming fix, even for those still invested in the tail end of Atari's dead-end branch of the gaming console's evolutionary tree.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-atari-7800-is-a-no-frills-glimpse-into-a-forgotten-gaming-era/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When you compare SpaceX to the world's other space enterprises, it's probably easier to list the things SpaceX hasn't done instead of reciting all of the company's achievements.</p>
<p>One of these is the launch of nuclear materials. SpaceX has launched a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/nasa-launches-mission-to-explore-the-frozen-frontier-of-jupiters-moon-europa/">handful of planetary science missions</a> for NASA, but these spacecraft have all used solar arrays to generate electricity. In this century, NASA's probes relying on nuclear power have all flown on rockets built by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>This is about to change with a $256.6 million contract NASA awarded to SpaceX on Monday.

The company has pulled back the firmware and issued a fixed version, but the company's response has left some users feeling less confident in the boxes into which they put all their digital stuff.</p>
<p>As seen on <a href="https://community.qnap.com/t/firmware-qts-5-2-2-2950-build-20241114-released/254">a QNAP community thread</a>, and as <a href="https://www.qnap.com/en-us/news/2024/qnap-addresses-recent-qts-5-2-2-operating-system-update-issues">announced by QNAP itself</a>, the QNAP operating system, QTS, received update 5.2.2.2950, build 20241114, at some point around November 19. After QNAP "received feedbacks from some users reporting issues with device functionality after installation," the firm says it withdrew it, "conducted a comprehensive investigation," and re-released a fixed version "within 24 hours."</p>
<p>The community thread sees many more users of different systems having problems than the shortlist ("limited models of TS-x53D series and TS-x51 series") released by QNAP. Issues reported included owners being rejected as an authorized user, devices reporting issues with booting, and claims of Python not being installed to run some apps and services.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/qnap-firmware-update-leaves-nas-owners-locked-out-of-their-boxes/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the Biden-Harris administration finalized a CHIPS award of up to $7.865 billion to help fund the expansion of Intel's commercial fabs in the US. By the end of the decade, these fabs are intended to decrease reliance on foreign adversaries and fill substantial gaps in America's domestic semiconductor supply chain.</p>
<p>Initially, Intel was awarded $8.5 billion, but it was decreased after Intel won a $3 billion subsidy from the Pentagon to expand Department of Defense semiconductor manufacturing. In a <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-chips-incentives-award-intel">press release</a>, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo boasted that the substantial award would set up "Intel to drive one of the most significant semiconductor manufacturing expansions in US history" and "supercharge American innovation" while making the US "more secure."</p>
<p>For Intel, the CHIPS funding supports an expected investment of nearly $90 billion by 2030 to expand projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. Approximately 10,000 manufacturing jobs and 20,000 construction jobs will be created "across all four states," the Commerce Department's press release said. Additionally, Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-chips-act.html#gs.ir2gfr">estimated </a>that the funding will create "more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/workers-demand-more-transparency-after-intel-secures-8b-chips-funding/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal agents briefly detained infamous ex-hospital CEO Ralph de la Torre early last week and seized his phone, according to an investigative report from the Boston Globe.</p>
<p>De la Torre is the ultra-wealthy former CEO of the now-bankrupt hospital chain Steward, once the largest for-profit health care company in the country. Steward and de la Torre have been accused of being "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/ceo-of-health-care-terrorists-sues-senators-after-contempt-of-congress-charges/">health care terrorists</a>" and practicing "third-world medicine" that killed and maimed patients as executives extracted millions in payouts, stripping the company of assets.</p>
<p>In September, de la Torre was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/senate-holds-rich-ceo-of-third-world-medicine-hospitals-in-contempt/">held in criminal contempt of Congress</a> for failing to abide by a congressional subpoena to attend a Senate hearing over the alleged corruption.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/things-arent-looking-good-for-infamous-ceo-of-health-care-terrorists/">Read full article</a></p>
