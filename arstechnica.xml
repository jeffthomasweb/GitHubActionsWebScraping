                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As age-verification laws continue to dismantle the adult industry—and determine the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-internet-revolutionized-porn-age-verification-could-upend-everything/">future of free speech on the internet</a>—a Utah lawmaker proposed a bill this week that would enforce a tax on <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/porn/">porn</a> sites that operate within the state.</p>
<p>Introduced by state senator Calvin Musselman, a Republican, <a href="https://le.utah.gov/Session/2026/bills/introduced/SB0073.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://le.utah.gov/Session/2026/bills/introduced/SB0073.pdf" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">the bill</a> would impose a 7 percent tax on total receipts “from sales, distributions, memberships, subscriptions, performances, and content amounting to material harmful to minors that is produced, sold, filmed, generated, or otherwise based” in Utah. If passed, the bill would go into effect in May and would also require adult sites to pay a $500 annual fee to the State Tax Commission. Per the legislation, the money made from the tax will be used by Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services to provide more mental health support for teens.</p>
<p>Musselman did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/conservative-lawmakers-want-porn-taxes-critics-say-theyre-unconstitutional/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX today received US permission to launch another 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites, bringing its total authorization to 15,000 Gen2 satellites including those previously approved.</p>
<p>"Under this grant, SpaceX is authorized to construct, deploy, and operate an additional 7,500 Gen2 Starlink satellites, bringing the total to 15,000 satellites worldwide," the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-approves-next-gen-satellite-constellation">announced</a> today. "This expansion will enable SpaceX to deliver high-speed, low-latency Internet service globally, including enhanced mobile and supplemental coverage from space."</p>
<p>The FCC gave SpaceX permission for the first set of 7,500 satellites <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/starlink-speeds-in-us-dropped-from-105mbps-to-53mbps-in-the-past-year/">in December 2022</a>. The agency deferred action on the rest of the second-generation constellation at the time and limited the first batch to certain altitudes, saying it needed to "address concerns about orbital debris and space safety" before approving the full bunch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/spacex-gets-fcc-permission-to-launch-another-7500-starlink-satellites/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It took a while, but a consensus has emerged in Europe that the continent's space industry needs to develop reusable rockets. How to do it and how much to spend on it remain unresolved questions.</p>
<p>Much of the discourse around reusable rockets in Europe has focused on developing a brand new rocket that might eventually replace the Ariane 6, which debuted less than two years ago but still uses the use it and lose it model embraced by the launch industry for most of the Space Age.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/sizing-up-the-5-companies-selected-for-europes-launcher-challenge/">money to emerging rocket companies</a> in Europe to prove their small satellite launchers can do the job. ESA is also making money available to incentivize rocket upgrades to haul heavier cargo into orbit. ESA, the European Commission, and national governments are funding rocket hoppers to demonstrate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. While there is significant money behind these efforts, the projects are not unified, and progress has been slow.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/esa-considers-righting-the-wrongs-of-ariane-6-by-turning-it-into-a-franken-rocket/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/over-250-people-quarantined-in-south-carolina-as-measles-outbreak-rages/">measles outbreak in South Carolina</a> that began in October continues to rage, with the state health department reporting Friday that nearly 100 new cases have been identified just in the last three days.</p>
<p>In a regularly scheduled update this afternoon, the health department said <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/friday-measles-update-dph-reports-99-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-310">99 cases</a> were identified since Tuesday, bringing the outbreak total to <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak">310 cases</a>. There are currently 200 people in quarantine and nine in isolation. However, the outbreak is expanding so quickly and with so many exposure sites that health officials are struggling to trace cases and identify people at risk.</p>
<p>"An increasing number of public exposure sites are being identified with likely hundreds more people exposed who are not aware they should be in quarantine if they are not immune to measles," Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist and the health department's incident commander for the measles outbreak, said in the announcement. "Previous measles transmission studies have shown that one measles case can result in up to 20 new infections among unvaccinated contacts."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/measles-continues-raging-in-south-carolina-99-new-cases-since-tuesday/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Search engine optimization, or SEO, is a big business. While some SEO practices are useful, much of the day-to-day SEO wisdom you see online amounts to superstition. An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called "content chunking" may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google's <a href="https://search-off-the-record.libsyn.com/seo-aio-geo-your-site-third-party-support-to-optimize-for-llms"><em>Search Off the Record</em> podcast</a>, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea.</p>
<p>You've probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn't made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot.</p>
<p>According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn't use such signals to improve ranking. "One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?" said Sullivan. "So... we don't want you to do that."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-dont-make-bite-sized-content-for-llms-if-you-care-about-search-rank/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Italy fined Cloudflare 14.2 million euros for refusing to block access to pirate sites on its 1.1.1.1 DNS service, the country's communications regulatory agency, AGCOM, <a href="https://www.agcom.it/comunicazione/comunicati-stampa/comunicato-stampa-71">announced</a> yesterday. Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities.</p>
<p>AGCOM issued the fine under Italy's controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company's annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent.</p>
<p>The fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren't subject to the dispute over piracy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/cloudflare-may-pull-servers-out-of-italy-over-order-that-it-block-pirate-sites/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Collecting fallen (or "shed") elk antlers is a popular pastime in elk-heavy places like Montana, but it's usually a pretty low-tech, on-the-ground affair. That's why last year's story about a US Black Hawk helicopter descending from the skies to harvest shed elk antlers on a ranch was such an odd one.</p>
<p>Was it really possible that US military personnel were using multimillion-dollar government aircraft to land on private property in the Crazy Mountains—yes, that's their actual name—just to grab some antlers valued at a few hundred bucks?</p>
<h2>Antler hunt</h2>
<p>In May 2025, Montana rancher Linda McMullen received a call from a neighbor. "He said, 'Linda, there’s a green Army helicopter landed on your place, picking up elk antlers,’” McMullen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/montana-national-guard-helicopter-elk-antlers.html">told The New York Times last year</a>. “I said, ‘Are you joking?’ He said, ‘I’m looking at them with binoculars.’”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/us-black-hawk-helicopter-trespasses-on-private-montana-ranch-to-grab-elk-antlers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Poisoned arrows or darts have long been used by cultures all over the world for hunting or warfare. For example, there are recipes for poisoning projective weapons, and deploying them in battle, in Greek and Roman historical documents, as well as references in Greek mythology and Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. Chinese warriors over the ages did the same, as did the Gauls and Scythians, and some Native American populations.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have now found traces of a plant-based poison on several 60,000-year-old quartz Stone Age arrowheads found in South Africa, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz3281">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances. That would make this the oldest direct evidence of using poisons on projectiles—a cognitively complex hunting strategy—and pushes the timeline for using poison arrows back into the Pleistocene.</p>
<p>The poisons commonly used could be derived from plants or animals (frogs, beetles, venomous lizards). Plant-based examples include curare, a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the victim's respiratory system, causing death by asphyxiation. Oleander, milkweeds, or inee (onaye) contain cardiac glucosides. In Southeast Asia, the sap or juice of seeds from the ancar tree is smeared on arrowheads, which causes paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac arrest due to the presence of toxins like strychnine. Several species of aconite are known for their use as arrow poisons in Siberia and northern Japan.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/these-60000-year-old-poison-arrows-are-oldest-yet-found/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Friday morning, many outlets reported that X had blocked universal access to Grok's image-editing features after the chatbot began prompting some users to pay $8 to use them. The messages are seemingly in response to reporting that people are using Grok to generate thousands of non-consensual sexualized images of women and children each hour.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.24 of the Rocket Report! We're back from a restorative holiday, and there's a great deal Eric and I look forward to covering in 2026. You can get a taste of what we're expecting this year in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/here-are-the-launches-and-landings-were-most-excited-about-in-2026/">this feature</a>. Other storylines are also worth watching this year that didn't make the Top 20. Will SpaceX's Starship begin launching Starlink satellites? Will United Launch Alliance finally get its Vulcan rocket flying at a higher cadence? Will Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket be certified by the US Space Force? I'm looking forward to learning the answers to these questions, and more. As for what has already happened in 2026, it has been a slow start on the world's launch pads, with only a pair of SpaceX missions completed in the first week of the year. <em>Only?</em> Two launches in one week by any company would have been remarkable just a few years ago.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>New launch records set in 2025. </b>The number of orbital launch attempts worldwide last year surpassed the record 2024 flight rate by 25 percent, with SpaceX and China accounting for the bulk of the launch activity, <a href="https://aviationweek.com/space/launch-vehicles-propulsion/spaceops-global-orbital-launch-rate-jumped-25-2025">Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology reports</a>. Including near-orbital flight tests of SpaceX’s Starship-Super Heavy launch system, the number of orbital launch attempts worldwide reached 329 last year, an annual analysis of global launch and satellite activity by <a href="https://planet4589.org/space/papers/space25.pdf">Jonathan’s Space Report</a> shows. Of those 329 attempts, 321 reached orbit or marginal orbits. In addition to five Starship-Super Heavy launches, SpaceX launched 165 Falcon 9 rockets in 2025, surpassing its 2024 record of 134 Falcon 9 and two Falcon Heavy flights. No Falcon Heavy rockets flew in 2025. US providers, including Rocket Lab Electron orbital flights from its New Zealand spaceport, added another 30 orbital launches to the 2025 tally, solidifying the US as the world leader in space launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/rocket-report-spacex-and-china-led-the-way-in-2025-vandenberg-has-room-to-grow/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The writer and comedian Megan Koester got her first writing job, reviewing Internet pornography, from a <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/craigslist/">Craigslist</a> ad she responded to more than 15 years ago. Several years after that, she used the listings website to find the rent-controlled apartment where she still lives today. When she wanted to buy property, she scrolled through Craigslist and found a parcel of land in the Mojave Desert. She built a dwelling on it (never mind that she’d later discover it was unpermitted) and furnished it entirely with finds from Craigslist’s free section, right down to the laminate flooring, which had previously been used by a production company.</p>
<p>“There’s so many elements of my life that are suffused with Craigslist,” says Koester, 42, whose <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bornferal/?hl=en">Instagram account</a> is dedicated, at least in part, to cataloging screenshots of what she has dubbed “harrowing images” from the site’s free section; on the day we speak, she’s wearing a cashmere sweater that cost her nothing, besides the faith it took to respond to an ad with no pictures. “I’m ride or die.”</p>
<p>Koester is one of untold numbers of Craigslist aficionados, many of them in their thirties and forties, who not only still use the old-school classifieds site but also consider it an essential, if anachronistic, part of their everyday lives. It’s a place where anonymity is still possible, where money doesn’t have to be exchanged, and where strangers can make meaningful connections—for romantic pursuits, straightforward transactions, and even to cast unusual creative projects, including experimental TV shows like <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/167189/nathan-fielder-sorry-rehearsal-hbo-review"><i>The Rehearsal</i> on HBO and</a> Amazon Freevee’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/jury-duty-interview.html"><i>Jury Duty</i></a>. Unlike flashier online marketplaces such as DePop and its parent company, Etsy, or Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist doesn’t use algorithms to track users’ moves and predict what they want to see next. It doesn’t offer public profiles, rating systems, or “likes” and “shares” to dole out like social currency; as a result, Craigslist effectively disincentivizes clout-chasing and virality-seeking—behaviors that are often rewarded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. It’s a utopian vision of a much earlier, far more earnest Internet.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/ungentrified-craigslist-may-be-the-last-real-place-on-the-internet/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>American automakers who got overenthusiastic about electric vehicles continue to pay the price—literally. Yesterday, General Motors told investors that building and selling fewer EVs will cost the company $6 billion. Still, things could be worse—last month, rival Ford said it would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/ford-ends-f-150-lightning-production-starts-battery-storage-business/">write down $19.5 billion</a> as a result of its failed EV bet.</p>
<p>GM is not actually abandoning its EV portfolio, even as it reduces shifts at some plants and repurposes others—like the one in Orion, Michigan—into assembling combustion-powered pickups and SUVs instead of EVs. The electric crossovers, SUVs, and pickups from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC will remain on sale, with the rebatteried Chevy Bolt joining their ranks this year.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467858/000146785826000005/gm-20260108.htm">GM says</a> it expects to sell many fewer EVs than once planned. For one thing, the US government abolished the clean vehicle tax credit, which cut the price of an American-made EV by up to $7,500. That government has also told automakers it no longer cares if they sell plenty of inefficient vehicles. Add to that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/car-dealers-renew-their-opposition-to-ev-mandates/">hostility</a> from car dealers by having to sell EVs in the first place, and one can see why GM has decided to retreat, even if we might not sympathize.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/fewer-american-evs-costs-gm-6-billion-even-as-its-chinese-sales-boom/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA officials said Thursday they have decided to bring home four of the seven crew members on the International Space Station after one of them experienced a "medical situation" earlier this week.</p>
<p>The space agency has said little about the incident, and officials have not identified which crew member suffered the medical issue. James "JD" Polk, NASA's chief health and medical officer, told reporters Thursday the crew member is "absolutely stable" but that the agency is "erring on the side of caution" with the decision to return the astronaut to Earth.</p>
<p>The ailing astronaut is part of the Crew-11 mission, which launched to the station August 1 and was slated to come back to Earth around February 20. Instead, the Crew-11 astronauts will depart the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming days and head for reentry and a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/in-a-first-nasa-orders-astronauts-home-after-unspecified-medical-issue/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2002, Bryan Fleming helped to create pcTattletale, software for monitoring phone and computer usage. Fleming's tool would record everything done on the target device, and the videos would be uploaded to a server where they could be viewed by the pcTattletale subscriber.</p>
<p>This might sound creepy, but it can also be legal when used by a parent monitoring their child or an employer monitoring their workers. These are exactly the use cases that were once outlined on pcTattletale's website, where the software was said to have "helped tens of thousands of parents stop their daughters from meeting up with pedophiles." Businesses could "track productivity, theft, lost hours, and more." Even "police departments use it for investigating."</p>
<p>But this week, nearly 25 years after launching pcTattletale, Fleming pled guilty in federal court to having knowingly built and marketed software to spy on other adults without their consent. In other words, pcTattletale was often used to spy on romantic partners without their knowledge—and Fleming helped people do it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/michigan-man-learns-the-hard-way-that-catch-a-cheater-spyware-apps-arent-legal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission plans to authorize a new category of wireless devices in the 6 GHz Wi-Fi band that will be permitted to operate at higher power levels than currently allowed. The FCC will also consider authorizing higher power levels for certain wireless devices that are only allowed to operate indoors.</p>
<p>The FCC said it scheduled a vote for its January 29 meeting on an order "to create a new category of unlicensed devices... that can operate outdoors and at higher power than previously authorized devices." These so-called Geofenced variable power (GVP) devices operating on the 6 GHz band will "support high data rates suitable for AR/VR, short-range hotspots, automation, and indoor navigation," and "overcome limitations of previous device classes by allowing higher power and outdoor mobility," the FCC said. They will be required to work with geofencing systems to avoid interference with fixed microwave links and radio astronomy observatories.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr attributed the FCC's planned action to President Trump in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/president-trump-unleashes-american-innovation-6-ghz-win">press release</a> titled, "President Trump Unleashes American Innovation With 6 GHz Win." That's consistent with Carr's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/fcc-deletes-independent-agency-from-website-as-carr-defends-allegiance-to-trump/">relatively new stance</a> that the FCC takes orders from the president, despite his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/no-one-loves-president-trump-more-than-fcc-chairman-brendan-carr/">insisting during the Biden era</a> that the FCC must operate independently from the White House.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fcc-to-authorize-more-powerful-wireless-devices-in-6-ghz-wi-fi-band/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins unveiled the delayed 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for America Wednesday, which is already drawing criticism for its ties to the meat and dairy industry.</p>
<p>Headlining with the advice to "eat real food," the new <a href="https://cdn.realfood.gov/DGA.pdf">guidelines</a>, which are updated every five years, are in a brisk, citation-free 10-page document. Overall, the new guidelines: lambaste added sugars and highly processed foods (though it doesn't clearly define them); ditch previous limits on alcohol while directing Americans to just drink "less"; beef up recommendations for protein, including red meat; and appear to embrace saturated fats while not actually changing the 2020–2025 recommendation for how much you should eat—which was and continues to be no more than 10 percent of total daily calories.</p>
<p>"We are ending the war on saturated fats," Kennedy said triumphantly in a White House press briefing Wednesday, despite the lack of a change. He went on to proclaim that "today, our government declares war on added sugar," though that too is questionable.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-s-dietary-guidelines-beef-tallow-is-in-but-no-booze-for-breakfast/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When it comes to cognitive ability, not all dogs are created equal. Most dogs can learn simple action cues like “sit” or “down." But so-called “gifted word learner” (GWL) dogs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn the names of objects—for example, learning the names of specific toys so well that they can retrieve them from a large pile of toys on command. And according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq5474">new study</a> published in the journal Science, they can even learn labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. Per the authors, this suggests that GWL dogs have sociocognitive skills that are functionally comparable to those of 18-month-old human toddlers.</p>
<p>Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the <a href="https://ethology.elte.hu/gifteddogs">Genius Dog Challenge</a>. For instance, the group’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-022-01639-z?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_BOOKS_ECOM_PBOK_ALWYS_DEEPLINK_GL&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=5403bdd6926f11f082de00130a82b839" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-022-01639-z?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_BOOKS_ECOM_PBOK_ALWYS_DEEPLINK_GL&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=5403bdd6926f11f082de00130a82b839" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1767820363623hib" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1767820363623hib">2022 study</a> discovered that dogs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/dogs-rely-on-multiple-senses-to-locate-their-favorite-toys-study-finds/">store key sensory features</a> about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels.</p>
<p>In that 2022 study, all the dogs—regardless of whether they were GWL dogs or typical dogs—successfully picked out the target toys in both light and dark conditions, though it took them longer to locate the toys in the dark. Most relied on visual cues, even though dogs possess an excellent sense of smell. However, the dogs sniffed more frequently and longer when searching for the toy in the dark.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/these-dogs-eavesdrop-on-their-owners-to-learn-new-words/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>While the chatbot claimed that xAI supposedly "identified lapses in safeguards" that allowed outputs flagged as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and was "urgently fixing them," Grok has proven to be an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/no-grok-cant-really-apologize-for-posting-non-consensual-sexual-images/">unreliable spokesperson</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/">xAI has not announced any fixes.</a></p>
<p>A quick look at Grok's safety guidelines on its public <a href="https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts/blob/main/grok4_system_turn_prompt_v8.j2">GitHub</a> shows they were last updated two months ago. The GitHub also indicates that, despite prohibiting such content, Grok maintains programming that could make it likely to generate CSAM.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/grok-assumes-users-seeking-images-of-underage-girls-have-good-intent/">Read full article</a></p>
