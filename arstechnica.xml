              <![CDATA[<p>Almost no one ever writes about the Parker Solar Probe anymore.</p>
<p>Sure, the spacecraft got some attention when it launched.  It is, after all, the fastest moving object that humans have ever built. At its maximum speed, goosed by the gravitational pull of the Sun, the probe reaches a velocity of 430,000 miles per hour, or more than one-sixth of 1 percent the speed of light. That kind of speed would get you from New York City to Tokyo in less than a minute.</p>
<p>And the Parker Solar Probe also has the distinction of being the first NASA spacecraft named after a living person. At the time of its launch, in August 2018, physicist Eugene Parker was 91 years old.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/were-about-to-fly-a-spacecraft-into-the-sun-for-the-first-time/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking is Google's take on so-called AI reasoning models.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's been a really busy month for Google as it apparently endeavors to outshine OpenAI with a blitz of AI releases. On Thursday, Google dropped its latest party trick: <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking-mode">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental</a>, which is a new AI model that uses runtime "reasoning" techniques similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-new-200-mo-chatgpt-subscription-will-buy-you-more-compute-time/">OpenAI's o1</a> to achieve "deeper thinking" on problems fed into it.</p>
<p>The experimental model builds on Google's newly released <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> and runs on its AI Studio platform, but early tests <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">conducted</a> by TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers reveal accuracy issues with some basic tasks, such as incorrectly counting that the word "strawberry" contains two R's.</p>
<p>These so-called reasoning models differ from standard AI models by incorporating feedback loops of self-checking mechanisms, similar to techniques we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/hype-grows-over-autonomous-ai-agents-that-loop-gpt-4-outputs/">first saw in early 2023</a> with hobbyist projects like "Baby AGI." The process requires more computing time, often adding extra seconds or minutes to response times. Companies have turned to reasoning models as traditional scaling methods at training time have been showing diminishing returns.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Home Assistant’s voice device is a $60 box that’s both focused and evolving.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Home Assistant announced today the availability of <a href="https://home-assistant.io/voice-pe">the Voice Preview Edition</a>, its own design of a living-room-friendly box to offer voice assistance with home automation. Having used it for a few weeks, it seems like a great start, at least for those comfortable with digging into the settings. That's why Home Assistant is calling it a "Preview Edition."</p>
<p>Using its privacy-minded <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Nabu Casa cloud</a>—or your own capable computer—to handle the processing, the Voice Preview Edition (VPE) ($60/60 euros, available today) has the rough footprint of a modern Apple TV but is thinner. It works similarly to an Amazon Echo, Google Assistant, or Apple Siri device, but with a more focused goal. Start with a wake word—the default, and most well-trained version, is "Okay, Nabu," but "Hey, Jarvis" and "Hey, Mycroft" are available. Follow that with a command, typically something that targets a smart home device: "Turn on living room lights," "Set thermostat to 68," "Activate TV time." And then, that thing usually happens.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BGq0C9vxyU?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div><div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300">
    <div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"></div>
    <div class="caption-content">
      Home Assistant's Voice Preview Edition, doing what it does best. I had to set a weather service to an alias of "the weather outside" to get that response worked out.

<p>"That thing" is primarily controlling devices, scenes, and automations around your home, set up in Home Assistant. That means you have to have assigned them a name or alias that you can remember. Coming up with naming schemes is something you end up doing in big-tech smart home systems, too, but it's a bit more important with the VPE.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/home-assistants-voice-preview-edition-is-a-little-box-with-big-privacy-powers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Another company has publicly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">cut ties with Broadcom's VMware</a>. This time, it's Ingram Micro, one of the world's biggest IT distributors. The announcement comes as Broadcom eyes services as a key part of maintaining VMware business in 2025. But even as some customers are reducing reliance on VMware, its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/broadcom-rallies-forecast-booming-ai-chip-demand-2024-12-13/">trillion-dollar</a> owner is laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
<h2>IT distributor severs VMware ties</h2>
<p>Ingram is reducing its Broadcom-related business to "limited engagement with VMware in select regions," a spokesperson told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/16/ingram_micro_vmware_broadcom_deal_ends/">The Register</a> this week.</p>
<p>"We were unable to reach an agreement with Broadcom that would help our customers deliver the best technology outcomes now and in the future while providing an appropriate shareholder return,” the spokesperson said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/as-firms-abandon-vmware-broadcom-is-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, a large group of university and private industry researchers unveiled <a href="https://genesis-world.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Genesis</a>, a new open source computer simulation system that lets robots practice tasks in simulated reality 430,000 times faster than in the real world. Researchers can also use an AI agent to generate 3D physics simulations from text prompts.</p>
<p>The accelerated simulation means a neural network for piloting robots can spend the virtual equivalent of decades learning to pick up objects, walk, or manipulate tools during just hours of real computer time.</p>
<p>"One hour of compute time gives a robot 10 years of training experience. That's how Neo was able to learn martial arts in a blink of an eye in the Matrix Dojo," <a href="https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1869795912597549137">wrote</a> Genesis paper co-author Jim Fan on X, who says he played a "minor part" in the research.

Even the seemingly most cautious among them have been duped by sophisticated phishing attacks that hack their accounts to push cryptocurrency scams by convincingly appearing to offer legitimate sponsorships from established brands.</p>
<p>These scams often start with bad actors seemingly taking over verified accounts on X (formerly Twitter) with substantial followings and then using them to impersonate marketing managers at real brands who can be easily found on LinkedIn.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When the impossibly punctuated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl</em></a> released on November 20, after many delays (that included <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq843dg4geo">the Russian invasion of the developer's native Ukraine</a>), it seemed like it could have used even more delays.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2</em> had big performance issues and game-breaking bugs, along with balance and difficulty spike issues. Some things that seem "wrong" in the game are just going to stay that way. The first-person survival/shooter series has always had a certain wobbly, wild feel to it. This expresses itself in both the game world, where a major villain can off themselves by walking through a window, and in the tech stack, where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/03/new-stalker-patch-breaks-saved-games/">broken save games</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/04/st-a-l-k-e-r-proves-you-can-have-just-as-much-fun-tweaking-as-you-can-playing/">DIY optimization</a>, and other unmet needs have created <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl">thriving mod scenes</a>.</p>
<p>Developer GSC Game World has been steadfastly patching the game since its release, and the latest one should nudge the needle a bit from "busted" to "charmingly wonky." Amid the "Over 1,800 fixes and adjustments" in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365?l=english">Patch 1.1</a>, the big changes are to "A-Life." In porting <em>Stalker 2</em> to Unreal Engine 5, the developer faced a challenge in getting this global AI management system working, but it's showing its weird self again.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/stalker-2-has-been-enjoyable-jank-but-its-also-getting-rapidly-fixed/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Intel's Core Ultra 200S desktop processors—the company's biggest overhaul of its desktop platform <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/intels-core-ultra-200s-cpus-are-its-biggest-desktop-refresh-in-three-years/">since 2021</a>—consume less power and run a lot cooler than the company's 13th- and 14th-generation Core CPUs. However, early reviewers found that the processors sometimes struggled to match, let alone beat, those older desktop CPUs in some tasks. This was particularly true for games, and people who build their own gaming PCs are a key constituency for these kinds of brand-new high-end chips.</p>
<p>Intel quickly blamed optimization issues for some of the problems, promising performance fixes sometime later in November or December, and the company has outlined the first batch of fixes in <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Field-Update-1-of-2-Intel-Core-Ultra-200S-Series-Performance/post/1650490">a lengthy support document</a>. Of the five identified problems, Intel says it has fixed four; users can get those updates by installing Windows 11 24H2 build 26100.2161 or higher, updating their motherboard's BIOS to the latest version. Non-performance-related blue screens related to Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat software have also been resolved, and users should update to the latest version if they're still having issues.</p>
<p>The performance problems resolved via the Windows update are both related to a missing power plan specific to the Core Ultra processors—Intel didn't have those power plans ready for reviewers, who did all their testing using the generic power profiles provided with Windows. Intel said that this by itself could reduce performance by between 6 and 30 percent, depending on the software.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/intel-patches-performance-for-core-ultra-200s-desktop-cpus-promises-more-to-come/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington, DC, to San Francisco and accommodation so Ars could drive the Q6 and SQ6. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>HEALDSBURG, Calif.—Earlier this summer, Ars got its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-best-audi-ev-so-far-we-drive-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/">first drive</a> of Audi's new Q6 e-tron on some very wet roads in Spain. Then, we were driving pre-production Q6s in Euro-spec. Now, the electric SUV is on sale in the US, with more power in the base model and six months more refinement for its software. But the venue change did not bring a change of weather—heavy rain was the order of the day, making me wonder if Audi is building its new electric vehicle on the site of an ancient rain god's temple?</p>
<p>Of all its rivals, Audi appears to have settled into a nomenclature for its vehicles that at least makes a little sense. Odd numbers are for internal combustion engines, even numbers for EVs, although it also appends "e-tron" on the end to make that entirely clear... and give francophones something to snicker about. (Yes, the e-tron GT does not fit into this schema, but nobody's perfect.)</p>
<p>The Q6 e-tron is also the most advanced EV to wear Audi's four rings. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/audi-debuts-its-next-ev-platform-with-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/">Built on a new architecture called PPE</a> (premium platform electric), at its heart is an 800 V powertrain with a 100 kWh (94.4 kWh useable) lithium-ion battery pack that powers a permanently excited synchronous motor driving the rear wheels, and in the case of the quattro versions, an asynchronous motor. The electric motors have 30 percent less energy consumption than those used in the Q8 e-tron, and are smaller and lighter.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/heres-what-we-learned-driving-audis-new-q6-and-sq6-electric-suvs/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On December 16, Clarivate—a scholarly publication analytics company—removed the journal Chemosphere from its platform, <a href="https://mjl.clarivate.com/home">the Web of Science</a>, which is a key index for academic journals. The indexing platform tracks citations and calculates journal "impact factors," a proxy for relevance in its field.

            <![CDATA[Will Tencent's "open source" HunyuanVideo launch an at-home "Stable Diffusion" moment for uncensored AI video?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The AI-generated video scene has been hopping this year (or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/twirling-body-horror-in-gymnastics-video-exposes-ais-flaws/">twirling wildly</a>, as the case may be). This past week alone we've seen releases or announcements of OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/ten-months-after-first-tease-openai-launches-sora-video-generation-publicly/">Sora</a>, Pika AI's <a href="https://pikartai.com/pika-2-0/">Pika 2</a>, Google's <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-2/">Veo 2</a>, and Minimax's <a href="https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1868763436974588222">video-01-live</a>. It's frankly hard to keep up, and even tougher to test them all. But recently, we put a new open-weights AI video synthesis model, Tencent's <a href="https://aivideo.hunyuan.tencent.com/">HunyuanVideo</a>, to the test—and it's surprisingly capable for being a "free" model.</p>
<p>Unlike the aforementioned models, HunyuanVideo's neural network weights are openly distributed, which means they can be run locally under the right circumstances (people have already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1h7hunp/how_to_run_hunyuanvideo_on_a_single_24gb_vram_card/">demonstrated it</a> on a consumer 24 GB VRAM GPU) and it can be fine-tuned or used with <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/LoRAs-explained">LoRAs</a> to teach it new concepts.</p>
<p>Notably, a few Chinese companies have been at the forefront of AI video for most of this year, and some experts speculate that the reason is less reticence to train on copyrighted materials, use images and names of famous celebrities, and incorporate some uncensored video sources. As we saw with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/ridiculed-stable-diffusion-3-release-excels-at-ai-generated-body-horror/">Stable Diffusion 3</a>'s mangled release, including nudity or pornography in training data may allow these models achieve better results by providing more information about human bodies. HunyuanVideo notably allows uncensored outputs, so unlike the commercial video models out there, it can generate videos of anatomically realistic, nude humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/a-new-uncensored-ai-video-model-may-spark-a-new-ai-hobbyist-movement/">Read full article</a></p>

      David Corenswet stars in James Gunn's <em>Superman</em> reboot.

          </div>

<p>The Internet has been buzzing the last few days about James Gunn's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(2025_film)"><em>Superman</em></a> reboot slated for release next year. The studio released a "motion poster" earlier this week set to a moody cover of John Williams' "Superman March," as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbE8n146umc">a teaser</a> for a teaser for the film. That teaser just dropped.</p>
<p>Clearly, given all the buildup, what director James Gunn wants for Christmas is for everyone to get excited over his <em>Superman</em> movie. And you know what? It kinda worked, especially since Superman's dog Krypto makes an adorably welcome appearance.</p>
<p>Gunn describes his take as less of an origin story and more of a journey, with Superman struggling to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage and aristocratic origins with his small-town, adoptive human family. Gunn tapped David Corenswet to play Clark Kent/Superman, at 25 a bit more established than the young cub reporter of <em>Smallville</em>, for instance. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane, Skyler Gisondo plays Jimmy Olsen, and Nicholas Holt is arch-nemesis Lex Luther. (Holt's son shaved his head for the role.) Luther's sidekicks are played by Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher and Terence Rosemore as Otis.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/krypto-steals-the-show-in-superman-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon workers at seven warehouses walked out Thursday morning, launching a strike ahead of the holidays after Amazon failed to meet a bargaining deadline set by the Teamsters union representing the workers.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://teamster.org/2024/12/teamsters-launch-largest-strike-against-amazon-in-american-history/">press release</a>, Teamsters declared it "the largest strike against Amazon in US history." Teamsters general president, Sean O'Brien, warned shoppers of potential delays, saying "you can blame Amazon’s insatiable greed."</p>
<p>"We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it," O’Brien said. "These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they’ve pushed workers to the limit and now they’re paying the price. This strike is on them."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/amazon-faces-holiday-strike-after-refusing-to-bargain-with-warehouse-workers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When the Sun is blazing and the wind is blowing, Germany’s solar and wind power plants swing into high gear. For nine days in July 2023, renewables produced more than 70 percent of the electricity generated in the country; there are times when wind turbines even need to be turned off to avoid overloading the grid.</p>
<p>But on other days, clouds mute solar energy down to a flicker and wind turbines languish. For nearly a week in January 2023, renewable energy generation fell to less than 30 percent of the nation’s total, and gas-, oil- and coal-powered plants revved up to pick up the slack.</p>
<p>Germans call these periods <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/german-wind-reliant-power-firms-brace-annual-dunkelflaute-2024-02-21/"><em>Dunkelflauten</em></a>, meaning “dark doldrums,” and they can last for a week or longer. They’re a major concern for doldrum-afflicted places like Germany and parts of the United States as nations increasingly push renewable-energy development. <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/technology/2021/the-dazzling-history-solar-power">Solar</a> and wind combined contribute 40 percent of overall energy generation in Germany and 15 percent in the US and, as of December 2024, both countries have goals of becoming 100 percent clean-energy-powered by 2035.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/solving-renewable-energys-sticky-storage-problem/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon announced in September that it will require workers to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/amazon-kills-remote-working-tells-workers-to-be-in-office-5-days-a-week/">in the office five days a week</a> starting in January. Employee backlash ensued, not just because return-to-office (RTO) mandates can be unpopular but also because Amazon is using some of the worst strategies for issuing RTO mandates.</p>
<p>Ahead of the mandate, Amazon had been letting many employees work remotely for two days a week, with a smaller number of workers being totally remote. But despite saying that employees would have to commute five days per week, the conglomerate doesn’t have enough office space to accommodate over 350,000 employees. Personnel in “at least seven cities,” including Phoenix and Austin, Texas, have had their RTO dates delayed until after January, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-18/amazon-delays-return-to-office-mandate-for-thousands-of-workers">Bloomberg</a> reported today, citing “people familiar with the situation." Employees in Dallas won’t have enough space until March or April, and an office in New York City won’t have sufficient space until May, per Bloomberg's sources.</p>
<p>RTO dates are also delayed in Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville, Tennessee, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-delays-full-rto-some-staff-workspace-shortages-2024-12">Business Insider</a> reported this week, citing “internal Amazon notifications.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/amazons-rto-delays-highlight-why-workers-get-so-mad-about-mandates/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An AT&amp;T customer who switched to the company's <a href="https://www.firstnet.com/">FirstNet</a> service for first responders got quite the shock when his bill came in at $6,223.60, instead of the roughly $260 that his four-line plan previously cost each month.</p>
<p>The Texas man described his experience in a now-deleted Reddit post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comments/1hf14qw/622360_wireless_bill/">three days ago</a>, saying he hadn't been able to get the obviously incorrect bill reversed despite calling AT&amp;T and going to an AT&amp;T store in Dallas. The case drew plenty of attention and the bill was finally wiped out several days after the customer contacted the AT&amp;T president's office.</p>
<p>The customer said he received the billing email on December 11. An automatic payment was scheduled for December 15, but he canceled the autopay before the money was charged. The whole mess took a week to straighten out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/2-per-megabyte-att-mistakenly-charged-customer-6223-for-3-1gb-of-data/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The health department had reported the presumptive positive case on Friday and noted the person was hospitalized, as Ars reported. But a spokesperson had, at the time, declined to provide Ars with the patient's condition or further details, citing patient confidentiality and an ongoing public health investigation.</p>
<p>This morning, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it had confirmed the state's H5N1 testing and determined that the case "marks the first instance of severe illness linked to the virus in the United States."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/bird-flu-case-in-louisiana-is-in-critical-condition-health-officials-reveal/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In theory, it ought to be as good a time as ever to be a gamer on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Classic console emulators have rolled out to the platform for the first time, and they work great. There are strong libraries of non-skeezy mobile games on Apple Arcade and Netflix Games, streaming via Xbox and PlayStation services is continuing apace, and there are even a few AAA console games now running natively on the platform, like Assassin's Creed and Resident Evil titles.</p>
