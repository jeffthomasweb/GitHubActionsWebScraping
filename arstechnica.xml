                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/news/stargate-advances-with-oracle-partnership/">announced</a> a partnership with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional data center capacity for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/trump-announces-500b-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-with-agi-aims/">Stargate AI infrastructure platform</a> in the US. The expansion, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/openai-agreed-to-pay-oracle-30b-a-year-for-data-center-services/">TechCrunch reports</a> is part of a $30 billion per year deal between OpenAI and Oracle, will reportedly bring OpenAI's total Stargate capacity under development to over 5 gigawatts.</p>
<p>The data center has taken root in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene,_Texas">Abilene</a>, Texas, a city of 127,000 located 150 miles west of Fort Worth. The city, which serves as the commercial hub of a 19-county region known as the "<a href="https://keanradio.com/why-is-the-abilene-are-called-the-big-country/">Big Country</a>," offers a location with existing tech infrastructure, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyess_Air_Force_Base">Dyess Air Force Base</a> and three universities. Abilene's economy has evolved over time from its agricultural and livestock roots to embrace technology and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>"We have signed a deal for an additional 4.5 gigawatts of capacity with oracle as part of stargate. easy to throw around numbers, but this is a gigantic infrastructure project," <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1947640330318156074">wrote</a> OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on X. "We are planning to significantly expand the ambitions of stargate past the $500 billion commitment we announced in January."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/openai-and-partners-are-building-a-massive-ai-data-center-in-texas/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla posted its financial results for the second quarter of 2025 this afternoon. The numbers show yet another bad three months for the automaker. As competition in the EV marketplace has exploded, Tesla has increasingly been left behind, with a small and aging model lineup, before we even contemplate how CEO Elon Musk has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-is-the-least-trusted-car-brand-in-america-survey-finds/">tarnished</a> what was once the hottest brand in the car world. Earlier this month, we learned that sales dropped by 13 percent year over year in Q2 2025; today, the financials show that automotive revenues fell even more, dropping 16 percent year over year to $16.7 billion.</p>
<p>Tesla’s battery business has been feeling the pain, too. For a while, this was a growth area for the company, albeit one with a relatively minor contribution to the bottom line. During Q2 2025, Tesla’s energy generation and storage division brought in $2.8 billion in revenue, a 7 percent decline from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-q2-2025-sales-dropped-more-than-13-year-over-year/">same period in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Sales of Carbon credits—those government-issued permits that other automakers buy in order to pollute—shrank by more than half, to $490 million. Those other automakers are now selling EVs, at least most of them, and have less need to buy credits from Tesla. It’s likely this subsidy, which has kept the company out of the red in the past, will be even less of a contributor in the coming years as the US <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/feds-let-automakers-off-the-hook-for-fuel-economy-violations/">strips away environmental protections</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-q2-2025-sell-fewer-cars-and-carbon-credits-make-less-money/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Other times, you just call up a company's IT service desk and pretend to be an employee who needs a password reset, an Okta multifactor authentication reset, and a Microsoft multifactor authentication reset... and it's done. Without even verifying your identity.</p>
<p>So you use that information to log in to the target network and discover a more trusted user who works in IT security. You call the IT service desk back, acting like you are now this second person, and you request the same thing: a password reset, an Okta multifactor authentication reset, and a Microsoft multifactor authentication reset. Again, the desk provides it, no identity verification needed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/how-do-hackers-get-passwords-sometimes-they-just-ask/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is following through on recent promises to add more generative AI features to its photo and video products. Over on YouTube, Google is rolling out the first wave of generative AI video for YouTube Shorts, but even if you're not a YouTuber, you'll be exposed to more AI videos soon. Google Photos, which is integrated with virtually every Android phone on the market, is also getting AI video-generation capabilities. In both cases, the features are currently based on the older Veo 2 model, not the more capable Veo 3 that has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/googles-will-smith-double-is-better-at-eating-ai-spaghetti-but-its-crunchy/">meming across the Internet</a> since it was announced at I/O in May.</p>
<p>YouTube CEO Neal Mohan <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/googles-veo-3-ai-videos-will-come-to-youtube-shorts-this-summer/">confirmed earlier this summer</a> that the company planned to add generative AI to the creator tools for YouTube Shorts. There were already tools to generate backgrounds for videos, but the next phase will involve creating new video elements from a text prompt.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-shorts-creation-tools-2025/">Starting today</a>, creators will be able to use a photo as the basis for a new generative AI video. YouTube also promises a collection of easily applied generative effects, which will be accessible from the Shorts camera. There's also a new AI playground hub that the company says will be home to all its AI tools, along with examples and suggested prompts to help people pump out AI content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/07/ai-video-is-invading-youtube-shorts-and-google-photos-starting-today/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nearly 150 employees of the National Science Foundation (NSF) sent an urgent <a href="https://democrats-science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/AFGE_Local_3403_NSF_Letter_to_RM_Lofgren_REDACTED_Redacted.pdf">letter</a> of dissent to Congress on Tuesday, warning that the Trump administration's recent "politically motivated and legally questionable" actions threaten to dismantle the independent "world-renowned scientific agency."</p>
<p>Most NSF employees signed the letter anonymously, with only Jesus Soriano, the president of their local union (AFGE Local 3403), publicly disclosing his name. Addressed to Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, the letter insisted that Congress intervene to stop steep budget cuts, mass firings and grant terminations, withholding of billions in appropriated funds, allegedly coerced resignations, and the sudden eviction of NSF from its headquarters planned for next year.</p>
<p>Perhaps most disturbingly, the letter revealed "a covert and ideologically driven secondary review process by unqualified political appointees" that is now allegedly "interfering with the scientific merit-based review system" that historically has made NSF a leading, trusted science agency. Soriano further warned that "scientists, program officers, and staff" have all "been targeted for doing their jobs with integrity" in what the letter warned was "a broader agenda to dismantle institutional safeguards, impose demagoguery in research funding decisions, and undermine science."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/whistleblower-scientists-outline-trumps-plan-to-politicize-and-dismantle-nsf/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"We are going to try to craft a schedule to have incremental demonstrations every six months because we are on a short timeline," said Gen. Michael Guetlein, who was confirmed by the Senate last week to become the military's Golden Dome czar.</p>
<p>Speaking on Tuesday, his second day on the job leading the Golden Dome initiative, Guetlein said his team will "move out with a sense of urgency and move out with incremental wins" as the military races to meet Trump's timeline.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/what-exactly-is-golden-dome-this-space-force-general-owes-trump-an-answer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple is introducing a fairly major update to its AppleCare extended warranty program today: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-introduces-applecare-one-streamlining-coverage-into-a-single-plan/">AppleCare One</a>, a program meant to cover users with multiple Apple devices who want extended hardware and software support for all of them. The program can cover up to three devices, regardless of what kind of device they are, for $19.99 a month, and additional devices can be added for a flat $5.99 a month.</p>
<p>The new program comes several months after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/applecare-iphone-price-increase/">raised prices for iPhone AppleCare+ subscriptions</a> in the US, adding 50 cents per month to most plans.</p>
<p>Whether AppleCare One will save you money depends on the kind of devices you’re covering. Generally speaking, you’ll at least break even for any plan that includes coverage for an iPhone, but you save more if you’re paying for coverage for high-end gadgets like the iPhone Pro and iPad Pro.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/new-applecare-one-plan-bundles-three-extended-warranties-for-20-a-month/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington, DC, to Santa Barbara, California, and accommodation so Ars could drive the A6 and S6. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>For much of my lifetime, the auto industry has been dominated by the German carmakers. As they battled for supremacy, their engineers came to dictate what we think of as performance and luxury in cars. Now the battleground is a new generation of electric vehicles, and the Germans are playing catch-up. Hyundai stole a march on them as the first established OEM with an 800 V platform that charged faster and drove more efficiently than anything else we’d seen to date, and those cars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better/">continue to accrue plaudits</a>. Soon, BMW will launch its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/heres-bmws-electric-replacement-for-the-x3-production-starts-in-2025/">Neue Klasse platform with the iX3</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2026-mercedes-benz-cla-feels-like-a-real-car-not-a-science-experiment/">our first drive in Mercedes-Benz’s new CLA</a> was promising. But Audi was the first of the German companies to ready its own purpose-built 800 V EV platform, and it has followed up the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-best-audi-ev-so-far-we-drive-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/">Q6 e-tron SUV</a> with today’s pair of electric fastback sedans, the A6 Sportback e-tron and its hotted-up variant, the S6 Sportback e-tron.</p>
<p>Yes, technically, Audi had an 800 V EV a while ago, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/the-2022-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-shows-badge-engineering-is-nothing-to-fear/">rebadged version</a> of the mighty <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/the-porsche-taycan-every-bit-as-good-as-a-200000-porsche-should-be/">Porsche Taycan</a>. That car still exists and now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-more-range-more-power-still-drives-like-an-audi/">goes <em>extremely quickly</em></a>, but the A6’s architecture—called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/audi-debuts-its-next-ev-platform-with-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/">Premium Platform Electric, or PPE</a>—takes lessons from the Taycan and combines them with the latest in software-defined vehicles, where a handful of powerful computers replace hundreds of individual discrete controllers around the car. It all comes wrapped up in a highly aero-efficient shape that still manages to light up the relevant bit of a car-spotter’s brain that identifies Audis.</p>
<h2>A6 or S6?</h2>
<p>In Europe, there’s the option of a proper station wagon version, or Avant in Audi-speak; we might see that body variant for an RS6 Avant e-tron in the future, but for now, it’s just the A6 and S6 Sportbacks. Both variants use the same 100 kWh (94.4 kWh useable) battery pack, made up of prismatic cells. The A6 can be had in rear- or all-wheel drive; the former makes do with a 375 hp (280 kW) drive unit, the latter with a combined 456 hp (340 kW) thanks to an asynchronous motor on the front axle that complements the rear’s permanent magnet synchronous motor. Actually, both those power outputs are for peak power, should you engage launch control. Nominal power output is a little lower, at 362 hp (270 kW) and 422 hp (315 kW), respectively.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/audis-midsize-sedan-goes-electric-the-2025-a6-and-s6-sportback-driven/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We live in the era of the electric car—lightning that can't be put back in its bottle. This is important to keep in mind when we talk about new cars like the Aston Martin Vanquish Volante, because on paper, it seems hard to justify its half-million-dollar price tag and 800-plus horsepower twin-turbo V12 when things like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/rivians-new-quad-motor-r1t-and-r1s-beat-the-competition-in-any-conditions/">Rivian's Quad-motor R1</a> vehicles and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/lucid-is-making-a-triple-motor-air-to-rival-teslas-model-s-plaid/">Lucid's Air</a> can top its numbers for half the price. I say this not to suck the air out of the room but to put things in perspective, as this was on my mind when I slid into the driver's seat of Aston's latest ultra-luxury option.</p>
<p>What I was quickly reminded of, however, is that this is decadence, which, by its nature, does not need to be justified. Nobody needs an Aston Martin; you want one. You don't simply drive it, either; you indulge in it.</p>
<h2>Layer cake</h2>
<p>Aston Martin's current state of affairs is a strong one. Thanks to the efforts of Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll course-correcting the wayward ship of Aston Martin Lagonda—nobody remembers the Lagonda part, <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/concept/concepts-time-forgot-aston-martin-lagonda-vignale">not even AML</a>—the brand's portfolio contains four core vehicles, with several derivatives like the Vantage S on their way. This also includes the Volante, or convertible versions, such as this one, which is the fastest and most powerful mainline Aston Martin convertible ever made.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-aston-martin-vanquish-volante-a-ms-ultimate-gt-goes-topless/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A popular account on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sylvaniandrama">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sylvaniandrama">Instagram</a> stopped posting suddenly at the end of last year, hit by a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Epoch-Company-Ltd-v-Von-Engelbrechten-Complaint-4-7-25.pdf">lawsuit</a> after garnering millions of views on funny videos it made using adorable children's Calico Critter dolls to act out dark, cringe-y adult storylines.</p>
<p>While millions of followers mourn the so-called "Sylvanian Drama" account's demise, experts told Ars that the creator may have a decent chance at beating the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The "Sylvanian Drama" account derived its name from "Sylvanian Families," a brand name used by Epoch Company Ltd., the maker of Calico Critters, for its iconic fuzzy animal dolls in some markets outside the US. Despite these videos referencing murder, drugs, and hookups, the toy company apparently had no problem, until the account, managed by Ireland-based Thea Von Engelbrechten, started accepting big brand partnerships and making sponsored content featuring the dolls.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/tiktok-parody-account-sylvanian-drama-may-survive-sponsored-content-lawsuit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In May 2020, Sacramento, California, resident Alfonso Nguyen was alarmed to find two Sacramento County Sheriff’s deputies at his door, accusing him of illegally growing cannabis and demanding entry into his home. When Nguyen refused the search and denied the allegation, one deputy allegedly called him a liar and threatened to arrest him.</p>
<p>That same year, deputies from the same department, with their guns drawn and bullhorns and sirens sounding, fanned out around the home of Brian Decker, another Sacramento resident. The officers forced Decker to walk backward out of his home in only his underwear around 7 am while his neighbors watched. The deputies said that he, too, was under suspicion of illegally growing cannabis.</p>
<h2>Invasion of the privacy snatchers</h2>
<p>According to a motion the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed in Sacramento Superior Court last week, Nguyen and Decker are only two of more than 33,000 Sacramento-area people who have been flagged to the sheriff’s department by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the electricity provider for the region. SMUD called the customers out for using what it and department investigators said were suspiciously high amounts of electricity indicative of illegal cannabis farming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/eff-moves-to-stop-power-utility-reporting-suspected-pot-growers-to-cops/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple has released the fourth developer betas of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and its other next-generation software updates today. And along with their other changes and fixes, the new builds are bringing back Apple Intelligence notification summaries for news apps.</p>
<p>Apple disabled news notification summaries as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/01/ios-18-3-beta-disables-news-notification-summaries-after-high-stakes-errors/">the iOS 18.3 update in January</a>. Incorrect summaries circulating on social media prompted news organizations <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno">to complain to Apple</a>, particularly after one summary said that Luigi Mangione, alleged murderer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died by suicide (he had not and has not).</p>
<p>Upon installing the new update, users of Apple Intelligence-compatible devices will be asked to enable or disable three broad categories of notifications: those for "News &amp; Entertainment" apps, for "Communication &amp; Social" apps, and for all other apps. The operating systems will list sample apps based on what you currently have installed on your device.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/07/apple-intelligence-news-summaries-are-back-with-a-big-red-disclaimer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Belief in conspiracy theories is often attributed to some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning">motivated reasoning</a>: People want to believe a conspiracy because it reinforces their worldview, for example, or doing so meets some deep psychological need, like wanting to feel unique. However, it might also be driven by overconfidence in their own cognitive abilities, according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672251338358">a paper</a> published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. The authors were surprised to discover that not only are conspiracy theorists overconfident, they also don't realize their beliefs are on the fringe, massively overestimating by as much as a factor of four how much other people agree with them.</p>
<p>"I was expecting the overconfidence finding," co-author <a href="https://psychology.cornell.edu/gordon-pennycook">Gordon Pennycook</a>, a psychologist at Cornell University, told Ars. "If you've talked to someone who believes conspiracies, it's self-evident. I did not expect them to be so ready to state that people agree with them. I thought that they would overestimate, but I didn't think that there'd be such a strong sense that they are in the majority. It might be one of the biggest false consensus effects that's been observed."</p>
<p>In 2015, Pennycook made headlines when he <a href="http://littlesvr.ca/grumble/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bullshit-detection.pdf">co-authored a paper</a> demonstrating how certain people interpret "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/abstract-art-with-pseudo-profound-bs-titles-seen-as-more-meaningful/">pseudo-profound bullshit</a>" as deep observations. Pennycook <em>et al</em>. were interested in identifying individual differences between those who are susceptible to pseudo-profound BS and those who are not and thus looked at conspiracy beliefs, their degree of analytical thinking, religious beliefs, and so forth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/conspiracy-theorists-think-their-views-are-mainstream/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Everybody aboard the Research Vessel <em>Garvin</em> had come to Miami for the sharks—to catch them, sample them, and tag them, all in the name of science. People who once wanted to be marine biologists, actual marine biologists, shark enthusiasts, the man who literally wrote the book <a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12267/why-sharks-matter?srsltid=AfmBOor5KWozpDxG9zPVTJO07QfbKTXpz1sy1DNj845zkbuc3Iddx1yR"><em>Why Sharks Matter</em></a>, and various friends and family had spent much of the day sending fish heads set with hooks over the side of the <em>Garvin</em>. But each time the line was hauled back in, it came in slack, with nothing but half-eaten bait or an empty hook at the end.</p>

<p>Assemblymember Tasha Boerner <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/california-bill-would-force-isps-to-offer-100mbps-plans-for-15-a-month/">proposed the state law</a> a few months ago, modeling the bill on a law enforced by New York. It seemed that other states were free to impose cheap-broadband mandates because the Supreme Court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/isps-lose-yet-another-attempt-to-kill-new-yorks-15-broadband-mandate/">rejected</a> broadband industry challenges to the New York law twice.</p>
<p>Boerner, a Democrat who is chair of the Communications and Conveyance Committee, faced pressure from Internet service providers to change or drop the bill. She made some changes, for example lowering the $15 plan's required download speeds from 100Mbps to 50Mbps and the required upload speeds from 20Mbps to 10Mbps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/california-backs-down-to-trump-admin-wont-force-isps-to-offer-15-broadband/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's search results have undergone a seismic shift over the past year as AI fever has continued to escalate among the tech giants. Nowhere is this change more apparent than right at the top of Google's storied results page, which is now home to AI Overviews. Google contends these Gemini-based answers don't take traffic away from websites, but a new analysis from the Pew Research Center says otherwise. Its analysis shows that searches with AI summaries reduce clicks, and their prevalence is increasing.</p>
<p>Google began testing AI Overviews as the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-search-will-start-automatically-showing-a-chatbot-to-some-users/">search generative experience</a>" in May 2023, and just a year later, they were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">an official part of the search engine results page</a> (SERP). Many sites (including this one) have noticed changes to their traffic in the wake of this move, but Google has brushed off concerns about how this could affect the sites from which it collects all that data.</p>
<p>SEO experts have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/">disagreed with Google's stance</a> on how AI affects web traffic, and the newly released Pew study backs them up.
