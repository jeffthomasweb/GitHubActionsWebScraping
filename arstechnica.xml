              <![CDATA[<p>Unlike workers at many other federal agencies this week, probationary employees at NASA were not terminated on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For much of the day employees at the space agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/by-the-end-of-today-nasas-workforce-will-be-about-10-percent-smaller/">anticipated a directive</a> from the White House Office of Personnel Management to fire these employees, but it never came. "We were on pins and needles throughout the day," said one senior official at Johnson Space Center in Houston on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>However, by late in the afternoon, several field center directors received confirmation from the White House that their probationary employees—of which there are more than 1,000 across the agency's headquarters and 10 field centers—would not be terminated. NASA had sought exemptions for all of these employees, who comprise about 6 percent of NASA's workforce. Ars could not confirm whether the reprieve applied to some field centers or all 10 of them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-receives-11th-hour-reprieve-from-probationary-employee-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Most PC games that you can play on a modern PC would run faster on an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/">Nvidia RTX 5080 or 5090</a> than, say, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/nvidia-gtx-1070-ti-review/">GTX 1070</a>. But some games, from a particular phase of enthusiasm for particles, destructible environments, and smooth-moving hair, will take a notable hit if their owners upgrade to the latest Nvidia cards.</p>
<p>That's because <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk">PhysX</a>, once a dedicated physics simulation tool and card that became a selling point for Nvidia's gear, has been largely deprecated on Nvidia 50-series cards. The transition was announced in January, but it seems to have taken some time for someone to notice the impact on 32-bit, PhysX-enabled games (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/geforce-rtx-50-series-cards-physx-support">as seen by PCGamesN</a>). The most recent of these affected games, <em>Assassin's Creek IV: Black Flag,</em> came out in 2013.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief primer on PhysX: what it was, what it did, and why it's left out of Nvidia's road map.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/batman-arkham-games-among-those-losing-physx-powers-on-newer-nvidia-gpus/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[xAI shows off new chatbot that calls legacy media outlets "garbage."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Elon Musk's AI company, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/musk-announces-new-ai-company-that-seeks-to-understand-the-universe/">xAI</a>, released Grok 3, a new AI model family set to power chatbot features on the social network X. This latest release adds image analysis and simulated reasoning capabilities to the platform's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/elon-musks-xai-releases-grok-source-and-weights-taunting-openai/">existing text-</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/musks-new-grok-upgrade-allows-x-users-to-create-largely-uncensored-ai-images/">image-generation tools</a>.</p>
<p>Grok 3's release comes after the model went through months of training in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/elon-musk-claims-he-is-training-the-worlds-most-powerful-ai-by-every-metric/">xAI's Memphis data center</a> containing a reported 200,000 GPUs. During a livestream presentation on Monday, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875357350393246114">echoed previous social media posts</a> describing Grok 3 as using 10 times more computing power than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/musks-new-grok-upgrade-allows-x-users-to-create-largely-uncensored-ai-images/">Grok 2</a>.</p>
<p>Since news of Grok 3's imminent arrival <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/elon-musk-says-grok-3-final-stages-outperforming-all-chatbots-2025-02-13/">emerged</a> last week, Musk has wasted no time <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891112681538523215">showing</a> how he may intend to use Grok as a tool to represent his worldview in AI form. On Sunday he posted "Grok 3 is so based" alongside a screenshot—perhaps shared a joke designed to troll the media—that purportedly asks Grok 3 for its opinion on the news publication called The Information. In response, Grok replies:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/new-grok-3-release-tops-llm-leaderboards-despite-musk-approved-based-opinions/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>If you know just one thing about FromSoft's recent history of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soulslikes/">so-called "Soulslike" games,</a> you probably know that they have a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/dark-souls-3-review-marching-towards-masochism/">well-earned</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/learning-how-to-die-in-dark-souls-ii/">reputation</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">absolutely brutal difficulty</a>. But these titles apparently just weren't difficult enough for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dinossindgeil">streamer dinossindgeil</a> (aka <a href="https://x.com/dinossindgeil">Nico</a>) who spent the weekend beating seven of FromSoft's most punishing titles without taking a single hit or leveling up even once.</p>
<p>Nico's conquest of what he calls "The God Run 3" <a href="https://x.com/dinossindgeil/status/1592208311344037888">dates back to 2022</a>, when he took down all three Dark Souls games as well as <em>Demon's Souls</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> live on his Twitch stream without sustaining any damage from enemies. Back then, though, Nico relied at least a little bit on grinding leveled-up characters and high-end gear to make the game's most difficult bosses a bit more manageable. Even with that advantage, though, a successful God Run 3 completion took Nico 120 days of real-time effort due to frequent restarts whenever he took a single hit.</p>
<p>This time around, Nico cranked up the difficulty even further by deciding not to level his characters even once (though he was able to increase his stats and abilities in some games with level 1-accessible items and weapons). After <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2331460758">his first level 1 God Run attempt two months ago</a>, Nico's efforts culminated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ripk0RYwEgo">roughly 11-hour</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whMssrH1uX4">multi-day marathon run</a> over the weekend, which saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgMBmsNiUJY">Nico break down in tears</a> at the end of the ordeal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-god-run-dark-souls-player-beats-seven-games-at-level-1-without-taking-a-hit/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>PC-manufacturer Acer has said that it plans to raise the prices of its PCs in the US by 10 percent, a direct response to the new 10 percent import tariff on Chinese goods that the Trump administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/tariffs-on-biggest-us-trading-partners-likely-to-spike-cost-of-cars-tech/">announced earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>"We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff," said Acer CEO Jason Chen in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/16/computer-giant-to-raise-prices-by-10pc-in-response-to-trump/">an interview with The Telegraph</a>. "We think 10 percent probably will be the default price increase because of the import tax. It’s very straightforward."</p>
<p>These price increases won't roll out right away, according to Chen—products shipped from China before the tariffs went into effect earlier this month won't be subject to the increased import taxes—but we can expect them to show up in PC price tags over the next few weeks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/acer-ceo-says-its-pc-prices-to-increase-by-10-percent-in-response-to-trump-tariffs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft said it has detected a new variant of XCSSET, a powerful macOS malware family that has targeted developers and users since at least 2020.</p>
<p>The variant, which Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1891410993265123662">reported Monday</a>, marked the first publicly known update to the malware since 2022. The malware first came to light in 2020, when security firm Trend Micro <a href="https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/XCSSET_Technical_Brief.pdf">said</a> it had targeted app developers after spreading through a publicly available project the attacker wrote for Xcode, a developer tool Apple makes freely available. The malware gained immediate attention because it exploited what, at the time, were two zero-day vulnerabilities, a testament to the resourcefulness of the entity behind the attacks.</p>
<p>In 2021, XCSSET surfaced again, first when it was used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/attackers-are-trying-awfully-hard-to-backdoor-ios-developers-macs/">backdoor developers’ devices</a> and a few months later when researchers found it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/hackers-exploit-a-macos-0day-that-allows-them-to-screenshot-infected-macs/">exploiting</a> what at the time was a new zero-day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/microsoft-warns-that-the-powerful-xcsset-macos-malware-is-back-with-new-tricks/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Astronomers have detected over 5,800 confirmed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet">exoplanets</a>. One extreme class is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter">ultra-hot Jupiters</a>, of particular interest because they can provide a unique window into planetary atmospheric dynamics. According to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08664-1">a new paper</a> published in the journal Nature, astronomers have mapped the 3D structure of the layered atmosphere of one such ultra-hot Jupiter-size exoplanet, revealing powerful winds that create intricate weather patterns across that atmosphere. A <a href="https://exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Prinoth-et-al.-2025-WASP-121b.pdf">companion paper</a> published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics reported on the unexpected identification of titanium in the exoplanet's atmosphere as well.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/tess-mission-finds-nearby-3-planet-system-thats-a-perfect-planet-lab/">previously reported</a>, thanks to the massive trove of exoplanets discovered by the Kepler mission, we now have a good idea of what kinds of planets are out there, where they orbit, and how common the different types are. What we lack is a good sense of what that implies in terms of the conditions on the planets themselves. Kepler can tell us how big a planet is, but it doesn't know what the planet is made of. And planets in the "habitable zone" around stars could be consistent with anything from a blazing hell to a frozen rock.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/04/nasas-new-planet-finder-is-in-space-now-what/">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a> (TESS), Kepler identifies planets using the transit method. This works for systems in which the planets orbit in a plane that takes them between their host star and Earth. As this occurs, the planet blocks a small fraction of the starlight that we see from Earth (or nearby orbits). If these dips in light occur with regularity, they're diagnostic of something orbiting the star.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/3d-map-of-exoplanet-atmosphere-shows-wacky-climate/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is considering granting new voting rights to its nonprofit board in a move that could help it fight an unsolicited takeover bid from Elon Musk, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5af7279f-5996-46f8-a7b9-f35d966880a0">Financial Times reported last night</a>. Citing people familiar with the discussions, the FT wrote that CEO "Sam Altman and other board members are weighing a range of new governance mechanisms after OpenAI converts into a more conventional for-profit company."</p>
<p>"Giving the nonprofit's board outsized voting power would ensure it retain[s] control of the restructured company and [is] able to over-rule other investors including existing backers such as Microsoft and SoftBank," the FT wrote. "While no firm decisions have been made, special voting rights would also ensure OpenAI can fight off hostile bids from outsiders such as Musk."</p>
<p>We contacted OpenAI about the report and will update this article if it provides any comment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/openai-board-considers-special-voting-powers-to-prevent-elon-musk-takeover/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Spread across NASA's headquarters and 10 field centers, which dot the United States from sea to sea, the space agency has had a workforce of nearly <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/organization/#:~:text=The%20agency's%20organization%20comprises%20a,for%20the%20benefit%20of%20humanity.">18,000 civil servants</a>.</p>
<p>However, by the end of today, that number will have shrunk by about 10 percent since the beginning of the second Trump administration four weeks ago. And the world's preeminent space agency may still face significant additional cuts.</p>
<p>According to sources, about 750 employees at NASA accepted the "fork in the road" offer to take deferred resignation from the space agency later this year. This sounds like a lot of people, but generally about 1,000 people leave the agency every year, so effectively, many of these people might just be getting paid to leave jobs they were already planning to exit from.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/by-the-end-of-today-nasas-workforce-will-be-about-10-percent-smaller/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Public trust in science has shown a certain resiliency, but it is being tested like never before.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Public trust in science has been in the spotlight in recent years: After the US presidential election in November, one Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/kennedy-trump-vaccines-covid-skeptics-cfdef1bd">headline</a> declared that "Science Lost America’s Trust.” Another publication called 2024 “<a href="https://theweek.com/science/distrust-science-politics-2024-public-trust-vaccines-milk-pandemic">the year of distrust in science</a>.”</p>
<p>Some of that may be due to legitimate concerns: Public health officials have been <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/43/2/e307/6130872">criticized</a> for their lack of transparency during critical moments, including the COVID-19 pandemic. And experts have noted the influence of political factors. For instance, the first Trump administration repeatedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html">undermined</a> scientists—a trend repeating in his <a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/jules-barbati-dajches/how-science-has-fared-in-the-first-two-weeks-of-trump-2-0/">second term</a> so far.</p>
<p>But what does the research say about where public trust in science, doctors, and health care institutions actually stands? In recent years, researchers have been increasingly looking into quantifying these sentiments. And indeed, <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/major-declines-in-the-publics-confidence-in-science-in-the-wake-of-the-pandemic/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/15/americans-trust-in-scientists-other-groups-declines/">surveys</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2319488121">studies</a> have reported the COVID-19 pandemic correlated with a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821693">decline</a> in trust in the years following the initial outbreak. This decrease, though, seems to be waning as new research shows a clearer picture of trust across time. One 2024 study suggests Trump’s attacks on science during his first term did not have the significant impact many experts feared—and may have even <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/survey-suggests-trump-s-attacks-boosted-public-trust-science">boosted</a> confidence among certain segments of the population.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/can-public-trust-in-science-survive-a-second-battering/">Read full article</a></p>

<p class="p1">I really like <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/">Asus’ ROG Flow Z13</a> for what it is: a convertible tablet with way more gaming power than you would think. Looking at this thing, you might expect to see it propped up at an airport bar, in front of somebody talking into wireless headphones about Tim in Product. But there’s a lot of frame-rendering and multicore processing power inside this glass-fronted slab with a keyboard cover. It's an impressive showcase for AMD's leap forward in integrated power.</p>
<p class="p1">The Z13 can rip through <i>Hitman</i> and <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i> on their highest settings at its native 2560×1600 resolution. Turn the resolution down to a reasonable-for-this-size 1920×1080 and you can play <i>Cyberpunk 2077 </i>at its Ultra settings at 45–55 frames per second, depending on your power and upscaling preferences. On a device that is essentially a beefy Microsoft Surface, this is no small thing. The <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html">AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395</a> "Strix Halo" inside the Z13, with the latest Ryzen 8060S GPU built into it, is not just capable—it's a step up from most of the gaming laptops out there.</p>

<p class="p1">As a Windows convertible, it has some interesting tech and notable upgrades from the 2022 product that was also called the ROG Flow Z13. Its webcam works with Windows Hello and logs you in 95 percent of the time. The keyboard has decent travel, the trackpad has a pleasant smoothness, and you can prop the thing up anywhere along the solid kickstand’s 170-degree range. It’s a Copilot+ PC if that matters to you, and when you’re not pushing ray-traced gaming frames, its battery life is no slouch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/review-asus-rog-flow-z13-tablet-takes-the-asterisk-off-integrated-gpus/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If humanity is ever to spread out into the Solar System, we're going to need to find a way to put fuel into rockets somewhere other than the cozy confines of a launchpad on Earth. One option for that is in low-Earth orbit, which has the advantage of being located very close to said launch pads. But it has the considerable disadvantage of requiring a lot of energy to escape Earth's gravity—it takes a lot of fuel to put substantially less fuel into orbit.</p>
<p>One alternative is to produce fuel on the Moon. We know there is hydrogen and oxygen present, and the Moon's gravity is far easier to overcome, meaning more of what we produce there can be used to send things deeper into the Solar System. But there is a tradeoff: Any fuel-production infrastructure will likely need to be built on Earth and sent to the Moon.</p>
<p>How much infrastructure is that going to involve? A study released today by PNAS evaluates the energy costs of producing oxygen on the Moon and finds that they're substantial: about 24 kWh per kilogram. This doesn't sound bad until you start considering how many kilograms we're going to eventually need.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/turning-the-moon-into-a-fuel-depot-will-take-a-lot-of-power/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Remember the Lumia 1020? It's back—in iPhone SE form.</p>
<p>The Lumia 1020 was a lot of smartphone in July 2013. It debuted with a focus "almost entirely on the phone's massive camera," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/07/in-the-dark-and-on-the-move-with-the-nokia-lumia-1020s-camera/">Ars wrote at the time</a>. That big 41-megapixel sensor jutted forth from the phone body, and Nokia reps showed off its low-light, rapid-motion camera abilities by shooting pictures of breakdancers in a dark demonstration room. The company also offered an optional camera grip—one that made it feel a lot more like a point-and-shoot camera. In a more robust review, Ars suggested <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/the-nokia-lumia-1020-the-smartphone-to-render-point-and-shoots-obsolete/">the Lumia 1020 might actually make the point-and-shoot obsolete</a>.</p>

<p>The Lumia 1020 contained yet another cutting edge concept of the day: Windows Phone, Microsoft's color-coded, square-shaped companion to its mobile-forward Windows 8. The mobile OS never got over the users/apps, chicken/egg conundrum, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/windows-phone-is-now-officially-dead-a-sad-tale-of-what-might-have-been/">called it quits in October 2017</a>. The end of that distant-third-place mobile OS would normally signal the end of the Lumia 1020 as a usable phone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/windows-lumiphone-modder-elegantly-fits-2022-iphone-into-2013-nokia-body/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In a media briefing held Monday, the South Korean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Information_Protection_Commission_(South_Korea)">Personal Information Protection Commission</a> indicated that it had paused new downloads within the country of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's mobile app. The restriction took effect on Saturday and doesn't affect South Korean users who already have the app installed on their devices. The DeepSeek service also remains accessible in South Korea via the web.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/south-koreas-data-protection-authority-suspends-local-service-deepseek-2025-02-17/">Reuters</a>, PIPC explained that representatives from DeepSeek acknowledged the company had "partially neglected" some of its obligations under South Korea's data protection laws, which provide South Koreans some of the <a href="https://cookie-script.com/privacy-laws/south-korean-data-privacy-law">strictest privacy protections</a> globally.</p>
<p>PIPC investigation division director Nam Seok is quoted by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-deepseek-app-downloads-privacy-concerns-ai-20950f357276b9bb8f2a70a4b3c03e96">Associated Press</a> as saying DeepSeek "lacked transparency about third-party data transfers and potentially collected excessive personal information." DeepSeek reportedly has dispatched a representative to South Korea to work through any issues and bring the app into compliance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/south-korea-pauses-deepseek-app-downloads-over-privacy-concerns/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump’s freeze on federal funding shows little sign of thawing for climate, energy and environmental justice programs.</p>
<p>Despite two federal court orders directing the administration to resume distributing federal grants and loans, at least $19 billion in Environmental Protection Agency funding to thousands of state and local governments and nonprofits remained on hold as of Feb. 14, said environmental and legal advocates who are tracking the issue.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, is seemingly blocking links to Signal, the encrypted messaging platform, according to journalist Matt Binder and other firsthand accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.disruptionist.com/p/elon-musks-x-blocks-links-to-signal">Binder wrote in his Disruptionist newsletter Sunday</a> that links to <a href="https://signal.me">Signal.me</a>, a domain that offers a way to connect directly to Signal users, are blocked on public posts, direct messages, and profile pages. Error messages—including "Message not sent," "Something went wrong," and profiles tagged as "considered malware" or "potentially harmful"—give no direct suggestion of a block. But posts on X, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613997/x-blocks-signal-me-links-errors">reporting at The Verge</a>, and other sources suggest that Signal.me links are broadly banned.</p>
<p>Signal.me links that were already posted on X prior to the recent change now show a "Warning: this link may be unsafe" interstitial page rather than opening the link directly. Links to Signal handles and <a href="https://signal.org/">the Signal homepage</a> are still functioning on X.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/x-is-reportedly-blocking-links-to-secure-signal-contact-pages/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The likely next leader of NASA, private astronaut and pilot Jared Isaacman, has kept a low profile since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/jared-isaacman-entrepreneur-and-private-astronaut-is-trumps-choice-to-lead-nasa/">announcement last year</a> that he was President Donald Trump's choice to lead the space agency.</p>
<p>This is understandable, as Isaacman must still be confirmed by the US Senate. No date has yet been put forward for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Typically, during this interim period, nominees meet with Senators behind closed doors before their hearings and limit public comments that could put them in the hot seat during the confirmation process.</p>
<p>This has meant that we've heard little from the person who is in line to lead NASA over the next four years as the space agency confronts a number of issues. These include reconfiguring the Artemis Program, a potential pivot toward Mars, an aging International Space Station, Mars Sample Return, a limited pipeline of science missions, and the likelihood of budget cuts. On top of all of this there is the uncertainty and unease federal workers face as the Trump Administration scrutinizes their activities for efficiency and, in some cases, loyalty.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-nominee-previews-his-vision-for-the-agency-mars-hard-work-inspiration/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like it or not, generative AI is carving out its place in the world. And some Reddit users are definitely in the “don't like it" category. While some subreddits openly welcome AI-generated images, videos, and text, others have responded to the growing trend by banning most or all posts made with the technology.</p>
<p>To better understand the reasoning and obstacles associated with these bans, Ars Technica spoke with moderators of subreddits that totally or partially ban generative AI. Almost all these volunteers described moderating against generative AI as a time-consuming challenge they expect to get more difficult as time goes on. And most are hoping that Reddit will release a tool to help their efforts.</p>
<p>It's hard to know how much AI-generated content is actually on Reddit, and getting an estimate would be a large undertaking. Image library Freepik has <a href="https://www.freepik.com/ai-content-on-the-web">analyzed</a> the use of AI-generated content on social media but leaves Reddit out of its research because “it would take loads of time to manually comb through thousands of threads within the platform,” spokesperson Bella Valentini told me. For its part, Reddit doesn't publicly disclose how many Reddit posts involve generative AI use.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/reddit-mods-are-fighting-to-keep-ai-slop-off-subreddits-they-could-use-help/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[As NASA astronauts aim for landings in 2027, geologists find surprises in recently retrieved samples from the far side]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p class="article-byline">In the summer of 2024, a robotic mission landed for the first time on the far side of the Moon. The Chinese Chang’e-6 lander planted a flag, dug up more than four pounds of rock and soil, and brought it back home—an accomplishment widely lauded as a technological tour de force.</p>
<div class="article-content">
<div class="article-text -drop-cap">
<p>That mission, and the 2020 Chang’e-5 robotic mission before it, are the first to return lunar rocks to Earth since the 1970s. Together they are building on what scientists learned from Apollo-era missions, helping to unravel mysteries about how the Moon was formed and why it looks the way it does today, and providing clues about our solar system’s history.</p>
<p>But big puzzles remain, such as why the far side of the Moon—the half that always faces away from Earth—is so radically different from the near side. And what is behind the surprising finding that lunar volcanoes may have been active much more recently than previously thought? “The more we look at the Moon, the more we’ve discovered—and the more we realize how little we know,” says Clive R. Neal, a geologist at the University of Notre Dame who specializes in lunar exploration.</p>

<p>With NASA planning to send astronauts back to the Moon’s surface in 2027 for the first time since 1972, geologists are excited about what rocks they might find there and the scientific secrets those samples could reveal—along with what resources could be mined for a future Moon base, or for renewable energy back home on Earth.</p>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p>The samples brought home from the Moon in the 1970s by the Apollo missions and the Soviet Union’s Luna missions cleared up quite a lot about the <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/physical-world/2019/how-moon-landings-changed-our-view-solar-system">Moon’s history</a>. Because the lunar samples shared strong similarities with Earth rocks, this added weight to the idea that the Moon was formed when a Mars-sized object called Theia collided with the proto-Earth roughly <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-031621-060538">4.5 billion years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Debris from the impact was thrown into orbit around Earth and eventually coalesced into the Moon. In its early days, the Moon was entirely molten. As the magma ocean cooled over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon formed a crust and a mantle below. Giant pools of lava filled impact craters and settled into the lunar lowlands, or maria (Latin for “seas”), while highlands and volcanic domes loomed above them. Eventually, the volcanism died out.</p>
<p>Without plate tectonics or weather, the only things left to alter the Moon’s cold, dead surface were meteorites. A lot of the Apollo-era samples were found to have formed from the heat and pressure of impacts around 3.9 billion years ago, suggesting that they were the result of a short period of intense pummeling by space rocks called the Late Heavy Bombardment.</p>
<p>But research since the 1970s has refined or changed this picture. Higher-resolution orbital images have revealed plenty of large impact craters that seem far older than 3.9 billion years, for example. And meteorites found on Earth, thought to have been ejected from various areas of the Moon during big impacts, have been found to span a huge range of ages.</p>
<p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5602003/">All this work together suggests</a> that the asteroid bombardment didn’t happen in one dramatic spike but rather over an extended period lasting from perhaps 4.2 billion to 3.4 billion years ago. In this scenario, the Apollo samples dated to 3.9 billion years likely all came from just one huge impact that spewed rock over a very wide area that happened to include the Apollo-era landing sites.</p>
<h2>The Moon: Dead or alive</h2>
<p>Greater mysteries surround volcanism on the Moon. “The canonical thing I learned in school was that the Moon had been geologically dead for billions of years,” says Samuel Lawrence, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p>The long-held theory was that a small body like the Moon should have lost its heat to space relatively quickly—and a frigid, extinguished Moon shouldn’t have widespread volcanic activity. Apollo-era samples suggested that most of this volcanism stopped 3 billion years ago or earlier, supporting the theory. But research over the past two decades has overturned that view.</p>

<p>In 2014, Lawrence and colleagues posited that some patches of irregular terrain in the middle of the dark plains, or mare, spotted by the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter were the result of volcanism that kept going until <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2252">less than 100 million years ago</a>. “That is totally, totally surprising,” says cosmochemist Qing-Zhu Yin of the University of California, Davis.</p>
<p>The latest sample-return missions added more concrete evidence for recent volcanism. In 2020, the Chang’e-5 robotic mission landed in Oceanus Procellarum (the Ocean of Storms) — a spot picked in part because it looked geologically young given how few craters had accumulated there. Sure enough, the volcanic rocks brought home by that mission were found to be <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7957">2 billion years old</a>, the youngest ever retrieved from the Moon. “That was big news,” says planetary geoscientist Jim Head of Brown University, who worked on NASA’s Apollo missions.</p>
<p>On top of this, when researchers trawled through thousands of glass beads found in the Chang’e-5 soil samples, most of which are thought to have been created by impacts, they identified three that were volcanic—and only <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk6635">120 million years old</a>. This finding was published just last year and still needs to be verified, but if such recent dates hold up, they suggest that the Moon might <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr9336">still be capable of producing deep magma even today</a>, Yin says.</p>
<p>All this indicates that the Moon might not have cooled as fast as everyone thought it did. It’s also possible that some of the younger volcanism could have been powered by radioactive elements underground, which can generate enough heat to form magma and are known to be prevalent in certain patches of the Moon. This could explain the 120-million-year-old volcanic glass beads, for example. But not all the early volcanism can be explained this way: The Chang’e-5 volcanic rocks, along with some 2.8-billion-year-old volcanic rock brought back from the far side by Chang’e-6, came from source rocks <em>not </em>enriched with these elements.</p>
<p>“It throws up more questions than it answers,” Neal says. “It’s job security for people like me — we now have new questions to address.”<!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>Lunar exploration ahead</h2>
<p>Untangling these mysteries is challenging with so much of the Moon unexplored: While about 850 pounds of Moon rock and soil have now been brought back to Earth, it has all been from just a handful of sites.</p>
<p>Chang’e-6 expanded this picture by bringing back the first samples from the Moon’s far side, taken from the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the satellite’s largest, deepest and oldest impact crater. Researchers are keen to use these samples to start determining why the far side is so dramatically different from the near side. The questions that remain unanswered are why the far side has a thicker crust and is nearly devoid of mare from ancient lava oceans when compared with the near side.</p>
<p>NASA’s Artemis III mission, planned for 2027 (though that could <a href="https://aviationweek.com/space/space-exploration/mars-mind-will-trump-put-moon-back-burner">change</a>), aims to break more new ground by landing astronauts near the Moon’s south pole—in a spot that is more representative of the Moon’s typical geology than the Apollo sites—and bring home a bonanza of 150 to 180 pounds of samples.</p>
<p>This site should provide fresh geological insights, along with more information about lunar water. In 2018, scientists analyzing orbital mapping data <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/ice-confirmed-at-the-moons-poles/">confirmed that there is water ice</a> at the poles—but in what form no one yet knows. “Is it frost on the surface? Is it discrete patches underneath the surface? Is it absorbed onto mineral grains? Is it baked into the regolith like cement?” says NASA’s Juliane Gross, who is helping to develop the plans for lunar sample collection and curation for the Artemis science team. “We don’t know.”</p>
<p>What the Artemis astronauts find could inform ongoing projects spearheaded by China and the United States to establish permanent bases on the Moon, which could benefit from the south pole’s water. “That’s stuff you can breathe, that’s stuff you can drink, it’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576523000061">rocket fuel</a>,” Lawrence says.</p>
<h2>Lunar quarry</h2>
<p>In addition to water ice, other potentially mineable resources on the Moon have garnered attention, particularly <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Space_for_Earth/Energy/Helium-3_mining_on_the_lunar_surface">helium-3</a>. This stable isotope of helium is far more plentiful on the Moon than on Earth and could be an ideal fuel for <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/physical-world/2023/the-challenge-of-fusion-power">nuclear fusion</a> (if physicists can get that process to work). Commercial enterprises seeking to mine the Moon have popped up, including Seattle-based <a href="https://www.interlune.space/blog/excavate-sort-extract-and-separate-interlune-core-intellectual-property">Interlune</a>, which plans to bring helium-3 back to Earth in the 2030s, followed by other resources such as rare earth elements needed for technologies like batteries. But when lunar mining will be a reality—considering the logistics, the economics and the legal concerns—is an open question, Lawrence says.</p>
<p>While some people find the idea of mining the pristine Moon distasteful, there could be side benefits for mining on Earth, Neal says. With polar temperatures around -230° C (-380° F), lunar mining would have to be done without fluids. Developing the technologies needed for fluid-free mining could mitigate environmental concerns about wastewater and tailing fluids from mining on Earth. “Just think how you could revolutionize mining on this planet,” he says.</p>
<p>But first, researchers need to simply find out more about the Moon, its history, its geology and the possibility of extracting resources—and that requires up-close exploration, which is sure to bring more surprises. “Once you’re on the ground, you’re like, oh … what’s this?” Gross says. She’s hoping the astronauts can bring home a large haul. “The more they return, the more we can do.”</p>
