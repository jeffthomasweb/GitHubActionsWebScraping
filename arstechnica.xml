<p>NASA is ready for Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, stricken with thruster problems and helium leaks, to leave the International Space Station as soon as Friday, wrapping up a disappointing test flight that has clouded the long-term future of the Starliner program.</p>
<p>Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who launched aboard Starliner on June 5, closed the spacecraft's hatch Thursday in preparation for departure Friday. But it wasn't what they envisioned when they left Earth on Starliner three months ago. Instead of closing the hatch from a position in Starliner's cockpit, they latched the front door to the spacecraft from the space station's side of the docking port.</p>
<p>The Starliner spacecraft is set to undock from the International Space Station at 6:04 pm EDT (22:04 UTC) Friday. If all goes according to plan, Starliner will ignite its braking rockets at 11:17 pm EDT (03:17 UTC) for a minute-long burn to target a parachute-assisted, airbag-cushioned landing at White Sands Space Harbor, New Mexico, at 12:03 am EDT (04:03 UTC) Saturday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047423#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047423&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since its introduction in the 1970s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> has become one of the most influential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop role-playing games</a> (TRPGs) in popular culture, featuring heavily in <em>Stranger Things</em>, for example, and spawning <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/review-dd-honor-among-thieves-is-a-worthy-homage-to-the-classic-rpg/">a blockbuster movie</a> released last year. Over the last decade or so, researchers have turned their focus more heavily to the ways in which <em>D&amp;D</em> and other TRPGs <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-024-06408-0">can help</a> people with autism form healthy social connections, in part because the gaming environment offers clear rules around social interactions. According to the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613241275260">new paper</a> published in the journal Autism, <em>D&amp;D</em> helped boost players' confidence with autism, giving them a strong sense of kinship or belonging, among other benefits.</p>
<p>“There are many myths and misconceptions about autism, with some of the biggest suggesting that those with it aren’t socially motivated, or don’t have any imagination," <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/dungeons-and-dragons-can-help-autistic-people-gain-confidence-and-find-their-inner-hero">said co-author Gray Atherton</a>, a psychologist at the University of Plymouth. "<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> goes against all that, centering around working together in a team, all of which takes place in a completely imaginary environment. Those taking part in our study saw the game as a breath of fresh air, a chance to take on a different persona and share experiences outside of an often challenging reality. That sense of escapism made them feel incredibly comfortable, and many of them said they were now trying to apply aspects of it in their daily lives.”</p>
<p>Prior research has shown that autistic people are more likely to feel lonely, have smaller social networks, and often experience anxiety in social settings. Their desire for social connection leads many to "mask" their neurodivergent traits in public for fear of being rejected as a result of social gaffes. "I think every autistic person has had multiple instances of social rejection and loss of relationships," one of the study participants said when Atherton et al. interviewed them about their experiences. "You've done something wrong. You don't know what it is. They don't tell you, and you find out when you've been just, you know, left shunned in relationships, left out.... It's traumatic."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046700#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046700&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Federal prosecutors on Thursday unsealed an indictment charging six Russian nationals with conspiracy to hack into the computer networks of the Ukrainian government and its allies and steal or destroy sensitive data on behalf of the Kremlin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-russian-gru-officers-and-one-civilian-charged-conspiring-hack-ukrainian-government">The indictment</a>, filed in US District Court for the District of Maryland, said that five of the men were officers in Unit 29155 of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), a military intelligence agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Along with a sixth defendant, prosecutors alleged, they engaged in a conspiracy to hack, exfiltrate data, leak information, and destroy computer systems associated with the Ukrainian government in advance of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<h2>Targeting critical infrastructure with WhisperGate</h2>
<p>The indictment, which supersedes one filed earlier, comes 32 months after Microsoft documented its discovery of a destructive piece of malware, dubbed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/01/microsoft-warns-of-destructive-disk-wiper-targeting-ukraine/">WhisperGate</a>, had infected dozens of Ukrainian government, nonprofit, and IT organizations. WhisperGate masqueraded as ransomware, but in actuality was malware that permanently destroyed computers and the data stored on them by wiping the master boot record—a part of the hard drive needed to start the operating system during bootup.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047689#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047689&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Signs of volcanic activity on the Moon can be viewed simply by looking up at the night-time sky: The large, dark plains called "maria" are the product of massive outbursts of volcanic material. But these were put in place relatively early in the Moon's history, with their formation ending roughly 3 billion years ago. Smaller-scale additions may have continued until roughly 2 billion years ago. Evidence of that activity includes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/lunar-samples-returned-by-change-5-tell-of-recent-volcanism/">samples obtained by China's Chang'e-5 lander</a>.</p>
<p>But there are hints that small-scale volcanism continued until much more recent times. Observations from space have identified terrain that seems to be the product of eruptions, but only has a limited number of craters, suggesting a relatively young age. But there's considerable uncertainty about these deposits.</p>
<p>Now, further data from samples returned to Earth by the Chang’e-5 mission show clear evidence of volcanism that is truly recent in the context of the history of the Solar System. Small beads that formed during an eruption have been dated to just 125 million years ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047690#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047690&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the US Surgeon General <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/28/us-surgeon-general-issues-advisory-mental-health-well-being-parents.html">recently highlighted</a>, parenting is stressful. From navigating social media to facing a youth mental health crisis, challenges abound. But, for one father in Spain, even the simple, loving, everyday act of giving your child a peck on the cheek has turned to nightmare fuel.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2403121?logout=true">a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, the man's 9-year-old daughter developed a fever along with a crusty, blistering lesion on her left cheek. Doctors initially diagnosed the blotch as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430974/">impetigo</a>, a bacterial infection on the skin's surface layers that is fairly common in children. It's often caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>or <em>Streptococcus</em> bacteria and is generally easily treated with antibiotics.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T filed a lawsuit against Broadcom on August 29 accusing it of seeking to “retroactively change existing VMware contracts to match its new corporate strategy.” The lawsuit, spotted by <a href="https://www.channelfutures.com/channel-business/att-sues-broadcom-over-vmware-contracts-bullying">Channel Futures</a>, concerns claims that Broadcom is not letting AT&amp;T renew support services for previously purchased perpetual VMware software licenses unless AT&amp;T meets certain conditions.</p>
<p>Broadcom closed its $61 billion <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/05/broadcom-will-pay-61-billion-to-become-the-latest-company-to-acquire-vmware/">VMware acquisition</a> in November and swiftly enacted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/vmware-admits-sweeping-broadcom-changes-are-worrying-customers/">sweeping changes</a>. For example, in December, Broadcom announced the end of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">VMware perpetual license sales</a> in favor of subscriptions of bundled products. Combined with higher core requirements per CPU subscription, complaints <a href="https://blogs.idc.com/2024/08/07/vmware-cost-increases-how-broadcom-vmware-product-offerings-are-evolving/">ensued</a> that VMware was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/">getting more expensive</a> to work with.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T uses VMware software to run 75,000 virtual machines (VMs) across about 8,600 servers, per the complaint filed at the Supreme Court of the State of New York [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/att_broadcom.pdf">PDF</a>]. It reportedly uses the VMs to support customer service operations and for operations management efficiency.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047618#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047618&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Verizon today <a href="https://investor.frontier.com/news/news-details/2024/Verizon-to-acquire-Frontier/default.aspx">announced</a> a deal to acquire Frontier Communications, an Internet service provider with about 3 million customers in 25 states. Verizon said the all-cash transaction is valued at $20 billion.</p>
<p>Verizon agreed to pay $9.6 billion and is taking on <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/129601114/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Frontier-Second-Quarter-2024-Trending-Schedule.pdf">over $10 billion in debt</a> held by Frontier. Verizon said the deal is subject to regulatory approval and a vote by Frontier shareholders and is expected to be completed in 18 months.</p>
<p>"Under the terms of the agreement, Verizon will acquire Frontier for $38.50 per share in cash, representing a premium of 43.7 percent to Frontier's 90-Day volume-weighted average share price (VWAP) on September 3, 2024, the last trading day prior to media reports regarding a potential acquisition of Frontier," Verizon said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047606#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047606&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For years, Apple's September event has focused almost exclusively on new flagship iPhones and new Apple Watch models. Once in a while, other second-tier products make an appearance. And in recent cycles, the Mac and high-end iPads had their shining moment later in the year—often in October or November.</p>
<p>We expect the same to happen this time. You can almost certainly count on new iPhones and Watches. As for what else to expect: well, no Macs, but there are a couple of interesting possibilities.</p>
<p>Here's what we expect to see next week.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047346#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047346&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's no secret that government IT can be a huge bummer. The records retention! The security! So government workers occasionally take IT into their own hands with creative but, err, unauthorized solutions.</p>
<p>For instance, a former US Ambassador to Kenya in 2015 got in trouble after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/the-ambassador-who-worked-from-nairobi-bathroom-to-avoid-state-dept-it/">working out of an embassy compound bathroom</a>—the only place where he could use his personal computer (!) to access an unsecured network (!!) that let him log in to Gmail (!!!), where he did much of his official business—rules and security policies be damned.</p>
<p>Still, the ambassador had nothing on senior enlisted crew members of the littoral combat ship <a href="https://www.surfpac.navy.mil/lcs14/">USS</a><em><a href="https://www.surfpac.navy.mil/lcs14/"> Manchester</a></em>, who didn't like the Navy's restriction of onboard Internet access. In 2023, they decided that the best way to deal with the problem was to <em>secretly bolt a Starlink terminal to the "O-5 level weatherdeck" of a US warship</em>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047581#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047581&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>LocalThunk, the pseudonymous lead developer of the surprise smash hit deckbuilding/roguelike/poker-math-simulation game <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/"><em>Balatro</em></a>, has long given the impression that he understands that his game, having <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1821184859974344853">sold 2 million copies</a>, might be a little <em>too </em>good.</p>
<p>To that end, LocalThunk has made the game specifically <em>not</em> about actual gambling, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24216323/balatro-update-2025-details-new-jokers-iphone-android-version">or microtransactions</a>, or anything of the kind. Shortly after it arrived in February 2024 (but after it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/steam-next-fest-eight-game-demos-that-stood-out-from-the-crowd/">already got its hooks into one of us</a>), some storefronts removed or re-rated the game on concerns about its cards and chips themes, causing him to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-devs-argue-poker-roguelike-does-not-encourage-gambling-as-it-vanishes-from-some-stores">explain his line</a> between random number generation (RNG), risk/reward mechanics, and actual gambling. He <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/i-hate-the-thought-of-balatro-becoming-a-true-gambling-game-localthunk-is-making-sure-casinos-cant-get-their-hands-on-his-game-even-after-he-dies-by-literally-writing-it-into-his-will/">literally wrote it into his will</a> that the game cannot be used in any kind of gambling or casino property.</p>
<p>So LocalThunk has done everything he can to ensure <em>Balatro</em> won't waste people's money. Time, though? If you're a <em>Balatro</em> fan already, or more of a mobile gamer than a console or computer player, your time is in danger.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047492#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047492&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last month, Google's GameNGen AI model showed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">generalized image diffusion techniques</a> can be used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-model-can-hallucinate-a-game-of-1993s-doom-in-real-time/">generate a passable, playable version of <em>Doom</em></a>. Now, researchers are using some similar techniques with a model called MarioVGG to see if an AI model can generate plausible video of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in response to user inputs.</p>
<p>The results of <a href="https://virtual-protocol.github.io/mario-videogamegen/">the MarioVGG model</a>—available <a href="https://virtual-protocol.github.io/mario-videogamegen/static/pdfs/VideoGameGen.pdf">as a pre-print paper</a> published by the crypto-adjacent AI company <a href="https://www.virtuals.io/">Virtuals Protocol</a>—still display a lot of apparent glitches, and it's too slow for anything approaching real-time gameplay at the moment. But the results show how even a limited model can infer some impressive physics and gameplay dynamics just from studying a bit of video and input data.</p>
<p>The researchers hope this represents a first step toward "producing and demonstrating a reliable and controllable video game generator," or possibly even "replacing game development and game engines completely using video generation models" in the future.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047527#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047527&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's X has won its appeal on free speech grounds to block AB 587, a California law requiring social media companies to submit annual reports publicly explaining their controversial content moderation decisions.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/xmvjnmbxjvr/X%20Corp%20v%20Bonta%2020240904.pdf">opinion</a>, Ninth Circuit court of appeals judge Milan Smith reversed a district court's ruling that he said improperly rejected Musk's First Amendment argument. Smith was seemingly baffled to find that the "district court performed, essentially, no analysis on this question."</p>
<p>According to Smith, the district court "offered no reason" for finding that AB 587 only compelled commercial speech "except for wanting" to follow "the lead of the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits,” which never dealt with "speech similar" to AB 587's required content moderation reports. Instead, Smith said, the district court seemed to take up California's invitation to invent a new category of commercial speech that did not clash with the First Amendment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047493#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047493&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, BMW announced that it will start selling vehicles with hydrogen fuel cell powertrains in 2028 alongside the battery electric, gasoline-, and diesel-powered cars and SUVs it sells today. It is working with Toyota to develop new fuel cells, targeting half the cost and 20 percent better efficiency than current-generation fuel cell stacks. But the technology should be seen as complementary to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/heres-bmws-electric-replacement-for-the-x3-production-starts-in-2025/">battery electric vehicles</a>, not a replacement for them, BMW said.</p>
<p>Earlier this morning, the automaker held a roundtable discussion with Michael Rath, BMW's vice president for hydrogen vehicles, who began by answering the main question I had been planning to ask well before any of the assembled journalists were called on.</p>
<p>"It's a fact: battery electric vehicles are more efficient in well-to-wheel than fuel cell electric vehicles. It's absolutely true that the conversion of electricity into hydrogen and back into electricity in the car generates losses and hence is less efficient than using the electricity directly," Rath said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047501#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047501&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“On Earth, the ocean is in contact with some rock. If we have too much water, it creates high-pressure ice underneath the ocean, which separates it from the planet’s rocky interior,” said Caroline Dorn, a geophysicist at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, who led new research in exoplanet interiors.</p>
<p>This high-pressure ice prevents minerals and chemical compounds from being exchanged between the rocks and the water. In theory, that should make the ocean barren and lifeless. But Dorn’s team argues that even exoplanets that have enough water to form such high-pressure ice can host life if the majority of the water is not stored in the surface oceans but is held much deeper in the planet’s core. The water in the core can’t sustain life—it’s not even in its molecular form there. But it means that a substantial fraction of a planet’s water isn’t on the surface, which makes the surface oceans a little more shallow and prevents high-pressure ice from forming at their bottom.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047009#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047009&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, federal prosecutors charged a North Carolina musician with defrauding streaming services of $10 million through an elaborate scheme involving AI, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/nc-man-charged-ai-fake-music.html">reported by</a> The New York Times. Michael Smith, 52, allegedly used AI to create hundreds of thousands of fake songs by nonexistent bands, then streamed them using bots to collect royalties from platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.</p>

<p>While the AI-generated element of this story is novel, Smith allegedly broke the law by setting up an elaborate fake listener scheme. The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/north-carolina-musician-charged-music-streaming-fraud-aided-artificial-intelligence">announced the charges</a>, which include wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. If convicted, Smith could face up to 20 years in prison for each charge.</p>
<p>Smith's scheme, which prosecutors say ran for seven years, involved creating thousands of fake streaming accounts using purchased email addresses. He developed software to play his AI-generated music on repeat from various computers, mimicking individual listeners from different locations. In an industry where success is measured by digital listens, Smith's fabricated catalog reportedly managed to rack up billions of streams.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047451#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047451&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first wave of major generative AI tools largely were trained on “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/open-ai-training-data-public-available-meaning">publicly available</a>” data—basically, anything and everything that could be scraped from the Internet. Now, sources of training data are increasingly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/applebot-extended-apple-ai-scraping/">restricting access</a> and pushing for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conde-nast-openai-deal/">licensing agreements</a>. With the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-generative-ai-companies-thirsty-for-your-data/">hunt for additional data sources</a> intensifying, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bill-gross-prorata-generative-ai-business/">new licensing startups</a> have emerged to keep the source material flowing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thedpa.ai/">Dataset Providers Alliance</a>, a trade group formed this summer, wants to make the AI industry more standardized and fair. To that end, it has just released a <a href="https://www.thedpa.ai/ai-data-licensing-position-paper">position paper</a> outlining its stances on major AI-related issues. The alliance is made up of seven AI licensing companies, including music copyright-management firm <a href="https://rightsify.com/">Rightsify</a>, Japanese stock-photo marketplace <a href="https://www.pixtastock.com/">Pixta</a>, and generative-AI copyright-licensing startup <a href="https://calliopenetworks.ai/">Calliope Networks</a>. (At least five new members will be announced in the fall.)</p>

<p>For some of us, few things are more infuriating than a gadget that stops working due to a software change. As we've frequently covered here at Ars, startups and Big Tech companies are guilty of rendering hardware obsolete and/or stripping it of core functions. Consumer groups are urging the Federal Trade Commission to get involved.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/research/group-letter-ftc-software-tethering">a letter</a> sent today to Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, and Serena Viswanathan, associate director of the FTC's Division of Advertising Practices, representatives from 17 groups, including Consumer Reports, the US PIRG, and iFixit, urged the FTC for "clear guidance" around software tethering. Software tethering, per the letter, is "making functions of a device reliant on embedded software that ties the device back to a manufacturer’s servers.” As it stands, the practice is hurting customers with "unfair and deceptive practices," such as suddenly<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/smart-sous-vide-cooker-to-start-charging-2-month-for-10-year-old-companion-app/"> locking features behind a subscription</a>—like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/1700-smart-bassinet-adds-20-month-sub-but-only-if-you-buy-it-used/">Snoo smart bassinet</a> recently did—or bricking already-purchased devices, which Spotify did with its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/spotify-wont-open-source-car-thing-but-starts-refund-process/">Car Thing</a>.</p>
<p>The letter to the FTC argues that such practices hinder owners' ability to own their hardware.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047344#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047344&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The final flight of Europe's Vega rocket lifted off Wednesday night from French Guiana, carrying an important environmental monitoring satellite for the European Union's flagship Copernicus program.</p>
<p>The 98-foot-tall (30-meter) Vega rocket took off at 9:50 pm EDT Wednesday (01:50 UTC Thursday) from the European-run spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The launcher headed north from the launch pad on the coast of South America, aiming for a polar orbit about 480 miles (775 kilometers) above the Earth.</p>
<p>The sole payload was Sentinel-2C, a remote sensing platform set to join Europe's fleet of Copernicus environmental satellites. The multibillion-dollar Copernicus system is the world's most comprehensive space-based Earth observation network, with satellites fitted with different kinds of instruments monitoring land surfaces, oceans, and the atmosphere.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047033#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047033&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now that NASA has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/">resolved the question</a> of the Starliner spacecraft and its two crew members on the International Space Station, the agency faces another high-stakes human spaceflight decision.</p>
<p>The choice concerns the Orion spacecraft's heat shield and whether NASA will make any changes before the Artemis II mission that will make a lunar flyby. Although Starliner has garnered a lot of media attention, this will be an even higher-profile decision for NASA, with higher consequences—four astronauts will be on board, and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people will be watching humanity's first deep space mission in more than five decades.</p>
<p>The issue is the safety of the heat shield, located at the base of the capsule, which protects Orion's crew during its return to Earth. During the Artemis I mission that sent Orion beyond the Moon in late 2022, without astronauts on board, chunks of charred material cracked and chipped away from Orion's heat shield during reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Once the spacecraft landed, engineers found more than 100 locations where the stresses of reentry damaged the heat shield.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043964#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043964&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Over the weekend, the nonprofit National Novel Writing Month organization (NaNoWriMo) <a href="https://nanowrimo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/29933455931412-What-is-NaNoWriMo-s-position-on-Artificial-Intelligence-AI">published an FAQ</a> outlining its position on AI, calling categorical rejection of AI writing technology "classist" and "ableist." The statement caused a backlash online, prompted <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nanowrimo-organizers-classist-and-ableist-to-condemn-ai/">four members</a> of the organization's board to step down, and prompted a sponsor to <a href="https://ellipsus.com/blog/nanowrimo-sponsorship-generative-ai">withdraw</a> its support.</p>

<p>"We believe that to categorically condemn AI would be to ignore classist and ableist issues surrounding the use of the technology," wrote NaNoWriMo, "and that questions around the use of AI tie to questions around privilege."</p>
<p>NaNoWriMo, known for its annual challenge where participants write a 50,000-word manuscript in November, argued in its post that condemning AI would ignore issues of class and ability, suggesting the technology could benefit those who might otherwise need to hire human writing assistants or have differing cognitive abilities.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047101#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047101&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
