              <![CDATA[<p>NASA's acting administrator is moving swiftly to remove diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility—or DEIA—programs from the space agency.</p>
<p>In an email sent to agency employees on Wednesday afternoon, acting administrator Janet Petro wrote, "We are taking steps to close all agency DEIA offices and end all DEIA-related contracts in accordance with President Trump’s executive orders titled Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing and Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions."</p>
<p>During his run for a second term as president, Trump campaigned on ending programs in the federal government that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. He signed executive orders to that effect shortly after his inauguration on Monday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/nasa-moves-swiftly-to-end-dei-programs-ask-employees-to-report-violations/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What could go wrong with eating an extremely high-fat diet of beef, cheese, and sticks of butter? Well, for one thing, your cholesterol levels could reach such stratospheric levels that lipids start oozing from your blood vessels, forming yellowish nodules on your skin.</p>
<p>That was the disturbing case of a man in Florida who showed up at a Tampa hospital with a three-week history of painless, yellow eruptions on the palms of his hands, soles of his feet, and elbows. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2828915">His case was published today in JAMA Cardiology</a>.</p>

      Painless yellowish nodules were observed on the patient’s palms (A) and elbows. B, Magnified view of the palmar lesions. These lesions are consistent with xanthelasma, likely resulting from severe hypercholesterolemia associated with a high-fat carnivore diet.

<p>The man, said to be in his 40s, told doctors that he had adopted a "carnivore diet" eight months prior. His diet included between 6 lbs and 9 lbs of cheese, sticks of butter, and daily hamburgers that had additional fat incorporated into them. Since taking on this brow-raising food plan, he claimed his weight dropped, his energy levels increased, and his "mental clarity" improved.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/florida-man-eats-diet-of-butter-cheese-beef-cholesterol-oozes-from-his-body/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Apple must face a potential class action alleging that Apple had a policy of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/apple-deliberately-pays-women-less-than-men-lawsuit-says/">paying men higher salaries than women for similar work</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, California Superior Court Judge Ethan P. Schulman filed an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jong-v-Apple-Order-Denying-Motion-to-Strike-1-21-24.pdf">order</a> that largely denies Apple's motions to strike the class allegations and suspend several class claims. This allows what one lawyer representing women suing, Joseph Sellers, said was "a very important case that impacts thousands of current and former female Apple employees."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most significantly, Apple tried and failed to argue that pay disparities for individual female workers suing were "justified" and that their circumstances were not common to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/apple-deliberately-pays-women-less-than-men-lawsuit-says/">12,000 female employees who could be owed backpay</a> if the class action is certified and Apple loses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-must-face-suit-over-alleged-policy-of-underpaying-female-workers/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Reddit is staying out of the current revolt against social media website X and, to a lesser degree, Meta, on its platform.</p>
<p>Since Tuesday, hundreds of subreddits have discussed and/or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nffc/comments/1i6k2oz/rnffc_is_banning_direct_links_to_xtwitter/">implemented bans</a> against the site formerly called Twitter, as reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/hundreds-of-subreddits-are-considering-banning-all-links-to-x/">404 Media</a>. Dozens of subreddits have already agreed to disallow the sharing of any links to X, with moderators (volunteer Reddit users) agreeing to enforce the bans.</p>
<p>The trend seemed to start among subreddits focused on sports-related topics, like the subreddits for the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1i6ne3o/twitter_and_rnfl/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://mashable.com/article/sports-subreddits-push-to-ban-x-links-after-elon-musk-salute">NFL</a>, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/">Vancouver Canucks</a> NHL team, and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1i6gym0/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://mashable.com/article/sports-subreddits-push-to-ban-x-links-after-elon-musk-salute">Liverpool Football Club</a>, as reported by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sports-subreddits-push-to-ban-x-links-after-elon-musk-salute">Mashable</a>. However, as of today, subreddits of various topics are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1i6hprq/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/">discussing X bans</a>. Reddit users in support of X bans like the one instituted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/londonontario/comments/1i6xi7j/banning_of_twitterx_links/">r/londonontario</a> have pointed to various reasoning, including not being able to see tweet links without having an X account, Elon Musk <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-salute-nazi-trump-inauguration-backlash-rcna188540">appearing to make a Nazi salute</a> at the presidential inauguration on Monday (as cited by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i6ybpf/xtwitter_are_blocked_in_rchristianity/?ref=404media.co">r/Christianity’s</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1i6txcn/fuck_this_guy_x_links_are_now_banned_from/">r/newjersey's</a> bans, for example), and general dislike for Musk and/or how he runs X.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/reddit-wont-interfere-with-users-revolting-against-x-with-subreddit-bans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that AI models may surpass human capabilities "in almost everything" within two to three years, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-01-21-2025/card/anthropic-ceo-says-ai-could-surpass-human-intelligence-by-2027-9tka9tjLKLalkXX8IgKA">Wall Street Journal interview</a> at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Speaking at Journal House in Davos, Amodei <a href="https://x.com/JoannaStern/status/1881750060251451884">said</a>, "I don't know exactly when it'll come, I don't know if it'll be 2027. I think it's plausible it could be longer than that. I don't think it will be a whole bunch longer than that when AI systems are better than humans at almost everything. Better than almost all humans at almost everything. And then eventually better than all humans at everything, even robotics."</p>
<p>Amodei co-founded Anthropic in 2021 with his sister, Daniela Amodei, and five other former OpenAI employees. Not long after, Anthropic emerged as a strong technological competitor to OpenAI's AI products (such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT). Most recently, its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> model has remained highly regarded among some AI users and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-king-is-dead-claude-3-surpasses-gpt-4-on-chatbot-arena-for-the-first-time/">highly ranked</a> among AI benchmarks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The open source Wine project—sometimes stylized WINE, for Wine Is Not an Emulator—has become an important tool for companies and individuals who want to make Windows apps and games run on operating systems like Linux or even macOS. The <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/">CrossOver software</a> for Mac and Windows, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Apple's Game Porting Toolkit</a>, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">Proton project</a> that powers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/">Valve's SteamOS</a> and the Steam Deck are all rooted in Wine, and the attention and resources put into the project in recent years have dramatically improved its compatibility and usefulness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Wine project announced <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.0">the stable release of version 10.0</a>, the next major version of the compatibility layer that is not an emulator. The headliner for this release is support for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/arm64ec">ARM64EC</a>, the application binary interface (ABI) used for Arm apps in Windows 11, but the release notes say that the release contains "over 6,000 individual changes" produced over "a year of development effort."</p>
<p>ARM64EC allows developers to mix Arm and x86-compatible code—if you're making an Arm-native version of your app, you can still allow the use of more obscure x86-based plugins or add-ons without having to port everything over at once. Wine 10.0 also supports ARM64X, a different type of application binary file that allows ARM64EC code to be mixed with older, pre-Windows 11 ARM64 code.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/wine-10-0-released-adding-linux-compatibility-for-arm-windows-apps/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Department of Homeland Security has terminated all members of advisory committees, including one that has been investigating a major Chinese hack of large US telecom firms.</p>
<p>"The Cyber Safety Review Board—a Department of Homeland Security investigatory body stood up under a Biden-era cybersecurity executive order to probe major cybersecurity incidents—has been cleared of non-government members as part of a DHS-wide push to cut costs under the Trump administration, according to three people familiar with the matter," <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/01/dhs-cyber-review-board-cleaned-out-trump-move-eliminate-misuse-resources/402386/">NextGov/FCW reported yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25500093-dhs-advisory-boards-termination-letter/">memo</a> sent Monday by DHS Acting Secretary Benjamine Huffman said that in order to "eliminate[e] the misuse of resources and ensur[e] that DHS activities prioritize our national security, I am directing the termination of all current memberships on advisory committees within DHS, effective immediately. Future committee activities will be focused solely on advancing our critical mission to protect the homeland and support DHS's strategic priorities."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-admin-fires-homeland-security-advisory-boards-blaming-agendas/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Samsung announced the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25/">Galaxy S25, S25+</a>, and <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/">S25 Ultra</a> at its Unpacked event today. What is different from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/the-galaxy-s24-gets-seven-years-of-updates-1300-titanium-ultra-model/">last year's models</a>? With the phones themselves, not much, other than a new chipset and a wide camera. But pure AI optimism? Samsung managed to pack a whole lot more of that into its launch event and promotional materials.</p>
<p>The corners on the S25 Ultra are a bit more rounded, the edges are flatter, and the bezels seem to be slightly thinner. The S25 and S25+ models have the same screen size as the S24 models, at 6.2 and 6.7 inches, respectively, while the Ultra notches up slightly from 6.8 to 6.9 inches.</p>

            <![CDATA[Result "challenges existing theories that tie FRB origins to phenomena in star-forming galaxies."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are puzzling phenomena because their details are so difficult to resolve, and observations to date have been inconsistent. Astronomers added another piece to the puzzle with the detection of an FRB that seems to originate in a dead galaxy that is no longer producing new stars, according to a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad9ddc">new paper</a> published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, along with a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad9de2">related paper</a> on the event from scientists at Northwestern University.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/its-coming-from-inside-the-galaxy-first-fast-radio-burst-source-idd/">we've reported previously</a>, FRBs involve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst">sudden blast</a> of radio-frequency radiation that lasts just a few microseconds. Astronomers have observed over a thousand of them to date; some come from sources that repeatedly emit FRBs, while others seem to burst once and go silent. You can produce this sort of sudden surge of energy by destroying something. But the existence of repeating sources suggests that at least some of them are produced by an object that survives the event. That has led to a focus on compact objects, like neutron stars and black holes—especially a class of neutron stars called magnetars—as likely sources. Only about 3 percent of FRBs are of the repeating variety.</p>
<p>There have also been many detected FRBs that don't seem to repeat at all, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/fast-radio-burst-may-point-to-the-first-blitzar-weve-observed/">suggesting that</a> the conditions that produce them may destroy their source. That's consistent <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.4.2-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fscience%2F2023%2F03%2Ffast-radio-burst-may-point-to-the-first-blitzar-weve-observed%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41550-023-01917-x&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=3ff74213e34d09c57c230a7cd5dcaa05&amp;cci=4b274c4ca7451974397c72687220aa06&amp;xcust=xid:fr1737560785577jfh" data-orig-url="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.4.2-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fscience%2F2023%2F03%2Ffast-radio-burst-may-point-to-the-first-blitzar-weve-observed%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41550-023-01917-x&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=3ff74213e34d09c57c230a7cd5dcaa05&amp;cci=4b274c4ca7451974397c72687220aa06" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1737560785577jfh">with a blitzar</a>—a bizarre astronomical event caused by the sudden collapse of an overly massive neutron star.

            <![CDATA[Trump: "The largest AI infrastructure project in history, and it's taking place here in America."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/03/what-know-about-mgx-uaes-latest-ai-investment-firm">MGX</a> <a href="https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/">announced</a> plans to form Stargate, a new company that will invest $500 billion in AI computing infrastructure across the United States over four years. The announcement came during a White House meeting with President Donald Trump, who called it the "largest AI infrastructure project in history."</p>
<p>The goal is to kickstart building more data centers to expand computing capacity for current and future AI projects, including OpenAI's goal of "AGI," which the company <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">defines</a> as a highly autonomous AI system that "outperforms humans at most economically valuable work."</p>
<p>"This infrastructure will secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world," <a href="https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/">wrote</a> OpenAI in a press statement.

              <![CDATA[<p>We’re only three weeks into 2025, and it’s already shaping up to be the year of Internet of Things-driven DDoSes. Reports are rolling in of threat actors infecting thousands of home and office routers, web cameras, and other Internet-connected devices.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q4/">post</a> on Tuesday from content-delivery network Cloudflare reported on a recent distributed denial-of-service attack that delivered 5.6 terabits per second of junk traffic—a new record for the largest DDoS ever reported.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ulbricht, 40, was about 10 years into his life sentence for helming an online black market where drug dealers, money launderers, and traffickers used bitcoins to mask more than $214 million in illicit trades.

But even with the console officially "revealed," there's still a wide range of important unknown Switch 2 details that Nintendo has yet to address.</p>
<p>As we wait for the company to dribble out additional information in the coming weeks and months, we thought we'd take a quick look at the biggest outstanding questions and concerns we still have about Nintendo's next gaming platform, along with some analysis of what we know, what we can guess, and what we expect on each score.</p>
<h2>Launch date?</h2>
<p>The teaser trailer's promise of a "2025" Switch 2 release technically covers any launch date between "tomorrow" and December 31.

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://bambulab.com/en">Bambu Lab</a>, a major maker of 3D printers for home users and commercial "farms," is pushing an update to its devices that it claims will improve security while still offering third-party tools "authorized" access. Some in the user community—and 3D printing advocates broadly—are pushing back, suggesting the firm has other, more controlling motives.</p>
<p>As is perhaps appropriate for 3D printing, this matter has many layers, some long-standing arguments about freedom and rights baked in, and a good deal of heat.</p>

<h2>Printing more, tweaking less</h2>
<p>Bambu Lab, launched in 2022, has stood out in the burgeoning consumer 3D printing market because of its printers' capacity for printing at high speeds without excessive tinkering or maintenance. The <a href="https://bambulab.com/en-us/x1">product page for the X1 series</a>, the printer first targeted for new security, starts with the credo, "We hated 3D printing as much as we loved it." Bambu's faster, less fussy multicolor printers garnered attention—including an ongoing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/stratasys-sues-bambu-lab-over-patents-used-widely-by-consumer-3d-printers/">patent lawsuit from established commercial printer Stratasys</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/bambu-lab-pushes-a-control-system-for-3d-printers-and-boy-did-it-not-go-well/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a letter to investors [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">PDF</a>], Netflix announced price changes starting today in the US, Canada, Argentina, and Portugal.</p>
<p>People who subscribe to Netflix's cheapest ad-free plan (Standard) will see the biggest increase in monthly costs.

              <![CDATA[<p>After 14 years, EA will retire its controversial Origin game distribution app for Windows, the company<a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/"> announced</a>. Origin will stop working on April 17, 2025. Folks still using it will be directed to install the newer EA app, which launched in 2022.</p>
<p>The launch of Origin in 2011 was a flashpoint of controversy among gamers, as EA—already not a beloved company by this point—began pulling titles like<em> Crysis 2</em> from the popular Steam platform to drive players to its own launcher.</p>
<p>Frankly, it all made sense from EA's point of view. For a publisher that size, Valve had relatively little to offer in terms of services or tools, yet it was taking a big chunk of games' revenue. Why wouldn't EA want to get that money back?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/rip-eas-origin-launcher-we-knew-ye-all-too-well-unfortunately/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple has sent out release candidate builds of the upcoming iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS 15.3 updates to developers today. But they come with one tweak that hasn't been reported on, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/macos-sequoia-15-3-apple-intelligence-opt-out/">per MacRumors</a>: They enable all of the AI-powered Apple Intelligence features by default during setup. When Apple Intelligence was initially released in iOS 18.1, the features were off by default, unless users chose to opt-in and enable them.</p>
<p>Those who still wish to opt out of Apple Intelligence features will now have to do it after their devices are set up by navigating to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri section in the Settings app.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence will only be enabled by default for hardware that supports it. For the iPhone, that's just the iPhone 15 Pro series, iPhone 16 series, and iPhone 16 Pro series. It goes further back on the iPad and Mac—Apple Intelligence works on any model with an M1 processor or newer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/ios-18-3-macos-15-3-updates-switch-to-enabling-apple-intelligence-by-default/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Chinese AI lab <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek">DeepSeek</a> released its new <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1">R1 model family</a> under an open <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT license</a>, with its largest version containing 671 billion parameters. The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">OpenAI's o1</a> simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.</p>
<p>Alongside the release of the main <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero">DeepSeek-R1-Zero</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1">DeepSeek-R1</a> models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.</p>
<p>The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models—which can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware—have lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A potentially disruptive satellite company launched its first spacecraft last week as part of a Transporter mission flown on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>The demonstration mission from a California-based firm named K2 aims to "burn down" the risk of the technology that will fly on the company's first full-sized satellite. So far, so good, but it's early days for the demo flight.</p>
<p>Founded a little less than three years ago, K2 seeks to disrupt the production of large satellites by focusing on vertical integration and taking advantage of large launch vehicles, such as SpaceX's Starship and Blue Origin's New Glenn, which can throw a lot of payload into space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/company-aims-to-build-larger-satellites-for-new-era-of-launch-abundance/">Read full article</a></p>
