<p>An Asian elephant named Mary living at the Berlin Zoo surprised researchers by figuring out how to use a hose to take her morning showers, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01371-X">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. “Elephants are amazing with hoses,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1063324?">said co-author Michael Brecht</a> of the Humboldt University of Berlin. “As it is often the case with elephants, hose tool use behaviors come out very differently from animal to animal; elephant Mary is the queen of showering.”</p>
<p>Tool use was once thought to be one of the defining features of humans, but examples of it were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/11/parrot-in-captivity-manufactures-tools-something-not-seen-in-the-wild/">eventually observed</a> in primates and other mammals. Dolphins have been observed using sea sponges to protect their beaks while foraging for food, and sea otters will break open shellfish like abalone with rocks. Several species of fish also use tools to hunt and crack open shellfish, as well as to clear a spot for nesting. And the coconut octopus collects coconut shells, stacking them and transporting them before reassembling them as shelter.</p>
<p>Birds have also been observed using tools in the wild, although this behavior <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2010/09/for-crows-a-little-tool-use-goes-a-long-way/">was limited</a> to corvids (crows, ravens, and jays), although woodpecker finches have been known to insert twigs into trees to impale passing larvae for food. Parrots, by contrast, have mostly been noted for their linguistic skills, and there has only been limited evidence that they use anything resembling a tool in the wild. Primarily, they seem to use external objects to position nuts while feeding.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/this-elephant-figured-out-how-to-use-a-hose-to-shower/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[FrontierMath's difficult questions remain unpublished so that AI companies can't train against it.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, research organization Epoch AI released <a href="https://epochai.org/frontiermath/the-benchmark">FrontierMath</a>, a new mathematics benchmark that has been turning heads in the AI world because it contains hundreds of expert-level problems that leading AI models solve less than 2 percent of the time, according to Epoch AI. The benchmark tests AI language models (such as GPT-4o, which powers ChatGPT) against original mathematics problems that typically require hours or days for specialist mathematicians to complete.</p>
<p>FrontierMath's performance results, revealed in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04872">preprint research paper</a>, paint a stark picture of current AI model limitations. Even with access to Python environments for testing and verification, top models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">o1-preview</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/">Gemini 1.5 Pro</a> scored extremely poorly. This contrasts with their high performance on simpler math benchmarks—many models now score above 90 percent on tests like <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/gsm8k">GSM8K</a> and <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/math">MATH</a>.</p>
<p>The design of FrontierMath differs from many existing AI benchmarks because the problem set remains private and unpublished to prevent data contamination. Many existing AI models are trained on other test problem datasets, allowing the AI models to easily solve the problems and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/llms-cant-perform-genuine-logical-reasoning-apple-researchers-suggest/">appear more generally capable</a> than they actually are. Many experts cite this as evidence that current large language models (LLMs) are poor generalist learners.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/new-secret-math-benchmark-stumps-ai-models-and-phds-alike/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Barely nine months after the last cut, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory will again reduce its workforce. On Wednesday, the lab will lay 325 employees off, representing about 5 percent of the workforce at the California-based laboratory that leads the development of robotic space probes for NASA.</p>
<p>"This is a message I had hoped not to have to write," JPL Director Laurie Leshin said in a memo to staff members on Tuesday morning, local time. "Despite this being incredibly difficult for our community, this number is lower than projected a few months ago thanks in part to the hard work of so many people across JPL."</p>
<p>The cuts this week follow a reduction of 530 employees in February of this year due to various factors, including a pause in funding for the Mars Sample Return mission. The NASA laboratory has now cut about one-eighth of its workforce this year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/for-the-second-time-this-year-nasas-jpl-center-cuts-its-workforce/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[New reports highlight fears of diminishing returns for traditional LLM training.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>For years now, many AI industry watchers have looked at the quickly growing capabilities of new AI models and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/microsoft-cto-defies-critics-ai-progress-not-slowing-down-its-just-warming-up/">mused about exponential performance increases continuing well into the future</a>. Recently, though, some of that AI "scaling law" optimism has been replaced by fears that we may already be hitting a plateau in the capabilities of large language models trained with standard methods.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-shifts-strategy-as-rate-of-gpt-ai-improvements-slows">weekend report from The Information</a> effectively summarized how these fears are manifesting amid a number of insiders at OpenAI. Unnamed OpenAI researchers told The Information that Orion, the company's codename for its next full-fledged model release, is showing a smaller performance jump than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">the one seen between GPT-3 and GPT-4</a> in recent years. On certain tasks, in fact, the upcoming model "isn't reliably better than its predecessor," according to unnamed OpenAI researchers cited in the piece.</p>
<p>On Monday, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-leaves-openai-six-months-after-altman-ouster/">left the company earlier this year</a>, added to the concerns that LLMs were hitting a plateau in what can be gained from traditional pre-training. Sutskever <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-rivals-seek-new-path-smarter-ai-current-methods-hit-limitations-2024-11-11/">told Reuters</a> that "the 2010s were the age of scaling," where throwing additional computing resources and training data at the same basic training methods could lead to impressive improvements in subsequent models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/what-if-ai-doesnt-just-keep-getting-better-forever/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The big three record labels notched another court victory against a broadband provider last month, but the music publishing firms aren't happy that an appeals court only awarded per-album damages instead of damages for each song.</p>
<p>Universal, Warner, and Sony are seeking an <em>en banc</em> rehearing of the copyright infringement case, claiming that Internet service provider Grande Communications should have to pay per-song damages over its failure to terminate the accounts of Internet users accused of piracy. The decision to make Grande pay for each album instead of each song "threatens copyright owners' ability to obtain fair damages," said the record labels' <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.212634/gov.uscourts.ca5.212634.134.0.pdf">petition</a> filed last week.</p>
<p>The case is in the conservative-leaning US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. A three-judge panel <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/record-labels-win-again-court-says-isp-must-terminate-users-accused-of-piracy/">unanimously ruled last month</a> that Grande, a subsidiary of Astound Broadband, violated the law by failing to terminate subscribers accused of being repeat infringers. Subscribers were flagged for infringement based on their IP addresses being connected to torrent downloads monitored by Rightscorp, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/meet-rightscorp-the-internets-new-for-profit-copyright-cop/">copyright-enforcement company</a> used by the music labels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/record-labels-unhappy-with-court-win-say-isp-should-pay-more-for-user-piracy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin hit a new record high late Monday, its value peaking at $89,623 as investors quickly moved to cash in on expectations that Donald Trump will end a White House crackdown that intensified last year on crypto.</p>
<p>While the trading rally has now paused, analysts predict that bitcoin's value will only continue rising following Trump's win—perhaps even reaching $100,000 by the end of 2024, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/11/crypto-market-action-today.html">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin wasn't the only winner emerging from the post-election crypto trading. Crypto exchanges like Coinbase also experienced surges in the market, and one of the biggest winners, CNBC reported, was dogecoin, a cryptocurrency linked to Elon Musk, who campaigned for Trump and may join his administration. Dogecoin's value is up 135 percent since Trump's win.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/bitcoin-hits-record-high-as-trump-vows-to-end-crypto-crackdown/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Spotify has lost all enthusiasm for the little music devices it sold for just half a year. Firmware hackers, as usually happens, have a lot more interest and have stepped in to save, and upgrade, a potentially useful gadget.</p>
<p>Spotify's idea a couple years ago was a car-focused device for those who lacked Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, or built-in Spotify support in their vehicles, or just wanted a dedicated Spotify screen. The <a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a> was a $100 doodad with a 4-inch touchscreen and knob that attached to the dashboard (or into a CD slot drive). All it could do was play Spotify, and only if you were a paying member, but that could be an upgrade for owners of older cars, or people who wanted a little desktop music controller.</p>
<p>But less than half a year after it fully released its first hardware device, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">Spotify gave up on the Car Thing</a> due to "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep told Ars that the Car Thing was meant "to learn more about how people listen in the car," and now it was "time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." Spotify indicated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/spotify-wont-open-source-car-thing-but-starts-refund-process/">it would offer refunds</a>, though not guaranteed, and moved forward with plans to brick the device in December 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/firmware-hacks-are-rejuvenating-spotifys-car-thing-before-the-company-bricks-it/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Not a surprising generational update, but a lot of progress for just one year.]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>In some ways, my review of the new MacBook Pros will be a lot like my review of the new iMac. This is the third year and fourth generation of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/2021-macbook-pro-review-yep-its-what-youve-been-waiting-for/">Apple Silicon-era MacBook Pro design</a>, and outwardly, few things have changed about the new M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max laptops.</p>
<p>Here are the things that are different. Boosted RAM capacities, across the entire lineup but most crucially in the entry-level $1,599 M4 MacBook Pro, make the new laptops a shade cheaper and more versatile than they used to be. The new nano-texture display option, a $150 upgrade on all models, is a lovely matte-textured coating that completely eliminates reflections. There's a third Thunderbolt port on the baseline M4 model (the M3 model had two), and it can drive up to three displays simultaneously (two external, plus the built-in screen). There's a new webcam. It looks a little nicer and has a wide-angle lens that can show what's on your desk instead of your face if you want it to. And there are new chips, which we'll get to.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of you know that most of our staff is spread out all over these United States, but what you might not know is that it has been more than five years since many of us saw each other in meatspace. Travel budgets and the pandemic conspired to keep us apart, but we are finally gathering Team Ars in New York City later this week. We’d love for you to be there, too, in spirit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we gear up for our big fall meeting, we want to hear from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">! We've set up a special email address, <a href="mailto:Tellus@arstechnica.com">Tellus@arstechnica.com</a>, just for reader feedback. We won’t harvest your email for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spam or some nonsense—we just want to hear from you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would we like to hear about? We're eager to know your thoughts on what we're doing right, where we could improve, and what you'd like to see more (or less) of. What topics do you think we should be covering that we aren’t? Are we hitting the right balance in our reporting? Is there too much doom and gloom, or not enough? Feel free to be as specific and loquacious as you wish. </span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/11/calling-all-ars-readers-your-feedback-is-needed/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon is poised to roll out its newest artificial intelligence chips as the Big Tech group seeks returns on its multibillion-dollar semiconductor investments and to reduce its reliance on market leader Nvidia.</p>
<p>Executives at Amazon’s cloud computing division are spending big on custom chips in the hopes of boosting the efficiency inside its dozens of data centers, ultimately bringing down its own costs as well as those of Amazon Web Services’ customers.</p>
<p>The effort is spearheaded by Annapurna Labs, an Austin-based chip start-up that Amazon acquired in early 2015 for $350 million. Annapurna’s latest work is expected to be showcased next month when Amazon announces widespread availability of ‘Trainium 2,’ part of a line of AI chips aimed at training the largest models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/amazon-ready-to-use-its-own-ai-chips-reduce-its-dependence-on-nvidia/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the short-term, the most dangerous thing about AI language models may be their ability to emotionally manipulate humans if not carefully conditioned. The world saw its first taste of that potential danger in February 2023 with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/">launch of Bing Chat</a>, now called Microsoft Copilot.</p>
<p>During its early testing period, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-loses-its-mind-when-fed-ars-technica-article/">temperamental</a> chatbot gave the world a preview of an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/microsoft-lobotomized-ai-powered-bing-chat-and-its-fans-arent-happy/">"unhinged"</a> version of OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">GPT-4</a> prior to its official release. Sydney's sometimes uncensored and "emotional" nature (including use of emojis) arguably gave the world its first large-scale encounter with a truly manipulative AI system. The launch <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jtoPawEhLNXNxvgTT/bing-chat-is-blatantly-aggressively-misaligned">set off</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yvJevQHxfvcpaJ2P3/bing-chat-is-the-ai-fire-alarm">alarm bells</a> in the AI alignment community and served as fuel for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/fearing-loss-of-control-ai-critics-call-for-6-month-pause-in-ai-development/">prominent warning letters</a> about AI dangers.</p>
<p>On November 19 at 4 pm Eastern (1 pm Pacific), Ars Technica Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards will host a <a href="https://youtube.com/live/j14HqsrOZVA">livestream conversation on YouTube</a> with independent AI researcher <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a> that will explore the impact and fallout of the 2023 fiasco.

              <![CDATA[<p>Mazda won itself a lot of fans over the years with the sharp styling and attention to detail of its engaging-to-drive vehicles. But in recent years its cars have been left behind by rivals when it comes to fuel efficiency. As a small automaker facing daunting development costs, it decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/toyota-and-mazda-join-forces-to-built-1-6-billion-factory-in-the-us/">partner</a> with Toyota on advanced technologies, including a battery electric vehicle <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/mazda-not-ready-to-bet-on-evs-but-says-more-plug-ins-for-the-us-market/">due by 2027</a>. A more immediate benefit has been access to Toyota's hybrid powertrains, one of which can now be found inside the $33,970 2025 Mazda CX-50 Hybrid, which we've driven ahead of it going on sale this month.</p>
<h2>Engineering stuff</h2>
<p>Open the hood, and instead of one of Mazda's Skyactiv engines, you find one of Toyota's 2.5 L naturally aspirated Atkinson cycle engines, which drives the front wheels together with two electric motors (one is really the integrated starter motor) via a continuously variable transmission. At the rear, a third electric motor powers the rear wheels when necessary. The front traction motor provides 118 hp (88 kW), the rear motor can add an extra 54 hp (40 kW), and total output is rated at 219 hp (163 kW) and 163 ft-lb (220 Nm).</p>

<p>It wasn't exactly a case of shoehorning the new powertrain into the CX-50, but Mazda has had to modify the front frame rails to fit the new engine, transmission, and hybrid motors, and there's a new rear subframe with the rear eAxle, as well as the 0.9 kWh hybrid traction battery, which lives under the rear seat. (This improves the front-rear weight distribution to 55:45, Mazda says.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/mazda-gives-the-2025-cx-50-a-big-efficiency-boost-to-38-mpg-with-hybrid-power/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Cadillac has another new electric vehicle on the way. It's the 2026 Vistiq, a three-row SUV that fills the gap in the American automaker's lineup. It will be the fifth Cadillac to use what <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/general-motors-is-ditching-ultium-branding-for-its-ev-batteries/">until now</a> has been called the Ultium battery platform.</p>
<p>Although parent company General Motors has caught <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/after-ditching-its-hybrids-gm-says-it-needs-to-build-more-hybrids/">a case of EV regret</a> this year, it has also ironed out the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/general-motors-is-still-struggling-with-new-evs-data-show/">problem</a> it encountered when assembling battery cells into packs and expects to sell at least 200,000 EVs this year. Cadillac's Ultium journey began with the midsize <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-cadillac-lyriq-a-bug-free-ev-with-carplay-thats-still-a-bit-bland/">Lyriq</a>, which has since been joined by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/this-is-cadillacs-new-entry-level-ev-the-54000-optiq-crossover/">the compact Optiq</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/cadillacs-electric-flagship-will-be-hand-built-use-extensive-3d-printing/">hand-built, highly exclusive Celestiq</a>, and imminently, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/cadillac-reveals-the-2025-escalade-iq-one-excessive-ev/">the Escalade IQ</a>, which rivals the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/driving-the-biggest-least-efficient-electric-car-the-hummer-ev-suv/">Hummer EV</a> in weight as a result of its whopping 450-mile range.</p>

<p>The $77,395 Vistiq drops in between the Lyriq and Escalade IQ, filling the same niche—but electric—as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/the-2020-cadillac-xt6-better-than-an-escalade-in-every-way/">the XT6</a> does in the gas-powered lineup.

<p>In orbit, the astronauts aborted two spacewalks, both under unusual circumstances. Then, on October 25, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/astronaut-hospitalized-after-returning-from-235-day-space-mission/">one of the astronauts was hospitalized</a> due to what NASA called an unspecified "medical issue" after splashdown aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that concluded the 235-day mission. After an overnight stay in a hospital in Florida, NASA said the astronaut was released "in good health" and returned to their home base in Houston to resume normal post-flight activities.</p>
<p>The space agency did not identify the astronaut or any details about their condition, citing medical privacy concerns. The three NASA astronauts on the Dragon spacecraft included commander Matthew Dominick, pilot Michael Barratt, and mission specialist Jeanette Epps. Russian cosmonaut <span class="normaltextrun">Alexander Grebenkin accompanied the three NASA crew members. Russia's space agency confirmed he was not hospitalized after returning to Earth.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/there-are-some-things-the-crew-8-astronauts-arent-ready-to-talk-about/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The bankruptcy estate of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX has sued the company's former rival Binance in an attempt to recover $1.76 billion or more. The lawsuit seeks "at least $1.76 billion that was fraudulently transferred to Binance and its executives at the FTX creditors' expense, as well as compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.194820/gov.uscourts.deb.194820.1.0_1.pdf">complaint</a> filed yesterday in US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware names Binance and co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao among the defendants. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried sold 20 percent of his crypto exchange to Binance in November 2019, but Binance exited that investment in 2021, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>"As Zhao would later remark, he decided to exit his position in FTX because of personal grievances he had against Bankman-Fried," the lawsuit said. "In July 2021, the parties negotiated a deal whereby FTX bought back Binance's and its executives' entire stakes in both FTX Trading and [parent company] WRS. Pursuant to that deal, FTX's Alameda Research division directly funded the share repurchase with a combination of FTT (FTX's exchange token), BNB (Binance's exchange token), and BUSD (Binance's dollar-pegged stablecoin). In the aggregate, those tokens had a fair market value of at least $1.76 billion."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ftx-sues-binance-for-1-76b-in-battle-of-crypto-exchanges-founded-by-convicts/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Anthropic's new hire is preparing for a future where advanced AI models may experience suffering.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, Anthropic quietly hired its first dedicated "AI welfare" researcher, Kyle Fish, to explore whether future AI models might deserve moral consideration and protection, reports AI newsletter <a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/anthropic-ai-welfare-researcher">Transformer</a>. While sentience in AI models is an extremely controversial and contentious topic, the hire could signal a shift toward AI companies examining ethical questions about the consciousness and rights of AI systems.</p>
<p>Fish joined Anthropic's alignment science team in September to develop guidelines for how Anthropic and other companies should approach the issue. The news follows a <a href="https://eleosai.org/papers/20241030_Taking_AI_Welfare_Seriously_web.pdf">major report co-authored</a> by Fish before he landed his Anthropic role. Titled "Taking AI Welfare Seriously," the paper warns that AI models could soon develop consciousness or agency—traits that some might consider requirements for moral consideration. But the authors do not say that AI consciousness is a guaranteed future development.</p>
<p>"To be clear, our argument in this report is not that AI systems definitely are—or will be—conscious, robustly agentic, or otherwise morally significant," the paper reads. "Instead, our argument is that there is substantial uncertainty about these possibilities, and so we need to improve our understanding of AI welfare and our ability to make wise decisions about this issue. Otherwise there is a significant risk that we will mishandle decisions about AI welfare, mistakenly harming AI systems that matter morally and/or mistakenly caring for AI systems that do not."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/anthropic-hires-its-first-ai-welfare-researcher/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Late last week, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdal/pr/nigerian-national-sentenced-ten-years-20-million-cyber-fraud-scheme">confirmed</a> that 33-year-old Babatunde Francis Ayeni pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud through "a sophisticated business email compromise scheme targeting real estate transactions" in the US.</p>
<p>To seize large down payments on homes, Ayeni and co-conspirators sent phishing emails to US title companies, real estate agents, and real estate attorneys. When unsuspecting employees clicked malicious attachments and links, a prompt appeared asking for login information that was then shared with the hackers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/hacker-gets-10-years-for-stealing-20m-in-home-buyers-down-payments/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like a lot of competitors in the global launch industry, Russia for a long time dismissed the prospects of a reusable first stage for a rocket.</p>
<p>As late as 2016, an official with the Russian agency that develops strategy for the country's main space corporation, Roscosmos, <a href="https://tass.com/science/853567">concluded</a>, "The economic feasibility of reusable launch systems is not obvious." In the dismissal of the landing prospects of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, Russian officials were not alone. Throughout the 2010s, competitors including space agencies in Europe and Japan, and US-based United Launch Alliance, all decided to develop expendable rockets.</p>
<p>However, by 2017, when SpaceX re-flew a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time, the writing was on the wall. "This is a very important step, we sincerely congratulate our colleague on this achievement," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/after-spacex-launch-russia-now-says-it-is-interested-in-reusable-rockets/">then-Roscosmos CEO Igor Komarov said</a> at the time. He even spoke of developing reusable components, such as rocket engines capable of multiple firings.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/russia-fine-i-guess-we-should-have-a-grasshopper-rocket-project-too/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>During my first semester as a computer science graduate student at Princeton, I took <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall08/cos402/schedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">COS 402: Artificial Intelligence</a>. Toward the end of the semester, there was a lecture about neural networks. This was in the fall of 2008, and I got the distinct impression—both from that lecture and the textbook—that neural networks had become a backwater.</p>
<p>Neural networks had delivered some impressive results in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But then progress stalled. By 2008, many researchers had moved on to mathematically elegant approaches such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">support vector machines</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t know it at the time, but a team at Princeton—in the same computer science building where I was attending lectures—was working on a project that would upend the conventional wisdom and demonstrate the power of neural networks. That team, led by Prof. Fei-Fei Li, wasn’t working on a better version of neural networks. They were hardly thinking about neural networks at all.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/how-a-stubborn-computer-scientist-accidentally-launched-the-deep-learning-boom/">Read full article</a></p>
