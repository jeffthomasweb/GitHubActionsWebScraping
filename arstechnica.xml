                            <![CDATA[<p>The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed Sunday that it is investigating an airliner that was struck by an object in its windscreen, mid-flight, over Utah.</p>
<p>“NTSB gathering radar, weather, flight recorder data,” the federal agency said on the <a href="https://x.com/ntsb_newsroom/status/1979962245703483461?s=43">social media site X</a>. “Windscreen being sent to NTSB laboratories for examination.”</p>
<p>The strike occurred Thursday, during a United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles. <a href="https://x.com/xJonNYC/status/1979220753380683943">Images shared on social media</a> showed that one of the two large windows at the front of a 737 MAX aircraft was significantly cracked. Related images also reveal a pilot’s arm that has been cut multiple times by what appear to be small shards of glass.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/something-from-space-may-have-just-struck-a-united-airlines-flight-over-utah/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>Even in my youth, I always loved the idea of point-and-click adventure games more than I did the reality. I appreciated how they transported me to other worlds, each with its own rules, histories, and interesting characters. However, like many people, I often ran up against the harsh reality of solving bizarre and obtuse puzzles in a time before Internet walkthroughs.</p>
<p>I almost never actually finished point-and-click adventure games for that reason—but there is one major exception: I completed Roberta Williams’ <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe_colonels_bequest"><em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em></a> several times.</p>
<p>One of the last Sierra adventure games to still use a text parser, <em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em> follows a young woman named Laura Bow as she visits a mansion in the Southern US belonging to her college friend’s grandfather, Colonel Henri Dijon. While she’s there, a dispute breaks out over the colonel’s will, and it becomes clear a murderer is on the loose.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/roberta-williams-the-colonels-bequest-was-a-different-type-of-adventure-game/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, the Trump administration made nine elite universities <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">an offer they couldn’t refuse</a>: bring in more conservatives while shutting down “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” give up control of admissions and hiring decisions, agree to “biological” definitions of sex and gender, don’t raise tuition for five years, clamp down on student protests, and stay institutionally “neutral” on current events. Do this and you won’t be cut off from “federal benefits,” which could include research funding, student loans, federal contracts, and even student and faculty immigration visas. Instead, you may gain “substantial and meaningful federal grants.”</p>
<p>But the universities <em>are</em> refusing. With the initial deadline of October 20 approaching, four of the nine universities—the <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/announcements/update-penns-response-compact-academic-excellence">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5557914-brown-university-rejects-trump-compact/">Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-16/usc-rejects-trump-education-compact">University of Southern California</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/mit-rejects-white-house-compact.html">MIT</a>—that received the federal “compact” have announced that they will not sign it.</p>
<p>In addition, the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,600 colleges and universities, today <a href="https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Statement-Trump-Administration-Compact.aspx">issued a statement</a> calling for the compact to be completely withdrawn.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/with-deadline-looming-4-of-9-universities-reject-trumps-compact-to-remake-higher-ed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Law enforcement agencies will soon have easier access to footage captured by Amazon’s Ring smart cameras. In a partnership announced this week, Amazon will allow approximately 5,000 local law enforcement agencies to request access to Ring camera footage via surveillance platforms from <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/">Flock Safety</a>. Ring cooperating with law enforcement and the reported use of Flock technologies by federal agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has resurfaced privacy concerns that have followed the devices for years.</p>
<p>According to Flock’s announcement, its Ring partnership allows local law enforcement members to use Flock software “to send a direct post in the Ring Neighbors app with details about the investigation and request voluntary assistance.” Requests must include “specific location and timeframe of the incident, a unique investigation code, and details about what is being investigated,” and users can look at the requests anonymously, Flock said.</p>
<p>“Any footage a Ring customer chooses to submit will be securely packaged by Flock and shared directly with the requesting local public safety agency through the FlockOS or Flock Nova platform,” the announcement reads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/ring-cameras-are-about-to-get-increasingly-chummy-with-law-enforcement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 1890, a German scientist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Koch">Robert Koch</a> thought he’d invented a cure for tuberculosis, a substance derived from the infecting bacterium itself that he dubbed Tuberculin. His substance didn’t actually cure anyone, but it was eventually widely used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin">diagnostic skin test</a>. Koch’s successful failure is just one of the many colorful cases featured in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Ends-Failures-Sparked-Medical/dp/1547615028"><em>Dead Ends! Flukes, Flops, and Failures</em> <em>that Sparked Medical Marvels</em></a>, a new nonfiction illustrated children’s book by science historian Lindsey Fitzharris and her husband, cartoonist Adrian Teal.</p>
<p>A noted science communicator with a fondness for the medically macabre, Fitzharris published a biography of surgical pioneer Joseph Lister, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374117292/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=0&amp;imprToken=26c0af77-ed11-8f74-19c&amp;tag=arstech20-20" rel="nofollow" data-orig-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374117292/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=0&amp;imprToken=26c0af77-ed11-8f74-19c&amp;tag=arstech20-20" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-uri="ad6f0422bfaaccb498271fe8ac321b3d" data-xid="fr1760646290574dbd"><em>The Butchering Art</em></a>, in 2017—a great, if occasionally grisly, read. She followed up with 2022’s  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facemaker-Visionary-Surgeons-Disfigured-Soldiers/dp/0374282307"><em>The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon’s Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I</em></a>, about a WWI surgeon named Harold Gillies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/meet-harold-gillies-the-wwi-surgeon-who-rebuilt-the-faces-of-injured-soldiers/">who rebuilt</a> the faces of injured soldiers.</p>
<p>And in 2020, she hosted a documentary for the Smithsonian Channel, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/famous-strange-demises-get-a-second-look-in-the-curious-life-and-death-of/"><em>The Curious Life and Death Of</em></a>…, exploring famous deaths, ranging from drug lord Pablo Escobar to magician Harry Houdini. Fitzharris performed virtual autopsies, experimented with blood samples, interviewed witnesses, and conducted real-time demonstrations in hopes of gleaning fresh insights. For his part, Teal is a well-known caricaturist and illustrator, best known for his work on the British TV series <em>Spitting Image</em>. His work has also appeared in The Guardian and the Sunday Telegraph, among other outlets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/dead-ends-is-a-fun-macabre-medical-history-for-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Texas is being sued by a Big Tech lobby group over the state’s new law that will require app stores to verify users’ ages and impose restrictions on users under 18.</p>
<p>“The Texas App Store Accountability Act imposes a broad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps,” the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said yesterday in a <a href="https://ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dkt.-1-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a>. “In a misguided attempt to protect minors, Texas has decided to require proof of age before anyone with a smartphone or tablet can download an app. Anyone under 18 must obtain parental consent for every app and in-app purchase they try to download—from ebooks to email to entertainment.”</p>
<p>The CCIA said in a <a href="https://ccianet.org/news/2025/10/ccia-sues-texas-to-block-unconstitutional-app-store-law/">press release</a> that the law violates the First Amendment by imposing “a sweeping age-verification, parental consent, and compelled speech regime on both app stores and app developers.” When app stores determine that a user is under 18, “the law prohibits them from downloading virtually all apps and software programs and from making any in-app purchases unless their parent consents and is given control over the minor’s account,” the CCIA said. “Minors who are unable to link their accounts with a parent’s or guardian’s, or who do not receive permission, would be prohibited from accessing app store content.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/big-tech-sues-texas-says-age-verification-law-is-broad-censorship-regime/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In her <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jane-Doe-v-ClothOff-Telegram-Complaint-10-16-25.pdf">complaint</a>, the teen—who was granted anonymity as a 17-year-old minor—accused ClothOff of intentionally making it easy to generate and distribute child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), as well as nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) of adults. She also alleged that the social media network Telegram helps promote ClothOff through automated bots that have attracted hundreds of thousands of subscribers.</p>
<p>ClothOff’s operation, the teen alleged, goes beyond promoting a single app, which can be used for free to turn an ordinary Instagram photo into CSAM or NCII in “three clicks.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/teen-haunted-by-fake-nudes-sues-to-kill-nudify-app-block-telegram-bots/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The late-night transfer covered about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from one facility to another at the Florida spaceport. NASA and its contractors are continuing preparations for the Artemis II mission after the White House approved the program as an exception to work through the ongoing government shutdown, which began on October 1.</p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Backblaze is a backup and cloud storage company that has been tracking the annualized failure rates (AFRs) of the hard drives in its datacenter since 2013. As you can imagine, that’s netted the firm a lot of data. And that data has led the company to conclude that HDDs “are lasting longer” and showing fewer errors.</p>
<p>That conclusion came from a <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/">blog post</a> this week by Stephanie Doyle, Backblaze’s writer and blog operations specialist, and Pat Patterson, Backblaze’s chief technical evangelist. The authors compared the AFRs for the approximately 317,230 drives in Backblaze’s datacenter to the AFRs the company recorded when examining the 21,195 drives it had <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/10-stories-from-10-years-of-drive-stats-data/">in 2013</a> and 206,928 drives <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-2021/">in 2021</a>. Doyle and Patterson said they identified “a pretty solid deviation in both age of drive failure and the high point of AFR from the last two times we’ve run the analyses.”</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Our hominid ancestors faced a Pleistocene world full of dangers—and apparently one of those dangers was lead poisoning.</p>
<p>Lead exposure sounds like a modern problem, at least if you define “modern” the way a paleoanthropologist might: a time that started a few thousand years ago with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/greenland-ice-cores-track-roman-lead-pollution-in-year-by-year-detail/">ancient Roman silver smelting</a> and lead pipes. According to a recent study, however, lead is a much more ancient nemesis, one that predates not just the Romans but the existence of our genus <i>Homo</i>. Paleoanthropologist Renaud Joannes-Boyau of Australia’s Southern Cross University and his colleagues found evidence of exposure to dangerous amounts of lead in the teeth of fossil apes and hominins dating back almost 2 million years. And somewhat controversially, they suggest that the toxic element’s pervasiveness may have helped shape our evolutionary history.</p>

<h2>The Romans didn’t invent lead poisoning</h2>
<p>Joannes-Boyau and his colleagues took tiny samples of preserved enamel and dentin from the teeth of 51 fossils. In most of those teeth, the paleoanthropologists found evidence that these apes and hominins had been exposed to lead—sometimes in dangerous quantities—fairly often during their early years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/hominins-suffered-lead-poisoning-starting-at-least-2-million-years-ago/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The United States Grand Prix takes place this weekend at the Circuit of the Americas in Texas, and this morning, Formula 1 used the occasion to announce a new broadcast deal for the sport in the US. Starting next year, F1 will no longer be broadcast on ESPN—it’s moving to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/10/apple-tv-streaming-service-is-renamed-to-just-apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> in a five-year, $750 million deal.</p>
<p>Apple boss Tim Cook <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1mnf9x1/tim_cook_the_worst_checkered_flag_waver_in_f1s/">has been seen</a> at F1 races in the past, and earlier this year, Apple released <em>F1: The Movie</em>, starring Brad Pitt as a 50-something racing driver who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/f1-the-movie-takes-motorsport-into-the-imax-age/">improbably gets a second bite at the cherry</a> 30 years after a brutal crash seemingly ended his F1 career.</p>
<p>But securing the rights to the sport itself means Apple has snagged a very fast-growing series, with races almost every other week—currently, the sport has expanded to 24 races a year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/apple-pays-750-million-for-us-formula-1-streaming-coverage/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The car world has long had a thing about numbers. Engine outputs. Top speeds. Zero-to-60 times. Displacement. But the numbers go beyond bench racing specs. Some cars have numbers for names, and few more memorably than Porsche. Its most famous model shares its appellation with the emergency services here in North America; although the car should accurately be “nine-11,” you call it “nine-one-one.”</p>
<p>Some numbers are less well-known, but perhaps more special to Porsche’s fans, especially those who like racing. 908. 917. 956. 962. 919. But how about 963?</p>
<p>That’s Porsche’s current sports prototype, a 670-hp (500 kW) hybrid that for the last three years has battled against rivals in what is starting to look like, if not a golden era for endurance racing, then at least a very purple patch. And the 963 has done well, racing here in IMSA’s WeatherTech Sportscar Championship and around the globe in the FIA World Endurance Championship.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/3-years-4-championships-but-0-le-mans-wins-assessing-the-porsche-963/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When teachers rely on commonly used artificial intelligence chatbots to devise lesson plans, it does not result in more engaging, immersive, or effective learning experiences compared with existing techniques, we found in our <a href="https://citejournal.org/proofing/civic-education-in-the-age-of-ai-should-we-trust-ai-generated-lesson-plans/">recent study</a>. The AI-generated civics lesson plans we analyzed also left out opportunities for students to explore the stories and experiences of traditionally marginalized people.</p>
<p>The allure of generative AI as a teaching aid has caught the attention of educators. A Gallup survey from September 2025 found that <a href="https://www.gallup.com/analytics/659819/k-12-teacher-research.aspx">60 percent of K-12 teachers are already using AI in their work</a>, with the most common reported use being teaching preparation and lesson planning.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.15 of the Rocket Report! This year has been, at best, one of mixed results for SpaceX’s Starship program. There have been important steps forward, including the successful reuse of the rocket’s massive Super Heavy booster. Clearly, SpaceX is getting really good at launching and recovering the 33-engine booster stage. But Starship itself, part spacecraft and part upper stage, hasn’t fared as well<span class="s1">—at </span>least it hadn’t until the last couple of months. After four Starships were destroyed in flight and on the ground in the first half of 2025, the last two missions ended with pinpoint splashdowns in the Indian Ocean. The most recent mission this week was arguably the most successful yet for Starship, which returned to Earth with little damage, suggesting SpaceX’s improvements to the heat shield are working.</p>

<p><b>SpaceX vet will fly with Blue Origin. </b>Hans Koenigsmann is one of SpaceX’s earliest, longest-tenured, and most-revered employees. He worked at Elon Musk’s space company for nearly two decades, rising to the role of vice president for mission assurance and safety before leaving SpaceX in 2021. He led the investigations into every Falcon rocket failure, mentored young engineers, and became a public face for SpaceX through numerous presentations and press conferences. And now he has announced he is going to space on a future suborbital flight on Blue Origin’s New Shepard vehicle, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/one-of-spacexs-earliest-employees-is-going-to-space-via-blue-origin/">Ars reports</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/rocket-report-a-nearly-perfect-flight-for-starship-chinas-surprise-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>We all feel it: Our once-happy digital spaces have become increasingly less user-friendly and more toxic, cluttered with extras nobody asked for and hardly anybody wants. There’s even a word for it: “enshittification,” named 2023 Word of the Year by the American Dialect Society. The term was coined by tech journalist/science fiction author <a href="https://craphound.com">Cory Doctorow</a>, a longtime advocate of digital rights. Doctorow has spun his analysis of what’s been ailing the tech industry into an eminently readable new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374619328"><em>Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What To Do About It</em></a>.</p>
<p>As Doctorow tells it, he was on vacation in Puerto Rico, staying in a remote cabin nestled in a cloud forest with microwave Internet service—i.e., very bad Internet service, since microwave signals struggle to penetrate through clouds. It was a 90-minute drive to town, but when they tried to consult TripAdvisor for good local places to have dinner one night, they couldn’t get the site to load. “All you would get is the little TripAdvisor logo as an SVG filling your whole tab and nothing else,” Doctorow told Ars. “So I tweeted, ‘Has anyone at TripAdvisor ever been on a trip? This is the most enshittified website I’ve ever used.'”</p>
<p>Initially, he just got a few “haha, that’s a funny word” responses. “It was when I married that to this technical critique, at a moment when things were quite visibly bad to a much larger group of people, that made it take off,” Doctorow said. “I didn’t deliberately set out to do it. I bought a million lottery tickets and one of them won the lottery. It only took two decades.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/yes-everything-online-sucks-now-but-it-doesnt-have-to/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A prominent voice in the Make America Healthy Again movement is pushing for health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to make the topic of chemtrail conspiracy theories a federal priority, according to a report by KFF News.</p>
<p><a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/MAHA-Memo-Armour-Delany-Means.pdf">KFF obtained a memo</a>, written by MAHA influencer Gray Delany in July, presenting the topic to Calley Means, a White House health advisor. The memo lays out a series of unsubstantiated and far-fetched claims that academic researchers and federal agencies are secretively spreading toxic substances from airplanes, poisoning Americans, and spurring large-scale weather events, such as the devastating flooding in Texas last summer.</p>
<p>“It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation’s citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany writes in the memo.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/rfk-jr-s-maha-wants-to-make-chemtrail-conspiracy-theories-great-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Like virtually every major Windows announcement in the last three years, the spate of features that Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/10/16/making-every-windows-11-pc-an-ai-pc/">announced for the operating system today</a> all revolve around generative AI. In particular, they’re concerned with the company’s more recent preoccupation with “agentic” AI, an industry buzzword for “telling AI-powered software to perform a task, which it then does in the background while you move on to other things.”</p>
<p>But the overarching impression I got, both from reading the announcement and sitting through a press briefing earlier this month, is that Microsoft is using language models and other generative AI technologies to try again with Cortana, Microsoft’s failed and discontinued entry in the voice assistant wars of the 2010s.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft’s Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi, “AI PCs” should be able to recognize input “naturally, in text or voice,” to be able to guide users based on what’s on their screens at any given moment, and that AI assistants “should be able to take action on your behalf.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsofts-vision-for-ai-pcs-looks-a-lot-like-another-crack-at-cortana/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hacking groups—at least one of which works on behalf of the North Korean government—have found a new and inexpensive way to distribute malware from “bulletproof” hosts: stashing them on public cryptocurrency blockchains.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/dprk-adopts-etherhiding/">Thursday post</a>, members of the Google Threat Intelligence Group said the technique provides the hackers with their own “bulletproof” host, a term that describes cloud platforms that are largely immune from takedowns by law enforcement and pressure from security researchers. More traditionally, these hosts are located in countries without treaties agreeing to enforce criminal laws from the US and other nations. These services often charge hefty sums and cater to criminals spreading malware or peddling child sexual abuse material and wares sold in crime-based flea markets.</p>
<h2>Next-gen, DIY hosting that can’t be tampered with</h2>
<p>Since February, Google researchers have observed two groups turning to a newer technique to infect targets with credential stealers and other forms of malware. The method, known as EtherHiding, embeds the malware in smart contracts, which are essentially apps that reside on blockchains for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Two or more parties then enter into an agreement spelled out in the contract. When certain conditions are met, the apps enforce the contract terms in a way that, at least theoretically, is immutable and independent of any central authority.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/hackers-bullet-proof-hosts-deliver-malware-from-blockchains/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday of last week, Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ars-live-is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-pop-ed-zitron-is-on-with-ars-at-330pm-edt-today/">hosted</a> a live conversation with Ed Zitron, host of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/better-offline/id1730587238">Better Offline</a> podcast and one of tech’s most vocal AI critics, to discuss whether the generative AI industry is experiencing a bubble and when it might burst. My Internet connection had other plans, though, dropping out multiple times and forcing Ars Technica’s Lee Hutchinson to jump in as an excellent emergency backup host.</p>
<p>During the times my connection cooperated, Zitron and I covered OpenAI’s financial issues, lofty infrastructure promises, and why the AI hype machine keeps rolling despite some arguably shaky economics underneath. Lee’s probing questions about per-user costs revealed a potential flaw in AI subscription models: Companies can’t predict whether a user will cost them $2 or $10,000 per month.</p>
