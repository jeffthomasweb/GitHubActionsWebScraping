                            <![CDATA[<p>A Russian intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fired from an underground silo on the country’s southern steppe Friday on a scheduled test to deliver a dummy warhead to a remote impact zone nearly 4,000 miles away. The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet.</p>
<p>Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border.</p>
<p>A video posted by the <a href="https://t.me/militaryrussiaru/39856">Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram</a> and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/the-missile-meant-to-strike-fear-in-russias-enemies-fails-once-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Supreme Court justices expressed numerous concerns today in a case that could determine whether Internet service providers must terminate the accounts of broadband users accused of copyright infringement. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-171_4gd5.pdf">Oral arguments</a> were held in the case between cable Internet provider Cox Communications and record labels led by Sony.</p>
<p>Some justices were skeptical of arguments that ISPs should have no legal obligation under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to terminate an account when a user’s IP address has been repeatedly flagged for downloading pirated music. But justices also seemed hesitant to rule in favor of record labels, with some of the debate focusing on how ISPs should handle large accounts like universities where there could be tens of thousands of users.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor chided Cox for not doing more to fight infringement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/supreme-court-debates-whether-isps-must-kick-pirates-off-the-internet/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI may soon be forced to explain why it deleted a pair of controversial datasets composed of pirated books, and the stakes could not be higher.</p>
<p>At the heart of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/book-authors-sue-openai-and-meta-over-text-used-to-train-ai/">class-action lawsuit from authors</a> alleging that ChatGPT was illegally trained on their works, OpenAI’s decision to delete the datasets could end up being a deciding factor that gives the authors the win.</p>
<p>It’s undisputed that OpenAI deleted the datasets, known as “Books 1” and “Books 2,” prior to ChatGPT’s release in 2022. Created by former OpenAI employees in 2021, the datasets were built by scraping the open web and seizing the bulk of its data from a shadow library called Library Genesis (LibGen).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-desperate-to-avoid-explaining-why-it-deleted-pirated-book-datasets/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="bolded">n early 2025,</span> Sian traveled deep into the mountains of Shan State, on Myanmar’s eastern border with China, in search of work. He had heard from a friend that Chinese companies were recruiting at new rare-earth mining sites in territory administered by the United Wa State Army, Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed group, and that workers could earn upwards of $1,400 a month.</p>
<p>It was an opportunity too good to pass up in a country where the formal economy has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1163706">collapsed</a> since the 2021 military coup, and <a href="https://www.undp.org/press-releases/middle-class-disappearing-and-poverty-deepening-myanmar">nearly half</a> of the population lives on less than $2 a day. So Sian set off by car for the town of Mong Pawk, then rode a motorbike for hours through the thick forest.</p>
<p>Hired for daily wages of approximately $21, he now digs boreholes and installs pipes. It is the first step in a <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/schoolforcross-facultystudies/research/projects/rare_earth_mining_myanmar/briefing_paper_2_the_rare_earth_mining_process_in_myanmar.pdf">process</a> called in situ<em> </em>leaching, which involves injecting acidic solutions into mountainsides, then collecting the drained solution in plastic-lined pools where solids, like dysprosium and terbium, two of the world’s most sought-after heavy rare-earth metals, settle out. The resulting sediment sludge is then transported to furnaces and burned, producing dry rare earth oxides.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/in-myanmar-illicit-rare-earth-mining-is-taking-a-heavy-toll/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s been over 10 years since the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-hunting-fiends-for-fun-and-forever/">the excellent <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a>, and nearly four years since <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/42167/a-new-saga-begins">the announcement</a> of “the next installment in The Witcher series of video games.” Despite those long waits, developer CD Projekt Red is still insisting it will deliver the next three complete <em>Witcher</em> games in a short six-year window.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">a recent earnings call</a>, CDPR VP of Business Development Michał Nowakowski suggested that a rapid release schedule would be enabled in no small part by the team’s transition away from its proprietary REDEngine to the popular Unreal Engine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/the-witcher-will-return-as-a-triple-a-rpg-shifting-to-unreal-engine-5/">in 2022</a>. At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/cd-projekt-red-offers-refunds-to-unsatisfied-cyberpunk-2077-console-players/">widespread technical issues with the console versions of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, which CDPR later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/cdpr-ceo-blames-in-game-streaming-for-cyberpunks-console-problems/">blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.”</a></p>
<p>“We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [<em>The Witcher 4</em>] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call. “In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time—as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between <em>TW4</em> and <em>TW5</em>, between <em>TW5</em> and <em>TW6</em> and so on.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-a-witcher-free-decade-cdpr-still-promises-three-sequels-in-six-years/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I can take or leave some of the things that Microsoft is doing with Windows 11 these days, but I do usually enjoy the company’s yearly limited-time holiday sweater releases. Usually crafted around a specific image or product from the company’s ’90s-and-early-2000s heyday—2022’s sweater was Clippy themed, and 2023’s was just the Windows XP Bliss wallpaper in sweater form—the sweaters usually hit the exact combination of dorky/cute/recognizable that makes for a good holiday party conversation starter.</p>
<p>Microsoft is reviving the tradition for 2025 after taking a year off, and <a href="https://www.microsoftmerchandise.com/Shop/#/product/What's+New/MIC060639.000001-Artifact-Sweater--Pre-Order--Multi-XS">the design for this year’s flagship $80 sweater</a> is mostly in line with what the company has done in past years. The 2025 “Artifact Holiday Sweater” revives multiple pixelated icons that Windows 3.1-to-XP users will recognize, including Notepad, Reversi, Paint, MS-DOS, Internet Explorer, and even the MSN butterfly logo. Clippy is, once again, front and center, looking happy to be included.</p>
<p>Not all of the icons are from Microsoft’s past; a sunglasses-wearing emoji, a “50” in the style of the old flying Windows icon (for Microsoft’s 50th anniversary), and a <em>Minecraft</em> Creeper face all nod to the company’s more modern products. But the only one I really take <em>issue</em> with is on the right sleeve, where Microsoft has stuck a pixelated monochrome icon for its Copilot AI assistant.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/even-microsofts-retro-holiday-sweaters-are-having-copilot-forced-upon-them/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s a critical time for companies competing to develop a commercial successor to the International Space Station. NASA is working with several companies, including Axiom Space, Voyager Technologies, Blue Origin, and Vast, to develop concepts for private stations where it can lease time for its astronauts.</p>
<p>The space agency awarded Phase One contracts several years ago and is now in the final stages of writing requirements for Phase Two after <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/leo-economy/nasa-seeks-industry-input-on-next-phase-of-commercial-space-stations/">asking for feedback</a> from industry partners in September. This program is known as Commercial LEO Destinations, or CLDs in industry parlance.</p>
<p>Time is running out for NASA if it wants to establish continuity from the International Space Station, which will reach its end of life in 2030, with a follow-on station ready to go before then.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/space-ceo-explains-why-he-believes-private-space-stations-are-a-viable-business/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Have you been trying to cast <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/netflix-drops-a-doozy-of-a-trailer-for-stranger-things-s5/"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> from your phone, only to find that your TV isn’t cooperating? It’s not the TV—Netflix is to blame for this one, and it’s intentional. The streaming app has recently updated its support for Google Cast to disable the feature in most situations. You’ll need to pay for one of the company’s more expensive plans, and even then, Netflix will only cast to older TVs and streaming dongles.</p>
<p>The Google Cast system began appearing in apps shortly after the original Chromecast launched in 2013. Since then, Netflix users have been able to start video streams on TVs and streaming boxes from the mobile app. That was vital for streaming targets without their own remote or on-screen interface, but times change.</p>
<p>Today, Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/google-kills-chromecast-replaces-it-with-apple-tv-and-roku-ultra-competitor/">moved beyond the remote-free Chromecast experience</a>, and most TVs have their own standalone Netflix apps. Netflix itself is also allergic to anything that would allow people to share passwords or watch in a new place. Over the last couple of weeks, Netflix updated its app to remove most casting options, mirroring a change in 2019 to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/netflix-ends-airplay-support-on-ios-in-an-ongoing-souring-of-its-apple-relationship/">kill Apple AirPlay</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/netflix-quietly-drops-support-for-casting-to-most-tvs/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>After our celebration of Prime Day earlier in the year, last Friday we all somberly marked <a href="https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2025/11/here-are-the-best-black-friday-deals-we-can-find/">the passage of Black Friday</a>, the day where we commemorate the passing of the great Optimus Prime during his apocalyptic battle with that foulest and most deceptive of Decepticons, Megatron (may his name and his energon both be forever cursed). But then, as everyone knows, just as our darkest hour seemed finally at hand, Optimus Prime was resurrected from death and returned to us! The long-ago Monday when this unprecedented event occurred was the day hope returned—the day everyone, human and machine alike, was united in joy. It truly was a Monday for all of Cybertron—a “Cyber Monday,” if you will.</p>
<p>Today in 2025, we pause to recall how the power of the AllSpark and the collective wisdom of the Primes has torn the veil of death, shattering the barrier between the living world and the world beyond—and through that power, Optimus Prime now walks among us again and it’s not weird at all! (Though I think there also might have been, like, <a href="https://rq87.flyingomelette.com/RQ/C/TF/95/95.html">some spores or something</a>? I dunno, it was a long time ago.) To show our joy at the greatest transformer’s return as he takes back up the mantle of Autobot leadership from Rodimus Prime—who, let’s face it, kind of sucked anyway—it is time to do what we did on Black Friday but even harder: it is time to <em>engage in more celebratory commerce!</em></p>
<p>Below you’ll find a short curated list of the best deals we could find for Cyber Monday. The pricing is accurate as of the time of posting, and we’ll update the list several times today as things change (keep an eye out for the “Updated” tag near the story’s timestamp). <em>‘Til all are one!</em></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2025/12/here-are-the-best-cyber-monday-deals-we-can-find/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we’ve featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we’re experimenting with a monthly collection. November’s list includes forensic details of the medieval assassination of a Hungarian duke, why woodpeckers grunt when they peck, and more evidence that X’s much-maligned community notes might actually help combat the spread of misinformation after all.</p>

<p>Back in 1915, archaeologists discovered the skeletal remains of a young man in a Dominican monastery on Margaret Island in Budapest, Hungary. The remains were believed to be those of Duke Bela of Masco, grandson of the medieval Hungarian King Bela IV. Per historical records, the young duke was brutally assassinated in 1272 by a rival faction and his mutilated remains were recovered by the duke’s sister and niece and buried in the monastery.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/research-roundup-6-cool-stories-we-almost-missed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you know the name Ron Gilbert, it’s probably for his decades of work on classic point-and-click adventure games like <i>Maniac Mansion</i>, <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/review-return-to-monkey-island-is-must-play-point-and-click-brilliance/">the Monkey Island series</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/thimbleweed-park-review-nostalgic-to-a-fault/"><i>Thimbleweed Park</i></a>. Given that pedigree, October’s release of the Gilbert-designed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3773590/Death_by_Scrolling/"><i>Death by Scrolling</i></a>—a rogue-lite action-survival pseudo-shoot-em-up—might have come as a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>In an interview from his New Zealand home, though, Gilbert noted that his catalog also includes some reflex-based games—<a href="https://www.backyardsports.com/">Humungous Entertainment’s Backyard Sports titles</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/07/its-funny-because-its-poop-ars-reviews-deathspank/">2010’s <em>Deathspank</em></a>, for instance. And Gilbert said his return to action-oriented game design today stemmed from his love for modern classics like <i>Binding of Isaac</i>, <i>Nuclear Throne</i>, and <i>Dead Cells</i>.</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m certainly mostly known for adventure games, and I have done other stuff, [but] it probably is a little bit of a departure for me,” he told Ars. “While I do enjoy playing narrative games as well, it’s not the only thing I enjoy, and just the idea of making one of these kind of started out as a whim.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>Boy, was 1992 a different time for computer games. Epic MegaGames’ <em>Jill of the Jungle</em> illustrates that as well as any other title from the era. Designed and programmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the game was meant to prove that console-style games of the original Nintendo era could work just as well on PCs. (Later, the onus of proof would often be in the reverse direction.)</p>
<p>Also, it had a female protagonist, which Sweeney saw as a notable differentiator at the time. That’s pretty wild to think about in an era of <em>Tomb Raider</em>‘s Lara Croft, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>‘s Aloy, <em>Life is Strange</em>‘s Max Caulfield, <em>Returnal</em>‘s Selene Vassos, <em>Control</em>‘s Jesse Faden, <em>The Last of Us</em>‘ Ellie Williams, and a seemingly endless list of others—to say nothing of the fact that many players of all genders who played the games <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> seem to agree that the female protagonist options in those are more compelling than their male alternatives.</p>
<p>As wacky as it is to remember that the idea of a female character was seen as exceptional at any point (and with the acknowledgement that this game was nonetheless not the first to do that), it’s still neat to see how forward-thinking Sweeney was in many respects—and not just in terms of cultural norms in gaming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/revisiting-jill-of-the-jungle-the-last-game-tim-sweeney-designed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Around the world, some 40 million people are living with HIV. And though progress in treatment means the infection isn’t the death sentence it once was, researchers have never been able to bring about a cure. Instead, HIV-positive people must take a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>But in 2025, researchers reported a breakthrough that suggests that a “functional” cure for HIV—a way to keep HIV under control long-term without constant treatment—may indeed be possible. In two independent trials using infusions of engineered antibodies, some participants remained healthy without taking antiretrovirals, long after the interventions ended.</p>
<p>In one of the trials—the<a href="https://www.natap.org/2025/CROI/croi_33.htm"> FRESH trial</a>, led by virologist Thumbi Ndung’u of the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa—four of 20 participants maintained undetectable levels of HIV for a median of 1.5 years without taking antiretrovirals. In the other, the <a href="https://www.natap.org/2025/CROI/croi_34.htm">RIO trial</a> set in the United Kingdom and Denmark and led by Sarah Fidler, a clinical doctor and HIV research expert at Imperial College London, six of 34 HIV-positive participants have maintained viral control for at least two years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/achieving-lasting-remission-for-hiv/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://t.me/roscosmos_gk/18802">a terse statement</a> issued Thursday night on the social media site Telegram, the Russian space corporation that operates Soyuz appeared to downplay the incident: “The launch pad was inspected, as is done every time a rocket is launched. Damage to several launch pad components was identified. Damage can occur after launch, so such inspections are mandatory worldwide. The launch pad’s condition is currently being assessed.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/russian-launch-pad-incident-raises-concerns-about-future-of-space-station/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier in 2025 we celebrated Prime Day—the yearly veneration of the greatest Transformer of all, Optimus Prime (in fact, Optimus Prime is so revered that we often celebrate Prime Day twice!). But in the fall, as the evenings lengthen and the air turns chill, we pause to remember a much more somber occasion: Black Friday, the day Optimus Prime was cruelly cut down by the treacherous hand of his arch-nemesis Megatron while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVzf6_wUtlg">bravely defending Autobot City from attack</a>. Though Optimus Prime did not survive the brutal fight, the Autobot leader’s indomitable spirit nonetheless carried the day and by his decisive actions the Decepticons were routed, fleeing from the city like the cowardly robots they truly are and giving over victory to the forces of light.</p>
<p>Although Optimus Prime’s death was tragic and unexpected, things are often darkest just before dawn—and so, even though today is called “Black Friday” to remind us of the day’s solemnity, we choose to honor him the way we honor other important historical figures who also laid their lives upon the altar of freedom: we take the day off to go shopping!</p>
<p>Below you’ll find a curated list of the best Black Friday deals that we’ve been able to find. Stand strong in the shadow cast by that long-gone noble Autobot, for by his sacrifice the day was won. Now, as Optimus would say, transform, my friends—<em>transform and buy things</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2025/11/here-are-the-best-black-friday-deals-we-can-find/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When the US Fish and Wildlife Service reintroduced 14 gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park in 1995, the animals were, in some ways, stepping into a new world.</p>
<p>After humans hunted wolves to near-extinction across the Western US in the early 20th century, the carnivore’s absence likely altered ecosystems and food webs across the Rocky Mountains. Once wolves were reintroduced to the landscape, scientists hoped to learn if, and how quickly, these changes could be reversed.</p>
<p>Despite studies claiming to show early evidence of a tantalizing relationship between wolves and regenerating riparian ecosystems since the canines returned to Yellowstone, scientists are still debating how large carnivores impact vegetation and other animals, according to a new <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/ecolsys/56/1/annurev-ecolsys-102722-021139.pdf?expires=1762810414&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=39FA618B0AFFE69D080F20268394148B">paper</a> published this month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/reintroduced-carnivores-impacts-on-ecosystems-are-still-coming-into-focus/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/tiny-vinyl-is-a-new-pocketable-record-format-for-the-spotify-age/">looked at Tiny vinyl</a>, a new miniature vinyl single format developed through a collaboration between a toy industry veteran and the world’s largest vinyl record manufacturer. The 4-inch singles are pressed in a process nearly identical to standard 12-inch LPs or 7-inch singles, except everything is smaller. They have a standard-size spindle hole and play at 33⅓ RPM, and they hold up to four minutes of music per side.</p>
<p>Several smaller bands, like The Band Loula and Rainbow Kitten Surprise, and some industry veterans like Blake Shelton and Melissa Etheridge, have already experimented with the format. But Tiny Vinyl partnered with US retail giant Target for its big coming-out party this fall, with <a href="https://www.target.com/c/tiny-vinyl-music-movies-books/-/N-7f0kq">44 exclusive titles</a> launching throughout the end of this year.</p>
<p>Tiny Vinyl supplied a few promotional copies of releases from former America’s Got Talent finalist Grace VanderWaal, The Band Loula, country pop stars Florida Georgia Line, and jazz legends the Vince Guaraldi Trio so I could get a first-hand look at how the records actually play. I tested these titles as well as several others I picked up at retail, playing them on an Audio Technica LP-120 direct drive manual turntable connected to a Yamaha S-301 integrated amplifier and playing through a pair of vintage Klipsch kg4 speakers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/we-put-the-new-pocket-sized-vinyl-format-to-the-test-with-mixed-results/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Peruse a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_1985">list of films</a> released in 1985 and you’ll notice a surprisingly high number of movies that have become classics in the ensuing 40 years. Sure, there were blockbusters like <em>Back to the Future, The Goonies, Pale Rider, The Breakfast Club</em> and <em>Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome</em>, but there were also critical arthouse favorites like <em>Kiss of the Spider Woman</em> and Akira Kurosawa’s masterpiece, <em>Ran</em>. Since we’re going into a long Thanksgiving weekend, I’ve made a list, in alphabetical order, of some of the quirkier gems from 1985 that have stood the test of time. (Some of the films first premiered at film festivals or in smaller international markets in 1984, but they were released in the US in 1985.)</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below but no major reveals.)</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2509643">a report in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, the worm likely hatched from a hard lump in her right temple, which the woman recalled first spotting a month beforehand. She also noticed that the nodule had vanished just a day before the worm apparently made a squiggly run for her eye.</p>
<p>When she went to an ophthalmologist the next day, doctors immediately noted the “mobile lesion” on her eyelid, which was in the suspicious shape of a bunched-up worm just under her skin with a little redness and swelling.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/doctors-pull-4-inch-worm-out-of-womans-eyelid-after-monthlong-incubation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Around this time last year, officials at United Launch Alliance projected 2025 would be their busiest year ever. Tory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, told reporters the company would launch as many as 20 missions this year, with roughly an even split between the legacy Atlas V launcher and its replacement<span class="s1">—</span>the Vulcan rocket.</p>
<p>Now, it’s likely that ULA will close out 2025 with six flights<span class="s1">—five with the Atlas V and just one with the Vulcan rocket the company is so eager to accelerate into service. Six flights would make</span> 2025 the busiest launch year for ULA since 2022, but it would still fall well short of the company’s forecast.</p>
<p>Last week, ULA announced its next launch is scheduled for December 15. An Atlas V will loft another batch of broadband satellites for the Amazon Leo network, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/we-finally-know-a-little-more-about-amazons-super-secret-satellites/">formerly known as Project Kuiper</a>, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.
