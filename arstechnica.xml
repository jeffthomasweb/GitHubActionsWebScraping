              <![CDATA[<p>When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0">Powers of 10 video</a>, which came out in the 1970s. Perhaps you remember it, with the narrator taking us both outward toward the fathomless end of the Universe and then, reversing course, guiding us back to Earth and inside a proton. The film gave a younger me a good sense of just how large the Universe around us really is.</p>
<p>What I did not know until much later is that the short film was made by <a href="https://www.eamesoffice.com/about/biography/">the Eames Office</a>, which was founded by the noted designers Charles Eames and Ray Kaiser. It's the same organization that produced the Eames Lounge Chair. It goes to show you the value of good design across genres (shoutout to Ars' resident designer, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/author/aurich-lawson/">Aurich Lawson</a>).</p>
<p>Anyway, I say all that because the Power of 10 film continues to live in my head, rent-free, decades later. It was the first thing I thought of when looking at today's image of the Milky Way Galaxy's center. The main image showcases huge vertical filaments, with the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's core clearly visible. This image, captured by a South African radio telescope named MeerKAT, also shows the ghostly, bubble-like remnants of supernovas that exploded over millennia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/tuesday-telescope-the-heart-of-the-galaxy-revealed-in-two-kinds-of-light/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For the second time in six months, SpaceX will deploy a US military satellite that was sitting in storage, waiting for a slot on United Launch Alliance's launch schedule.</p>
<p>Space Systems Command, which oversees the military's launch program, announced Monday that it is reassigning the launch of a Global Positioning System satellite from ULA's Vulcan rocket to SpaceX's Falcon 9. This satellite, designated GPS III SV-08 (Space Vehicle-08), will join the Space Force's fleet of navigation satellites beaming positioning and timing signals for military and civilian users around the world.</p>
<p>The Space Force booked the Vulcan rocket to launch this spacecraft in 2023, when ULA hoped to begin flying military satellites on its new rocket by mid-2024. The Vulcan rocket is now scheduled to launch its first national security mission around the middle of this year, following the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/at-long-last-the-space-force-has-certified-the-vulcan-rocket/">Space Force's certification of ULA's new launcher</a> last month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/a-military-satellite-waiting-to-launch-with-ula-will-now-fly-with-spacex/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Framework, the designers and sellers of the modular and repairable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/framework-laptop-13-reviewed-again-meteor-lake-meh-linux-upgrades-good/">Framework Laptop 13</a> and other products, announced today that it would be "<a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1909304225072394380">temporarily pausing US sales</a>" on some of its laptop configurations as a result of new tariffs put on Taiwanese imports by the Trump administration. The affected models will be removed from Framework's online store for now, and there's no word on when buyers can expect them to come back.</p>
<p>"We priced our laptops when tariffs on imports from Taiwan were 0 percent," the company <a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1909320405627580621">responded</a> to a post asking why it was pausing sales. "At a 10 percent tariff, we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss."</p>
<p>"Other consumer goods makers have performed the same calculations and taken the same actions, though most have not been open about it," Framework said. Nintendo also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">paused US preorders for its upcoming Switch 2 console</a> last week after the tariffs were announced.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/framework-temporarily-pausing-some-laptop-sales-because-of-new-tariffs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Among the many surprises during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">last week's wider unveiling of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> was the pricing: $450 for the console itself and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">$70 to $80 for many first-party games</a>. Now, in a set of interviews posted today (but conducted during last week's unveiling event), Nintendo executives are explaining and defending those prices, even as Trump's tariffs are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">apparently forcing the company to pause and reassess its whole launch strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRmWFAGLJg">speaking to CNBC</a> just as Trump's tariffs were being announced, and said in the moment that "we're still all trying to really understand [the tariffs] better and understand what possible impacts may rise from that." At the same time, he said that the company "didn't consider tariffs into that equation" when choosing the Switch 2's $450 price and instead went with what "we felt that was going to be the right price point for our consumers and the right value proposition if you will for the device that we're creating."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in that CNBC interview, Bowser suggested that Nintendo isn't following the Wii U example of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/nintendo-wii-u-still-being-sold-at-a-loss/">selling hardware at a loss</a> in order to gain more potential software customers. Instead, Bowser said the company is "trying to find a way to maintain... margins on the hardware even though they may be more slim than they are on software," and then "to make sure that they're seeing the value in their investment in one of our devices" through software.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-hardware-and-software-prices-cost-so-much/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We're used to updating Windows, macOS, and Linux systems at least once a month (and usually more), but people with ancient DOS-based PCs still get to join in the fun every once in a while. Over the weekend, the team that maintains <a href="https://www.freedos.org/download/">FreeDOS officially released version 1.4</a> of the operating system, containing a list of fixes and updates that have been in the works since the last time a stable update was released <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freedos/news/2022/02/freedos-13/">in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>FreeDOS creator and maintainer Jim Hall goes into more detail about the FreeDOS 1.4 changes <a href="https://allthingsopen.org/articles/getting-started-with-freedos-1-4-release-candidate-1">here</a>, and full release notes for the changes are <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/test/changes.log">here</a>. The release has "a focus on stability" and includes an updated installer, new versions of common tools like <code>fdisk</code>, and <code>format</code> and the <code>edlin</code> text editor. The release also includes updated HTML Help files.</p>
<p>Hall talked with Ars about several of these changes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/30-years-later-freedos-is-still-keeping-the-dream-of-the-command-prompt-alive/">when we interviewed him about FreeDOS in 2024</a>.

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, Meta <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/">released</a> its newest Llama 4 multimodal AI models in a surprise weekend move that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/5/llama-4-notes/">caught</a> some AI experts off guard. The announcement touted Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick as major advancements, with Meta claiming top performance in their categories and an enormous 10 million token context window for Scout. But so far the open-weights models have received an initial mixed-to-negative reception from the AI community, highlighting a familiar tension between AI marketing and user experience.</p>
<p>"The vibes around llama 4 so far are decidedly <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mid">mid</a>," independent AI researcher Simon Willison told Ars Technica. Willison often <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/5/llama-4-notes/">checks the community pulse</a> around open source and open weights AI releases in particular.</p>
<p>While Meta positions Llama 4 in competition with closed-model giants like OpenAI and Google, the company continues to use the term "open source" despite <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama4/LICENSE">licensing restrictions</a> that prevent truly open use. As we have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/the-first-gpt-4-class-ai-model-anyone-can-download-has-arrived-llama-405b/">noted in the past</a> with previous Llama releases, "open weights" more accurately describes Meta's approach. Those who sign in and accept the license terms can download the two smaller Llama 4 models from <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama">Hugging Face</a> or <a href="http://www.llama.com">llama.com</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/metas-surprise-llama-4-drop-exposes-the-gap-between-ai-ambition-and-reality/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[What they delivered is a gray wolf genome carrying a handful of genetic edits.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, biotech company Colossal announced what it views as its first successful de-extinction: the dire wolf. These large predators were lost during the Late Pleistocene extinctions that eliminated many large land mammals from the Americas near the end of the most recent glaciation. Now, in a coordinated PR blitz, the company is claiming that clones of gray wolves with lightly edited genomes have essentially brought the dire wolf back. (Both <a href="https://time.com/7274542/colossal-dire-wolf/">Time</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/04/14/the-dire-wolf-is-back?_sp=06490e9d-e826-4489-8a60-79f0d501a2e8.1744044989139">The New Yorker</a> were given exclusive access to the animals ahead of the announcement.)</p>
<p>The dire wolf is a relative of the now-common gray wolf, with clear differences apparent between the two species' skeletons. Based on the sequence of two new dire wolf genomes, the researchers at Colossal conclude that dire wolves formed a distinct branch within the canids over 2.5 million years ago. For context, that's over twice as long as brown and polar bears are estimated to have been distinct species. Dire wolves are also large, typically the size of the largest gray wolf populations. Comparisons between the new genomes and those of other canids show that the dire wolf also had a light-colored coat.</p>
<p>That large of an evolutionary separation means there are likely a lot of genetic differences between the gray and dire wolves. Colossal's internal and unpublished analysis suggested that key differences could be made by editing 14 different areas of the genome, with 20 total edits required. The new animals are reported to have had 15 variants engineered in. It's unclear what accounts for the difference, and a Colossal spokesperson told Ars: "We are not revealing all of the edits that we made at this point."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/de-extinction-company-announces-that-the-dire-wolf-is-back/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>Balatro</em> is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/balatro-arrives-on-phones-sept-26-so-plan-your-sick-days-accordingly/">certainly habit-forming</a>, but there's nothing to be won or lost, other than time, by playing it. While the game has you using standard playing cards and poker hands as part of its base mechanics, it does not have in-app purchases, loot boxes, or any kind of online play or enticement to gambling, beyond the basics of risk and reward.</p>
<p>Yet many YouTube creators have had their <em>Balatro</em> videos set to the traffic-dropping "Age-restricted" status, allegedly due to "depictions or promotions of casino websites or apps," with little recourse for appeal.</p>
<p>The Balatro University channel detailed YouTube's recent concerns about "online gambling" in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnhNLWKEbSE">a video posted last weekend</a>. Under policies that took effect March 19, YouTube no longer allows any reference to gambling sites or applications "<a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6018017?hl=en">not certified by Google</a>." Additionally, content with "online gambling content"—"excluding online sports betting and depictions of in-person gambling"—cannot be seen by anyone signed out of YouTube or registered as under 18 years old.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/balatro-yet-again-subject-to-mods-poor-understanding-of-gambling/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google started <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">cramming AI features into search</a> in 2024, but last month marked an escalation. With the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/">release of AI Mode</a>, Google previewed a future in which searching the web does not return a list of 10 blue links. Google says it's getting positive feedback on AI Mode from users, so it's forging ahead by adding multimodal functionality to its robotic results.</p>
<p>AI Mode relies on a custom version of the Gemini large language model (LLM) to produce results. Google confirms that this model now supports multimodal input, which means you can now show images to AI Mode when conducting a search.</p>
<p>As this change rolls out, the search bar in AI Mode will gain a new button that lets you snap a photo or upload an image. The updated Gemini model can interpret the content of images, but it gets a little help from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googlelens/">Google Lens</a>. Google notes that Lens can identify specific objects in the images you upload, passing that context along so AI Mode can make multiple sub-queries, known as a "fan-out technique."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/googles-ai-mode-search-can-now-answer-questions-about-images/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tech companies' worst nightmare ahead of Donald Trump's election has already come true, as the US and China are now fully engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war, where China claims it expects to be better positioned to withstand US blows long-term.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has claimed that Americans must take their "medicine," bearing any pains from tariffs while waiting for supposed long-term gains from potentially pressuring China—and every other country, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">islands of penguins—</a>into a more favorable trade deal. On Monday, tech companies across the US likely winced when Trump threatened to heap "additional" 50 percent tariffs on China, after China announced retaliatory 34 percent tariffs on US imports and restricted US access to rare earth metals.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Posting on Truth Social, Trump gave China one day to withdraw tariffs to avoid higher US tariffs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-gives-china-one-day-to-end-retaliations-or-face-extra-50-tariffs/">Read full article</a></p>

      Tom Cruise is back for what may (or may not) be his final turn as Ethan Hunt in <em>Mission: Impossible—Final Reckoning</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>After giving CinemaCon attendees a sneak peek last week, Paramount Pictures has publicly released the trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_The_Final_Reckoning"><em>Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning</em></a>, the eighth installment of the blockbuster spy franchise starring Tom Cruise as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and a sequel to the events that played out in 2023's <em>Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning</em>.</p>
<p>This may, or may not, end up being Cruise's last film in the franchise; everyone's being pretty cagey about that question. But the trailer certainly gives us everything we've come to expect from the Mission: Impossible films: high stakes, global political intrigue, and of course, lots and lots of spectacular stunt work, including Cruise hanging precariously mid-air from a 1930s Boeing Stearman biplane.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A second unvaccinated child has died of measles in Texas, according to <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak">state health officials</a> and the hospital in Lubbock, Texas, that treated the child.</p>
<p>“We are deeply saddened to report that a school-aged child who was recently diagnosed with measles has passed away," a representative for UMC Health System in Lubbock said in a statement emailed to Ars Technica. "The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized. It is important to note that the child was not vaccinated against measles and had no known underlying health conditions. This unfortunate event underscores the importance of vaccination."</p>
<p>US Health Secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. identified the child as 8-year-old <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414">Daisy Hildebrand</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>A White House investigation has reportedly identified the mistakes that led to a journalist being added to a Signal text chain in which bombing plans were discussed hours before the strikes occurred.</p>
<p>As previously reported, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz last month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-secret-bombing-plans-to-a-reporter/">invited The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg</a> to a Signal chat in which top Trump administration officials discussed a plan for bombing Houthi targets in Yemen. Waltz publicly claimed that Goldberg's number was "sucked in" to his phone and added to a different person's contact information without his knowledge.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/signal-group-chat-leak-how-it-happened">report published yesterday</a> by The Guardian said a forensic review by the White House IT office "found that Waltz's phone had saved Goldberg's number as part of an unlikely series of events that started when Goldberg emailed the Trump campaign last October."

              <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo's barrage of Switch announcements over the last two weeks have also come with changes to the way Nintendo treats physical and digital copies of games.</p>
<p>Digital games can now become "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">virtual game cards</a>," facilitating slightly more flexible sharing of digitally purchased games between multiple Switch systems owned by the same person or family of people. And physical copies of games can now be either traditional game cards—little bits of plastic with the game stored on a flash memory chip inside—or "Game-Key cards," which look the same from the outside but don't actually have any game data stored on them.</p>
<p>A Game-Key card has a "key" stored on it that prompts a download of the game data from Nintendo's servers the first time you insert it. From then on, the game behaves like a cross between a digital download and a physical game—all of the game's content has to be on the console's internal storage or a microSD Express card, but you <em>need</em> to have the Game-Key card inserted before the game will launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1 held the third round of its 2025 season at Suzuka in Japan yesterday. The race used to be held toward the end of the calendar, but F1 now visits while the cherry blossoms are blooming, which certainly makes for some good visuals. With a hefty timezone difference between Suzuka and fans in Europe and the US, a difficult decision must be made: Do I stay up all night to watch it live? Let's just say I was glad I did that for qualifying on Friday night—and I was equally glad I slept in the following night and watched the race on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.racingcircuits.info/asia/japan/suzuka.html">circuit at Suzuka</a> is one of the few old-school tracks left on the calendar. Along with places like Monaco, Catalyunya, and Spa-Francorchamps, it's a real driver's track; anyone who's played it in <em>Forza</em>, <em>Gran Turismo</em>, or the racing franchise of your choice will know what I mean. The first corner is flat after a long straight. The left-right-left-right of turns 3–7 might be the best set of esses on any track in the world. It even crosses over itself in a figure-eight.</p>
<p>Like Spa, though, some bits have become less of a challenge for modern F1 cars with their immense amounts of power and grip. 130R used to be a test of nerve, but now the cars barely notice it as a corner.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/f1-in-japan-reminds-us-a-great-track-might-not-make-for-a-great-race/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/report-nintendo-quietly-owns-up-to-joy-con-drift-will-repair-for-free/">dealing with</a> years of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/report-nintendo-quietly-owns-up-to-joy-con-drift-will-repair-for-free/">widespread reports of "stick drift" on the original Switch Joy-Cons</a>, Nintendo watchers have been hoping the Switch 2 would make use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor">magnetic Hall effect sensors</a> that avoid most of the physical wear and tear that causes the problem. Now, though, a Nintendo executive has confirmed that the Joy-Cons on the new console won't make use of the more reliable but more expensive technology.</p>
<p>"Well, the Joy-Con 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up," Nintendo of America Senior Vice President of Product Development &amp; Publishing Nate Bihldorff <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/we-really-want-to-future-proof-the-nintendo-switch-2-interview">told enthusiast site Nintendo Life</a> in a recent interview. "They're not Hall effect sticks, but they feel really good."</p>
<p>The confirmation comes after Nintendo pointedly refused to offer details about the Switch 2's joystick hardware at a roundtable Q&amp;A session attended by Ars last week. When a reporter asked whether stick drift "is the sort of thing that has been improved with the Joy-Con 2 and the Pro Controller 2 as well," Switch 2 Technical Director Tetsuya Sasaki responded (via a translator) that the "new Joy-Con 2 controllers have been designed from the ground up from scratch to have bigger movement, and also a lot smoother movement."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/switch-2-joysticks-wont-use-hall-effect-sensors-to-avoid-stick-drift/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There is no action star quite like Jackie Chan, who made his name in the Hong Kong movie industry starting in the late 1970s and developed his own signature style: combining slapstick physical comedy with acrobatics and martial arts, and designing astonishing stunts—all of which he performed himself along with his own handpicked stunt team. His stunt sequences and fight choreography have influenced everything from <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Kill Bill</em> to the John Wick franchise and <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> (in which he voiced Master Monkey).</p>
<p>Born on April 7, 1954, Chan studied acrobatics, martial arts, and acting as a child at the Peking Opera School's China Drama Academy and became one of the Seven Little Fortunes. Those skills served him well in his early days as a Hong Kong stuntman, which eventually landed him a gig as an extra and stunt double on Bruce Lee's 1972 film, <em>Fist of Fury</em>. He also appeared in a minor role in Lee's <em>Enter the Dragon</em> (1973).</p>
<p>Initially, Hong Kong producers, impressed by Chan's skills, wanted to mold him into the next Lee, but that just wasn't Chan's style. Chan found his milieu when director Yuen Woo-ping cast him in 1978's kung fu comedy <em>Snake in the Eagle's Shadow</em> and gave Chan creative freedom over the stunt work. It was <em>Drunken Master</em>, released that same year, that established Chan as a rising talent, and he went on to appear in more than 150 movies, becoming one of Hong Kong's biggest stars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/our-top-10-jackie-chan-movies/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/">DOGE</a>) has plans to stage a “hackathon” next week in Washington, DC. The goal is to create a single “mega API”—a bridge that lets software systems talk to one another—for accessing IRS data, sources tell WIRED. The agency is expected to partner with a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-silicon-valley-corporate-connections/">third-party vendor</a> to manage certain aspects of the data project. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-palantir-chief-information-officers-government/">Palantir</a>, a software company cofounded by billionaire and Musk associate Peter Thiel, has been brought up consistently by DOGE representatives as a possible candidate, sources tell WIRED.</p>
<p>Two top DOGE operatives at the IRS, Sam Corcos and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">Gavin Kliger</a>, are helping to orchestrate the hackathon, sources tell WIRED. Corcos is a health-tech CEO with ties to Musk’s SpaceX. Kliger attended UC Berkeley until 2020 and worked at the AI company Databricks before joining DOGE as a special adviser to the director <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lackeys-office-personnel-management-opm-neuralink-x-boring-stalin/">at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)</a>. Corcos is also a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370300545112">special adviser</a> to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.</p>
<p>Since joining Musk’s DOGE, Corcos has told IRS workers that he wants to pause all engineering work and cancel current attempts to modernize the agency’s systems, according to sources with direct knowledge who spoke with WIRED. He has also spoken about some aspects of these cuts publicly: "We've so far stopped work and cut about $1.5 billion from the modernization budget. Mostly projects that were going to continue to put us down the death spiral of complexity in our code base," Corcos told Laura Ingraham on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370300545112">Fox News in March</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/doge-gearing-up-for-hackathon-at-irs-wants-easier-access-to-taxpayer-data/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr is taking a hard line against broadcast TV stations accused of bias against Republicans and President Trump. To pressure broadcasters, Carr is invoking the rarely enforced <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/broadcast-news-distortion">news distortion policy</a> that was developed starting in the <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/778/16/253127/">late 1960s</a> and says the FCC should consider <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/trumps-fcc-chair-can-hassle-the-living-daylights-out-of-news-broadcasters/">revoking broadcast licenses</a>.</p>
<p>The FCC has regulatory authority over broadcasters with licenses to use the public airwaves. But Carr's two immediate predecessors—Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel and Republican Ajit Pai—both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-chair-slams-trumps-call-to-revoke-cbs-and-abc-broadcast-licenses/">said</a> that punishing stations based on the content of news programs would violate the First Amendment right to free speech.</p>
<p>Rosenworcel and Pai's agreement continued a decades-long trend of the FCC easing itself out of the news-regulation business. Two other former FCC chairs—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/ex-fcc-chairs-from-both-parties-say-cbs-news-distortion-investigation-is-bogus/">Republican Alfred Sikes and Democrat Tom Wheeler</a>—have urged Carr to change course.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trumps-fcc-chair-invokes-rarely-enforced-news-distortion-policy-to-punish-media/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Maureen Long talks to the public about her work, she likes to ask her audience to close their eyes and think of a landscape with incredible geology. She hears a lot of the same suggestions: Iceland, the Grand Canyon, the Himalayas. “Nobody ever says Connecticut,” says Long, a geologist at Yale University in New Haven in that state.</p>
<p>And yet Connecticut—along with much of the rest of eastern North America—holds important clues about Earth’s history. This region, which geologists call the eastern North American margin, essentially spans the US eastern seaboard and a little farther north into Atlantic Canada. It was created over hundreds of millions of years as slivers of Earth’s crust collided and merged. Mountains rose, volcanoes erupted and the Atlantic Ocean was born.</p>
<p>Much of this geological history has become apparent only in the past decade or so, after scientists blanketed the United States with seismometers and other instruments to illuminate geological structures hidden deep in Earth’s crust. The resulting findings include many surprises—from why there are volcanoes in Virginia to how the crust beneath New England is weirdly crumpled.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/how-did-eastern-north-america-form/">Read full article</a></p>
