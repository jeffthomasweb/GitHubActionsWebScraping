<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When OpenAI's DALL-E 2 <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1511707245536428034">debuted</a> on April 6, 2022, the idea that a computer could create relatively photorealistic images on demand based on just text descriptions caught a lot of people <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23162454/openai-dall-e-image-generation-tool-creative-revolution">off guard</a>. The launch began an innovative and tumultuous period in AI history, marked by a sense of wonder and a polarizing ethical debate that reverberates in the AI space to this day.</p>

<p>Last week, OpenAI <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936794-is-dall-e-2-available">turned off</a> the ability for new customers to purchase generation credits for the web version of DALL-E 2, effectively killing it. From a technological point of view, it's not too surprising that OpenAI recently began winding down support for the service. The 2-year-old image generation model was groundbreaking for its time, but it has since been surpassed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">DALL-E 3's</a> higher level of detail, and OpenAI has recently begun rolling out DALL-E 3 <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1775569161759985737">editing capabilities</a>.</p>
<p>But for a tight-knit group of artists and tech enthusiasts who were there at the start of DALL-E 2, the service's sunset marks the bittersweet end of a period where AI technology briefly felt like a magical portal to boundless creativity. "The arrival of DALL-E 2 was truly mind-blowing," illustrator <a href="https://bonfx.com/">Douglas Bonneville</a> told Ars in an interview. "There was an exhilarating sense of unlimited freedom in those first days that we all suspected AI was going to unleash. It felt like a liberation from something into something else, but it was never clear exactly what."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017168#p3">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017168&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A life-threatening bacterial infection typically spread through rat urine sickened a record number of people in New York City last year—and this year looks on track for another all-time high, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reports.</p>
<p>The infection is leptospirosis, which can cause a range of symptoms, including non-specific ones like fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and cough. But, if left untreated, can become severe, causing kidney failure, liver damage, jaundice, hemorrhage, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/canal-of-urine-blamed-for-rare-infection-in-man-with-bloody-yellow-eyes/">bloody eyes</a> (conjunctival suffusion), respiratory distress, and potentially death.</p>
<p>The bacteria that causes it—spirochete bacteria of the genus <em>Leptospira</em>—infect rats, which shed the bacteria in their urine. The germs jump to people through direct contact with open wounds or mucous membranes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018117#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018117&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Kremlin-backed actors have stepped up efforts to interfere with the US presidential election by planting disinformation and false narratives on social media and fake news sites, analysts with Microsoft reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The analysts have identified several unique influence-peddling groups affiliated with the Russian government seeking to influence the election outcome, with the objective in large part to reduce US support of Ukraine and sow domestic infighting. These groups have so far been less active during the current election cycle than they were during previous ones, likely because of a less contested primary season.</p>
<h2>Stoking divisions</h2>
<p>Over the past 45 days, the groups have seeded a growing number of social media posts and fake news articles that attempt to foment opposition to US support of Ukraine and stoke divisions over hot-button issues such as election fraud. The influence campaigns also promote questions about President Biden’s mental health and corrupt judges. In all, Microsoft has tracked scores of such operations in recent weeks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018090#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018090&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The humanoid robotics market is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/huge-funding-round-makes-figure-big-techs-favorite-humanoid-robot-company/">starting</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-announces-moonshot-to-create-embodied-human-level-ai-in-robot-form/">heat up,</a> and the company that's been doing this the longest isn't going to sit by and watch. Boston Dynamics has a <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/blog/electric-new-era-for-atlas/">new humanoid robot</a> that the company says represents a path to commercialization. It's the company's next-generation, all-electric "Atlas" robot.</p>
<p>While new Atlas and old Atlas share a name, they couldn't be more different when it comes to construction. The old Atlas—a research platform and viral sensation that could handle nearly any terrain, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/boston-dynamics-shares-an-incredible-behind-the-scenes-look-at-robot-building/">do backflips</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/boston-dynamics-atlas-tries-out-inventory-work-gets-better-at-lifting/">pick up heavy objects</a>—was powered by a heavy, complicated hydraulics system. The new Atlas is all-electric and looks like it's a fraction of the size and weight of the hydraulic version. It also looks like <em>a product</em>, with covers around all the major components and consumer-friendly design touches like a giant status light in the head and a light-up power button that looks like it was ripped right from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/boston-dynamics-robot-dog-gets-an-arm-attachment-self-charging-capabilities/">Spot</a> assembly line.</p>
<p>Hydraulic Atlas is being retired to make way for the all-electric version. The company posted one last <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EM5_VFlt8">goodbye video</a> for the hydraulic model on its YouTube page, showing the history of the project. Atlas has done a lot of neat tricks over the years, but getting there has required a lot of learning—part of that is taking some absolutely gnarly slams, which are highlighted in the video. The video seemed to go out of its way to show just how cumbersome hydraulics can be. At one point, it looks like Atlas' foot <a href="https://youtu.be/-9EM5_VFlt8?t=85">completely breaks off</a>, and hydraulic fluid gushes all over the floor. Other times, the robot just springs a leak, and a fine mist of high-pressure fluid sprays everywhere as the robot goes limp. The fluid has a red tinge to it, so with a little imagination, it can look pretty gory!</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017478#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017478&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US AI Safety Institute—part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)—has finally announced its leadership team after much speculation.</p>
<p>Appointed as head of AI safety is Paul Christiano, a former OpenAI researcher who pioneered a foundational AI safety technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but is also known for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-researcher-ai-doom-50-chatgpt-2023-5">predicting</a> that "there's a 50 percent chance AI development could end in 'doom.'" While Christiano's research background is impressive, some fear that by appointing a so-called "AI doomer," NIST may be risking encouraging non-scientific thinking that many critics view as sheer speculation.</p>
<p>There have been rumors that NIST staffers oppose the hiring. A controversial VentureBeat <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/nist-staffers-revolt-against-potential-appointment-of-effective-altruist-ai-researcher-to-us-ai-safety-institute/">report</a> last month cited two anonymous sources claiming that, seemingly because of Christiano's so-called "AI doomer" views, NIST staffers were "revolting." Some staff members and scientists allegedly threatened to resign, VentureBeat reported, fearing "that Christiano’s association" with effective altruism and "longtermism could compromise the institute’s objectivity and integrity."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017927#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017927&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's easy to get the impression that Discord chat messages are ephemeral, especially across different public servers, where lines fly upward at a near-unreadable pace. But someone claims to be catching and compiling that data and is offering packages that can track more than 600 million users across more than 14,000 servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/a-spy-site-is-scraping-discord-and-selling-users-messages/">Joseph Cox at 404 Media confirmed</a> that Spy Pet, a service that sells access to a database of purportedly 3 billion Discord messages, offers data "credits" to customers who pay in bitcoin, ethereum, or other cryptocurrency. Searching individual users will reveal the servers that Spy Pet can track them across, a raw and exportable table of their messages, and connected accounts, such as GitHub. Ominously, Spy Pet lists more than 86,000 other servers in which it has "no bots," but "we know it exists."</p>
  <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">
          <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spypet_1-980x1289.png" alt=""></div>
          <p>
            An example of Spy Pet's service from its website. Shown are a user's nicknames, connected accounts, banner image, server memberships, and messages across those servers tracked by Spy Pet.                          [credit:
                              Spy Pet                            ]
                      </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>As Cox notes, Discord doesn't make messages inside server channels, like blog posts or unlocked social media feeds, easy to publicly access and search. But many Discord users many not expect their messages, server memberships, bans, or other data to be grabbed by a bot, compiled, and sold to anybody wishing to pin them all on a particular user. 404 Media confirmed the service's function with multiple user examples. Private messages are not mentioned by Spy Pet and are presumably still secure.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017957#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017957&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of two women in a Neolithic tomb in France, with the positioning of the bodies suggesting they may have been ritualistically murdered by asphyxia or self-strangulation, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adl3374">recent paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances.</p>
<p><strong>(WARNING: graphic descriptions below.)</strong></p>
<p>France's Rhône Valley is home to several archaeological sites dating to the end of the Middle Neolithic period (between 4250 and 3600/3500 BCE in the region); the sites include various storage silos, broken grindstones, imported ceramics, animal remains (both from communal meals and sacrifices), and human remains deposited in sepulchral pits. Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux is one such site.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015478#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015478&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Almost from the start, arguments about mitigating climate change have included an element of cost-benefit analysis: Would it cost more to move the world off fossil fuels than it would to simply try to adapt to a changing world? A strong consensus has built that the answer to the question is a clear no, capped off by <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2018/nordhaus/facts/">a Nobel in Economics</a> given to one of the people whose work was key to building that consensus.</p>
<p>While most academics may have considered the argument put to rest, it has enjoyed an extended life in the political sphere. Large unknowns remain about both the costs and benefits, which depend in part on the remaining uncertainties in climate science and in part on the assumptions baked into economic models.</p>
<p>In Wednesday's edition of Nature, a small team of researchers analyzed how local economies have responded to the last 40 years of warming and projected those effects forward to 2050. They find that we're already committed to warming that will see the growth of the global economy undercut by 20 percent. That places the cost of even a limited period of climate change at roughly six times the estimated price of putting the world on a path to limit the warming to 2° C.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018002#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018002&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla is asking shareholders to approve a move to Texas and to re-approve a $55.8 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk that was recently voided by a Delaware judge.</p>
<p>Musk's 2018 pay package was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/">voided in a ruling</a> by Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick, who found that the deal was unfair to shareholders. After the ruling, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/elon-musk-proposes-tesla-move-to-texas-after-delaware-judge-voids-56-billion-pay/">Musk said</a> he would seek a shareholder vote on transferring Tesla's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas.</p>
<p>The proposed move to Texas and Musk's pay package will be up for votes at Tesla's 2024 annual meeting on June 13, Tesla Board Chairperson Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders that was included in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465924048040/tm2326076d13_pre14a.htm">regulatory filing</a> today.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017920#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017920&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a game industry that seems to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">engage</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/unity-cuts-25-percent-of-workforce-as-it-refocuses-on-game-engine-business/">periodic layoffs</a> as a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/report-embracers-ongoing-layoffs-kill-a-new-deus-ex-game-after-2-years-work/">matter</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/activision-blizzard-lays-off-775-people-after-record-results-in-2018/">course</a>, it's often hard for even popular game franchises to maintain continuity in their underlying creative teams from sequel to sequel. Then there's the Mario series, where <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/7298/super-mario-bros/credits/nes/?autoplatform=true">every person credited with the creation of the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></a> in the 1980s ended up having <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/5-people-made-the-original-super-mario-bros-all-of-them-were-still-at-nintendo-to-ship-wonder-38-years-later/">a role in the making of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a> just last year.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Ars Technica, <em>Wonder</em> producer Takashi Tezuka said it wasn't that tough to get that kind of creative continuity at Nintendo. "The secret to having a long-tenured staff is that people don't quit," he said. "For folks who have been there together for such a long time, it's easy for us to talk to each other."</p>

<p>That said, Tezuka added that just getting a bunch of industry veterans together to make a game runs the risk of not "keeping up with the times. Really, for me, I have a great interest in how our newer staff members play, what they play, what they think, and what is appealing to them. I think it's very interesting the things we can come up with when these two disparate groups influence each other to create something."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017848#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017848&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Broadcom CEO Hock Tan this week publicized some concessions aimed at helping customers and partners ease into VMware’s recent business model changes. Tan reiterated that the controversial changes, like the end of perpetual licensing, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/">aren't going away</a>. But amid questioning from antitrust officials in the European Union (EU), Tan announced that the company has already given support extensions for some VMware perpetual license holders.</p>
<p>Broadcom closed its $69 billion VMware acquisition in November. One of its first moves was ending <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">VMware perpetual license sales</a> in favor of subscriptions. Since December, Broadcom also hasn't sold Support and Subscription renewals for VMware perpetual licenses.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/blog/a-changing-market-landscape-requires-constant-evolution-our-mission-for-vmware-customers">blog post</a> on Monday, Tan admitted that this shift requires "a change in the timing of customers' expenditures and the balance of those expenditures between capital and operating spending." As a result, Broadcom has "given support extensions to many customers who came up for renewal while these changes were rolling out." Tan didn't specify how Broadcom determined who is eligible for an extension or for how long. However, the executive's blog is the first time Broadcom has announced such extensions and opens the door to more extension requests.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017717#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017717&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I'm crying for some reason," says Tarn Adams, demonstrating <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/">Dwarf Fortress</a>' </em>"Adventure Mode" for a Discord stream full of games writers and PR folk. His adventurer is crying, that is. "Something must have upset me. Probably the dead bodies… I have great grouchiness, though."</p>
<p>Adventure Mode, out today, builds on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/dwarf-fortresss-graphical-upgrade-provides-a-new-way-into-a-wildly-wonky-game/">graphical version of <em>Dwarf Fortress</em></a> and the work you've put into it. The adventurers you create and send out into the world traverse the overland and underground places you yourself crafted. This allows you to both appreciate the realms carved out by your imagination and also be a kind of dungeon master for other adventurers (with, hopefully, an easier fortress-swapping mechanic to come soon). You can also generate a new world if you prefer the simulation's weird choices to your own.</p>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the object that fell into a Florida home last month was part of a battery pack released from the International Space Station.</p>
<p>This extraordinary incident opens a new frontier in space law. NASA, the homeowner, and attorneys are navigating little-used legal codes and intergovernmental agreements to determine who should pay for the damages.</p>
<p>Alejandro Otero, owner of the Naples, Florida, home struck by the debris, told Ars he is fairly certain the object came from the space station, even before NASA's confirmation. The circumstances strongly suggested that was the case. The cylindrical piece of metal tore through his roof on March 8, a few minutes after the time US Space Command reported the reentry of a space station cargo pallet and nine decommissioned batteries over the Gulf of Mexico on a trajectory heading forward the coast of southwest Florida.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017513#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017513&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Studies have shown that automatic emergency braking systems have reduced road deaths in the <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/bibliography/ref/2111">US</a>, <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/eng-2021-0097/html?lang=en">Europe</a>, and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/3/917?type=check_update&amp;version=1">China</a>, but so-called phantom braking problems have dogged systems from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/teslas-radar-less-cars-investigated-by-nhtsa-after-complaints-spike/#:~:text=The%20National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety,about%20416%2C000%20cars%20are%20affected.">Tesla</a> and Honda.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/nhtsa-to-investigate-honda-accords-and-cr-vs-over-phantom-braking/">We first learned of the problem in 2022</a>, when NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into the matter, based on 278 complaints. Now, NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation has received 1,294 complaints from drivers of Honda CR-Vs (model years 2017–2022) and Honda Accords (model years 2018–2022), all claiming that their Hondas' automatic emergency braking system slammed on the brakes with no apparent obstruction in the way.</p>
<p>Honda says it's aware of even more cases—1,991 in all, and NHTSA says that, when it takes out cases where multiple reports affect the same vehicle, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2022/HONDA/ACCORD/4%252520DR/FWD#investigations">it knows of</a> 2,976 reports of inadvertent automatic emergency braking, with 93 injury reports and 47 crashes to date.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017732#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017732&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Electricity supply is becoming the latest chokepoint to threaten the growth of artificial intelligence, according to leading tech industry chiefs, as power-hungry data centers add to the strain on grids around the world.</p>
<p>Billionaire Elon Musk said this month that while the development of AI had been “chip constrained” last year, the latest bottleneck to the cutting-edge technology was “electricity supply.” Those comments followed a warning by Amazon chief Andy Jassy this year that there was “not enough energy right now” to run new generative AI services.</p>
<p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet are investing billions of dollars in computing infrastructure as they seek to build out their AI capabilities, including in data centers that typically take several years to plan and construct.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017729#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017729&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google Maps is making itself friendlier for electric vehicles. A couple of years ago it added the option <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-maps-can-now-pick-the-most-efficient-route-for-evs/">to select different powertrain types</a> when calculating a route—gas, hybrid, electric, and so on. Lower-energy routes with fewer hills are helpful for electric vehicles, but mostly what EV drivers on unfamiliar terrain really want to know about are the chargers: Where are they, how fast are they, and do they work? Soon, that critical information will be available to Google Maps users via a new update.</p>
<p>Live charger status is usually available from the onboard navigation system built into an EV. Better yet, those native nav systems invariably talk to the powertrain, so they know how much state of charge is currently in the battery and how much to expect upon arrival. Add in real-time status on chargers—how many are working, how many are available—and it's not hard to see why plenty of EV drivers stick with the built-in system.</p>
<p>But for some EVs, that built-in system <em>is</em> Google Maps, including EVs from Ford, Honda, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/gm-confirms-its-dropping-apple-carplay-and-android-auto-from-2024-evs/">General Motors</a>, Volvo, Polestar, and soon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/porsche-gives-ars-a-look-inside-its-next-ev-the-all-electric-macan/">even Porsche</a>. These will be the first devices to receive the update, Google says, which will roll out globally in the coming months. After the connected cars, smartphones will be next.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017708#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017708&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Anybody can contribute to the Linux kernel, but any person's commit suggestion can become the focus of the kernel's master and namesake, Linus Torvalds. Torvalds is famously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/01/linus-torvalds-responds-to-ars-about-diversity-niceness-in-open-source/">not overly committed to niceness</a>, though he has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/linus-torvalds-apologizes-for-years-of-being-a-jerk-takes-time-off-to-learn-empathy/">working on it since 2018</a>. You can see glimpses of this newer, less curse-laden approach in how Torvalds recently addressed a commit with which he vehemently disagreed. It involves tabs.</p>
<p>The commit last week changed <a href="https://git.kernel.dk/?p=linux-block.git;a=commit;h=d96c36004e31">exactly one thing on one line</a>, replacing a tab character with a space: "It helps Kconfig parsers to read file without error." Torvalds responded with a commit of his own, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/16/torvalds_complicates_his_indents/">as spotted by The Register</a>, which would "<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/diff/?id=d5cf50dafc9dd5faa1e61e7021e3496ddf7fd61e">add some hidden tabs on purpose</a>." Trying to smooth over a tabs-versus-spaces matter seemed to awaken Torvalds to the need to have tab-detecting failures be "more obvious." Torvalds would have added more, he wrote, but didn't "want to make things uglier than necessary. But it *might* be necessary if it turns out we see more of this kind of silly tooling."</p>
<p>If you've read this far and don't understand what's happening, please allow me, a failed CS minor, to offer a quick explanation: <a href="https://www.popsci.com/inside-silicon-valleys-spaces-and-tabs-debate/">Tabs Versus Spaces</a> will <a href="https://roberttruesdale.medium.com/tabs-vs-spaces-the-never-ending-battle-beyond-code-037d493e6dd8">never</a> be truly resolved, codified, or set right by standards, and the energy spent on the issue over time could, if harnessed, likely power one or more small nations. Still, the Linux kernel has <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html">its own coding style</a>, and it directly cites "K&amp;R," or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/unix-legend-who-owes-us-nothing-keeps-fixing-foundational-awk-code/">Kernighan</a> &amp; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/10/dennis-ritchie-the-giant-whose-shoulders-we-stand-on/">Ritchie</a>, the authors of the coding bible <em>The C Programming Language,</em> which is a tabs book. If you are submitting kernel code, it had better use tabs (eight-character tabs, ideally, though that is tied in part to <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/16172/when-did-tabs-start-defaulting-to-8-columns">teletype and line-printer history</a>).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017554#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017554&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cisco’s Talos security team is warning of a large-scale credential compromise campaign that’s indiscriminately assailing networks with login attempts aimed at gaining unauthorized access to VPN, SSH, and web application accounts.</p>
<p>The login attempts use both generic usernames and valid usernames targeted at specific organizations. Cisco included a <a href="https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/IOCs/blob/main/2024/04/large-scale-brute-force-activity-targeting-vpns-ssh-services-with-commonly-used-login-credentials.txt">list</a> of more than 2,000 usernames and almost 100 passwords used in the attacks, along with nearly 4,000 IP addresses sending the login traffic. The IP addresses appear to originate from TOR exit nodes and other anonymizing tunnels and proxies. The attacks appear to be indiscriminate and opportunistic rather than aimed at a particular region or industry.</p>
<p>“Depending on the target environment, successful attacks of this type may lead to unauthorized network access, account lockouts, or denial-of-service conditions,” Talos researchers <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/large-scale-brute-force-activity-targeting-vpns-ssh-services-with-commonly-used-login-credentials/">wrote Tuesday</a>. “The traffic related to these attacks has increased with time and is likely to continue to rise.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017646#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017646&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At least 19 women across nine US states appear to have been poisoned by bogus injections of Botox, t<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/outbreaks/harmful-reactions-botox-injections.html">he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported late Monday.</a></p>
<p>Nine of the 19 cases—47 percent—were hospitalized and four—21 percent—were treated with botulinum anti-toxin. The CDC's alert and outbreak investigation follows <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/sketchy-botox-shots-spark-multistate-outbreak-of-botulism-like-condition/">reports in recent days of botulism-like illnesses linked to shady injections</a> in Tennessee, where officials reported four cases, and Illinois, where there were two.

<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/counterfeit-version-botox-found-multiple-states">In a separate alert Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration</a> said that "unsafe, counterfeit" versions of Botox had been found in several states, and the toxic fakes were administered by unlicensed or untrained people and/or in non-medical or unlicensed settings, such as homes or spas. The counterfeit products appeared to have come from an unlicensed source, generally raising the risks that they're "misbranded, adulterated, counterfeit, contaminated, improperly stored and transported, ineffective and/or unsafe," the FDA said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017617#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017617&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Since the 1960s, scientists have known that the tiny tardigrade can withstand very intense radiation blasts 1,000 times stronger than what most other animals could endure. According to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(24)00316-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982224003166%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, it's not that such ionizing radiation doesn't damage tardigrades' DNA; rather, the tardigrades are able to rapidly repair any such damage. The findings complement those of a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/92621">separate study</a> published in January that also explored tardigrades' response to radiation.</p>
<p>“These animals are mounting an incredible response to radiation, and that seems to be a secret to their extreme survival abilities,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1041321">said co-author Courtney Clark-Hachtel</a>, who was a postdoc in Bob Goldstein's lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which has been conducting research into tardigrades for 25 years. “What we are learning about how tardigrades overcome radiation stress can lead to new ideas about how we might try to protect other animals and microorganisms from damaging radiation.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/tiny-tardigrades-crash-landed-on-the-moon-and-probably-survived/">reported previously</a>, tardigrades are micro-animals that can survive in the harshest conditions: extreme pressure, extreme temperature, radiation, dehydration, starvation—even exposure to the vacuum of outer space. The creatures were first described by German zoologist Johann Goeze in 1773. They were dubbed <em>tardigrada</em> ("slow steppers" or "slow walkers") four years later by Lazzaro Spallanzani, an Italian biologist. That's because tardigrades tend to lumber along like a bear. Since they can survive almost anywhere, they can be found in lots of places: deep-sea trenches, salt and freshwater sediments, tropical rain forests, the Antarctic, mud volcanoes, sand dunes, beaches, and lichen and moss. (Another name for them is "moss piglets.") </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017449#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017449&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
