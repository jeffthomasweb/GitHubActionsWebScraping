<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Thus far, even AI companies have had trouble coming up with tools that can reliably detect when a piece of writing was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/openai-admits-that-ai-writing-detectors-dont-work/">generated using a large language model</a>. Now, a group of researchers has established a novel method for estimating LLM usage across a large set of scientific writing by measuring which "excess words" started showing up much more frequently during the LLM era (i.e., 2023 and 2024). The results "suggest that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs," according to the researchers.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016">a pre-print paper posted earlier this month</a>, four researchers from Germany's University of Tubingen and Northwestern University said they were inspired by studies that measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/07/gop-voters-had-higher-excess-deaths-rates-after-covid-vaccine-rollout/">by looking at excess deaths</a> compared to the recent past. By taking a similar look at "excess word usage" after LLM writing tools <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">became widely available in late 2022</a>, the researchers found that "the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words" that was "unprecedented in both quality and quantity."</p>
<h2>Delving in</h2>
<p>To measure these vocabulary changes, the researchers analyzed 14 million paper abstracts published on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a> between 2010 and 2024, tracking the relative frequency of each word as it appeared across each year. They then compared the expected frequency of those words (based on the pre-2023 trendline) to the actual frequency of those words in abstracts from 2023 and 2024, when LLMs were in widespread use.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034045#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034045&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"</span>If you're going to make a car and use all that energy, it should be a good car," said Thomas Ingenlath, CEO of Polestar. Ingenlath was referring to the company's latest electric vehicle, a midsize SUV with striking coupe looks called the Polestar 4. While Ingenlath is on point from a sustainability perspective, it makes good business sense, too. The Polestar 4 needs to be a good car to stand out as it enters <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/automakers-must-build-cheaper-smaller-evs-to-spur-adoption-report-says/">one of the most hotly contested segments</a> of the market.</p>
<p>In fact, Polestar uses less energy to make its latest EV than anything else in its range—the company quotes a carbon footprint of 19.9 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cradle-to-gate-assessment">cradle to gate</a>. Like some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/bmw-explores-recycling-with-the-i-vision-circular-concept/">other automakers</a>, Polestar is using a monomaterial approach to the interior to make recycling easier, choosing the same base plastic for all the components in a particular piece of trim, for example.</p>
<p>The carpets are made from, variously, recycled fishing nets or plastic bottles. The vinyl seats use pine oil instead of the stuff extracted from the ground, and the knitted upholstery fabric—also recycled plastic bottles—was designed to leave no off-cuts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034236#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034236&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ultra-athlete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Edgley">Ross Edgley</a> is no stranger to pushing his body to extremes. He once ran a marathon while pulling a 1-ton car; ran a triathlon while carrying a 100-pound tree; and climbed a 65-foot rope over and over again until he'd climbed the equivalent of Mt. Everest—all for charity. In 2016, he set the world record for the world's longest staged sea swim around the coastline of Great Britain: 1,780 miles over 157 days.</p>
<p>At one point during that swim, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basking_shark">basking shark</a> appeared and swam alongside Edgley for a day and a half. That experience ignited his curiosity about sharks and eventually led to his new National Geographic documentary, <em><a href="https://www.natgeotv.com/ca/shark-vs-ross-edgley">Shark vs. Ross Edgley</a>—</em>part of four full weeks of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qTvntc2MD0">2024 SHARKFEST</a> programming. Edgley matches his athletic prowess against four different species of shark. He tries to jump out of the water (polaris) like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark">great white shark</a>; withstand the G forces produced by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerhead_shark">hammerhead shark</a>'s fast, rapid turns; mimic the extreme fasting and feasting regimen of a migrating tiger shark; and match the swimming speed of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortfin_mako_shark">mako shark</a>. </p>
<p>"I love this idea of having a goal and then reverse engineering and deconstructing it," Edgley told Ars. "[Sharks are] the ultimate ocean athletes. We just had this idea: what if you're crazy enough to try and follow in the footsteps of four amazing sharks? It's an impossible task. You're going to fail, you're going to be humbled. But in the process, we could use it as a sports/shark science experiment, almost like a Trojan horse to bring science and ocean conservation to a new audience."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034182#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034182&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a vast stretch of the Sonoran Desert, between the towns of San Luis Río Colorado and Sonoyta in northern Mexico, sits a modest building of cement, galvanized sheet metal, and wood—the only stop along 125 miles of inhospitable landscape dominated by thorny ocotillo shrubs and towering saguaro cactuses up to 50 feet high. It’s a <em>fonda</em>—a small restaurant—called La Liebre del Desierto (The Desert Hare), and for more than 20 years, owner Elsa Ortiz Ramos has welcomed and nourished weary travelers taking a break from the adjacent highway that runs through the arid Pinacate and Grand Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve.</p>
<p>But the dedication and care of this petite woman go beyond her simple menu. Every two weeks, she pays out of pocket for a 5,000-gallon tank of water to distribute to a network of water troughs strategically placed in the area. By doing so, she relieves the thirst of bighorn sheep, ocelots, pronghorn, coyotes, deer, and even bats that have been deprived of access to their natural water sources.</p>
<p>“The crows come to the house and scream to warn us that there is no more water ... it’s our alarm,” says Ortiz Ramos in her distinct northern Mexico accent. Her words sound straight from an Aesop’s fable, but they take on stark realism in this spot. Covering large parts of Arizona, California, and the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora, the Sonoran Desert—along with the Lut Desert in Iran—was cataloged in 2023 as having <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/move-over-death-valley-these-are-two-hottest-spots-earth">the hottest surface temperature on the planet</a>, at 80.8° Celsius (177° Fahrenheit).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034429#p3">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034429&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A remake of <em>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</em> launched this week, made by the original game's developers. It strikes a fascinating balance between re-creation and reinvention, and based on a couple of hours of playing it, it's a resounding success.</p>
<p><em>Myst</em> was the classic most people remembered fondly from the early CD-ROM era, but for me, its sequel, <em>Riven</em>, was the highlight. After that, the sequels declined in quality. The sophomore effort was the apex.</p>
<p>It was certainly more ambitious than <em>Myst</em>. Instead of a handful of tightly packed theme park worlds, it offered a singular, cohesive one that felt lived in and steeped in history in a way that <em>Myst</em> couldn't quite match.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034421#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two big things happened in the world of text-based disk operating systems in June 1994.</p>
<p>The first is that Microsoft released MS-DOS version 6.22, the last version of its long-running operating system that would be sold to consumers as a standalone product. MS-DOS would continue to evolve for a few years after this, but only as an increasingly invisible loading mechanism for Windows.</p>

<p>The second was that a developer named Jim Hall wrote a post announcing something called “PD-DOS.” Unhappy with Windows 3.x and unexcited by the project we would come to know as Windows 95, Hall wanted to break ground on a new “public domain” version of DOS that could keep the traditional command-line interface alive as most of the world left it behind for more user-friendly but resource-intensive graphical user interfaces.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033083#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033083&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A small group of woolly mammoths became trapped on Wrangel Island around 10,000 years ago when rising sea levels separated the island from mainland Siberia. Small, isolated populations of animals lead to inbreeding and genetic defects, and it has long been thought that the Wrangel Island mammoths ultimately succumbed to this problem about 4,000 years ago.</p>
<p>A paper in Cell on Thursday, however, compared 50,000 years of genomes from mainland and isolated Wrangel Island mammoths and found that this was not the case. What the authors of the paper discovered not only challenges our understanding of this isolated group of mammoths and the evolution of small populations, it also has important implications for conservation efforts today.</p>
<h2>A severe bottleneck</h2>
<p>It’s the culmination of years of genetic sequencing by members of the international team behind this new paper. They studied 21 mammoth genomes—13 of which were newly sequenced by lead author Marianne Dehasque; others had been sequenced years prior by co-authors Patrícia Pečnerová, Foteini Kanellidou, and Héloïse Muller. The genomes were obtained from Siberian woolly mammoths (<i>Mammuthus primigenius</i>), both from the mainland and the island before and after it became isolated. The oldest genome was from a female Siberian mammoth who died about 52,300 years ago. The youngest were from Wrangel Island male mammoths who perished right around the time the last of these mammoths died out (one of them died just 4,333 years ago).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034436#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034436&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Cryptocurrency has always made a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-cryptocurrency-theft-ethereum/">ripe target for theft</a>—and not just hacking, but the old-fashioned, up-close-and-personal kind, too. Given that it can be irreversibly transferred in seconds with little more than a password, it's perhaps no surprise that thieves have occasionally sought to steal crypto in home-invasion burglaries and even kidnappings. But rarely do those thieves leave a trail of violence in their wake as disturbing as that of one recent, ruthless, and particularly prolific gang of crypto extortionists.</p>
<p>The United States Justice Department earlier this week <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-convicted-violent-home-invasion-robberies-steal-cryptocurrency">announced</a> the conviction of Remy Ra St. Felix, a 24-year-old Florida man who led a group of men behind a violent crime spree designed to compel victims to hand over access to their cryptocurrency savings. That announcement and the criminal complaint laying out charges against St. Felix focused largely on a single theft of cryptocurrency from an elderly North Carolina couple, whose home St. Felix and one of his accomplices broke into before physically assaulting the two victims—both in their seventies—and forcing them to transfer more than $150,000 in bitcoin and ether to the thieves' crypto wallets. </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>
<p>In fact, that six-figure sum appears to have been the gang’s only confirmed haul from its physical crypto thefts—although the burglars and their associates made millions in total, mostly through more traditional crypto hacking as well as stealing other assets. A deeper look into court documents from the St. Felix case, however, reveals that the relatively small profit St. Felix’s gang made from its burglaries doesn’t capture the full scope of the harm they inflicted: In total, those court filings and DOJ officials describe how more than a dozen convicted and alleged members of the crypto-focused gang broke into the homes of 11 victims, carrying out a brutal spree of armed robberies, death threats, beatings, torture sessions, and even one kidnapping in a campaign that spanned four US states.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034420#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034420&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since the beginning of the year, landowners have discovered several pieces of space junk traced to missions supporting the International Space Station. On all of these occasions, engineers expected none of the disposable hardware would survive the scorching heat of reentry and make it to Earth's surface.</p>
<p>These incidents highlight an urgency for more research into what happens when a spacecraft makes an uncontrolled reentry into the atmosphere, according to engineers from the Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research center based in El Segundo, California. More stuff is getting launched into space than ever before, and the trend will continue as companies deploy more satellite constellations and field heavier rockets.</p>
<p>"The biggest immediate need now is just to do some more work to really understand this whole process and to be in a position to be ready to accommodate new materials, new operational approaches as they happen more quickly," said Marlon Sorge, executive director of Aerospace's Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies. "Clearly, that’s the direction that spaceflight is going.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033944#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033944&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA and Boeing officials pushed back Friday on headlines that the commercial Starliner crew capsule is stranded at the International Space Station but said they need more time to analyze data before formally clearing the spacecraft for undocking and reentry.</p>
<p>Two NASA astronauts, commander Butch Wilmore and pilot Suni Williams, will spend at least a few more weeks on the space station as engineers on the ground conduct thruster tests to better understand issues with the Starliner propulsion system in orbit. Wilmore and Williams launched June 5 aboard an Atlas V rocket and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-drama-filled-day-boeings-starliner-finally-finds-its-way/">docked at the station the next day</a>, completing the first segment of Starliner's first test flight with astronauts.</p>
<p>NASA managers originally planned for the Starliner spacecraft to remain docked at the space station for at least eight days, although they left open the possibility of a mission extension. The test flight is now likely to last at least a month and a half, and perhaps longer, as engineers wrestle with helium leaks and thruster glitches on Starliner's service module.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034431#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034431&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple's Vision Pro headset went on sale outside the United States for the first time today, in the first of two waves of expanded availability.</p>
<p>The $3,499 "spatial computing" device launched back in February in the US, but it hasn't taken the tech world by storm. Part of that has been its regional launch, with some of the biggest markets still lacking access.</p>
<p>Apple announced that the product would be sold internationally during its keynote at the Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034503#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034503&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Since the rise of large language models like ChatGPT there have been lots of anecdotal reports about students submitting AI-generated work as their exam assignments and getting good grades. So, we stress-tested our university’s examination system against AI cheating in a controlled experiment,” says Peter Scarfe, a researcher at the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at the University of Reading.</p>
<p>His team created over 30 fake psychology student accounts and used them to submit ChatGPT-4-produced answers to examination questions. The anecdotal reports were true—the AI use went largely undetected, and, on average, ChatGPT scored better than human students.</p>
<h2>Rules of engagement</h2>
<p>Scarfe’s team submitted AI-generated work in five undergraduate modules, covering classes needed during all three years of study for a bachelor’s degree in psychology. The assignments were either 200-word answers to short questions or more elaborate essays, roughly 1,500 words long. “The markers of the exams didn’t know about the experiment. In a way, participants in the study didn’t know they were participating in the study, but we’ve got necessary permissions to go ahead with that”, Scarfe claims.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034465#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034465&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After weeks of reports of severe illnesses across the country, the maker of Diamond Shruumz microdosing chocolates, gummies, and candy cones has <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/prophet-premium-blends-recalls-diamond-shruumz-products-because-possible-health-risk">finally issued a recall</a>. It covers all lots and all flavors of all the brand's products.</p>
<p>The illnesses have been marked by several severe symptoms, which notably include seizures, loss of consciousness, and the need for intubation and intensive care. To date, there have been 39 people sickened, including 23 hospitalizations across 20 states, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">according to the Food and Drug Administration</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/environmental-health-studies/outbreak-investigation-diamond-shruumz-products/index.html#cdc_generic_section_1-outbreak-investigation-summary">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The FDA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/people-are-seizing-being-intubated-after-eating-microdose-chocolates/">first issued a warning</a> on the brand's chocolate bars on June 7, when there were reports of eight cases, including six hospitalizations, in four states.</p>
<p>Diamond Shruumz's parent company, Prophet Premium Blends, said in the recall notice that it had received only two complaints about the products to date and, upon receiving those complaints, reviewed recent laboratory analyses (Certificates of Analysis) of its products. According to the company, those CoAs noted "higher than normal amounts of muscimol," which is one of two key compounds found in hallucinogenic <em>Amanita </em>mushrooms. Muscimol "could be a potential cause of symptoms consistent with those observed in persons who became ill after eating Diamond Shruumz products," the company said in the recall notice.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034470#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034470&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Internet Archive (IA) went before a three-judge panel Friday to defend its open library's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/06/internet-archive-backs-up-digital-books-on-paper/">controlled digital lending (CDL) practices</a> after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/publishers-beat-internet-archive-as-judge-rules-e-book-lending-violates-copyright/">book publishers last year won a lawsuit</a> claiming that the archive's lending violated copyright law.</p>
<p>In the weeks ahead of IA's efforts to appeal that ruling, IA was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/internet-archive-forced-to-remove-500000-books-after-publishers-court-win/">forced to remove 500,000 books from its collection</a>, shocking users. In an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/let-readers-read-an-open-letter-to-the-publishers-in-hachette-v-internet-archive">open letter</a> to publishers, more than 30,000 readers, researchers, and authors begged for access to the books to be restored in the open library, claiming the takedowns dealt "a serious blow to lower-income families, people with disabilities, rural communities, and LGBTQ+ people, among many others," who may not have access to a local library or feel "safe accessing the information they need in public."</p>
<p>During a press briefing following arguments in court Friday, IA founder Brewster Kahle said that "those voices weren't being heard." Judges appeared primarily focused on understanding how IA's digital lending potentially hurts publishers' profits in the ebook licensing market, rather than on how publishers' costly ebook licensing potentially harms readers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034435#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034435&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a shocking announcement this week, the European intergovernmental organization responsible for launching and operating the continent's weather satellites has pulled its next mission off a future launch of Europe's new Ariane 6 rocket. Instead, the valuable MTG-S1 satellite will now reach geostationary orbit on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket in 2025.</p>
<p>“This decision was driven by exceptional circumstances” <a href="https://www.eumetsat.int/meteosat-satellite-be-launched-spacex">said</a> Phil Evans, director general of the organization Eumetsat. “It does not compromise our standard policy of supporting European partners, and we look forward to a successful SpaceX launch for this masterpiece of European technology.”</p>
<p>The decision, taken at a council meeting of Eumetsat's 30 member nations on Wednesday and Thursday, comes less than two weeks before the debut of the Ariane 6 rocket, scheduled for July 9.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034369#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034369&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of the most striking things about the explosion of renewable power that's happening in the US is that much of it is going on in states governed by politicians who don't believe in the problem wind and solar are meant to address. Acceptance of the evidence for climate change tends to be lowest among Republicans, yet many of the states where renewable power has boomed—wind in Wyoming and Iowa, solar in Texas—are governed by Republicans.</p>
<p>That's partly because, up until about 2020, there was a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of expanding wind and solar power, with support above 75 percent among both parties. Since then, however, support among Republicans has dropped dramatically, approaching 50 percent, according to polling data released this week.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img alt="Renewables enjoyed solid Republican support until recently." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-3.png"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Renewables enjoyed solid Republican support until recently.

<p>To a certain extent, none of this should be surprising. The current leader of the Republican Party has been saying that wind turbines <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/04/trumps-faulty-wind-power-claims/">cause cancer</a> and offshore wind is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66928305">killing whales</a>.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US Supreme Court today overturned the 40-year-old <em>Chevron</em> precedent in a ruling that limits the regulatory authority of federal agencies. The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf">6-3 decision</a> in <em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em> will make it harder for agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations without explicit authorization from Congress.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the opinion of the court and was joined by Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Justice Elena Kagan filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>
<p><em>Chevron</em> gave agencies leeway to interpret ambiguous laws as long as the agency's conclusion was reasonable. But the Roberts court said that a "statutory ambiguity does not necessarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency, as opposed to a court, resolve the resulting interpretive question."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034370#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034370&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla has denied that "any defect in the Autopilot system caused or contributed" to the 2022 death of a Tesla employee, Hans von Ohain, whose Tesla Model 3 burst into flames after the car suddenly veered off a road and crashed into a tree.</p>

<p>Brussels is preparing for an antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s $13 billion investment into OpenAI, after the European Union decided not to proceed with a merger review into the most powerful alliance in the artificial intelligence industry.</p>
<p>The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, began to explore a review under merger control rules in January, but on Friday announced that it would not proceed due to a lack of evidence that Microsoft controls OpenAI.</p>
<p>However, the commission said it was now exploring the possibility of a traditional antitrust investigation into whether the tie-up between the world’s most valuable listed company and the best-funded AI start-up was harming competition in the fast-growing market.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034368#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034368&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In what may be the biological equivalent to getting struck by lightning, a very unlucky man in the Philadelphia area took a very rare bee sting directly to the eyeball—and things went badly from there.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the 55-year-old went to the emergency department, where doctors tried to extract the injurious insect's stinger from the man's right eye. But it soon became apparent that they didn't get it all.</p>
<p>Two days after the bee attack, the man went to the Wills Eye Hospital with worsening vision and pain in the pierced eye. At that point, the vision in his right eye had deteriorated to only being able to count fingers. The eye was swollen, inflamed, and bloodshot. Blood was visibly pooling at the bottom of his iris. And right at the border between the man's cornea and the white of his eye, ophthalmologists spotted the problem: a teeny spear-like fragment of the bee's stinger still stuck in place.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034341#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034341&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
