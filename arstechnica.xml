<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Archaeologists seeking to learn more about how Neanderthals prepared and cooked their food conducted a series of hands-on experiments with small fowl using flint flakes for butchering. They found that the flint flakes were surprisingly effective for butchering the birds, according to their <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-archaeology/articles/10.3389/fearc.2024.1411853/full">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Archaeology. They also concluded that roasting the birds damages the bones to such an extent that it's unlikely they would be preserved in the archaeological record.</p>
<p>According to the authors, Neanderthals were able to thrive for over 200,000 years across a broad range of geographical regions, so naturally archaeologists are interested in how they sustained themselves. There has been research into their killing and hunting of large game. Neanderthals were expert hunters known to kill bears and other carnivores. A pair of lion fibula from the Middle Paleolithic found in eastern Iberia with cut marks indicates the lion was butchered, while other lion bones found in Southwestern France from the same period had cut marks indicative of skinning.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/10/this-may-be-the-earliest-evidence-that-neanderthals-hunted-cave-lions/">as we reported</a> just last year, researchers found evidence of what might be the earliest example of lion hunting yet known, based on a close forensic analysis of a cave lion skeleton showing evidence of injury by a wooden spear some 48,000 years ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038699#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038699&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Tesla <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q2-2024-Update.pdf">posted</a> its second-quarter financial results ahead of an investor call this afternoon. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/tesla-production-fell-by-15-percent-in-q2-2024-as-sales-continue-to-decline/">Earlier this month</a>, it released its Q2 2024 production and delivery numbers, which showed a 14.4 percent year-over-year reduction in the number of cars it built and a 4.8 percent reduction in sales compared to the same three months in 2023. Now, we can see the effect that a shrinking average sales price has had on the automaker's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Automotive revenues dropped a little more than deliveries, down 7 percent year-over-year to $19.9 billion—Tesla's price cuts since last year will have contributed to that. The good news for Tesla is that it doubled its sales of batteries and solar, deploying 9.4 GWh of batteries in Q2, which brought in $3 billion in revenue.</p>
<h2>Lots more carbon credits</h2>
<p>Tesla also saw a healthy increase in regulatory credits, where other automakers pay the company in order to count some of its EVs toward their own fleets. This exchange allows other companies to continue polluting rather than selling more efficient vehicles. The credits more than tripled compared to 2023—Tesla raked in $890 million in credits for Q2 2024.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038810#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038810&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Amazon business unit that focuses on Alexa-powered gadgets lost $25 billion between 2017 and 2021, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-alexa-devices-echo-losses-strategy-25f2581a">The Wall Street Journal </a>(WSJ) reported this week.</p>
<p>Amazon claims it has sold more than 500,000,000 Alexa devices, which included Echo speakers, Kindle readers, Fire TV sets and streaming devices, and Blink and Ring smart home security cameras. But since debuting, Alexa, like other voice assistants, has struggled to make money. In late 2022, Business Insider reported that Alexa was set to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/">lose $10 billion that year.</a></p>
<p>WSJ said it got the $25 billion figure from "internal documents" and that it wasn’t able to determine the Devices business's losses before or after the shared time period.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038688#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038688&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the AI world, there's a buzz in the air about a new AI language model released Tuesday by Meta: <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">Llama 3.1 405B</a>. The reason? It's potentially the first time anyone can download a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4-class</a> large language model (LLM) for free and run it on their own hardware. You'll still need some beefy hardware: Meta says it can run on a "single server node," which isn't desktop PC-grade equipment. But it's a provocative shot across the bow of "closed" AI model vendors such as OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>

<p>"Llama 3.1 405B is the first openly available model that rivals the top AI models when it comes to state-of-the-art capabilities in general knowledge, steerability, math, tool use, and multilingual translation," <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_content=video&amp;utm_campaign=llama31">says</a> Meta. Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls 405B "the first frontier-level open source AI model."</p>
<p>In the AI industry, "frontier model" is a term for an AI system designed to push the boundaries of current capabilities. In this case, Meta is positioning 405B among the likes of the industry's top AI models, such as OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">Claude's 3.5 Sonnet</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/">Google Gemini 1.5 Pro</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038486#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038486&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/Stay%20Motions%20DENIED%20July%2019%202024.pdf">denied a request</a> to put a hold on recently formulated rules that would limit carbon emissions made by fossil fuel power plants. The request, made as part of a case that sees 25 states squaring off against the EPA, would have put the federal government's plan on hold while the case continued. Instead, the EPA will be allowed to continue the process of putting its rules into effect, and the larger case will be heard under an accelerated schedule.</p>
<h2>Here we go again</h2>
<p>The EPA's efforts to regulate carbon emissions from power plants go back all the way to the second Bush administration, when a group of states <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2007/04/supreme-court-sends-carbon-regulation-back-to-the-epa/">successfully sued the EPA</a> to force it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. This led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/04/epa-applies-clean-air-act-to-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">a formal endangerment finding</a> regarding greenhouse gases during the Obama administration, something that remained unchallenged even during Donald Trump's term in office.</p>
<p>Obama tried to regulate emissions through the Clean Power Plan, but his second term came to an end before this plan had cleared court hurdles, allowing the Trump administration to formulate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/trump-administration-finalizes-replacement-for-obamas-clean-power-plan/">a replacement</a> that did far less than the Clean Power Plan. This took place against a backdrop of accelerated displacement of coal by natural gas and renewables that had already surpassed the changes envisioned under the Clean Power Plan.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038751#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038751&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A government investigation has revealed more detail on the impact and causes of a recent AT&amp;T outage that happened immediately after a botched network update. The nationwide outage on February 22, 2024, blocked over 92 million phone calls, including over 25,000 attempts to reach 911.</p>
<p>As described in more detail later in this article, the FCC criticized AT&amp;T for not following best practices, which dictate "that network changes must be thoroughly tested, reviewed, and approved" before implementation. It took over 12 hours for AT&amp;T to fully restore service.</p>
<p>"All voice and 5G data services for AT&amp;T wireless customers were unavailable, affecting more than 125 million devices, blocking more than 92 million voice calls, and preventing more than 25,000 calls to 911 call centers," the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-issues-report-nationwide-att-wireless-outage">said yesterday</a>. The outage affected all 50 states as well as Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038708#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038708&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Cruise Origin was definitely the least conventional of all the myriad vehicles that General Motors planned to build using its new Ultium battery platform. For starters, it wasn't a pickup truck or SUV, unlike all the Ultium-based electric vehicles that have gone into production thus far. Instead, the Origin—meant for Cruise, GM's robotaxi startup—was a true driverless pod design, a box on wheels with the front and rear seats facing each other and no steering wheel at all. But now the Origin is dead, GM said in a letter to investors today.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/01/cruises-autonomous-origin-hints-at-a-mcdonalds-of-mobility/">We saw the Origin in person</a> in January 2020 at a flashy reveal event that was light on the details. At the time, Cruise was targeting early 2022 to begin deploying Origins, a timeline that accounted for neither pandemic nor the difficulty in actually developing autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>By early 2022, Cruise was ready to petition the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/gm-seeks-us-approval-to-put-driverless-cruise-origin-into-commercial-service/">asking permission to begin using Origins</a> on the road. But 2023 was a bad year for the autonomous vehicle company, which had its operations in California suspended after a Cruise robotaxi <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/california-suspends-cruises-robotaxis-after-pedestrian-was-critically-injured/">ran over and then dragged</a> a pedestrian in San Francisco.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038723#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038723&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The people of San Francisco haven’t always been kind to <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/waymo/">Waymo’s growing fleet of driverless taxis</a>. The autonomous vehicles, which provide tens of thousands of rides each week, have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYTZRb-SWhY">torched</a>, <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-person-seen-trashing-waymo-car-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-person-seen-trashing-waymo-car-in-san-francisco/" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-person-seen-trashing-waymo-car-in-san-francisco/"}'>stomped on</a>, and <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/07/16/san-francisco-waymo-video-assault-police-say/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://sfstandard.com/2024/07/16/san-francisco-waymo-video-assault-police-say/" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://sfstandard.com/2024/07/16/san-francisco-waymo-video-assault-police-say/"}'>verbally berated</a> in recent months. Now Waymo is striking back—in the courts.</p>
<p>This month, the Silicon Valley company filed a pair of lawsuits, neither of which have been previously reported, that demand hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages from two alleged vandals. Waymo attorneys said in court papers that the alleged vandalism, which ruined dozens of tires and a tail end, are a significant threat to the company’s reputation. Riding in a vehicle in which the steering wheel swivels on its own can be scary enough. Having to worry about attackers allegedly targeting the rides could undermine Waymo’s ride-hailing business before it even gets past its earliest stage. </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>
<p>Waymo, which falls under the umbrella of Google parent Alphabet, operates a ride-hailing service in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robotaxis-cruise-waymo-san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/32-hours-chandler-arizona-self-driving-capital/">Phoenix</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-los-angeles-robotaxi-autonomous-car-approval/">Los Angeles</a> that is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-and-lyft-drivers-advice-autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-cars-taxis/">comparable to Uber and Lyft</a> except with sensors and software controlling the driving. While its cars haven’t contributed to any known deadly crashes, US regulators continue to probe their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robot-cars-are-causing-911-false-alarms-in-san-francisco/">sometimes</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dashcam-footage-shows-driverless-cars-cruise-waymo-clogging-san-francisco/">erratic driving</a>. Waymo spokesperson Sandy Karp says the company always prioritizes safety and that the lawsuits reflect that strategy. She declined further comment for this story.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038514#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038514&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For several months, Intel has been investigating reports that high-end 13th- and 14th-generation desktop CPUs (mainly, but not exclusively, the Core i9-13900K and 14900K) were crashing during gameplay. Intel partially addressed the issue by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-reportedly-blames-motherboard-makers-for-core-i9-cpu-crashes/">insisting</a> that third-party motherboard makers adhere to Intel's recommended default power settings in their motherboards, but the company said it was still working to identify the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>The company announced yesterday that it has wrapped up its investigation and that a microcode update to fix the problem should be shipping out to motherboard makers in mid-August "following full validation." Microcode updates like this generally require a BIOS update, so exactly when the patch hits your specific motherboard will be up to the company that made it.</p>
<p>Intel says that an analysis of defective processors "confirms that the elevated operating voltage is stemming from a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor." In other words, the CPU is receiving too much power, which is degrading stability over time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038549#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038549&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google has an announcement today: It's not going to do something it has thought about, and tinkered with, for quite some time.</p>
<p>Most people who just use the Chrome browser, rather than develop for it or try to serve ads to it, are not going to know what "<a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/">A new path for Privacy Sandbox on the web</a>" could possibly mean. The very short version is that Google had a "path," <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">first announced in January 2020</a>, to turn off third-party (i.e., tracking) cookies in the most-used browser on Earth, bringing it in line with Safari, Firefox, and many other browsers. Google has proposed several alternatives to the cookies that follow you from page to page, constantly pitching you on that space heater you looked at three days ago. Each of these alternatives has met varying amounts of resistance from privacy and open web advocates, trade regulators, and the advertising industry.</p>
<p>So rather than turn off third-party cookies by default and implement new solutions inside the Privacy Sandbox, Chrome will "introduce a new experience" that lets users choose their tracking preferences when they update or first use Chrome. Google will also keep working on its Privacy Sandbox APIs but in a way that recognizes the "impact on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising." Google also did not fail to mention it was "discussing this new path with regulators."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038576#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038576&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OKAwz2MsJs?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga star in <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em>. </p></div>
<p>This weekend will be all about San Diego Comic-Con and the hotly anticipated theatrical release of the summer blockbuster <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/final-deadpool-and-wolverine-trailer-strikes-a-surprisingly-somber-note/"><em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em></a>, but Warner Bros. is already looking ahead to the fall. The studio dropped the official trailer for <em>Joker: Folie à Deux,</em> the sequel to 2019's smash hit <em>Joker</em>, starring Joaquin Phoenix. This time, he's joined by fellow asylum inmate Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) to bring a comic book criminal partnership for the ages to gritty life.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for 2019's <em>Joker</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Joker </em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/review-joker-is-a-powerful-portrayal-of-a-troubled-mans-descent-into-madness/">was intended to be a standalone film</a>—part of DC Films' <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/dc-wonder-woman-movie-strategy-universe.html">decision to move</a> away from the shared-universe approach of its prior franchise DCEU films. (DC Studios CEO James Gunn is now calling it the "DC Elseworld" project.) It had no relation to the <em>Justice League </em>films that came before, so that freed Phillips to create his own darker, grittier version of this iconic character. He cited Martin Scorsese films like <em>Taxi Driver, Raging Bull</em>, and <em>The King of Comedy</em> among his influences. There's no real origin story for the Joker in the comics—not <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-10-04/joker-ending-explained-todd-phillips">a definitive one</a>, anyway—so Phillips and screenwriter Scott Silver were able to cherry-pick the canonical elements they needed and make up the rest. (In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke"><em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em></a>, for instance, the Joker is a failed comedian.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038604#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038604&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There is an emerging truth about NASA's push toward commercial contracts that is increasingly difficult to escape: Companies not named SpaceX are struggling with NASA's approach of awarding firm, fixed-price contracts for space services.</p>
<p>This belief is underscored by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/nasa-will-pay-spacex-nearly-1-billion-to-deorbit-the-international-space-station/">the recent award</a> of an $843 million contract to SpaceX for a heavily modified Dragon spacecraft that will be used to deorbit the International Space Station by 2030.</p>

SpaceX faced just a single serious competitor in this process, Northrop Grumman. And in all three categories—price, mission suitability, and past performance—SpaceX significantly outclassed Northrop.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038574#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038574&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CrowdStrike-Software-Update-Letter_FINAL.pdf">letter</a> Monday, the House Committee on Homeland Security demanded more transparency from CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">major global outages</a> were triggered by a "defect" in a recent update to CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor software.</p>
<p>Considered by some to be "the largest IT outage in history," the issue delayed or canceled thousands of flights, disabled emergency calls, postponed surgeries, and impacted banks, committee chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) and Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection chairman Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>"In less than one day, we have seen major impacts to key functions of the global economy, including aviation, healthcare, banking, media, and emergency services," their letter said. "Recognizing that Americans will undoubtedly feel the lasting, real-world consequences of this incident, they deserve to know in detail how this incident happened and the mitigation steps CrowdStrike is taking."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038610#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038610&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Of all the recent trends in automotive technology and design, the adoption of <a href="https://ignorethecode.net/blog/2011/07/04/the_capacitive_button_cult_must_be_stopped/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IgnoreTheCode+%28ignore+the+code%29">capacitive controls</a> over mechanical switches and buttons—particularly on multifunction steering wheels—is among the most deplorable. One can see the appeal to the designer—slick-looking fiat panels trump dust-attracting seams, for starters. The bean counters love them, too—it takes less time to install the subassemblies, and that means a little more profit per car. It's just that they suck. And now, some Volkswagen drivers say capacitive buttons are to blame for their car crashes.</p>
<p>Capacitive buttons require only the lightest of touches to register a button push. That's mostly a positive thing for buttons on the center console, but when those controls are on bits of trim you might touch by accident, you can run into problems.</p>
<p>For example, capacitive buttons are sometimes put on the spokes of a multifunction steering wheel, as in the image above. In some maneuvers—parking, for example—it's possible to brush either one of the panels of buttons with a palm. If it's the spoke on the right side, an accidental touch will just mess with the audio system, which is annoying and perhaps a bit distracting.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038577#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038577&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>United Launch Alliance is targeting September 16 for the second test flight of the new Vulcan rocket, and a flawless mission could finally set the stage for the first Vulcan launch for the US military by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The US Space Force has contracted ULA's Vulcan rocket to launch the majority of the military's space missions over the next few years. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/air-force-is-growing-concerned-about-the-pace-of-vulcan-rocket-launches/">Pentagon officials are eager</a> for Vulcan to get flying so they can start checking off a backlog of 25 military space missions the Space Force wants to launch by the end of 2027.</p>
<p>By any measure, the first Vulcan launch in January was a resounding success. On its debut flight, the new rocket delivered a commercial lunar lander to an on-target orbit. The next Vulcan mission, which ULA calls Cert-2, will be the rocket's second certification flight. The Space Force requires ULA to complete two successful flights of the Vulcan rocket before entrusting it to launch national security satellites.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038450#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038450&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A second Colorado poultry farm has reported a case of bird flu in a worker, marking the state's <a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/state-health-officials-closely-monitor-farms-responding-to-avian-flu-spread-in">seventh human case this month</a> amid the ongoing outbreak among dairy cows.</p>
<p>Colorado health officials said the seventh case is, for now, a presumptive positive. That means that the person has tested positive at the state level while confirmatory testing is being carried out at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The presumptive positive worker was at a poultry facility in the state's northeastern Weld County. In recent weeks, six workers at another poultry farm in Weld also tested positive for bird flu. In that facility, a commercial egg layer operation with about 1.8 million birds, workers were infected as they culled chickens known to be infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza. Genetic testing of the virus in the birds and the workers indicated that they were infected with a strain of H5N1 closely related to the virus found spreading in dairy cattle and to dairy farm workers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038535#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038535&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Smart TV owners have been subjected to an increasing amount of ads and tracking. Ad fatigue, only worsened by a trend that sees streaming providers trying to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/netflix-is-kicking-us-subscribers-off-its-cheapest-ad-free-plan-soon/">force customers</a> into subscriptions <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/prime-video-subs-will-soon-see-ads-for-amazon-products-when-they-hit-pause/">with commercials</a>, is understandable. We’re at the point where someone would rather use a <a href="https://carltheperson.com/posts/earlgreytv/">broken laptop dangling off a TV</a> than be subjected to the watchful eye of the TV's native operating system.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/custom-linux-powered-smart-tv-breaks-free-from-ads-and-tracking-enables-ultimate-customizability-earlgreytv-straps-a-laptop-to-the-back-to-unlock-unlimited-control">Tom’s Hardware</a>, a blogger named Carl Riis, who says he’s a software engineer, shared his DIY project, a <a href="https://carltheperson.com/posts/earlgreytv/">Linux-based “smart TV.”</a> Riis’ project doesn’t stand out because it’s the most unique, clever, or clean. In fact, if you’re the type of person willing to pay a lot for TVs with strong aesthetic appeal, like TVs that can<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201121/hisense-canvas-tv-samsung-frame-price-sizes"> look like artwork</a> or appear <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/lg-oled-t-is-a-transparent-77-inch-tv-that-will-arrive-in-2024/">transparent</a>, you’ll be put off by the EarlGreyTV. The system uses an old Lenovo laptop that has a broken keyboard and is attached to a TV by a string. As Riis wrote: “This may look a little insane, but it has been a great way to keep things neat while retaining access to the laptop."</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg"><img alt="The backside of the DIY smart TV." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back-640x378.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">The backside of the DIY smart TV.</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=836VlTPxnFc">Carl the Person/YouTube</a>)</p></div>
<p>The laptop is broken because Riis spilled tea onto the keyboard years ago. The keyboard stopped working, making it hard to turn the laptop on and off. “I have to short two specific pins where the keyboard connects to the motherboard. For this reason, I have the back removed, which probably also helps it run less hot,” Riis wrote.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038479#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038479&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Right now, the world's best weather forecast model is a General Circulation Model, or GCM, put together by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. A GCM is in part based on code that calculates the physics of various atmospheric processes that we understand well. For a lot of the rest, GCMs rely on what's termed "parameterization," which attempts to use empirically determined relationships to approximate what's going on with processes where we don't fully understand the physics.</p>
<p>Lately, GCMs have faced some competition from machine-learning techniques, which train AI systems to recognize patterns in meteorological data and use those to predict the conditions that will result over the next few days. Their forecasts, however, tend to get a bit vague after more than a few days and can't deal with the sort of long-term factors that need to be considered when GCMs are used to study climate change.</p>
<p>On Monday, a team from Google's AI group and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are announcing NeuralGCM, a system that mixes physics-based atmospheric circulation with AI parameterization of other meteorological influences. Neural GCM is computationally efficient and performs very well in weather forecast benchmarks. Strikingly, it can also produce reasonable-looking output for runs that cover decades, potentially allowing it to address some climate-relevant questions. While it can't handle a lot of what we use climate models for, there are some obvious routes for potential improvements.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038449#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038449&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
