<p>Since the acquisition closed in 2021, the Google-fication of Fitbit has largely meant a reduction in features and a focus from Google on getting people onto the Fitbit app. Long-time users have flocked to Fitbit—sometimes upon Fitbit's request—to share hundreds of complaints about recent changes. However, Google has been mostly unresponsive to customer feedback.</p>
<h2>Web app discontinuation angers users</h2>
<p>In June, Google announced it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/googles-abuse-of-fitbit-continues-with-web-app-shutdown/">discontinuing Fitbit.com's online dashboard</a>. After July 8, users seeking similar features that the web app provided have to download the Fitbit mobile app. On Fitbit’s Community forum, a company representative <a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-com-Dashboard/Fitbit-com-web-dashboard-is-transitioning-to-the-Fitbit-app/td-p/5613159">confirmed</a> that users’ “details and logging for activities, nutrition, sleep, and weight” would remain available via the app. However, the change inconvenienced users who preferred or needed to access such data on a bigger screen than a phone's. Worse, the app lacks some of the features of the online dashboard, such as food logging.</p>
<p>Despite these obvious user drawbacks, the need to Googlize Fitbit seemed to drive the change. Announcing the news on the Community forum, a Fitbit company rep said:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037668#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037668&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've ever seen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/how-to-play-and-broadcast-video-games-non-stop-for-a-week-straight/">a record-breaking video game speedrun</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/how-to-play-and-broadcast-video-games-non-stop-for-a-week-straight/">watched a Games Done Quick marathon</a>, you may have entertained fantasies that you, too, could put up some decent times on your favorite old games. Sure, it would probably take a bit of practice, but what these speedrunners are doing doesn't look <em>that difficult</em>, does it? How hard can it be to press a few buttons with good timing for a few minutes?</p>
<p>After spending a few weeks with <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>, I no longer think that way. The game's bite-size chunks of classic Nintendo games highlight the level of precision needed for even a few minutes of speedrunning perfection, not to mention the tedium of practicing the same in-game motions dozens of times to build up the needed muscle memory. In the process, I gained a newfound respect for the skill displayed by the best speedrunners and found a fresh way to experience some classic NES games that I felt I knew backward and forward.</p>
<h2>Gotta go fast</h2>
<p>While <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> draws its name from a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/after-100000-bid-3-more-ultra-rare-nintendo-world-championship-carts-appear/">series</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/nintendo-brings-back-its-world-championships-competition-25-years-later/">competitions</a> dating back to 1990, it draws its inspiration much more directly from the more recent rise of <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/">the online speedrunning community</a>. Thus, the game's main single-player mode is named "Speedrun," tasking players with putting up the fastest times in 150 mini-challenges spread across 13 different Nintendo-developed NES titles.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037726#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037726&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Language is a huge field, and we are novices in this. We know a lot about how different areas of the brain are involved in linguistic tasks, but the details are not very clear,” says Mohsen Jamali, a computational neuroscience researcher at Harvard Medical School who led a recent study into the mechanism of human language comprehension.</p>
<p>“What was unique in our work was that we were looking at single neurons. There is a lot of studies like that on animals—studies in electrophysiology, but they are very limited in humans. We had a unique opportunity to access neurons in humans,” Jamali adds.</p>
<h2>Probing the brain</h2>
<p>Jamali’s experiment involved playing recorded sets of words to patients who, for clinical reasons, had implants that monitored the activity of neurons located in their left prefrontal cortex—the area that’s largely responsible for processing language. “We had data from two types of electrodes: the old-fashioned tungsten microarrays that can pick the activity of a few neurons; and the Neuropixel probes which are the latest development in electrophysiology,” Jamali says. The Neuropixels were first inserted in human patients in 2022 and could record the activity of over a hundred neurons.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037714#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037714&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>US senators want AT&amp;T to explain why it stores massive amounts of call and text message records on a third-party analytics platform that bills itself as an "AI Data Cloud."</p>
<p>AT&amp;T <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/nearly-all-att-subscribers-call-records-stolen-in-snowflake-cloud-hack/">revealed last week</a> that "customer data was illegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform," and that the breach "includes files containing AT&amp;T records of calls and texts of nearly all of AT&amp;T's cellular customers." The third-party platform is Snowflake, and AT&amp;T is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/hackers-steal-significant-volume-of-data-from-hundreds-of-snowflake-customers/">one of many Snowflake corporate customers</a> that had data stolen. Ticketmaster is another notable company affected by the breach.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T and Snowflake each got <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-07-16_snowflake_breach_snowflake.pdf">letters</a> yesterday from US Sens.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Wednesday, researchers reported that they had developed a drone they're calling the CoulombFly, which is capable of self-powered hovering for as long as the Sun is shining. The drone, which is shaped like no aerial vehicle you've ever seen before, combines solar cells, a voltage converter, and an electrostatic motor to drive a helicopter-like propeller—with all components having been optimized for a balance of efficiency and light weight.</p>
<p>Before people get excited about buying one, the list of caveats is extensive. There's no onboard control hardware, and the drone isn't capable of directed flight anyway, meaning it would drift on the breeze if ever set loose outdoors. Lots of the components appear quite fragile, as well. However, the design can be miniaturized, and the researchers built a version that weighs only 9 milligrams.</p>
<h2>Built around a motor</h2>
<p>One key to this development was the researchers' recognition that most drones use electromagnetic motors, which involve lots of metal coils that add significant weight to any system. So, the team behind the work decided to focus on developing a lightweight electrostatic motor. These rely on charge attraction and repulsion to power the motor, as opposed to magnetic interactions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037681#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037681&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This week, Meta <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Zuckerman-v-Meta-Motion-to-Dismiss-7-15-2024.pdf">asked</a> a US district court in California to toss a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zuckerman-v-Meta-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by a professor, Ethan Zuckerman, who fears that Meta will sue him if he releases a tool that would give Facebook users an automated way to easily remove all content from their feeds.</p>
<p>Zuckerman has alleged that the imminent threat of a lawsuit from Meta has prevented him from releasing Unfollow Everything 2.0, suggesting that a cease-and-desist letter sent to the creator of the original Unfollow Everything substantiates his fears.</p>
<p>He's hoping the court will find that either releasing his tool would not breach Facebook's terms of use—which prevent "accessing or collecting data from Facebook 'using automated means'"—or that those terms conflict with public policy.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Inspired by the electric shock capabilities of electric eels, scientists have developed a soft, stretchable "jelly" battery ideal for wearable devices or soft robotics, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. With further testing in living organisms, the batteries might even be useful as brain implants for targeted drug delivery to treat epilepsy, among other conditions.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/study-solitary-electric-eels-sometimes-hunt-in-groups-with-synchronized-zaps/">previously </a><span style="color: #0000ee;"><span style="caret-color: #0000ee;"><u>reported,</u></span></span> the electric eel produces its signature electric discharges—both low and high voltages, depending on the purpose for discharging—via three pairs of abdominal organs composed of modified muscle cells called electrocytes, located symmetrically along both sides of the eel. The brain sends a signal to the electrocytes, opening ion channels and briefly reversing the polarity. The difference in electric potential then generates a current, much like a battery with stacked plates.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt University biologist and neuroscientist <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/catanialab/research/">Kenneth Catania</a> is one of the most prominent scientists studying electric eels these days. He has found that the creatures can <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=136779&amp;org=NSF">vary the degree of voltage</a> in their electrical discharges, using lower voltages for hunting purposes and higher voltages to stun and kill prey. Those higher voltages are also useful for tracking potential prey, akin to how bats use echolocation. One species, Volta's electric eel (<em>Electrophorus voltai</em>), can produce a discharge of up to 860 volts. In theory, if 10 such eels discharged at the same time, they could produce up to 8,600 volts of electricity—sufficient to power 100 light bulbs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037469#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037469&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The best time to truly implement the Markdown markup language into Google Docs was in the early 2010s, but yesterday was a pretty good time, too.</p>
<p>Google Docs was born from the conjoined features of a series of software company acquisitions (Writely, DocVerse, and QuickOffice), plus the remains of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/08/google-wave-why-we-didnt-use-it/">Google Wave</a>, smooshed together into Drive by 2012. By that point, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, a project of web writer John Gruber with input from data activist <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/weve-lost-a-fighter-hundreds-gather-to-mourn-aaron-swartz/">Aaron Swartz</a>, had been solidified and gathering steam for about eight years. Then, for another decade or so, writing in Markdown and writing in Google Docs were two different things, joined together only through browser extensions or onerous import/export tools. An uncountable number of cloud-syncing, collaboration-friendly but Markdown-focused writing tools flourished in that chasm.</p>
<p>In early 2022, the first connecting plank was placed: Docs could "<a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on.html">Automatically detect Markdown</a>," if you enabled it. This expanded the cursory support for numbered and unordered lists and checkboxes to the big items, like headlines, italics, bold, strikethrough, and links. You could write in Markdown in Docs, but you could not paste, nor could you import or export between Docs and Markdown styling.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037582#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037582&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus that spilled from wild birds <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/us-prepares-for-bird-flu-pandemic-with-176m-moderna-vaccine-deal/">into US dairy cows</a> late last year may have recently seeped from a dairy farm in Colorado to a nearby poultry farm, where it then infected five workers tasked with culling the infected chickens</p>
<p>In a press briefing Tuesday, federal officials reported that four of the avian influenza cases have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while the fifth remains a presumptive positive awaiting CDC confirmation.</p>
<p>All five people have shown mild illnesses, though they experienced variable symptoms. Some of the cases involved conjunctivitis, as was seen in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/we-still-dont-understand-how-one-human-apparently-got-bird-flu-from-a-cow/">other human cases linked to the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows</a>. Others in the cluster of five had respiratory and typical flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, sore throat, runny nose, and cough. None of the five cases required hospitalization.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037614#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037614&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Elon Musk said Tuesday that he will move the headquarters of SpaceX and his social media company X from California to Texas in response to a new gender identity law signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
<p>Musk's announcement, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813290895334383820">made via a post on X</a>, follows his decision in 2021 to move the headquarters of the electric car company Tesla from Palo Alto, California, to Austin, Texas, in the wake of coronavirus lockdowns in the Bay Area the year before. Now, two of Musk's other major holdings are making symbolic moves out of California: SpaceX to the company's Starbase launch facility near Brownsville, Texas, and X to Austin.</p>
<p>The new gender identity law, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-15/newsom-bans-schools-from-requiring-that-parents-are-notified-about-student-gender-identity&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFsoeKla2HAxWYxskDHeR7AYUQvOMEKAB6BAgTEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_jrrEgq9o3SX0yldJF7u2">signed by Governor Newsom, a Democrat, on Monday</a>, bars school districts in California from requiring teachers to disclose a change in a student's gender identification or sexual orientation to their parents. Musk wrote on X that the law was the "final straw" prompting the relocation to Texas, where the billionaire executive and his companies could take advantage of lower taxes and light-touch regulations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037525#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037525&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Allies of former President Donald Trump have reportedly drafted a sweeping AI executive order that aims to boost military technology and reduce regulations on AI development, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/16/trump-ai-executive-order-regulations-military/">The Washington Post reported</a>. The plan, which includes a section titled "Make America First in AI," signals a dramatic potential shift in AI policy if Trump returns to the White House in 2025.</p>

<p>The draft order, obtained by the Post, outlines a series of "Manhattan Projects" to advance military AI capabilities. It calls for an immediate review of what it terms "unnecessary and burdensome regulations" on AI development. The approach marks a contrast to the Biden administration's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/biden-ai-executive-order-requires-safety-testing-for-ai-that-poses-serious-risk/">executive order from last October</a>, which imposed new safety testing requirements on advanced AI systems.</p>
<p>The proposed order suggests creating "industry-led" agencies to evaluate AI models and safeguard systems from foreign threats. This approach would likely benefit tech companies already collaborating with the Pentagon on AI projects, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies">Palantir</a>, <a href="https://www.anduril.com/">Anduril</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_AI">Scale AI</a>. Executives from these firms have reportedly expressed support for Trump.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037557#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037557&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The report was written by researchers from the nonprofit organization AI Forensics and Interface, a European think tank specializing in information technology. Researchers found that in a quarter of cases, young users in Germany searching on the app for specific political parties and their politicians in the weeks leading up to the vote on June 5 were instead given suggestions for other parties. In the majority of these cases, they were given suggestions linked to Alternative for Germany (AfD), Germany’s leading far-right party.</p>
<p>It is already well documented that the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-afd-on-tiktok-the-political-battle-for-the-youth/a-68690661">AfD has successfully leveraged TikTok to spread extremism</a> and disinformation to a younger audience, but the new research suggests that the far-right group, which was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-69003733">labeled “extremist” by a German court earlier this year</a>, was aided by the TikTok algorithm itself.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037559#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037559&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As a private and generally secretive company, Valve doesn't offer much outside visibility into its inner workings. So when years' worth of data on the company's employee and aggregate payroll numbers leaked recently, we were eager to take a deep dive to see what those numbers could tell us about the operation and evolution of a company that <a href="https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/steam-statistics.html">has a hand in the majority of PC gaming transactions</a>.</p>
<p>The recent data comes from a poorly redacted document in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/judge-brings-dismissed-steam-antitrust-lawsuit-back-from-the-dead/">Wolfire's antitrust lawsuit against Steam</a>, as <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1811727326138310962">first noticed over the weekend by SteamDB's Pavel Djundik</a>. While the key data in the document has now been properly hidden in the court docket, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">The Verge captured the raw numbers</a> from a table labeled "Employee Headcount and Gross Pay Data, 2003-2021."</p>
<p>Breaking down that data by year and department with some simple graphs and statistics, seen below, gives us outsiders a rare partial glimpse into Valve's organization. All told, it's a bit hard to believe that this lynchpin of the PC gaming world has rested on the work of just a few hundred people for many years now.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037435#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037435&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rite Aid, the third biggest US drug store chain, said that more than 2.2 million of its customers have been swept into a data breach that stole personal information, including driver's license numbers, addresses, and dates of birth.</p>
<p>The company said in mandatory filings with the attorneys general of states including <a href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/c4bace65-85df-4fff-b99f-f8fd390bb41a.html">Maine</a>, <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/2024-1308-rite-aid-corporation/download">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="https://ago.vermont.gov/document/2024-07-15-rite-aid-data-breach-notice-consumers">Vermont</a>, and <a href="https://justice.oregon.gov/consumer/DataBreach/Home/Details/1364031490">Oregon</a> that the stolen data was associated with purchases or attempted purchases of retail products made between June 6, 2017, and July 30, 2018. The data provided included the purchaser's name, address, date of birth, and driver's license number or other form of government-issued ID. No Social Security numbers, financial information, or patient information were included.</p>
<p>“On June 6, 2024, an unknown third party impersonated a company employee to compromise their business credentials and gain access to certain business systems,” the filing stated. “We detected the incident within 12 hours and immediately launched an internal investigation to terminate the unauthorized access, remediate affected systems and ascertain if any customer data was impacted.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037497#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037497&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Can you really call them "leaks" if, every year, Google's Pixel phones end up being sloshed all over the web for months before their official release? What volume of photos, hardware specifications, and other details constitutes a leak, rather than a quick-draining colander?</p>
<p>Google's Pixel 9 series of phones are expected to be launched at an event on August 13. Because those phones need to be certified by various regulators, including the <a href="https://www.ncc.gov.tw/english/">Taiwanese National Communications Commission</a>, or NCC, there are now photos—so many photos—of all four phones Google is expected to announce next month. The Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google's second attempt at a folding phone, have been sized, measured, rated for battery life and charging speed, and even disassembled for a look inside.</p>
<p>As has been suggested by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/googles-pixel-9-gets-its-first-leaked-render-looks-a-lot-like-an-iphone/">Pixel 9 renders</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-pixel-9-might-have-three-models-adding-a-small-pro-phone/">renders of all three non-folding phones</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/first-real-life-pixel-9-pro-pictures-leak-and-it-has-16gb-of-ram/">pictures of prototypes</a>, the NCC pictures confirm that Google's "Pro" phone in this series is the same size as the standard model 9 but with three rear cameras and upgraded, possibly AI-friendly, specs. The NCC filings don't confirm all internal specs, such as the eye-popping 16GB of RAM seen in an earlier Pixel 9 Pro prototype. Google has previously noted that keeping certain generative models to be "RAM-resident" requires more RAM.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037418#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037418&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1813263734707790301">announced</a> the formation of a new AI learning platform called <a href="https://eurekalabs.ai/">Eureka Labs</a>. The venture aims to create an "AI native" educational experience, with its first offering focused on teaching students how to build their own large language model (LLM).</p>

<p>"It's still early days but I wanted to announce the company so that I can build publicly instead of keeping a secret that isn't," Karpathy <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1813263734707790301">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>While the idea of using AI in education isn't particularly new, Karpathy's approach hopes to pair expert-designed course materials with an AI-powered teaching assistant based on an LLM, aiming to provide personalized guidance at scale. This combination seeks to make high-quality education more accessible to a global audience.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037425#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037425&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AI models at Apple, Salesforce, Anthropic, and other major technology players were trained on tens of thousands of YouTube videos without the creators' consent and potentially in violation of YouTube's terms, according to a new report appearing in both <a href="https://www.proofnews.org/apple-nvidia-anthropic-used-thousands-of-swiped-youtube-videos-to-train-ai/">Proof News</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-training-data-apple-nvidia-anthropic/">Wired</a>.</p>
<p>The companies trained their models in part by using "the Pile," a collection by nonprofit <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/about">EleutherAI</a> that was put together as a way to offer a useful dataset to individuals or companies that don't have the resources to compete with Big Tech, though it has also since been used by those bigger companies.</p>
<p>The Pile includes books, Wikipedia articles, and much more. That includes YouTube captions collected by YouTube's captions API, scraped from 173,536 YouTube videos across more than 48,000 channels. That includes videos from big YouTubers like MrBeast, PewDiePie, and popular tech commentator <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1813206956716212511">Marques Brownlee</a>. On X, Brownlee <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1813206956716212511">called out</a> Apple's usage of the dataset, but acknowledged that assigning blame is complex when Apple did not collect the data itself.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Fans of the Netflix series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindhunter_(TV_series)"><em>Mindhunter</em></a> might recall the character of Dr. Wendy Carr (Anna Torv), a psychologist who joins forces with FBI criminal profilers to study the unique psychology of serial killers in hopes of more effectively catching them. But they might not know about the inspiration for the character: Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Burgess">Ann Wolbert Burgess</a>, whose long, distinguished career finally gets the attention it deserves in a new documentary from Hulu, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind:_To_Think_Like_a_Killer"><em>Mastermind: To Think Like a Killer</em></a>.</p>
<p>Burgess herself thought it was "fun" to see a fictional character based on her but noted that Hollywood did take some liberties. "They got it wrong," she told Ars. "They made me a psychologist. I'm a nurse"—specifically, a forensic and psychiatric nurse who pioneered research on sex crimes, victimology, and criminal psychology.</p>
<p><em>Mastermind</em> should go a long way toward setting things right. Hulu brought on Abby Fuller to direct, best known for her work on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table"><em>Chef's Table</em></a> series for Netflix. Fuller might seem like a surprising choice for making a true crime documentary, but the streamer thought she would bring a fresh take to a well-worn genre. "I love the true crime aspects, but I thought we could do something more elevated and cinematic and really make this a character-driven piece about [Ann], with true crime elements," Fuller told Ars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034664#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034664&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
