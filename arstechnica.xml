              <![CDATA[<p>New York's law requiring Internet service providers to offer broadband for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/new-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill/">$15 or $20 a month</a> has spurred legislative efforts in other states to guarantee affordable service for people with low incomes. So far, legislators in Vermont, Massachusetts, and California have proposed laws inspired by the New York requirement.</p>
<p>Christopher Morrow, a newly elected Democratic state legislator in Vermont, introduced a <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2026/H.121">bill</a> on January 29 that is modeled on New York's law. "Affordability is a big issue in Vermont and there are many stories of children who couldn't study properly during COVID for lack of Internet," Morrow told Ars. "It exposed the digital divide. This is a small gesture to help folks out."</p>
<p>Despite industry attempts to block the New York law and other broadband regulations, courts have made it clear that states can impose stricter requirements on Internet service when the Federal Communications Commission isn't regulating Internet providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. That's the situation right now after a federal appeals court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/appeals-court-blocks-fccs-efforts-to-bring-back-net-neutrality-rules/">blocked a Biden-era FCC order</a> that classified ISPs as common carriers and imposed net neutrality rules.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/isps-fear-wave-of-state-laws-after-new-yorks-15-broadband-mandate/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's hard to believe it's been 50 years since the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stepford_Wives_(1975_film)"><em>The Stepford Wives</em></a>, a film based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stepford_Wives">1972 novel</a> of the same name by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Levin">Ira Levin</a>. It might not be to everyone's taste, but its lasting cultural influence is undeniable. A psychological horror/thriller with a hint of sci-fi, the film spawned multiple made-for-TV sequels and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stepford_Wives_(2004_film)">campy 2004 remake</a>, as well as inspiring one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bree_Van_de_Kamp">main characters</a> in the hit series <em>Desperate Housewives</em>. The term "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Stepford_wife">Stepford wife</a>" became part of our shared cultural lexicon, and Jordan Peele even cited the film as one of the key influences for his 2017 masterpiece <em>Get Out</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below for the novel and both film adaptations.)</strong></p>
<p>Levin's novels were a hot commodity in Hollywood at the time, especially after the success of his most famous novel, <em>Rosemary's Baby </em>(1967), adapted into a 1968 horror film starring Mia Farrow. (The novels <em>A Kiss Before Dying, The Boys from Brazil, Sliver</em>, and Levin's play <em>Deathtrap</em> were also adapted to film.) The plot of the <em>The Stepford Wives</em> film follows the novel's plot fairly closely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2025/02/the-stepford-wives-turns-50/">Read full article</a></p>

The work, he complained on social media, was aimed at helping “throat cancer patients recover from radiation therapy faster.” And yet, he noted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dlipomi.bsky.social/post/3li3thme3qc22">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darren-lipomi-5926187_cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-activity-7295812417756835840-HLDF?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJYWNkBP6AxLEpYMfMrbJfVwtOdENA1LE8">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/darren_lipomi/status/1890179491554816498">X</a>, his project was among nearly 3,500 National Science Foundation grants <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-in-woke-dei-grants-at-nsf-releases-full-database">recently described</a> by the likes of Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican and chair of the powerful Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, as “woke DEI” research. These projects, Cruz argued, were driven by “Neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda,” and “far-left ideologies.”</p>
<p>“Needless to say,” Lipomi wrote of his research, “this project is not espousing class warfare.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/4BD2D522-2092-4246-91A5-58EEF99750BC">list</a> of grants was compiled by a group of Senate Republicans last fall and released to the public earlier this month, and while the NSF does not appear to have taken any action in response to the complaints, the list’s existence is adding to an atmosphere of confusion and worry among researchers in the early days of President Donald J. Trump’s second administration. Lipomi, for his part, described the situation as absurd. Others described it as chilling.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/in-war-against-dei-in-science-researchers-see-collateral-damage/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Found in the forests of Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Eastern Australia, <a href="https://www.youtube/watch?v=YTR21os8gTA">birds of paradise</a> are famous for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TefTgbHQiWk">flashy feathers</a> and unusually shaped ornaments, which set the standard for haute couture among birds. Many use these feathers for flamboyant mating displays in which they <a href="https://www.youtube.watch/?v=nkWjhCK4is8">shape-shift</a> into otherworldly forms.</p>
<p>As if this didn’t attract enough attention, we’ve now learned that they also glow in the dark.</p>
<p>Biofluorescent organisms are everywhere, from <a href="https://revealnature.co.uk/2023/08/13/glowing-kingdoms-how-biofluorescent-fungi-illuminate-the-night/#:~:text=Biofluorescent%20mushrooms%20reemit%20light%20in,many%20species%20of%20Biofluorescent%20mushrooms">mushrooms</a> to fish to reptiles and amphibians, but few birds have been identified as having glowing feathers. This is why biologist Rene Martin of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln wanted to investigate. She and her team studied a treasure trove of specimens at the American Museum of Natural History, which have been collected since the 1800s, and found that 37 of the 45 known species of birds of paradise have feathers that fluoresce.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/flashy-exotic-birds-can-actually-glow-in-the-dark/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The mantis shrimp comes equipped with its own weapons. It has claws that look like permanently clenched fists that are known as dactyl clubs. But when it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Li1k5hGB">smashes</a> the shells of its prey, these fists come out of it undamaged.</p>
<p>When throwing punches, mantis shrimp can strike at the speed of a .22 caliber bullet (about 1,316 kmph or 818 mph)—one of the <a href="https://guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/4/the-mantis-shrimp-packs-the-most-powerful-punch-in-the-animal-kingdom-567501">fastest movements</a> in the animal kingdom. That generates a force over a thousand times their body weight. However, unleashing that much energy can backfire because the shockwaves it produces could seriously damage an animal’s soft tissue. None of that seems to affect the mantis shrimp. Now we finally know why.</p>
<p>When a team of researchers from Northwestern University studied the dactyl clubs of one mantis shrimp species, they found that they have layered structures that selectively block sound waves, acting as protective gear against vibrations that could otherwise harm the shrimp. These types of structures, known as phononic mechanisms, filter out sound waves that could otherwise cause nerve and soft tissue trauma.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/the-seemingly-indestructible-fists-of-the-mantis-shrimp-can-take-a-punch/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Harbinger provided transportation from LAX to its HQ in Garden Grove, California, so Ars could drive its prototype truck. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>GARDEN GROVE, Calif.—There's no shortage of companies looking to reinvent the delivery experience using everything from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/amazon-begins-testing-deliveries-with-sidewalk-drones/">sidewalk drones</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/amazon-adds-its-10000th-rivian-electric-delivery-van-to-its-fleet/">electric vans</a>. Some are succeeding, but many more have failed by trying to radically rethink the simple, age-old task of getting stuff from one place to another.</p>
<p>Harbinger likewise wants to shake up part of that industry but in a decidedly understated way. If you found yourself stuck in traffic behind one of the company's all-electric vehicles, there's a good chance you wouldn't even notice. The only difference? The lack of diesel smoke and clatter.</p>
<p>From the outside, Harbinger's pre-production machine looks identical to the standard flat-sided, vinyl-wrapped delivery vehicles that seemingly haven't changed in decades. That's because they really haven't. Those familiar UPS and FedEx machines are built on common chassis like Ford's F-59 or Freightliner's MT45, with ladder chassis and leaf spring designs dating back to the earliest days of trucking.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/harbingers-electric-van-drives-like-a-classic-and-thats-the-point/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Isar Aerospace, a German startup founded seven years ago, is positioned to become the first in a new generation of European launch companies to reach orbit with a privately funded rocket.</p>
<p>The company announced Friday that the first stage of its Spectrum rocket recently completed a 30-second test-firing on a launch pad in the northernmost reaches of mainland Europe. The nine-engine booster ignited on a launch pad at Andøya Spaceport in Norway on February 14.</p>
<p>The milestone follows a similar test-firing of the Spectrum rocket's second stage last year. With these two accomplishments, Isar Aerospace says its launch vehicle is qualified for flight.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/german-startup-to-attempt-the-first-orbital-launch-from-western-europe/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An ongoing measles outbreak that began in<a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-erupts-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/"> one of Texas' least vaccinated counties</a> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/texas-measles-outbreak-climbs-to-48-cases-almost-all-kids-13-hospitalized/">mushroomed</a> to 90 cases across a cluster of seven counties in the state, according to <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-21-2025">an update by the Texas Department of State Health Services on Friday</a>.</p>
<p>The outbreak may have also spread across the border to New Mexico, where nine cases have been reported. In an email to Ars, Robert Nott, the communications director for the New Mexico Department of Health, said that as of today, the department has not confirmed a connection between the nine cases and any of the confirmed cases in Texas.</p>
<p>However, all nine of the cases are in Lea County, New Mexico, which sits at the border with Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak. Of Texas' 90 cases, 57 are in Gaines, which has a vaccination rate among kindergarteners of just 82 percent this school year. The lack of a clear connection between the Texas and New Mexico cases may be yet more worrying because it suggests undetected community spread and a heightened risk of transmission in Lea, <a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/publication/view/general/9115/">the health department noted in an alert last week</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/texas-measles-outbreak-may-have-spread-to-new-mexico-total-cases-near-100/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>You might suspect that a one-line bill about Bigfoot that bears the number "666" is a joke, but <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB666">AB-666</a> is apparently a serious offering from <a href="https://a02.asmdc.org">California Assemblymember Chris Rogers</a>. Rogers represents a California district known for its Bigfoot sightings (or "sightings," depending on your persuasion—many of these <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-dec-06-me-wallace6-story.html">have been faked</a>), and he wants to make Bigfoot the "official cryptid" of the state.</p>
<p>His bill notes that California already has <a href="https://www.library.ca.gov/california-history/state-symbols/">many official symbols</a>, including the golden poppy (official flower), the California redwood (official tree), the word "Eureka" (official motto), the red-legged frog (official amphibian), the grizzly bear (official animal), swing dancing (official dance), and the saber-toothed cat (official fossil). The state has so many of these that there are separate categories for freshwater fish (golden trout) and marine fish (garibaldi). So why not, Rogers wants to know, "designate Bigfoot as the official state cryptid"?</p>
<p>That's... pretty much the bill, which was introduced this week and already has Bigfoot advocates excited. SFGate <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/northcoast/article/california-takes-steps-toward-officially-20175812.php">talked to Matt Moneymaker</a>, who it describes as "a longtime Bigfoot researcher and former star of the Animal Planet series <em>Finding Bigfoot</em>," about the bill. Moneymaker loves it, noting that he has personally “had a face-to-face encounter one time, after which I was absolutely sure they existed because I had one about 20 feet in front of me, growling at me.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/under-new-bill-bigfoot-could-become-californias-official-cryptid/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>More than a year’s worth of internal communications from one of the world’s most active ransomware syndicates have been published online in a leak that exposes tactics, trade secrets, and internal rifts of its members.</p>
<p>The communications come in the form of logs of more than 200,000 messages members of Black Basta sent to each other over the Matrix chat platform from September 2023 to September 2024, researchers said. The person who published the messages said the move was in retaliation for Black Basta targeting Russian banks. The leaker's identity is unknown; it’s also unclear if the person responsible was an insider or someone outside the group who somehow gained access to the confidential logs.</p>
<h2>How to be your own worst enemy</h2>
<p>Last year, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Black Basta had targeted 12 of the 16 US critical infrastructure sectors in attacks mounted on 500 organizations around the world. One notable attack targeted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/black-basta-ransomware-group-is-imperiling-critical-infrastructure-groups-warn/">Ascention</a>, a St. Louis-based health care system with 140 hospitals in 19 states. Other victims <a href="https://flashpoint.io/blog/understanding-black-basta-ransomware/">include</a> Hyundai Europe, UK-based outsourcing firm Capita, the Chilean Government Customs Agency, and UK utility company Southern Water.

              <![CDATA[<p>As the owner of a 3-year-old laptop, I feel the finite lifespan of lithium batteries acutely. It's still a great machine, but the cost of a battery replacement would take me a significant way down the path of upgrading to a newer, even greater machine. If only there were some way to just plug it in overnight and come back to a rejuvenated battery.</p>
<p>While that sounds like science fiction, a team of Chinese researchers has identified a chemical that can deliver fresh lithium to well-used batteries, extending their life. Unfortunately, getting it to work requires that the battery has been constructed with this refresh in mind. Plus it hasn't been tested with the sort of lithium chemistry that is commonly used in consumer electronics.</p>
<h2>Finding the right chemistry</h2>
<p>The degradation of battery performance is largely a matter of its key components gradually dropping out of use within the battery. Through repeated cyclings, bits of electrodes fragment and lose contact with the conductors that collect current, while lithium can end up in electrically isolated complexes. There's no obvious way to re-mobilize these lost materials, so the battery's capacity drops. Eventually, the only way to get more capacity is to recycle the internals into a completely new battery.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/researchers-figure-out-how-to-get-fresh-lithium-into-batteries/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Clone Robotics <a href="https://x.com/clonerobotics/status/1892250639360561234">released video footage</a> of its Protoclone humanoid robot, a full-body machine that uses synthetic muscles to create unsettlingly human-like movements. In the video, the robot hangs suspended from the ceiling as its limbs twitch and kick, marking what the company claims is a step toward its goal of creating household-helper robots.</p>
<p>Poland-based <a href="https://www.clonerobotics.com/">Clone Robotics</a> designed the Protoclone with a polymer skeleton that replicates 206 human bones. The company built the robot with the hopes that it will one day be able to operate human tools and perform tasks like doing laundry, washing dishes, and preparing basic meals.</p>
<p>The Protoclone reportedly contains over 1,000 artificial muscles built with the company's "Myofiber" technology, which builds on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_artificial_muscles">McKibbin pneumatic muscle</a> concept. These muscles work through mesh tubes containing balloons that contract when filled with hydraulic fluid, mimicking human muscle function. A 500-watt electric pump serves as the robot's "heart," pushing fluid at 40 standard liters per minute.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/dangling-twitching-human-robot-with-synthetic-muscles-makes-its-debut/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>PC- and accessory-maker Asus has never been one to shy away from a strange idea, whether it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_PadFone">a tablet</a> that you need to slide your smartphone into before you can use it, <a href="https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1044627/">a laptop touchpad that's also a screen</a>, or going with "<a href="https://www.sloganlist.com/Technology-slogans/ASUS-Slogans.html">Rock Solid, Heart Touching</a>" as a corporate slogan. But an announcement the company made today stands out: Asus is launching something called the <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-fragrance-mouse-release/">Asus Fragrance Mouse</a>, a fairly regular-looking wireless mouse that also smells.</p>
<p>Yes, the main differentiating feature of the Fragrance Mouse is a "refillable vial" in its underside, next to the place where you put the battery and store its 2.4 GHz USB wireless receiver when not in use. The vial stores "aromatic oils" that "can be washed and refilled with different scents." Asus doesn't make any specific recommendations about the scents that you can put in the vial, so you have a lot of latitude as to what, exactly, you can make your mouse smell like.</p>
<p>Aside from the customizable stink, the Fragrance Mouse is a reasonably full-featured functional PC accessory. It supports Bluetooth as well as the USB wireless dongle, three DPI levels (1,200, 1,600, and 2,400) for customizing responsiveness, and understated white and pink color options. Asus says the mouse's switches are rated for 10 million clicks, ensuring that you will be able to smell your mouse for years to come.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/asus-new-fragrance-mouse-is-a-wireless-mouse-that-also-smells/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On May 16, 2024, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houston_derecho">powerful derecho</a> swept through Houston, killing seven people and causing significant damage to several of the city's towering skyscrapers. Those buildings were constructed to withstand much stronger hurricane-force winds up to 67 meters per second, as one would get with a Category 4 hurricane. The derecho's winds peaked at 40 meters per second, well below that threshold. And when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl">Hurricane Beryl</a> hit Houston that July with roughly comparable wind speeds of 36 meters per second, the damage wasn't nearly so severe. Why would that be the case?</p>
<p>Engineers at Florida International University (FIU) in Miami think they've found the answer, according to a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/built-environment/articles/10.3389/fbuil.2024.1514523/full">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Built Environment. "We show that a type of highly localized strong winds called ‘downbursts,’ which were generated during the May derecho, can significantly impact tall buildings and facades due to their unique characteristics in comparison to hurricanes,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073886?">said co-author Amal Elawady</a>. This is particularly the case for skyscrapers that are close together, creating a "wind-channeling" interference effect that increases pressure on walls and windows.</p>
<p>One might assume that hurricanes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho">derechos</a> are similar in that they both produce markedly intense winds, but the origin and characteristics of those winds are very different, per the authors. Hurricanes are vast tropical storms that form over warm ocean waters and affect large areas, usually lasting for several days, accompanied by heavy rains, storm surges, waves, and yes, high winds. By contrast, derechos and downbursts are much more localized convective systems, producing hurricane-force winds but over a much smaller area and shorter period of time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/why-houstons-2024-derecho-did-more-damage-than-hurricane-beryl/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk apparently no longer believes that crowdsourcing fact-checking through Community Notes can never be manipulated and is, thus, the best way to correct bad posts on his social media platform X.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Community Notes are supposed to be added to posts to limit misinformation spread after a broad consensus is reached among X users with diverse viewpoints on what corrections are needed. But Musk now claims a "fix" is needed to prevent supposedly outside influencers from allegedly gaming the system.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"Unfortunately, @CommunityNotes is increasingly being gamed by governments &amp; legacy media," Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1892613981426102465">wrote</a> on X.

              <![CDATA[<p>High-revving naturally aspirated engines and their associated screaming soundtracks might be on their way back to Formula 1. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/lighter-nimbler-more-hybrid-power-he-f1-car-of-2026/">Not with next year's rule changes</a>—that will see even bigger lithium-ion batteries and an even more powerful electric motor, paired with a turbocharged V6. But the sport is starting to think more seriously about the technical rules that will go into effect in 2030, and in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGTg6eQi-7K/?igsh=dWJtcXM2cWhocHV3">an Instagram post</a> yesterday, the man in charge of those rules signaled that he's open to cars that might be louder, lighter, and less complicated.</p>
<p>Mohammed Ben Sulayem's tenure as president of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile has been packed with controversy. The former rally driver has alienated many F1 drivers with clampdowns on jewelry and, most recently, swearing, as well as a refusal to explain what happens to the money the FIA collects as fines.</p>
<p>He also ruffled feathers when the FIA opened up the entry process for new teams into the sport and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/cadillac-wants-to-enter-formula-1-with-andretti-global/">then approved an entry by Andretti Global</a>.

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Just days after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/a-sicker-america-senate-confirms-robert-f-kennedy-jr-as-health-secretary/">anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became the country's top health official</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already pulled back some of its efforts to protect Americans with safe, lifesaving vaccines. The agency has indefinitely postponed a public meeting of its vaccine advisory committee and killed a campaign promoting seasonal flu shots.</p>
<p>Last weekend, a Washington Post columnist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crampell.bsky.social/post/3licr3yinlc2o">noted on Bluesky</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241217184035/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html#content-sources">the CDC's effective "Wild to Mild" seasonal flu shot campaign</a> had vanished. The campaign highlighted how the seasonal vaccines can prevent influenza infections from becoming severe or life-threatening. It used animals as an analogy for the diminished threat of the flu virus after vaccination, juxtaposing a lion and a domestic kitten in one ad while showing an elephant and a mouse in another. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html">The CDC page</a> no longer leads to a "not found" landing page, but it wasn't restored either. It now redirects to a 2023 article announcing the campaign, which does not contain the shareable resources found on the original page. The removal is startling given that the US is currently battling one of the worst flu seasons in 15 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated">NPR first reported</a> that CDC staff were told in a meeting Wednesday, February 19, the campaign was halted. In a story Thursday, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/">Stat News added more context</a> to the decision. According to the outlet's sources, the Department of Health and Human Services’ assistant secretary for public affairs informed the CDC that Kennedy wanted vaccine advertisements to emphasize "informed consent" instead.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/rfk-jr-promptly-cancels-vaccine-advisory-meeting-pulls-flu-shot-campaign/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In 2021, Linux kernel leaders, like founder and leader Linus Torvalds himself, were impressed with the language but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/linus-torvalds-weighs-in-on-rust-language-in-the-linux-kernel/">had a "wait and see" approach</a>. <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust for Linux</a> gained supporters and momentum, and in October 2022, Torvalds approved a pull request <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/05/rust_kernel_pull_request_pulled/">adding support for Rust code in the kernel</a>.</p>
<p>By late 2024, however, Rust enthusiasts were frustrated with stalls and blocks on their efforts, with the Rust for Linux lead quitting over "<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">nontechnical nonsense</a>." Torvalds said at the time that he understood it was slow, but that "old-time kernel developers are used to C" and "not exactly excited about having to learn a new language." Still, this could be considered a normal amount of open source debate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/linux-leaders-pave-a-path-for-rust-in-kernel-while-supporting-c-veterans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In December, roughly a dozen employees inside a manufacturing company received a tsunami of phishing messages that was so big they were unable to perform their day-to-day functions. A little over an hour later, the people behind the email flood had burrowed into the nether reaches of the company's network. This is a story about how such intrusions are occurring faster than ever before and the tactics that make this speed possible.</p>
<p>The speed and precision of the attack—laid out in posts published <a href="https://www.reliaquest.com/blog/blink-and-theyre-in-how-rapid-phishing-attacks-exploit-weaknesses/">Thursday</a> and <a href="https://www.reliaquest.com/blog/racing-the-clock-outpacing-accelerating-attacks/">last month</a>—are crucial elements for success. As awareness of ransomware attacks increases, security companies and their customers have grown savvier at detecting breach attempts and stopping them before they gain entry to sensitive data. To succeed, attackers have to move ever faster.</p>
<h2>Breakneck breakout</h2>
<p>ReliaQuest, the security firm that responded to this intrusion, said it tracked a 22 percent reduction in the “breakout time” threat actors took in 2024 compared with a year earlier. In the attack at hand, the breakout time—meaning the time span from the moment of initial access to lateral movement inside the network—was just 48 minutes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/notorious-crooks-broke-into-a-company-network-in-48-minutes-heres-how/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>YouTube dominates online video, but it's absolutely crammed full of ads these days. A YouTube Premium subscription takes care of that, but ad blockers <em>do</em> exist. Google seems to have gotten the message—a cheaper streaming subscription is on the way that drops YouTube Music from the plan. You may have to give up more than music to get the cheaper rate, though.</p>
<p>Google started testing cheaper YouTube subscriptions in a few international markets, including Germany and Australia, over the past year. Those users have been offered the option of subscribing to the YouTube Premium plan, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/youtube-premium-gets-a-2-price-increase-now-13-99-a-month/">runs $13.99 in the US</a>, or a new plan that costs about half as much. For example, in Australia, the options are AU$23 for YouTube Premium or AU$12 for "YouTube Premium Lite."</p>
<p>The Lite plan drops YouTube Music but keeps ad-free YouTube, which is all most people want anyway. Based on the early tests, these plans will probably drop a few other features that you'd miss, including background playback and offline downloads. However, this plan could cost as little as $7–$8 in the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-plans-cheaper-ad-free-youtube-subscription-without-music/">Read full article</a></p>
