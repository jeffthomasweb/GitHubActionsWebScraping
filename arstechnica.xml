            <![CDATA[Accepting AI-written code without understanding how it works is growing in popularity.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>For many people, coding is about telling a computer what to do and having the computer perform those precise actions repeatedly. With the rise of AI tools like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, it's now possible for someone to describe a program in English and have the AI model translate it into working code without ever understanding how the code works. Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy recently gave this practice a name—"vibe coding"—and it's gaining traction in tech circles.</p>
<p>The technique, enabled by large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, has attracted attention for potentially lowering the barrier to entry for software creation. But questions remain about whether the approach can reliably produce code suitable for real-world applications, even as tools like <a href="https://docs.cursor.com/composer">Cursor Composer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>, and <a href="https://docs.replit.com/replitai/agent">Replit Agent</a> make the process increasingly accessible to non-programmers.</p>
<p>Instead of being about control and precision, vibe coding is all about surrendering to the flow. On February 2, Karpathy introduced the term in a post on X, writing, "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding,' where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists." He described the process in deliberately casual terms: "I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google has become so integral to online navigation that its name became a verb, meaning "to find things on the Internet." Soon, Google might just <em>tell</em> you what's on the Internet instead of showing you. The company has <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-search/">announced</a> an expansion of its AI search features, powered by Gemini 2.0. Everyone will soon see more AI Overviews at the top of the results page, but Google is also testing a more substantial change in the form of AI Mode. This version of Google won't show you the 10 blue links at all—Gemini completely takes over the results in AI Mode.</p>
<p>This marks the debut of Gemini 2.0 in Google search. Google announced the first Gemini 2.0 models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">in December 2024</a>, beginning with the streamlined Gemini 2.0 Flash. The heavier versions of Gemini 2.0 are still in testing, but Google says it has tuned AI Overviews with this model to offer help with harder questions in the areas of math, coding, and multimodal queries.</p>
<p>With this update, you will begin seeing AI Overviews on more results pages, and minors with Google accounts will see AI results for the first time. In fact, even logged out users will see AI Overviews soon. This is a big change, but it's only the start of Google's plans for AI search.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>It was not until February 22, 2024, that another American-built spacecraft made a soft landing on the Moon. This was the Nova-C <em>Odysseus</em> lander built by Intuitive Machines. It landed, toppled over, but still completed most of its scientific experiments.</p>
<p>This first successful landing on the Moon by the first privately built spacecraft ended a 51-year gap, or 18,700 days. It was a long freaking time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/after-skidding-into-the-moon-intuitive-machines-hopes-to-stick-second-landing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Brother laser printers are popular recommendations for people seeking a printer with none of the nonsense. By nonsense, we mean printers<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-ceo-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-fights-viruses/"> suddenly bricking features</a>, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">scanning</a> or printing, if users install third-party cartridges. Some printer firms outright block third-party toner and ink, despite customer blowback and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-sued-again-for-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-accused-of-monopoly/">lawsuits</a>. Brother’s laser printers have historically worked fine with non-Brother accessories. A YouTube video posted this week, though, as well as older social media posts, claim that Brother has gone to the dark side and degraded laser printer functionality with third-party cartridges. Brother tells Ars that this isn’t true.</p>
<p>On March 3, YouTuber Louis Rossman posted a video saying that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpHX_9fHNqE">Brother turns heel &amp; becomes anti-consumer printer company</a>.” The video, spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/printers/brother-accused-of-locking-down-third-party-printer-ink-cartridges-via-firmware-updates-removing-older-firmware-versions-from-support-portals">Tom’s Hardware</a>, has 163,000 views as of this writing and seems to be based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/printers/comments/s9b2eg/brother_mfc_firmware_update_nongenuine_toner_now/">a Reddit post </a>from 2022. In that post, Reddit user 20Factorial said that firmware update W1.56 caused the automatic color registration feature to stop working on his Brother MFC-3750 when using third-party cartridges.</p>
<p>“With the colors not able to be aligned, the printer is effectively non-functional,” 20Factorial said. The Redditor went on to say that when asked, a Brother customer service agent confirmed that “the printer is non-functional without genuine toner.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/brother-denies-using-firmware-updates-to-brick-printers-with-third-party-ink/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[For $549 and $599, AMD comes close to knocking out Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>AMD is a company that knows a thing or two about capitalizing on a competitor's weaknesses. The company got through its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/amd-on-ropes-from-the-top-of-the-mountain-to-the-deepest-valleys/">early-2010s nadir</a> partially because its Ryzen CPUs struck just as Intel's current manufacturing woes began to set in, first with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/amd-ryzen-review/">somewhat-worse CPUs that were great value for the money</a> and later with CPUs that were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-zen-3-testing-with-amds-ryzen-9-5900x-and-5950x/">better than anything Intel could offer</a>.</p>
<p>Nvidia's untrammeled dominance of the consumer graphics card market should also be an opportunity for AMD. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have given buyers very little to get excited about, with an unreachably expensive high-end 5090 refresh and modest-at-best gains from 5080 and 5070-series cards that are <em>also</em> pretty expensive by historical standards, when you can buy them at all. Tech YouTubers—both the people making the videos and the people leaving comments underneath them—have been almost uniformly unkind to the 50 series, hinting at consumer frustrations and pent-up demand for competitive products from other companies.</p>
<p>Enter AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. These are aimed right at the middle of the current GPU market at the intersection of high sales volume and decent profit margins. They promise good 1440p and entry-level 4K gaming performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous-generation cards, with fixes for long-time shortcomings (ray-tracing performance, video encoding, and upscaling quality) that should, in theory, make them more tempting for people looking to ditch Nvidia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/">Read full article</a></p>

      A special look at the second season of <em>Andor</em>.

<p>Disney+ dropped the first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/the-revolution-starts-now-with-andor-s2-teaser/">action-packed teaser</a> for the second season of <em>Andor</em> just last week. The streaming platform followed up today with a special three-minute featurette on the making of the Star Wars series' sophomore outing—including a hint that we'll probably be seeing a major tragic event in the Star Wars canon this season.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for season 1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/official-andor-trailer-shows-us-what-the-birth-of-a-revolution-looks-like/">previously reported</a>, the story begins five years before the events of <em>Rogue One</em>, with the Empire's destruction of Cassian Andor's (Diego Luna) home world, and follows his transformation from a "revolution-averse" cynic to a major player in the nascent rebellion who is willing to sacrifice himself to save the galaxy. S1 left off with Cassian returning to Ferrix for the funeral of his adoptive mother, Maarva (Fiona Shaw), rescuing a friend from prison, and dodging an assassination attempt. A post-credits scene showed prisoners assembling the firing dish of the now-under-construction Death Star.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/an-inside-look-at-the-making-of-andor-s2/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google is no stranger to antitrust scrutiny, but the walls may be closing in. As the next phase of Google's search trial nears, the company's lawyers have reportedly met with representatives from the US Department of Justice in hopes of heading off a breakup. Google is reportedly pushing the argument that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/welcome-to-googles-nightmare-us-reveals-plan-to-destroy-search-monopoly/">forcing it to spin off parts of the business</a> and limit certain investments would constitute a national security threat.</p>
<p>Google's antitrust situation got much worse this past August when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">lost the long-running case</a> targeting its search business. With Google branded yet again as a monopolist, the DOJ asked for stiff penalties, seeking to have US District Judge Amit Mehta force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser and end payments for search engine placement with other firms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-04/google-urges-trump-doj-to-reverse-course-on-breaking-up-company">According to Bloomberg</a>, Google met with the DOJ team last week to make the case for a lighter regulatory touch. Specifically, Google has stepped up its claims that forcing it to spin-off Chrome and limit AI investments could harm US national security, as well as security at the user level.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-cites-national-security-as-it-urges-doj-to-drop-demand-for-breakup/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Donald Trump finally made it clear to Congress that he wants to kill the CHIPS and Science Act—a $280 billion bipartisan law Joe Biden signed in 2022 to bring more semiconductor manufacturing into the US and put the country at the forefront of research and innovation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has long expressed frustration with the high cost of the CHIPS Act, telling Congress on Tuesday that it's a "horrible, horrible thing" to "give hundreds of billions of dollars" in subsidies to companies that he claimed "take our money" and "don't spend it," Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-wants-kill-527-billion-semiconductor-chips-subsidy-law-2025-03-05/">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"You should get rid of the CHIPS Act, and whatever is left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt," Trump said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/china-aims-to-recruit-top-us-scientists-as-trump-tries-to-kill-the-chips-act/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge rejected Elon Musk's request to block OpenAI's planned conversion from a nonprofit to for-profit entity but expedited the case so that Musk's core claims can be addressed in a trial before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Musk had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/elon-musk-asks-court-to-block-openai-conversion-from-nonprofit-to-for-profit/">filed a motion</a> for preliminary injunction in US District Court for the Northern District of California, claiming that OpenAI's for-profit conversation "violates the terms of Musk's donations" to the company. But Musk failed to meet the burden of proof needed for an injunction, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.433688/gov.uscourts.cand.433688.121.0.pdf">ruled yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>"Plaintiffs Elon Musk, [former OpenAI board member] Shivon Zilis, and X.AI Corp. ('xAI') collectively move for a preliminary injunction barring defendants from engaging in various business activities, which plaintiffs claim violate federal antitrust and state law," Rogers wrote. "The relief requested is extraordinary and rarely granted as it seeks the ultimate relief of the case on an expedited basis, with a cursory record, and without the benefit of a trial."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/musk-loses-bid-to-stop-openais-for-profit-shift-but-can-make-his-case-in-trial/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A surprise find in my inbox this morning: news from Volkswagen about a pair of new electric vehicles it has in the works. Even better, they're both small and affordable, bucking the supersized, overpriced trend of the past few years. But before we get too excited, there's currently no guarantee either will go on sale in North America.</p>
<p>Next year sees the European debut of the ID. 2all, a small electric hatchback that VW wants to sell for less than 25,000 euros ($26,671). But the ID. 2all isn't really news: VW showed off the concept, as well as a GTI version, back in September 2023.</p>
<p>What is new is the ID. EVERY1, an all-electric entry-level car that, if the concept is anything to go by, is high on style and charm. It does not have a retro shape like a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/2025-mini-cooper-and-countryman-evs-bring-more-range-style/">Mini</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/why-the-fiat-500e-could-be-your-ideal-second-ev/">Fiat 500</a>—VW could easily have succumbed to a retread of the Giugiaro-styled Golf from 1976 but opted for something new instead. The design language involves three pillars: stability, likability, and surprise elements, or "secret sauce," according to VW's description.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/volkswagen-gets-the-message-cheap-stylish-evs-coming-from-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Analysts are warning that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trumps-25-tariffs-take-effect-canadian-pm-calls-it-a-very-dumb-thing/">the Trump administration's recently implemented tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China</a> could lead to price increases and supply issues for video game software and hardware in the United States.</p>
<p>The effects could be particularly pronounced for physical game discs, which are now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgb3euyyik2e">overwhelmingly produced in Mexico</a>. A 25 percent tax on discs shipped in from Mexico could lead to "a sharp downtick in the number of disc-based games that get released physically in the US," Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lgb3euyyik2e">said on social media</a>.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't surprise me to see physical games that would be subject to tariffs simply not get made, with pubs moving to an all digital strategy," Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ljkknpfsa22x">added recently</a>. That would accelerate a trend that has been building for years, making disc-based releases <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/fewer-and-fewer-console-games-are-seeing-a-physical-release/">a relative market niche</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/thanks-to-new-tariffs-many-more-physical-game-discs-may-simply-not-get-made/">Read full article</a></p>

Trailblazer appears to be spinning and out of contact with engineers back on Earth.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/trailblazer/2025/03/04/nasa-continuing-efforts-to-contact-command-lunar-trailblazer/">an update published</a> on Tuesday evening, the space agency acknowledged that a mission operations team at the California Institute of Technology is continuing its efforts to reestablish contact with the 200-kg spacecraft intended to orbit the Moon.</p>
<p>"Based on telemetry before the loss of signal last week and ground-based radar data collected March 2, the team believes the spacecraft is spinning slowly in a low-power state," the space agency said. "They will continue to monitor for signals should the spacecraft orientation change to where the solar panels receive more sunlight, increasing their output to support higher-power operations and communication."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/nasa-just-lost-yet-another-one-of-its-low-cost-planetary-missions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos has moved to introduce a tough Amazon-like approach to his rocket maker Blue Origin, as the world’s third-richest person seeks to revive a company that has lagged behind Elon Musk’s SpaceX.</p>
<p>The space company’s founder and sole shareholder has pushed to shift its internal culture with management hires from Amazon, while implementing policies akin to the ecommerce giant, including longer working hours and more aggressive targets.</p>
<p>Half a dozen current and former senior Blue Origin employees told the Financial Times that the billionaire had taken a prominent role in helping reset a company that has reached orbit only once, compared with SpaceX achieving the feat more than 450 times.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/jeff-bezos-brings-amazon-work-culture-to-blue-origin/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple’s first Mac Studio refresh in nearly two years is a welcome update, injecting fresh life into two computers that were still getting by with M2 chips. But the company took a bit of a strange approach to the update, giving an M4-series Max chip to the lower-end Studio but an M3 Ultra chip to the high-end model.</p>
<p>These processors are both performance upgrades from the M2 Max and M2 Ultra, and the M3 Ultra is so huge that it should have no trouble outrunning the M4 Max despite its slightly older CPU and GPU architecture. But it’s still a departure from past practice, where Apple would keep the Studio’s chip generation in lockstep.</p>

<p>When asked why the high-end Mac Studio was getting an M3 Ultra chip instead of an M4 Ultra, Apple told us that not every chip generation will get an “Ultra” tier. This is, as far as I can recall, the first time that Apple has said anything like this in public.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-announces-m3-ultra-and-says-not-every-generation-will-see-an-ultra-chip/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-studio/">its first Mac Studio updates</a> in nearly two years today, a few months after bringing the M4 and M4 Pro chips to the Mac mini.</p>
<p>As before, Apple offers a lower-end and a higher-end configuration of the Mac Studio. The lower-end model is pretty much what you expect: It gives you the same M4 Max processor Apple introduced in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/review-the-fastest-of-the-m4-macbook-pros-might-be-the-least-interesting-one/">the high-end MacBook Pro last year</a>. It has up to 16 CPU cores (10 P-cores, 4 E-cores), up to 40 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine.</p>
<p>The $1,999 base model comes with 14 CPU cores (10 P-cores, 4 E-cores), 32 GPU cores, 36GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. That model's RAM can't be upgraded until you step up to the fully-enabled M4 Max, which also gets you 48GB of RAM for $300. From there, the desktop can be upgraded with either 64GB or 128GB of RAM, same as the MacBook Pro.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-intros-new-mac-studio-models-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">Read full article</a></p>

And in most ways, it's a straightforward update, with no major changes to the laptop's physical design, screen specs, keyboard, or ports.</p>
<p>The most important update is the price. The 13-inch M4 MacBook Air will start at $999, a $100 price cut compared to the M3 Air and the same price that Apple set for the M2 Air last year when the M3 models came out. The 15-inch model will also get a $100 cut, from $1,299 to $1,199. These baseline configurations still come with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, plus the 8-core version of the M4's GPU.</p>
<p>The M2 version will continue to be sold as a budget model in some countries, but the US isn't one of them. Apple will also continue to sell a cheaper version of the M1 MacBook Air through Walmart, which it has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/walmart-resurrects-the-m1-macbook-air-as-an-entry-level-699-laptop/">doing since March 2024</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/macbook-air-gets-the-m4-a-new-blue-color-up-to-32gb-of-ram-and-a-100-price-cut/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One thing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536960/Shadowveil_Legend_of_The_Five_Rings/"><em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em></a> does well is invoke terror. Not just the terror of an overwhelming mass of dark energy encroaching on your fortress, which is what the story suggests; more so, the terror of hoping your little computer-controlled fighters will do the smart thing and then being forced to watch, helpless, as they are consumed by algorithmic choices, bad luck, your strategies, or some combination of all three.</p>
<p><em>Shadowveil,</em> the first video game based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Five_Rings">more than 30-year-old <em>Legend of the Five Rings </em>fantasy franchise</a>, is a roguelite auto-battler. You pick your Crab Clan hero (berserker hammer-wielder or tactical support type), train up some soldiers, and assign all of them abilities, items, and buffs you earn as you go. When battle starts, you choose which hex to start your fighters on, double-check your load-outs, then click to start and watch what happens. You win and march on, or you lose and regroup at base camp, buying some upgrades with your last run's goods.</p>

<p>In my impressions after roughly seven hours of playing, <em>Shadowveil </em>could do more to soften its learning curve, but it presents a mostly satisfying mix of overwhelming odds and achievement. What's irksome now could get patched, and what's already there is intriguing, especially for the price.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/shadowveil-is-a-stylish-tough-single-player-auto-battler/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In late 2013, the Spike Jonze film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(2013_film)"><em>Her</em></a> imagined a future where people would form <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/people-are-speaking-with-chatgpt-for-hours-bringing-2013s-her-closer-to-reality/">emotional connections</a> with AI voice assistants. Nearly 12 years later, that fictional premise has veered closer to reality with the release of a new conversational voice model from AI startup Sesame that has left many users both fascinated and unnerved.</p>
<p>"I tried the demo, and it was genuinely startling how human it felt," <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43227957">wrote</a> one Hacker News user who tested the system. "I'm almost a bit worried I will start feeling emotionally attached to a voice assistant with this level of human-like sound."</p>
<p>In late February, Sesame <a href="https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice#demo">released a demo</a> for the company's new Conversational Speech Model (CSM) that appears to cross over what many consider the "uncanny valley" of AI-generated speech, with some testers reporting emotional connections to the male or female voice assistant ("Miles" and "Maya").</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/users-report-emotional-bonds-with-startlingly-realistic-ai-voice-demo/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the team behind the plan to bring mammoth-like animals back to the tundra announced the creation of what it is calling wooly mice, which have long fur reminiscent of the woolly mammoth. The long fur was created through the simultaneous editing of as many as seven genes, all with a known connection to hair growth, color, and/or texture.</p>
<p>But don't think that this is a sort of mouse-mammoth hybrid. Most of the genetic changes were first identified in mice, not mammoths. So, the focus is on the fact that the team could do simultaneous editing of multiple genes—something that they'll need to be able to do to get a considerable number of mammoth-like changes into the elephant genome.</p>
<h2>Of mice and mammoths</h2>
<p>The team at Colossal Biosciences has started a number of de-extinction projects, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/the-next-de-extinction-target-the-dodo/">the dodo</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/effort-to-bring-back-the-tasmanian-tiger-builds-steam/">thylacine</a>, but its flagship project is the mammoth. In all of these cases, the plan is to take stem cells from a closely related species that has not gone extinct, and edit a series of changes based on the corresponding genomes of the deceased species. In the case of the mammoth, that means the elephant.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/wooly-mice-a-test-run-for-mammoth-gene-editing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US Health Secretary and long-standing anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing criticism for his equivocal response to the raging measles outbreak in West Texas, which as of Tuesday has grown to <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-march-4-2025">159 cases</a>, with 22 hospitalizations and one child death.</p>
<p>While public health officials would like to see a resounding endorsement of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine as the best way to protect children and vulnerable community members from further spread of the extremely infectious virus, Kennedy instead penned <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us">an Op-Ed for Fox News</a> sprinkled with anti-vaccine talking points. Before noting that vaccines "protect individual children" and "contribute to community immunity," he stressed parental choice. The decision to vaccinate is "a personal one," he wrote, and merely advised parents to "consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine."</p>
<p>Further, Kennedy seemed more eager to embrace nutrition and supplements as a way to combat the potentially deadly infection. He declared that the "best defense" against infectious diseases, like the measles, is "good nutrition"—not lifesaving, highly effective vaccines.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/cod-liver-oil-embraced-amid-texas-measles-outbreak-doctors-fight-misinfo/">Read full article</a></p>
