<p>The central piece of NASA's second Space Launch System rocket arrived at Kennedy Space Center in Florida this week. Agency officials intend to start stacking the towering launcher in the next couple of months for a mission late next year carrying a team of four astronauts around the Moon.</p>
<p>The Artemis II mission, officially scheduled for September 2025, will be the first voyage by humans to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing mission in 1972. NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canadian mission specialist Jeremy Hansen will ride the SLS rocket away from Earth, then fly around the far side of the Moon and return home inside NASA's Orion spacecraft.</p>
<p>"The core is the backbone of SLS, and it’s the backbone of the Artemis mission," said Matthew Ramsey, NASA's mission manager for Artemis II. "We’ve been waiting for the core to get here because all the integrated tests and checkouts that we do have to have the core stage. It has the flight avionics that drive the whole system. The boosters are also important, but the core is really the backbone for Artemis. So it’s a big day.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039154#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039154&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, Google DeepMind <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/">announced</a> that AI systems called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 reportedly solved four out of six problems from this year's <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> (IMO), achieving a score equivalent to a silver medal. The tech giant claims this marks the first time an AI has reached this level of performance in the prestigious math competition—but as usual in AI, the claims aren't as clear-cut as they seem.</p>

<p>Google says AlphaProof uses reinforcement learning to prove mathematical statements in the formal language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)">Lean</a>. The system trains itself by generating and verifying millions of proofs, progressively tackling more difficult problems. Meanwhile, AlphaGeometry 2 is described as an upgraded version of Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/deepmind-ai-rivals-the-worlds-smartest-high-schoolers-at-geometry/">previous geometry-solving AI modeI</a>, now powered by a Gemini-based language model trained on significantly more data.</p>
<p>According to Google, prominent mathematicians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers">Sir Timothy Gowers</a> and <a href="https://www.friends.edu/staff/myers-joseph/">Dr. Joseph Myers</a> scored the AI model's solutions using official IMO rules. The company reports its combined system earned 28 out of 42 possible points, just shy of the 29-point gold medal threshold. This included a perfect score on the competition's hardest problem, which Google claims only five human contestants solved this year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039221#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039221&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Arguably, few companies have unintentionally contributed more to the increase of AI-generated noise online than OpenAI. Despite its best intentions—and against its <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/">terms of service</a>—its AI language models are often <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697218/ai-generated-spam-fake-user-reviews-as-an-ai-language-model">used to compose spam</a>, and its pioneering research has inspired others to build AI models that can potentially do the same. This influx of AI-generated content has further reduced the effectiveness of SEO-driven search engines like Google. In 2024, web search is in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-search-is-losing-the-fight-with-seo-spam-study-says/">sorry state indeed</a>.</p>

<p>It's interesting, then, that OpenAI is now offering a potential solution to that problem. On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/">revealed</a> a prototype AI-powered search engine called SearchGPT that aims to provide users with quick, accurate answers sourced from the web. It's also a direct challenge to Google, which also has tried to apply generative AI to web search (but with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/">little success</a>).</p>
<p>The company says it plans to integrate the most useful aspects of the temporary prototype into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> in the future. ChatGPT (and Microsoft Copilot) can already perform web searches using Bing, but SearchGPT seems to be OpenAI's purpose-built interface for AI-assisted web searching.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039302#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039302&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google is redesigning Chrome malware detections to include password-protected executable files that users can upload for deep scanning, a change the browser maker says will allow it to detect more malicious threats.</p>
<p>Google has long allowed users to switch on the Enhanced Mode of its <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a>, a Chrome feature that warns users when they’re downloading a file that’s believed to be unsafe, either because of suspicious characteristics or because it’s in a list of known malware. With Enhanced Mode turned on, Google will prompt users to upload suspicious files that aren’t allowed or blocked by its detection engine. Under the new changes, Google will prompt these users to provide any password needed to open the file.</p>
<h2>Beware of password-protected archives</h2>

            The Lego Mario &amp; Yoshi set is an homage to 1990's <em>Super Mario World</em>.                          [credit:

<p>Nintendo and Lego are at it again—they've announced another collaboration today as a follow-up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/lego-teams-up-with-nintendo-for-super-mario-brick-based-game/">the interactive Mario sets</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/this-200-lego-nes-set-features-a-scrolling-8-bit-mario/">replica Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/2064-piece-lego-set-recreates-super-mario-64-in-miniature-for-170/">unfolding question mark block</a> with the <em>Mario 64 </em>worlds inside, and other sets besides.</p>
<p>The latest addition is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/super-mario-world-mario-yoshi-71438?cmp=REF-202407-Mario_Yoshi_Laun">an homage to 1990's <em>Super Mario World</em></a>, Mario's debut outing on the then-new 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System. At first, the 1,215-piece set just looks like a caped Mario sitting on top of Yoshi. But a look at the back reveals more complex mechanics, including a hand crank that makes Yoshi's feet and arms move and a dial that opens his mouth and extends his tongue.</p>

<p>Most of the Mario sets have included some kind of interactive moving part, even if it's as simple as the movable mouth on the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2023/september/lego-super-mario-piranha-plant">Lego Piranha Plant</a>.

<p>Sonos issued a redesigned app in May, and what lots of customers noticed about it wasn't the refreshed look, but the things from the previous design entirely missing. Not small things, but things that Sonos enthusiasts would really notice: sleep timers, local music library access and management, playlist and song queue editing, plus accessibility downgrades.</p>
<p>In May, a Sonos executive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152675/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-response-statement">told The Verge</a> that it "takes courage to rebuild a brand’s core product from the ground up, and to do so knowing it may require taking a few steps back to ultimately leap into the future." You might ask if bravery could have been mustered to not release an app before it was feature-complete.</p>
<p>Now, nearly three months after shipping, Sonos leadership has pivoted from excitement about future innovations to humility, apology, and a detailed roadmap of fixes. CEO Patrick Spence starts his "<a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/blog/update-on-the-sonos-app">Update on the Sonos app from Patrick</a>" with a personal apology, a note that "there isn’t an employee at Sonos who isn’t pained by having let you down," and a pledge that fixing the app is the No. 1 priority.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039296#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039296&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>With the plunging price of photovoltaics, the construction of solar plants has boomed in the US. Last year, for example, the US's Energy Information Agency expected that over half of the new generating capacity <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55419">would be solar</a>, with a lot of it coming online at the very end of the year for tax reasons. Yesterday, the EIA released electricity generation numbers for the first five months of 2024, and that construction boom has seemingly made itself felt: generation by solar power has shot up by 25 percent compared to just one year earlier.</p>
<p>The EIA breaks down solar production according to the size of the plant. Large grid-scale facilities have their production tracked, giving the EIA hard numbers. For smaller installations, like rooftop solar on residential and commercial buildings, the agency has to estimate the amount produced, since the hardware often resides behind the metering equipment, so only shows up via lower-than-expected consumption.</p>
<p>In terms of utility-scale production, the first five months of 2024 saw it rise by 29 percent compared to the same period in the year prior. Small-scale solar was "only" up by 18 percent, with the combined number rising by 25.3 percent.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039343#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039343&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Since 2019, researchers have been analyzing the chemical composition of the materials used to create Rembrandt's masterpiece, <em>The Night Watch,</em> as part of the Rijksmuseum's ongoing <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch" data-uri="529806e83092165890a87faeb310805f">Operation Night Watch</a>, devoted to its long-term preservation. Chemists at the Rijksmuseum and the University of Amsterdam have now detected unusual arsenic-based yellow and orange/red pigments used to paint the duff coat of one of the central figures in the painting, according to a <a href="https://heritagesciencejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40494-024-01350-x">recent paper</a> in the journal Heritage Science. It's a new addition to Rembrandt's known pigment palette that further adds to our growing body of knowledge about the materials he used.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/x-ray-imaging-of-the-night-watch-reveals-previously-unknown-lead-layer/">previously reported</a>, past analyses of Rembrandt's paintings identified many pigments the Dutch master used in his work, including lead white, multiple ochres, bone black, vermilion, madder lake, azurite, ultramarine, yellow lake, and lead-tin yellow, among others. The artist rarely used pure blue or green pigments, with <em>Belshazzar's Feast</em> being a notable exception. (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823032221/http://www.rembrandtdatabase.org/Rembrandt" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823032221/http://www.rembrandtdatabase.org/Rembrandt" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1721848412897ija" data-uri="8467bb4ccdf768362ff33eb52fa32bf9" data-xid="fr1721848412897ija">Rembrandt Database</a> is the best resource for a comprehensive chronicling of the many different investigative reports.)</p>
<p>Early last year, the researchers at Operation Night Watch <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202216478">found rare traces</a> of a compound called lead formate in the painting—surprising in itself, but the team also identified those formates in areas where there was no lead pigment, white or yellow. It's possible that lead formates disappear fairly quickly, which could explain why they have not been detected in paintings by the Dutch Masters until now. But if that is the case, why didn't the lead formate disappear in <em>The Night Watch</em>? And where did it come from in the first place?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039017#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039017&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA's Perseverance rover has found a very intriguing rock on the surface of Mars.</p>
<p>An arrowhead-shaped rock observed by the rover has chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. To be absolutely clear, this is not irrefutable evidence of past life on Mars, when the red planet was more amenable to water-based life billions of years ago. But discovering these colored spots on this rock is darn intriguing and has Mars scientists bubbling with excitement.</p>
<p>"These spots are a big surprise," said David Flannery, an astrobiologist and member of the Perseverance science team from the Queensland University of Technology in Australia, <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-scientists-find-intriguing-mars-rock">in a NASA news release</a>. "On Earth, these types of features in rocks are often associated with the fossilized record of microbes living in the subsurface."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039292#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039292&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2012, an industry-wide coalition of hardware and software makers adopted <a href="https://uefi.org/press-release/UEFI_Forum_Releases_UEFI_2.3.1_Specification_Update_and_Schedules_July_3_2012">Secure Boot</a> to protect against a long-looming security threat. The threat was the specter of malware that could infect the BIOS, the firmware that loaded the operating system each time a computer booted up. From there, it could remain immune to detection and removal and could load even before the OS and security apps did.</p>
<p>The threat of such BIOS-dwelling malware was largely theoretical and fueled in large part by the creation of <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/icelord/article/details/1604884">ICLord Bioskit</a> by a Chinese researcher in 2007. ICLord was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit">rootkit</a>, a class of malware that gains and maintains stealthy root access by subverting key protections built into the operating system. The proof of concept demonstrated that such BIOS rootkits weren't only feasible; they were also powerful. In 2011, the threat became a reality with the discovery of <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2011/09/14/bios_rootkit_discovered/">Mebromi</a>, the first-known BIOS rootkit to be used in the wild.</p>
<p>Keenly <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Plugfest_2011Q4_P5_Insyde.pdf">aware of Mebromi</a> and its potential for a devastating new class of attack, the Secure Boot architects hashed out a complex new way to shore up security in the pre-boot environment. Built into UEFI—the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface that would become the successor to BIOS—Secure Boot used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a> to block the loading of any code that wasn’t signed with a pre-approved digital signature. To this day, key players in security—among them <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/do-more-with-surface/what-is-secure-boot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> and the <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2020/Sep/15/2002497594/-1/-1/0/CTR-UEFI-SECURE-BOOT-CUSTOMIZATION-20200915.PDF/CTR-UEFI-SECURE-BOOT-CUSTOMIZATION-20200915.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US National Security Agency</a>—regard Secure Boot as an important, if not essential, foundation of trust in securing devices in some of the most critical environments, including in industrial control and enterprise networks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039140#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039140&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google is a company in transformation—but "from what<em>"</em> and "to what<em>"</em> are not always clear. To catalog and examine Google's moves in this new era of generative AI, Ars Technica is hiring a Senior Technology Reporter to focus on Google, AI, Android, and search. While attention to so-called "consumer products" will be important, this role will be more focused on Google's big moves as a technology and infrastructure company, moves often made to counter perceived threats from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Perplexity. Informed skepticism is the rule around here, so we're looking for someone with the chops to bring a critical eye to some deep technical and business issues.</p>
<p>As this is a senior role owning an important beat, it is not an entry-level position. We're looking for someone who can primarily self-direct when it comes to their reporting and someone who is comfortable working remotely within a similarly remote team. We'd also like someone who can bring to the table deep and intelligent analyses on broader Google topics while also hitting smaller daily news stories.</p>
<p>This is a full-time union job with benefits.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038555#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038555&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Volkswagen didn't wait the traditional four model years before giving its ID.4 electric crossover something of a spiff-up. The tweaks to the model-year 2024 ID.4 are mostly under the skin or inside the cabin—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/now-rear-wheel-drive-the-single-motor-polestar-2-is-better-than-ever/">like the recent refresh of the Polestar 2</a>, this update was more about making the ID.4 an easier EV to live with, with more range <em>and</em> more power.</p>
<p>Volkswagen was one of the first automakers to react to Tesla finally making the electric vehicle viable. After the company-wide bet on diesel <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/09/volkswagen-group-must-recall-500000-diesel-cars-for-cheating-on-smog-tests/">went up in a cloud of nitrogen oxides and black smoke</a>, VW threw itself headlong into electrification as a way to meet ever-stricter carbon emissions regulations. Already an industry pioneer for the use of highly flexible vehicle architectures that let it build vehicles in a wide range of sizes and shapes with a common set of components and tools, it applied that approach to a line of electric vehicles, all branded under the Intelligent Design, or ID, name.</p>
<p>VW is a global automaker, but automobile tastes are often not global. For Europe, VW designed the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/this-is-volkswagens-new-e30000-electric-car-the-id-3/">ID.3</a>, an electric hatchback that Americans who want forbidden fruit keep asking for, but which generated less than enthusiastic reviews from the people who actually got to buy them. Other models are optimized for China. But for America, with its adoration of the SUV and crossover, VW designed the ID.4.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039260#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039260&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During our second Ars Live event earlier this month, screenwriter/producer Ed Solomon (Bill &amp; Ted franchise) joined physicists Sean Carroll (Johns Hopkins University) and Jim Kakalios (University of Minnesota) and Ars Senior Reporter Jennifer Ouellette for a rousing discussion on the science and logic of time-travel movies. The discussion was inspired by last fall's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2023/11/the-ars-guide-to-time-travel-in-the-movies/">Ars Guide to Time Travel in the Movies</a>, written with the objective of helping us all make better, more informed decisions when it comes to choosing our time-travel movie fare—and having a bit of fun while doing so. You'll find the entire discussion in the video above, complete with a transcript.</p>
<p>Not all time-travel movies are created equal. Some make for fantastic entertainment, but the time travel makes no scientific or logical sense, while others might err in the opposite direction, sacrificing good storytelling in the interest of technical accuracy. The best strike a good balance between those two extremes.</p>
<p>We started off by letting Carroll recap his fundamental rules for time travel in the movies: (1) You can't go back earlier than whenever the time machine you're using was built; (2) it's easy to travel to the future, and special and general relativity give us ways to get to the future faster; (3) it may or may not be possible to travel to the past BUT.... (4) if you do, you can't change the past. Whatever happened, happened.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038049#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038049&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A US appeals court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund is unconstitutional, finding Universal Service fees on phone bills to be a "misbegotten tax." If not overturned, the ruling would upend the <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/027-5183">$8 billion-a-year</a> system that is used to expand telecom networks and make access more affordable through programs such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/poor-americans-will-get-9-a-month-to-buy-broadband-or-mobile-data/">Lifeline</a> discounts and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/internet-providers-that-won-fcc-grants-try-to-escape-broadband-commitments/">deployment grants</a> for Internet service providers.</p>
<p>But the FCC program could survive in the end as the case appears ripe for Supreme Court review, with yesterday's ruling creating a circuit split. <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/22/22-60008-CV2.pdf">The ruling</a> against the FCC was issued by the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which is generally considered one of the most conservative appeals courts.</p>
<p>The FCC previously prevailed in the <a href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/23a0093p-06.pdf">6th</a> and <a href="https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/202213315.pdf">11th</a> circuit appeals courts, which both rejected claims that the Universal Service Fund is unconstitutional.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Early on in the new documentary film <em>Wild Wild Space</em>, Astra rocket company chief executive Chris Kemp offers this bit of snide commentary on his launch competitor, Rocket Lab: “I’m someone who wants to actually succeed from a business perspective, versus just make big toys.”</p>
<p>For better or worse—and it's better for viewers and ultimately worse for Kemp—he is the star of the documentary film now showing on the streaming network Max. The main narrative involves the race between Rocket Lab and Astra to develop, test, and fly small and commercially viable rockets. And what a compelling narrative it is, especially as the story unfolds toward its inexorable conclusion. Anyone who has paid a bit of attention to the space industry knows where this is headed: the ascent of Rocket Lab and failure of Astra. But it's a fun ride anyway.</p>
<p>The film is based directly on the book <em>When the Heavens Went on Sale</em>, by Ashlee Vance. He is the most prominent talking head in the movie, and he does a fine job contextualizing the story. But what really makes the movie sing is the narcissistic monologues by Kemp, the access to his company, and interviews with Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck, who seems mostly bemused at Kemp’s aspirations to challenge him. It all offers a rare, revealing, and intimate look into startup culture.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039157#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039157&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Recent discussions on Reddit are no longer showing up in non-Google search engine results. The absence is the result of updates to Reddit’s <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/26410290525844-Public-Content-Policy">Content Policy</a> that ban crawling its site without agreeing to Reddit’s rules, which bar using Reddit content for AI training without Reddit’s explicit consent.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-is-the-only-search-engine-that-works-on-reddit-now-thanks-to-ai-deal/">404 Media</a>, using "site:reddit.com" on non-Google search engines, including Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Mojeek, brings up minimal or no Reddit results from the past week. Ars Technica made searches on these and other search engines and can confirm the findings. Brave, for example, brings up a few Reddit results sometimes (examples <a href="https://search.brave.com/search?q=cars+site%3Areddit.com&amp;source=web&amp;tf=pw">here</a> and <a href="https://search.brave.com/search?q=bill+belichick+declines+kyle+shanahan+site%3Areddit.com&amp;source=web&amp;tf=pw">here</a>) but not nearly as many as what appears on Google when using identical queries. A standout is Kagi, which is a paid-for engine that pays Google for some of its search index and still shows recent Reddit results.</p>
<p>As 404 Media noted, Reddit's Robots Exclusion Protocol (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1doc3pt/updating_our_robotstxt_file_and_upholding_our/?share_id=LWheQDxb-1jML29ocrt4T&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1doc3pt/updating_our_robotstxt_file_and_upholding_our/?share_id%3DLWheQDxb-1jML29ocrt4T%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_medium%3Dios_app%26utm_name%3Dioscss%26utm_source%3Dshare%26utm_term%3D1&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721995807643000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3iFt06GgdQQ07pXuby-6G1">robots.txt file</a>) blocks bots from scraping the site. The protocol also states, "Reddit believes in an open Internet, but not the misuse of public content." Reddit has approved scrapers from the Internet Archive and some research-focused entities.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039164#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039164&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For many people, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee is the start of a great day. But <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/caffeine-connection-between-coffee-and-headaches">caffeine can cause headaches and jitters</a> in others. That’s why many people reach for a decaffeinated cup instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/michael-crowder.html">I’m a chemistry professor</a> who has taught lectures on why chemicals dissolve in some liquids but not in others. The processes of decaffeination offer great real-life examples of these chemistry concepts. Even the best decaffeination method, however, <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/Decaffeinated-Coffee">does not remove all of the caffeine</a>—about 7 milligrams of caffeine usually remain in an 8-ounce cup.</p>
<p>Producers decaffeinating their coffee want to remove the caffeine while retaining all—or at least most—of the other chemical aroma and flavor compounds. Decaffeination <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee">has a rich history</a>, and now almost all coffee producers use <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/">one of three common methods</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039127#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039127&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In June, Runway debuted a new text-to-video synthesis model called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/runways-latest-ai-video-generator-brings-giant-cotton-candy-monsters-to-life/">Gen-3 Alpha</a>. It converts written descriptions called "prompts" into HD video clips without sound. We've since had a chance to use it and wanted to share our results. Our tests show that careful prompting isn't as important as matching concepts likely found in the training data, and that achieving amusing results likely requires many generations and selective cherry-picking.</p>

<p>An enduring theme of all generative AI models we've seen since 2022 is that they can be excellent at mixing concepts found in training data but are typically very poor at generalizing (applying learned "knowledge" to new situations the model has not explicitly been trained on). That means they can excel at stylistic and thematic novelty but struggle at fundamental structural novelty that goes beyond the training data.</p>
<p>What does all that mean? In the case of Runway Gen-3, lack of generalization means you might ask for a sailing ship in a swirling cup of coffee, and provided that Gen-3's training data includes video examples of sailing ships and swirling coffee, that's an "easy" novel combination for the model to make fairly convincingly. But if you ask for a cat drinking a can of beer (in a beer commercial), it will generally fail because there aren't likely many videos of photorealistic cats drinking human beverages in the training data. Instead, the model will pull from what it has learned about videos of cats and videos of beer commercials and combine them. The result is a cat with human hands pounding back a brewsky.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036379#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036379&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA launched the Chandra X-ray Observatory 25 years ago this week, opening a new eye on the Universe and giving astronomers vision into unimaginably violent cosmic environments like exploding stars and black holes. But Chandra's mission may soon end as NASA's science division faces a nearly billion-dollar budget shortfall.</p>
<p>NASA says it can no longer afford to fund Chandra at the levels it has since the telescope launched in 1999. The agency has a diminished budget for science missions this year, and the reductions may continue next year due to government spending caps in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/29/us/politics/debt-ceiling-agreement.html">deal reached between Congress and the Biden administration</a> last year to suspend the federal debt ceiling.</p>
<p>Congress and the White House have prioritized funding for NASA's human spaceflight programs, primarily the rockets, spacecraft, landers, spacesuits, and rovers needed for the Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon. Meanwhile, the funding level for NASA's science mission directorate has dropped.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038738#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038738&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Authorities have identified a second death that may have been caused by Diamond Shruumz microdosing candies, which are under investigation for causing a nationwide rash of severe illnesses involving <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/people-are-seizing-being-intubated-after-eating-microdose-chocolates/">seizures, and the need for intubation and intensive care</a>.</p>

Of the 74 people sickened, 62 sought medical care, and 38 were admitted to a hospital. There are two potentially associated deaths that are now under investigation. The counts are up from 69 cases and 36 hospitalizations, with one potentially linked death reported in an update last week.</p>
<p>The FDA announced its investigation into Diamond Shruumz products on June 7, when there had been just eight cases reported from four states. The federal investigation—led by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with help from America’s Poison Centers and state and local partners—followed warnings from Arizona poison control officials.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039080#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039080&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
