<p>On April 11, a small company called Graphyte began pumping out beige bricks, somewhat the consistency of particle board, from its new plant in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The bricks don’t look like much, but they come with a lofty goal: to help stop climate change.</p>
<p>Graphyte, a startup backed by billionaire <a href="https://www.graphyte.com/post/breakthrough-energy-state-of-thetransition-2023">Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures</a>, will bury its bricks deep underground, trapping carbon there. The company bills it as the largest carbon dioxide removal project in the world.</p>
<p>Scientists have long warned of the dire threat posed by global warming. It’s gotten so bad though that the long-sought mitigation, <a href="https://undark.org/2022/08/12/the-fervent-debate-over-the-best-way-to-confront-global-warming/">cutting carbon dioxide emissions</a> from every sector of the economy, might not be enough of a fix. To stave off the worst—including large swaths of the Earth exposed to severe heat waves, water scarcity, and crop failures—some experts say there is a deep need to remove <a href="https://undark.org/2024/02/19/carbon-seafloor/">previously emitted carbon</a>, too. And that can be done anywhere on Earth—even in places not known for climate-friendly policies, like Arkansas.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038257#p3">Read 48 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038257&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Of all the potential super-Earths—terrestrial exoplanets more massive than Earth—out there, an exoplanet orbiting a star only 40 light-years away from us in the constellation Cetus might be the most similar to have been found so far.</p>
<p>Exoplanet LHS 1140 b was assumed to be a mini-Neptune when it was first discovered by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope toward the end of 2023. After analyzing data from those observations, a team of researchers, led by astronomer Charles Cadieux, of Université de Montréal, suggest that LHS 1140 b is more likely to be a super-Earth.</p>
<p>If this planet is an alternate version of our own, its relative proximity to its cool red dwarf star means it would most likely be a gargantuan snowball or a mostly frozen body with a substellar (region closest to its star) ocean that makes it look like a cosmic eyeball. It is now thought to be the exoplanet with the best chance for liquid water on its surface, and so might even be habitable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038095#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038095&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For nearly 20 years, scientists have known an asteroid named Apophis will pass unusually close to Earth on Friday, April 13, 2029. But most officials at the world's space agencies stopped paying much attention when updated measurements ruled out the chance Apophis will impact Earth anytime soon.</p>
<p>Now, Apophis is again on the agenda, but this time as a science opportunity, not as a threat. The problem is there's not much time to design, build and launch a spacecraft to get into position near Apophis in less than five years. The good news is there are designs, and in some cases, existing spacecraft, that governments can repurpose for missions to Apophis, a rocky asteroid about the size of three football fields.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered Apophis in 2004, and the first measurements of its orbit indicated there was a small chance it could strike Earth in 2029 or in 2036. Using more detailed radar observations of Apophis, scientists in 2021 ruled out any danger to Earth for at least the next 100 years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037417#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037417&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7328a3.htm?s_cid=mm7328a3_w">Newly released testing data</a> of Diamond Shruumz-brand gummies purchased in 2023 identified the presence of psilocin, a hallucinogenic drug closely related to the magic-mushroom drug psilocybin that is classified as a Schedule I drug, alongside psilocybin, heroin, and LSD.</p>
<p>The finding comes as Diamond Shruumz's current line of gummies, chocolates, and candy cones is being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/microdosing-candies-linked-to-seizures-intubation-finally-recalled/">recalled</a> and are under active investigation in connection to a nationwide rash of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/people-are-seizing-being-intubated-after-eating-microdose-chocolates/">severe illnesses, which have involved seizures, intubation, and intensive care.</a> As of the latest update on July 15, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024">69 people in 28 states have been sickened</a> after eating a Diamond Shruumz product. Sixty of the 69 sought medical care, 36 were hospitalized, and there is one potentially associated death under investigation.</p>
<p>The new finding of psilocin in the products, published by researchers at the University of Virginia, adds to growing concern about psychedelic mushroom candies generally. Although the candies are marketed as being legal, they have often been found to contain various undisclosed illegal drugs, gray market synthetic versions of drugs, as well as dangerous adulterants and contaminants.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038241#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038241&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Samsung is delaying the release of the $250 Galaxy Buds3 Pro in the US from July 24 to August 28, per its website. The third-generation earbuds have Samsung moving from a bean-like shape to an Apple AirPods Pro-like design, including silicone ear tips. But some users have claimed that the new tips rip too easily.</p>
<p>Samsung confirmed to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-suspend-shipments-3462708/">Android Authority</a> today that it has temporarily stopped shipping units to stores.

<p>If there's anything the Deadpool franchise is known for, it's R-rated cheeky irreverence. The forthcoming <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> clearly has that in spades, but the final trailer strikes an uncharacteristically somber note, reminding us just what Wade Wilson/Deadpool stands to lose if Wolverine can't rise to the challenge. Bonus: There's a surprise cameo from Hugh Jackman's co-star in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_(film)">Logan</a>.</em></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/trailer-for-deadpool-and-wolverine-is-filled-with-fun-slo-mo-action-f-bombs/">previously reported</a>, Ryan Reynolds found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/wade-wilson-joins-the-mcu-in-deadpool-and-wolverine-super-bowl-teaser/">the perfect fit</a> with 2016's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(film)"><em>Deadpool</em></a>, starring as Wade Wilson, a former Canadian special forces operative (dishonorably discharged) who develops regenerative healing powers that heal his cancer but leave him permanently disfigured with scars all over his body. Wade decides to become a masked vigilante, turning down an invitation to join the X-Men and abandon his bad-boy ways. The first <em>Deadpool</em> was a big hit, racking up $782 million at the global box office, critical praise, and a couple of Golden Globe nominations for good measure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2"><em>Deadpool 2</em></a> was released in 2018 and was just as successful.</p>
<p><em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> reunites Reynolds with many familiar faces from the first two films. Morena Baccarin is back as Wade's girlfriend Vanessa, along with Leslie Uggams as Blind Al; Karan Soni as Wade's personal chauffeur, taxi driver Dopinder; Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead; Stefan Kapičić as the voice of Colossus; Shioli Kutsuna as Negasonic's mutant girlfriend, Yukio; Randal Reeder as Buck; and Lewis Tan as X-Force member Shatterstar.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038206#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038206&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Citing frustration with mobile carriers enforcing different phone-unlocking policies that are bad for consumers, the Federal Communications Commission is proposing a 60-day unlocking requirement that would apply to all wireless providers.</p>
<p>The industry's "confusing and disparate cell phone unlocking policies" mean that "some consumers can unlock their phones with relative ease, while others face significant barriers," Commissioner Geoffrey Starks <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404092A3.pdf">said</a> at yesterday's FCC meeting. "It also means certain carriers are subject to mandatory unlocking requirements while others are free to dictate their own. This asymmetry is bad for both consumers and competition."</p>
<p>The FCC is "proposing a uniform 60-day unlocking policy" so that "consumers can choose the carrier that offers them the best value," Starks said. Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on a different carrier's network as long as the phone is compatible.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038188#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038188&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore.—Formula E wraps up its 10th series with a pair of races in London this weekend. It's been a competitive manufacturer's championship between Porsche and Jaguar. This weekend, <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-e/five-things-to-watch-formula-e-tense-london-decider/">seven drivers are still in contention</a> to win the driver's title after a double-header in Portland on June 29-30 that saw cars going five-wide down the main straight as they reached the highest top speeds of the season. It was the second visit by Formula E to the picturesque Portland International Raceway, and Ars spoke with some of the sport's bigwigs to see what they think it's getting right and where the technical evolution of the cars is headed.</p>
<p>Formula E has come a long way since 2014. Racing then exclusively in city centers, the cars were slow at first. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/check-out-how-much-quicker-formula-e-has-gotten-in-just-three-years/">even as they developed</a>, they carried too small a battery to complete even a relatively short race distance. There was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/formula-es-new-electric-car-looks-like-nothing-else-in-racing/">a big upgrade in 2018</a> with the start of season five: The Gen2 car now has battery packs sufficient for 45 minutes-plus-a-lap races. The Gen2 car raced well, too, even putting on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hum3zqKj5sQ">a better show at Monaco</a> than Formula 1 has been able to muster for decades.</p>
<p>We expected another big improvement in lap times when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/formula-es-new-electric-race-car-is-lighter-more-powerful-more-nimble/">the Gen3 car arrived at the start of last season</a>. The Gen3 car featured much less weight and much more power, but also a change of tire supplier. Originally meant to last multiple race weekends, the rubber supplied by Hankook this season and last has much less grip than the Michelins it replaced. That's kept cornering speeds relatively low and made the cars even harder to drive.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038164#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038164&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>X's Community Notes account confirmed late Thursday that, due to "popular demand," X had launched a pilot test on the web-based version of the platform. The test is active now and the same functionality will be "coming soon" to Android and iOS, the Community Notes account said.</p>
<p>Through the current web-based pilot, if you're an eligible user, you can click on the "•••" menu on any X post on the web and request fact-checking from one of Community Notes' top contributors, X <a href="https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/note-requests">explained</a>. If X receives five or more requests within 24 hours of the post going live, a Community Note will be added.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038170#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038170&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Airlines, payment processors, 911 call centers, TV networks, and other businesses have been scrambling this morning after a buggy update to CrowdStrike's Falcon security software caused Windows-based systems to crash with a dreaded blue screen of death (BSOD) error message.</p>
<p>We're updating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">our story about the outage</a> with new details as we have them. Microsoft and CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/">both say</a> that "the affected update has been pulled," so what's most important for IT admins in the short term is getting their systems back up and running again. According to guidance from Microsoft, fixes range from annoying but easy to incredibly time-consuming and complex, depending on the number of systems you have to fix and the way your systems are configured.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Azure status page outlines several fixes. The first and easiest is simply to try to reboot affected machines over and over, which gives affected machines multiple chances to try to grab CrowdStrike's non-broken update before the bad driver can cause the BSOD. Microsoft <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status">says</a> that some of its customers have had to reboot their systems as many as 15 times to pull down the update.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038144#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038144&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Although US coal consumption has fallen dramatically since 2005, the country still consumes millions of tons a year, and exports tons more—much of it transported by train. Now, new research shows that these trains can affect the health of people living near where they pass.</p>
<p>The study found that residents living near railroad tracks likely have higher premature mortality rates due to air pollutants released during the passage of uncovered coal trains. The analysis of the San Francisco Bay Area cities of Oakland, Richmond, and Berkeley shows that increases in air pollutants such as small particulate matter (PM 2.5) are also associated with increases in asthma-related episodes and hospital admissions.</p>
<p>"This has never been studied in the world. There's been a couple studies trying to measure just the air pollution, usually in rural areas, but this was the first to both measure air pollution and trains in an urban setting," said Bart Ostro, author of the study and an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038054#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038054&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The FTC says the across-the-board price increases that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">Microsoft recently announced</a> for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service tiers represent "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged" when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">sought to block Microsoft's merger with Activision</a>. In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">a letter to the court</a> posted as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">an ongoing appeal by the FTC</a> in the case, the federal regulator alleges Microsoft's moves are a clear example of "product degradation" brought about by "a firm exercising market power post-merger."</p>
<p>The letter's primary focus is on the soon-to-be-discontinued $10.99/month Console Game Pass tier. That's being replaced with a $14.99/month Game Pass Standard tier (a 36 percent price increase) that no longer includes "day one" access to all of Microsoft's first-party titles. To maintain that key benefit, "Console" subscribers will have to spend 81 percent more for the $19.99 Game Pass Ultimate tier, which also includes a number of additional benefits over the current $10.99/month option.</p>
<h2>Is this “based on the acquisition”?</h2>
<p>The FTC notes that these changes "coincide with adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass’s most expensive tier." Previously, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/sony-calls-microsofts-3-year-call-of-duty-sharing-offer-inadequate/">Microsoft publicly promised</a> that this Game Pass access to Activision's ultra-popular shooter would come "with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038127#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038127&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Millions of people outside the IT industry are learning what CrowdStrike is today, and that's a real bad thing. Meanwhile, Microsoft is also catching blame for global network outages, and between the two, it's unclear as of Friday morning just who caused what.</p>
<p>After cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike shipped <a href="https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Tech-Alert-Windows-crashes-related-to-Falcon-Sensor-2024-07-19">an update to its Falcon Sensor software</a> that protects mission-critical systems, blue screens of death (BSODs) started taking down Windows-based systems. The problems started in Australia and followed the dateline from there.</p>
<p>TV networks, 911 call centers, and even the Paris Olympics were affected. Banks and financial systems in India, South Africa, Thailand, and other countries fell as computers suddenly crashed. Some individual workers discovered that their work-issued laptops were booting to blue screens on Friday morning. The outages took<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201885/starbucks-mobile-orders-unavailable-crowdstrike-outage"> down not only Starbucks mobile ordering</a>, but also <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@wa7iut/112813617928668882">a single motel in Laramie, Wyoming</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038106#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038106&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Let me get three negative points about the <a href="https://www.gazellebikes.com/en-us/gazelle-eclipse-c380plus-hmb#pim_primarycolorrgb=212%2C91%2C83&amp;pim_itemgenderframe=Low-Step&amp;color=color-metallic-orange&amp;frame=frame-low">Gazelle Eclipse</a> out of the way first. First, it’s a 62-pound e-bike, so it’s tough to get moving without its battery. Second, its rack is a thick, non-standard size, so you might need new bags for it. Third—and this is the big one—with its $6,000 suggested retail price, it's expensive, and you will probably feel nervous about locking it anywhere you don’t completely trust.</p>
<p>Apart from those issues, though, this e-bike is great fun. When I rode the Eclipse (the C380+ HMB version of it), I felt like Batman on a day off, or maybe Bruce Wayne doing reconnaissance as a bike enthusiast. The matte gray color, the black hardware, and the understated but impressively advanced tech certainly helped. But I felt prepared to handle anything that was thrown at me without having to think about it much. Brutally steep hills, poorly maintained gravel paths, curbs, stop lights, or friends trying to outrun me on their light road bikes—the Eclipse was ready.</p>
<p>It assists up to 28 miles per hour (i.e., Class 3) and provides up to 85 Nm of torque, and the front suspension absorbs shocks without shaking your grip confidence. It has integrated lights, the display can show you navigation while your phone is tucked away, and the automatic assist changing option balances your mechanical and battery levels, leaving you to just pedal and look.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036305#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036305&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.03 of the Rocket Report! One week ago, SpaceX suffered a rare failure of its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket. In fact, it was the first time the latest version of the Falcon 9, known as the Block 5, has ever failed on its prime mission after nearly 300 launches. The world's launch pads have been silent since the grounding of the Falcon 9 fleet after last week's failure. This isn't surprising, but it's noteworthy. After all, the Falcon 9 has flown more this year than all of the world's other rockets combined and is fundamental to much of what the world does in space.</p>

<p><b>Astra finally goes private, again. </b>A long-simmering deal for Astra's founders to take the company private has been finalized, the company announced Thursday, capping the rocket launch company’s descent from blank-check darling to delisting in three years, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/astra-space-founders-close-buyout-deal-for-ailing-rocket-maker">Bloomberg reports</a>. The launch company's valuation peaked at $3.9 billion in 2021, the year it went public, and was worth about $12.2 million at the end of March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Astra's chief executive officer, Chris Kemp, and chief technology officer, Adam London, founded the company in 2016 with the goal of essentially commoditizing launch services for small satellites. But Astra's rockets failed to deliver and fell short of orbit five times in seven tries.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038020#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038020&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a summer wave of COVID-19 infections swells once again, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403211">a study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine</a> offers some positive news about the pandemic disease: Rates of long COVID have declined since the beginning of the health crisis, with rates falling from a high of 10.4 percent before vaccines were available to a low of 3.5 percent for those vaccinated during the omicron era, according to the new analysis.</p>
<p>The study, led by Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research at the VA Saint Louis Health Care System, used data from a wealth of health records in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The researchers ultimately included data from over 440,000 veterans who contracted COVID-19 sometime between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2022, as well as over 4.7 million uninfected veterans who acted as controls.</p>
<p>Al-Aly and colleagues divided the population into eight groups. People who were infected during the study period were divided into five groupings by the dates of their first infection and their vaccination status. The first group included those infected in the pre-delta era before vaccines were available (March 1, 2020, to June 18, 2021). Then there were vaccinated and unvaccinated groups who were infected in the delta era (June 19, 2021, to December 18, 2021) and the omicron era (December 19, 2021, and January 31, 2022). The uninfected controls made up the final three of eight groups, with the controls assigned to one of the three eras.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038076#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038076&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, Apple announced a slate of more than a dozen upcoming Immersive Videos for its Vision Pro spatial reality headset. The first, titled <em>Boundless</em>, launches tonight at 9 pm ET. More will follow in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/apple-debuts-first-new-3d-video-content-for-vision-pro-in-two-months/">long, slow period</a> for new Vision Pro-specific video content from Apple. The headset launched in early February with a handful of Immersive Video episodes ranging from five to 15 minutes each. Since then, only three new videos have been added.</p>
<p>On March 28, Apple released a highlight reel of Major League Soccer plays from the season that had ended months prior. A second episode of <em>Prehistoric Planet</em>, Apple's Immersive Video dinosaur nature documentary, went live on April 19. Likewise, a new episode of the <em>Adventure</em> series titled "Parkour" landed on May 24.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037983#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037983&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Netflix today confirmed suspicions that it will stop letting people pay $12 per month to stream without commercials.</p>
<p>The ad-free Basic plan was the cheapest way to watch Netflix without commercials. The plan limits users to 720p resolution and one device and lets people download content. Netflix stopped offering the Basic plan to new subscribers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/netflix-hungry-for-more-growth-signals-more-price-hikes/">in January.</a> In June, Netflix started <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/all-the-ways-streaming-services-are-aggravating-their-subscribers-this-week/">booting subscribers</a> in the UK and Canada off the plan and automatically put them onto a cheaper subscription plan with ads.</p>
<p>In a letter to shareholders today [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FINAL-Q2-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">PDF</a>], Netflix confirmed publicly for the first time that it “will now start” to phase out the ad-free Basic plan in the US and France. This will make the cheapest commercial-free Netflix plan $15.49/month in the US. That Standard plan supports up to two devices, downloads, and 1080p resolution.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038032#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038032&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fans of director Denis Villeneuve's epic two-part film adaptation of Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> have no doubt been curious about the upcoming HBO Max series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_Prophecy"><em>Dune: Prophecy</em></a>. It's a prequel series inspired by the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisterhood_of_Dune"><em>Sisterhood of Dune</em></a>, written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, exploring the origins of the <a title="Bene Gesserit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit">Bene Gesserit.</a> The studio just dropped a tantalizing teaser rife with political intrigue, ominous warnings, and a bit of hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>The series was first announced in 2019, with Villeneuve serving as an executive producer and Alison Schapker (<em>Alias, Fringe, Altered Carbon</em>) serving as showrunner. The first season will consist of six episodes, and it's unclear how closely the series will adhere to the source material. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Set 10,000 years before the ascension of Paul Atreides, <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> follows two Harkonnen sisters as they combat forces that threaten the future of humankind, and establish the fabled sect that will become known as the Bene Gesserit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emily Watson co-stars as Valya Harkonnen, leader of the Sisterhood, with Olivia Williams playing her sister, Tula Harkonnen. Mark Strong plays Emperor Javicco Corrino, described as "a man from a great line of war-time Emperors, who is called upon to govern the Imperium and manage a fragile peace," while Jodhi May plays Empress Natalya, and Sarah-Sofie Boussnina plays Princess Ynez.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037901#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037901&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The face huggers and chest bursters return with a vengeance in a few weeks when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Romulus"><em>Alien: Romulus</em></a> finally hits theaters.

That is, after Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of the <em>Nostromo</em>, destroyed the killer xenomorph and launched herself into space in the ship's lifeboat—along with the ginger cat, Jonesy—and before she woke up after 57 years in hypersleep and battled more xenomorphs while protecting the young orphan, Newt (Carrie Henn).
