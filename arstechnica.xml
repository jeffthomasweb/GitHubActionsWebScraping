                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">BMW provided flights from Washington, DC, to Malaga, Spain, and accommodation so Ars could drive the iX3 and be briefed on the electric M Neue Klasse. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Late last year, we drove <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/great-handling-advanced-ev-tech-we-drive-the-2026-bmw-ix3/">BMW's new iX3</a>. It's the first of a series of electric BMWs to use a newly developed platform, known as the "Neue Klasse." Later this year, we'll see the first fully electric version of the 3 Series when the i3 sedan debuts. And next year, BMW enthusiasts will finally find out what the brand's M division—which infuses motorsport into the vehicles like few others—can do with an EV.</p>
<p>There have been M-tuned EVs before now, more powerful variants of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-2023-bmw-i4-is-the-electric-bmw-sedan-youve-been-waiting-for/">i4</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/05/dial-m-for-more-power-more-handling-the-2023-bmw-ix-m60-tested/">iX</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/the-2024-bmw-i7-m70-electric-luxury-turned-up-to-11/">i7</a>. And each time we've driven them, BMW has been at pains to point out that these weren't true M cars, not like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/the-2021-bmw-m3-when-youre-driving-it-you-dont-have-to-see-its-nose/">M3</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-bmw-m5-touring-review-way-more-power-way-too-much-weight/">M5</a>. Honestly, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-bmw-i4-edrive40-might-be-the-best-electric-sedan-on-sale-today/">they weren't better than the cheaper, less powerful versions</a>, something that won't be allowed for next year's performance EV, which might be called something like the iM3, assuming the naming convention remains logic-based.</p>
<p>"The next generation of models are set to establish a new benchmark in the high-performance vehicle segment," says Franciscus van Meel, managing director of BMW M GmbH. "With the latest generation of Neue Klasse technology, we are taking the BMW M driving experience to a new level and will inspire our customers with outstanding, racetrack-ready driving dynamics for everyday use."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/bmws-first-electric-m-car-is-coming-in-2027-with-one-motor-per-wheel/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have discovered a never-before-seen framework that infects Linux machines with a wide assortment of modules that are notable for the range of advanced capabilities they provide to attackers.</p>
<p>The framework, referred to as VoidLink by its source code, features more than 30 modules that can be used to customize capabilities to meet attackers' needs for each infected machine. These modules can provide additional stealth and specific tools for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement inside a compromised network. The components can be easily added or removed as objectives change over the course of a campaign.</p>
<h2>A focus on Linux inside the cloud</h2>
<p>VoidLink can target machines within popular cloud services by detecting if an infected machine is hosted inside AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent, and there are indications that developers plan to add detections for Huawei, DigitalOcean, and Vultr in future releases. To detect which cloud service hosts the machine, VoidLink examines metadata using the respective vendor’s API.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/never-before-seen-linux-malware-is-far-more-advanced-than-typical/">Read full article</a></p>

The page cited specifics scams and the "significant health risks" they pose.</p>
<p>But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has numerous ties to the wellness industry—that FDA information webpage is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism">now gone</a>. It was quietly deleted at the end of last year, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to Ars Technica.</p>
<p>The defunct webpage, titled "Be Aware of Potentially Dangerous Products and Therapies that Claim to Treat Autism," provided parents and other consumers with an overview of the problem. It began with a short description of autism and some evidence-based, FDA-approved medications that can help manage autism symptoms. Then, the regulatory agency provided a list of some false claims and unproven, potentially dangerous treatments it had been working to combat. "Some of these so-called therapies carry significant health risks," the FDA wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/warning-about-bogus-autism-treatments-vanishes-from-fdas-website/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he plans to integrate Elon Musk's AI tool, Grok, into Pentagon networks later this month. During remarks at the SpaceX headquarters in Texas <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/13/elon-musk-grok-hegseth-military-pentagon">reported by</a> The Guardian, Hegseth said the integration would place "the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department."</p>
<p>The announcement comes weeks after Grok <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/xai-silent-after-grok-sexualized-images-of-kids-dril-mocks-groks-apology/">drew international backlash</a> for generating sexualized images of women and children, although the Department of Defense has not released official documentation confirming Hegseth's announced timeline or implementation details.</p>
<p>During the same appearance, Hegseth rolled out what he called an "AI acceleration strategy" for the Department of Defense. The strategy, he said, will "unleash experimentation, eliminate bureaucratic barriers, focus on investments, and demonstrate the execution approach needed to ensure we lead in military AI and that it grows more dominant into the future."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/hegseth-wants-to-integrate-musks-grok-ai-into-military-networks-this-month/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/">announced</a> a new initiative called "Community-First AI Infrastructure" that commits the company to paying full electricity costs for its data centers and refusing to seek local property tax reductions.</p>
<p>As demand for generative AI services has increased over the past year, Big Tech companies have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/why-does-openai-need-six-giant-data-centers">racing</a> to spin up massive new data centers for serving chatbots and image generators that can have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/ai-in-wyoming-may-soon-use-more-electricity-than-states-human-residents/">profound economic effects</a> on the surrounding areas where they are located. Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-and-nvidias-100b-ai-plan-will-require-power-equal-to-10-nuclear-reactors/">heavy power consumption</a> and by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/mistrals-new-environmental-audit-shows-how-much-ai-is-hurting-the-planet/">straining</a> water supplies due to server cooling needs.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai">projects</a> that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period. This growth is happening while much of the country's electricity transmission infrastructure is <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/articles/what-does-it-take-modernize-us-electric-grid">more than</a> 40 years old and under strain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/microsoft-vows-to-cover-full-power-costs-for-energy-hungry-ai-data-centers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's Veo video AI made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">stunning leaps in fidelity</a> in 2025, and Google isn't stopping in 2026. The company has <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/ai/veo-3-1-ingredients-to-video/">announced</a> an update for Veo 3.1 that adds new capabilities when you provide the model with reference material, known as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/google-adds-photo-to-video-generation-with-veo-3-to-the-gemini-app/">Ingredients to Video</a>. The results should be more consistent, and output supports vertical video and higher-resolution upscaling.</p>
<p>With Ingredients to Video, you can provide the AI with up to three images to incorporate into the generated video. You can use that to provide the robot with characters to animate, backgrounds, and material textures. When you do that, the newly upgraded model will allegedly make fewer random alterations, hemming closer to the reference images. You can also generate multiple clips and even prompt for changes to the setting or style while keeping other elements consistent.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJngjnLZ_ZI?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div><div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300">

  </div>
</div>
<p>Google is also expanding its support for mobile-first video in Veo. When using Ingredients to Video, you can now specify outputs in a 9:16 (vertical) ratio. That makes it ideal for posting on social apps like Instagram or TikTok, as well as uploading as a YouTube Short. So get ready for even more phone-centric slop. Google added support for vertical videos via a text prompt last year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/googles-updated-veo-model-can-make-vertical-videos-from-reference-images-with-4k-upscaling/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you were to do a cost-benefit analysis of your lunch, it would be pretty difficult to do the calculation without the sandwich. But it appears that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving in this same direction—removing the benefit—when it comes to air pollution regulations.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/climate/trump-epa-air-pollution.html">a New York Times report</a> based on internal emails and documents—and demonstrated by a recently produced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johndwalke.bsky.social/post/3mcbfk53xi22x">analysis on the EPA website</a>—the EPA is changing its cost-benefit analysis process for common air pollutants. Instead of comparing the economic cost of a certain pollution limit to an estimate of the economic value of the resulting improvements in human health, the EPA will just qualitatively describe health benefits while carefully quantifying economic costs.</p>
<p>Cost-benefit analysis has been a key component of EPA regulations. Any decision to raise or lower air quality standards or pollution limits includes evaluations of the cost that change, like the addition of new pollution control equipment at power plants, would incur, for example.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/epa-axes-benefits-from-cost-benefit-analysis-for-air-pollution-limits/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's professional creative apps have been slower to jump on the subscription bandwagon than those from Adobe or some of its other competitors, but the company is taking a step in that direction today. Starting on January 28, Apple will offer an <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/introducing-apple-creator-studio-an-inspiring-collection-of-creative-apps/?1768312801">Apple Creator Studio</a> subscription for $13 a month, or $130 a year. Subscribers will get access to the Mac and (where applicable) iPad versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage, as well as "intelligent features and premium content" for the Mac, iPad, and iPhone versions of Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform.</p>
<p>Apple says it will also offer a one-month free trial for the subscription and a discounted version for students at $3 a month, or $30 a year.</p>
<p>Most of the apps also seem to be getting small feature updates to go along with the Creator Studio announcement. Final Cut will get a new Transcript Search feature that will allow you to dig through video footage by searching for specific dialogue, and a new Montage Maker feature "will analyze and edit together a dynamic video based on the best visual moments within the footage." An updated Logic Pro "helps creators deliver original music for their video content" and adds a synth player to the app's lineup of "AI Session Players."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/apple-creator-studio-bundles-final-cut-pro-logic-and-other-apps-for-129-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's not really accurate to call the Wagoneer S Jeep's first electric vehicle. For several years now, Europeans have been able to buy the Jeep Avenger, a subcompact crossover that will surely never see American roads. But it is the first electric Jeep designed for American consumption. It's aimed at the highly competitive midsize SUV segment, which gets ever more crowded even as electrification faces a less certain future here. Indeed, the brand, along with its Stellantis sibling Chrysler, just shelved all its plug-in hybrids, discontinuing them just a few days ago.</p>
<p>Like the little Avenger, the Wagoneer S makes use of one of parent company Stellantis' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/plug-in-jeeps-and-an-ev-ram-1500-pickup-are-part-of-stellantis-new-plan/">purpose-built EV platforms</a>, one shared with the growly-sounding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/dodge-keeps-true-to-its-roots-with-the-first-electric-charger-muscle-car/">Dodge Charger</a>. At 192.4 inches (4,886 mm) long, 74.8 inches (1,900 mm) wide, and 64.8 inches (1,645 mm) tall, it's a little larger than cars like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/great-handling-advanced-ev-tech-we-drive-the-2026-bmw-ix3/">BMW iX3</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/heres-what-we-learned-driving-audis-new-q6-and-sq6-electric-suvs/">Audi Q6 e-tron</a> but a little smaller than domestically designed rivals like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-cadillac-lyriq-a-bug-free-ev-with-carplay-thats-still-a-bit-bland/">Cadillac Lyriq</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/software-can-make-a-difference-the-acura-zdx-type-s-review/">Acura ZDX</a>, which have particularly long wheelbases.</p>
<p>I find it a rather handsome car, one that has to marry Jeep's Wagoneer styling cues with as many wind-smoothing and air-shaping elements as possible. The way the rear wing juts out above the tailgate window reminds me of a '90s rally hatchback, but it's the product of the designers and the engineers working on drag reduction. The overall drag coefficient is 0.29, and since Jeep actually publishes the frontal area, too, I can tell you the more important CdA number—where drag is multiplied by the frontal area—is 8.67 sq ft (0.805 m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/this-one-could-use-less-power-the-jeep-wagoneer-s-ev/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>It's looking to be a solid year for <em>kaiju</em> fans. Not only are we getting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_Minus_Zero"><em>Godzilla Minus Zero</em></a> in November—sequel to the critically acclaimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_Minus_One"><em>Godzilla Minus One</em></a> (2023)—but Apple TV just released a teaser for the second season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch:_Legacy_of_Monsters"><em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em></a>, part of Legendary Entertainment’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MonsterVerse">MonsterVerse</a>, which brought Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters (<em>kaiju</em>) created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toho">Toho Co., Ltd</a> into the same fold.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>The first season picked up where 2014's <em>Godzilla</em> left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other <em>kaiju</em>—after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. The plot spans three generations and takes place in the 1950s and half a century later. In the first season, two siblings (Kate and Kentaro Randa) follow in their father’s footsteps to uncover their family’s connection to the secretive organization known as Monarch. Naturally, they find themselves in the world of monsters and discover Army officer Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell), a longtime family ally.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/a-new-titan-emerges-in-monarch-legacy-of-monsters-s2-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A third person has died in a rash of poisonings from wild, foraged mushrooms in California, health officials report.</p>
<p>Since November, a total of 35 people across the state have been poisoned by mushrooms, leading to three people receiving liver transplants in addition to the three deaths. Health officials in Sonoma County <a href="https://sonomacounty.gov/sonoma-county-health-officer-issues-advisory-to-not-eat-wild-mushrooms-after-death-of-county-resident">reported the latest death last week</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Stacey, Sonoma's interim health officer, attributed the cases and deaths to an extraordinary boom in the prevalence of death cap mushrooms (<em>Amanita phalloides</em>), noting that in an average year, the state sees fewer than five mushroom poisoning cases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/wild-mushrooms-keep-killing-people-in-california-3-dead-35-poisoned/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>His latest brainchild is <a href="https://confer.to/">Confer</a>, an open source AI assistant that provides strong assurances that user data is unreadable to the platform operator, hackers, law enforcement, or any other party other than account holders. The service—including its large language models and back-end components—runs entirely on open source software that users can cryptographically verify is in place.</p>
<p>Data and conversations originating from users and the resulting responses from the LLMs are encrypted in a trusted execution environment (TEE) that prevents even server administrators from peeking at or tampering with them. Conversations are stored by Confer in the same encrypted form, which uses a key that remains securely on users’ devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/signal-creator-moxie-marlinspike-wants-to-do-for-ai-what-he-did-for-messaging/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Paramount Skydance escalated its hostile takeover bid of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) today by filing a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against WBD, declaring its intention to fight Netflix’s acquisition.</p>
<p>In December, WBD agreed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/netflixs-72b-wb-acquisition-confounds-the-future-of-movie-theaters-streaming/">sell its streaming and movie businesses to Netflix</a> for $82.7 billion. The deal would see WBD’s Global Networks division, composed of WBD's legacy cable networks, spun out into a separate company called Discovery Global. But in December, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/paramount-says-it-could-get-antitrust-approval-for-wbd-before-netflix/">Paramount submitted a hostile takeover bid</a> and <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-amends-its-superior-30-share-all-cash-offer-warner">amended its bid</a> for WBD. Subsequently, the company has aggressively tried to convince WBD’s shareholders that its $108.4 billion offer for all of WBD is superior to the Netflix deal.</p>
<p>Today, Paramount CEO David Ellison wrote a letter to WBD shareholders informing them of Paramount’s lawsuit. The lawsuit requests the court to force WBD to disclose “how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its ‘risk adjustment’” of Paramount’s $30 per share all-cash offer. Netflix’s offer equates to $27.72 per share, including $23.25 in cash and shares of Netflix common stock. Paramount hopes the information will encourage more WBD shareholders to tender their shares under Paramount's offer by the January 21 deadline.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/paramount-sues-wbd-over-netflix-deal-wbd-says-paramounts-price-is-still-inadequate/">Read full article</a></p>
