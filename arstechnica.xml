<p>A pleasant female voice greets me over the phone. “Hi, I’m an assistant named Jasmine for Bodega,” the voice says. “How can I help?”</p>
<p>“Do you have patio seating,” I ask. Jasmine sounds a little sad as she tells me that unfortunately, the San Francisco–based Vietnamese restaurant doesn't have outdoor seating. But her sadness isn’t the result of her having a bad day. Rather, her tone is a feature, a setting.</p>
<p>Jasmine is a member of a new, growing clan: the AI voice restaurant host. If you recently called up a restaurant in New York City, Miami, Atlanta, or San Francisco, chances are you have spoken to one of Jasmine’s polite, calculated competitors.  </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051613#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051613&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our planet is choking on plastics. Some of the worst offenders, which can take decades to degrade in landfills, are polypropylene—which is used for things such as food packaging and bumpers—and polyethylene, found in plastic bags, bottles, toys, and even mulch.</p>
<p>Polypropylene and polyethylene can be recycled, but the process can be difficult and often produces large quantities of the greenhouse gas methane. They are both polyolefins, which are the products of polymerizing ethylene and propylene, raw materials that are mainly derived from fossil fuels. The bonds of polyolefins are also notoriously hard to break.</p>
<p>Now, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have come up with a method of recycling these polymers that uses catalysts that easily break their bonds, converting them into propylene and isobutylene, which are gasses at room temperature. Those gasses can then be recycled into new plastics.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051605#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051605&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If the past five years of EU tech rules could take human form, they would embody <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/thierry-breton-eu-commissioner/">Thierry Breton</a>. The bombastic commissioner, with his swoop of white hair, became the public face of Brussels’ irritation with American tech giants, touring Silicon Valley last summer to personally remind the industry of looming regulatory deadlines.</p>
<p>Combative and outspoken, Breton warned that Apple had spent too long “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-hits-a-major-roadblock-as-eu-targets-app-store/">squeezing</a>” other companies out of the market. In a case against TikTok, he emphasized, “our children <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-faces-fresh-probe-over-addictive-effect-on-kids/">are not guinea pigs</a> for social media.”  </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>
<p>His confrontational attitude to the CEOs themselves was visible in his posts on X. In the lead-up to Musk’s interview with Donald Trump, Breton posted a vague but threatening <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1823033048109367549">letter</a> on his account reminding Musk there would be consequences if he used his platform to amplify “harmful content.” Last year, he published a photo <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1672361958262153219">with Mark Zuckerberg</a>, declaring a new EU motto of “move fast to fix things”—a jibe at the notorious early Facebook <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm">slogan</a>. And in a 2023 meeting with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Breton <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-12/zuckerberg-musk-didn-t-think-eu-legislators-could-regulate-them-is-that-changi">reportedly</a> got him to agree to an “AI pact” on the spot, before <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1661362714030092289">tweeting the agreement</a>, making it difficult for Pichai to back out.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051513#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051513&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A little more than two years ago, Dmitry Rogozin, the bellicose former head of Russia's space agency, nearly brought the International Space Station partnership to its knees.</p>
<p>During his tenure as director general of Roscosmos, Rogozin was known for his bombastic social media posts and veiled threats to abandon the space station after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/as-rumors-swirl-about-his-future-russias-space-chief-darkens-his-rhetoric/">Putin tersely dismissed Rogozin</a> in July 2022 and replaced him with Yuri Borisov, a former deputy prime minister.</p>
<p>While the clash between Russia and Western governments over the war in Ukraine has not cooled, the threats against the International Space Station (ISS) ended. The program remains one of the few examples of cooperation between the US and Russian governments. Last year, Russia <a href="https://spacenews.com/russia-commits-to-iss-extension-to-2028/">formally extended its commitment</a> to the ISS to at least 2028. NASA and space agencies in Europe, Japan, and Canada have agreed to maintain the space station through 2030.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051340#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051340&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As power utilities and industrial companies seek to use more renewable energy, the market for grid-scale batteries is expanding rapidly. Alternatives to lithium-ion technology may provide environmental, labor, and safety benefits. And these new chemistries can work in markets like the electric grid and industrial applications that lithium doesn't address well.</p>
<p>“I think the market for longer-duration storage is just now emerging,” said Mark Higgins, chief commercial officer and president of North America at Redflow. “We have a lot of… very rapid scale-up in the types of projects that we’re working on and the size of projects that we’re working on. We’ve deployed about 270 projects around the world. Most of them have been small off-grid or remote-grid systems. What we’re seeing today is much more grid-connected types of projects.”</p>
<p>“Demand… seems to be increasing every day,” said Giovanni Damato, president of CMBlu Energy. Media projections of growth in this space are huge. “We're really excited about the opportunity to… just be able to play in that space and provide as much capacity as possible.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051477#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051477&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you were looking for a reason to keep a flamethrower around the house, you may have just found one.</p>
<p>This week, the Los Angeles County health department reported <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=4821">that two people were infected with a raccoon parasite</a> that causes severe, frequently fatal, infections of the eyes, organs, and central nervous system. Those who survive are often left with severe neurological outcomes, including blindness, paralysis, loss of coordination, seizures, cognitive impairments, and brain atrophy.</p>
<p>The parasitic roundworm behind the infection, called <em>Baylisascaris procyonis</em>, spreads via eggs in raccoons feces. Adult worms live in the intestines of the masked trash scavengers, and each female worm can produce nearly 200,000 eggs per day. Once in the environment, those eggs can remain infectious for years. They can survive drying out as well as most chemical treatments and disinfectants, including bleach.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051594#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051594&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the US Department of Justice <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/google-holds-publishers-hostage-ex-news-corp-exec-testifies-at-ad-tech-trial/">aims to break up Google's alleged ad tech monopoly</a>, experts say that remedies sought in the antitrust trial could potentially benefit not just advertisers and publishers but also everyone targeted by ads online.</p>
<p>So far, the DOJ has argued that through acquisitions, Google allegedly monopolizes the ad server market, taking a substantial cut of every online ad sale by tying together products on the buyer and seller sides. Locking publishers into using its seller-side platform to access its large advertiser demand, Google also allegedly shut out rivals by pushing advertisers into a corner, then making it hard for publishers to switch platforms.</p>
<p>This scheme also allegedly set Google up to charge higher "monopoly" fees, the DOJ argued, allegedly putting some publishers out of business and raising costs for advertisers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051545#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051545&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Saturday, a YouTube creator called "ChromaLock" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bicjxl4EcJg">published a video</a> detailing how he modified a Texas Instruments TI-84 graphing calculator to connect to the Internet and access OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, potentially enabling students to cheat on tests. The video, titled "I Made The Ultimate Cheating Device," demonstrates a custom hardware modification that allows users of the graphing calculator to type in problems sent to ChatGPT using the keypad and receive live responses on the screen.</p>

<p>ChromaLock began by exploring the calculator's link port, typically used for transferring educational programs between devices. He then designed a custom circuit board he calls "TI-32" that incorporates a tiny Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller, the <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html">Seed Studio ESP32-C3</a> (which costs about $5), along with other components to interface with the calculator's systems.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the TI-32 hack isn't a commercial project. Replicating ChromaLock's work would involve purchasing a TI-84 calculator, a Seed Studio ESP32-C3 microcontroller, and various electronic components, and fabricating a custom PCB based on ChromaLock's design, which is <a href="https://github.com/chromalock/TI-32/">available online</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051342#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051342&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Certificate authorities and browser makers are planning to end the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">WHOIS</a> data verifying domain ownership following a report that demonstrated how threat actors could abuse the process to obtain fraudulently issued TLS certificates.</p>
<p>TLS certificates are the cryptographic credentials that underpin HTTPS connections, a critical component of online communications verifying that a server belongs to a trusted entity and encrypts all traffic passing between it and an end user. These credentials are issued by any one of hundreds of CAs (certificate authorities) to domain owners. The rules for how certificates are issued and the process for verifying the rightful owner of a domain are left to the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a>. One "base requirement rule" allows CAs to send an email to an address listed in the WHOIS record for the domain being applied for. When the receiver clicks an enclosed link, the certificate is automatically approved.</p>
<h2>Non-trivial dependencies</h2>
<p>Researchers from security firm watchTowr recently demonstrated how threat actors could abuse the rule to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/rogue-whois-server-gives-researcher-superpowers-no-one-should-ever-have/">obtain fraudulently issued certificates</a> for domains they didn’t own. The security failure resulted from a lack of uniform rules for determining the validity of sites claiming to provide official WHOIS records.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051511#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051511&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>iOS 18 launched this week, and while its flagship feature (Apple Intelligence) is still forthcoming, the new OS included two significant new buckets of customization: the home screen and Control Center.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/ios-18s-new-home-screen-features-are-a-long-awaited-win-for-flexibility/">talked about home screen</a> a few days ago, so for our next step in our series on iOS 18, it’s now time to turn our attention to the new ways you can adjust the Control Center to your liking. While we’re at it, we’ll assess a few other features meant to make iOS more powerful and more efficient for power users.</p>
<p>This is by no means the most significant update for power users Apple has released of the iPhone operating system—there’s nothing like Shortcuts, for example, or the introduction of the Files app a few years ago. But with the increasingly expensive iPhone Pro models, Apple still seems to be trying to make the case that you’ll be able to do more with your phone than you used to.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050326#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050326&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the miracles of the Apollo Moon landings is that they were televised, live, for all the world to see. This transparency diffused doubts about whether the lunar landings really happened and were watched by billions of people.</p>
<p>However, as remarkable a technical achievement as it was to broadcast from the Moon in 1969, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9HdPi9Ikhk">the video was grainy</a> and black and white. As NASA contemplates a return to the Moon as part of the Artemis program, it wants much higher resolution video and communications with its astronauts on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>To that end, NASA announced this week that it had awarded a contract to Houston-based Intuitive Machines for "lunar relay services." Essentially this means Intuitive Machines will be responsible for building a small constellation of satellites around the Moon that will beam data back to Earth from the lunar surface.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051271#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051271&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Remy Ra St. Felix spent April 11, 2023, on a quiet street in a rented BMW X5, staking out the 76-year-old couple that he planned to rob the next day.</p>
<p>He had recently made the 11-hour drive up I-95 from southern Florida, where he lived, to Durham, North Carolina. It was a long way, but as with so many jobs, occasional travel was the cost of doing business. That was true especially when your business was robbing people of their cryptocurrency by breaking into their homes and threatening to cut off their balls and rape their wives.</p>
<p>St. Felix, a young man of just 25, had tried this line of work closer to home at first, but it hadn't gone well. A September 2022 home invasion in Homestead, Florida, was supposed to bring St. Felix and his crew piles of crypto. All they had to do was stick a gun to some poor schlub's head and force him to log in to his online exchange and then transfer the money to accounts controlled by the thieves. A simple plan—which worked fine until it turned out that the victim's crypto accounts had far less money in them than planned.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051106#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051106&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cards Against Humanity sued SpaceX yesterday, alleging that Elon Musk's firm illegally took over a plot of land on the US/Mexico border that the party-game company bought in 2017 in an attempt to stymie then-President Trump's attempt to build a wall.</p>
<p>"As part of CAH's 2017 holiday campaign, while Donald Trump was President, CAH created a supporter-funded campaign to take a stand against the building of a Border Wall," said the <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cah-vs-spacex.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed in Cameron County District Court in Texas. Cards Against Humanity says it received $15 donations from 150,000 people and used part of that money to buy "a <a href="https://cameron.prodigycad.com/property-detail/173555/2024/gis">plot</a> of vacant land in Cameron County based upon CAH's promise to 'make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for Trump to build his wall.'"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanity</a> says it mowed the land "and maintained it in its natural state, marking the edge of the lot with a fence and a 'No Trespassing' sign." But instead of Trump taking over the land, Cards Against Humanity says the parcel was "interfered with and invaded" by Musk's space company. The lawsuit includes pictures that, according to Cards Against Humanity, show the land when it was first purchased and after SpaceX construction equipment and materials were placed on the land.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051417#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051417&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Philadelphia has learned its lesson the hard way: football makes people a little crazy. (Go birds!) Police here even <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/philadelphia-grease-poles-tradition-eagles-win/p3zznvlc3xdh633clw2azuaf">grease downtown light poles</a> before important games to keep rowdy fans from climbing them.</p>
<p>But Matthew Gabriel, 25, who lives in Philly's Mt. Airy neighborhood, took his football fanaticism to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfi33bdepuE">whole 'nother level</a>. For reasons that remain unclear, Gabriel grew incensed with a University of Iowa student who was also a member of Gabriel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(gridiron)">fantasy football</a> group chat.</p>
<p>So Gabriel did what anyone might do under such circumstances: He waited until the student went to Norway for a study abroad visit in August 2023, then contacted Norwegian investigators (<a href="https://www.pst.no">Politiets Sikkerhetstjeneste</a>) through an online "tip" form and told them that the student was planning a mass shooting.

<p>A Senate committee on Thursday <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/news-in-historic-first-help-committee-holds-steward-ceo-ralph-de-la-torre-in-civil-and-criminal-contempt-with-bipartisan-vote">voted overwhelmingly</a> to hold the wealthy CEO of a failed hospital chain in civil and criminal contempt for rejecting a rare subpoena from the lawmakers.</p>
<p>In July, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) subpoenaed Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre to testify before the lawmakers on the deterioration and eventual bankruptcy of the system, which included more than 30 hospitals across eight states. The resulting dire conditions in the hospitals, described as providing "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/as-hospitals-failed-and-patients-died-ceo-reportedly-netted-250m/">third-world medicine</a>," allegedly led to the deaths of at least 15 patients and imperiled more than 2,000 others.</p>
<p>The committee, chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), highlighted that amid the system's collapse, de la Torre was paid at least $250 million, bought a $40 million yacht, and owned a $15 million luxury fishing boat. Meanwhile, Steward executives jetted around on two private jets collectively worth $95 million.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051400#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051400&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Hundreds of owners of smart TVs and streaming devices from United Kingdom telecom Sky reported that their hardware stopped powering on Thursday. Sky hasn't confirmed the cause of the problem, but a botched update is largely suspected.</p>
<p>Sky, a Comcast company that sells Internet, mobile, and satellite TV service in the UK, got into the streaming hardware business in 2021. Its proprietary Glass TVs and Stream pucks let people access TV channels offered through Sky via the Internet instead of a dish. As of this writing, Glass TVs range from 600 pounds (about $800) for a 43-inch set to 1,199 pounds (about $1,600) for 65 inches and include <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/tcl-accused-of-selling-quantum-dot-tvs-without-actual-quantum-dots/">quantum dots</a> and Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG HDR support. To order a Glass TV, people have to sign up for a Sky Entertainment subscription that includes the same type of channels offered through Sky's satellite TV services but via streaming, plus Netflix (with or without ads). If you don’t buy/renew your Sky Entertainment subscription, “access to TV apps like Netflix won't be available,” Sky <a href="https://www.sky.com/help/articles/sky-glass-without-a-subscription">says</a>. The Stream puck, meanwhile, supports various streaming apps but doesn't work without a Sky subscription.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, paying subscribers and owners of Glass and Stream devices reported that their devices were unable to power on. Users reported only being able to see a <a href="https://x.com/Coolstorybrotec/status/1837018387693658147">blank screen</a>, with some saying the problems lasted for hours.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051341#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051341&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I can't remember every interaction I had with the advisers in <em>Civilization </em>games, but I don't believe I ever had to send my guards to put down a protest one of them staged in a new settlement.</p>

<p>Nor could I ask any of them for "Favours" to scrape a few more heat stamps necessary for a new food district, indebting me to them at some future point when they decide they've had enough of some other faction's people and ideas. In <em><a href="https://frostpunk2.com/">Frostpunk 2</a> (</em>out today), the people who pop up to tell you how they're feeling aren't just helpful indicators, they're a vital part of the strategy. To keep these people going, you've got to make some of them mad, some of them happy, and balance a ledger of all you've gained and demanded from them.</p>
<p>That's the biggest difference you'll notice in <em>Frostpunk 2</em> if you're coming from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/frostpunk-review-ice-burg/">the original</a>. The original had you making choices that affected people, but you were the Captain, in full control of your people, at least until you angered them enough to revolt. In <em>Frostpunk 2</em>, you manage factions and communities rather than groups of survivors. You place districts, not hospitals. Time moves in days and weeks, not hours. You play multiple chapters across a landscape in a world that is 30 years removed from its initial peril.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051226#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051226&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>New Starlink customers have to pay a $100 "congestion charge" in areas where the satellite broadband network has limited capacity.</p>
<p>"In areas with network congestion, there is an additional one-time charge to purchase Starlink Residential services," a <a href="https://www.starlink.com/support/article/63d885d3-c269-21f9-69d6-3ed1b2fd18e9">Starlink FAQ</a> says. "This fee will only apply if you are purchasing or activating a new service plan. If you change your Service address or Service Plan at a later date, you may be charged the congestion fee."</p>
<p>The charge is unwelcome for anyone wanting Starlink service in a congested area, but it could help prevent the capacity crunch from getting worse by making people think twice about signing up. The SpaceX-owned Internet service provider also seems to anticipate that people who sign up for service in congested areas may change their minds after trying it out for a few weeks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051360#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051360&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TROY, Mich.—Despite US dominance in so many different areas of technology, we're sadly somewhat of a backwater when it comes to car headlamps. It's been this way for many decades, a result of restrictive federal vehicle regulations that get updated rarely. The latest lights to try to work their way through red tape and onto the road are active-matrix LED lamps, which can shape their beams to avoid blinding oncoming drivers.</p>
<p>From the 1960s, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards allowed for only sealed high- and low-beam headlamps, and as a result, automakers like Mercedes-Benz would sell cars with less capable lighting in North America than it offered to European customers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051356#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051356&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
