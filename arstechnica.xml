                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.03 of the Rocket Report! We are at an interesting stage in Europe, with its efforts to commercialize spaceflight. Finally, it seems the long-slumbering continent is waking up to the need to leverage private capital to drive down the costs of space access, and we are seeing more investment flow into European companies. But it is critical that European policymakers make strategic investments across the industry or companies like PLD Space, which outlined big plans this week, will struggle to get off the launch pad.</p>

                        <![CDATA[The Nothing Phone 3 is the company's best phone by a wide margin, but is that enough?]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The last few years have seen several smartphone makers pull back or totally abandon their mobile efforts. UK-based Nothing Technologies, however, is still trying to carve out a niche in the increasingly competitive smartphone market. Its tools have been quirky designs and glowing lights, along with a focus on markets outside the US. With the Nothing Phone 3, the company has brought its "first flagship" phone stateside.</p>
<p>Nothing didn't swing for the fences with the Phone 3's specs, but this device can hold its own with the likes of OnePlus and Google. Plus, it has that funky Nothing design aesthetic. There's a transparent back, a tiny dot matrix screen, and a comprehensive Android skin. But at the end of the day, the Nothing Phone 3 is not treading new ground.</p>
<h2>Designing Nothing</h2>
<p>Despite Nothing's talk about unique designs, the Nothing Phone 3 looks unremarkable from the front. The bezels are slim and symmetrical all the way around the screen. Under a sheet of Gorilla Glass 7i, it has a 6.67-inch 120Hz OLED screen with an impressive 1260 x 2800 resolution. It hits 4,500 nits of brightness, which is even higher than Google and Samsung phones. It's more than bright enough to be readable outdoors, and the touch sensitivity is excellent—sometimes <em>too</em> excellent, as we've noticed a few accidental edge touches.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/nothing-phone-3-review-nothing-ventured-nothing-gained/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>San Diego Comic-Con is coming up next week, and Disney is getting ready for its big presentation by releasing a new trailer for <em>TRON: Ares</em>, directed by Joachim Rønning.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for<em> TRON: Legacy</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/go-back-to-the-grid-in-tron-ares-trailer/">previously reported</a>, <em>TRON: Legacy</em> ended with Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), son of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) from the original film, preventing the digital world from bleeding into the real world, as planned by the Grid's malevolent ruling program, Clu. He brought with him Quorra (Olivia Wilde), a naturally occurring isomorphic algorithm targeted for extinction by Clu.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/jared-leto-is-the-ultimate-solder-in-new-tron-ares-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Late Tuesday, President Trump announced on social media that he had convinced Coca-Cola to agree to use "REAL Cane Sugar" in Coke, in lieu of the current, cheaper sweetener used in the US version of the drink: high-fructose corn syrup.</p>
<p>"I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them—You’ll see. It's just better!" <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114864763487869986">Trump wrote</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Coca-Cola failed to confirm that supposed agreement. On its website, the beverage giant posted a <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/coca-cola-product-range.html">brief, vague statement</a> saying "We appreciate President Trump’s enthusiasm for our iconic Coca‑Cola brand" and that "More details on new innovative offerings" will be announced soon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/trumps-claims-of-a-coca-cola-agreement-quickly-go-flat-as-nutritionists-groan/">Read full article</a></p>

The company deleted all accounts, as well as the only ways to use Dictionary.com without seeing ads —even if you previously paid for an ad-free experience.</p>
<p>Dictionary.com offers a free dictionary through its website and free Android and iOS apps. It used to offer paid-for mobile apps, called Dictionary.com Pro, that let users set up accounts, use the app without ads, and enabled other features (like grammar tips and science and rhyming dictionaries) that are gone now. Dictionary.com's premium apps also let people download an offline dictionary (its free apps used to let you buy a downloadable dictionary as a one-time purchase), but offline the dictionaries aren't available anymore.</p>
<h2>Accounts axed abruptly</h2>
<p>About a year ago, claims of Dictionary.com’s apps being buggy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dictionary/comments/1eokr9i/comment/lhepd9n/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">surfaced online</a>.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers from Cisco’s Talos security team have uncovered a malware-as-a-service operator that used public GitHub accounts as a channel for distributing an assortment of malicious software to targets.</p>
<p>The use of GitHub gave the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) a reliable and easy-to-use platform that’s greenlit in many enterprise networks that rely on the code repository for the software they develop. GitHub removed the three accounts that hosted the malicious payloads shortly after being notified by Talos.</p>
<p>“In addition to being an easy means of file hosting, downloading files from a GitHub repository may bypass Web filtering that is not configured to block the GitHub domain,” Talos researchers Chris Neal and Craig Jackson <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/maas-operation-using-emmenhtal-and-amadey-linked-to-threats-against-ukrainian-entities/">wrote Thursday</a>. “While some organizations can block GitHub in their environment to curb the use of open-source offensive tooling and other malware, many organizations with software development teams require GitHub access in some capacity. In these environments, a malicious GitHub download may be difficult to differentiate from regular web traffic.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/malware-as-a-service-caught-using-github-to-distribute-its-payloads/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you're the owner of an Android phone and live in a seismically active region, there's a chance your phone has popped up an unusual warning. Not one that asks for permission to share personal information, or potential malware, but something far more serious: There's an earthquake nearby, and you have up to a minute or two to get to a safer location.</p>
<p>Starting in the US in 2020 and expanding internationally since, the system is called Android Earthquake Alert (AEA), and it's on by default in most Android phones. And today, Google has a paper in Science that describes how the system works, how the company has improved it, and what it has seen during the first few years of operation, including what caused a handful of false alarms.</p>
<h2>Shaking things up</h2>
<p>Smartphones come with accelerometers, small devices that enable them to sense changes in motion. This is how they manage to do tricks like figuring out how many steps you're walking. If your phone is sitting quietly on a table, however, the accelerometer shouldn't be registering much significant motion. But anything from you walking across the room to a truck going by outside can cause vibrations that your phone's accelerometer can pick up. As can the often less subtle vibrations of earthquakes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/how-android-phones-became-an-earthquake-warning-system/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, Medicare spent over $10 billion on dubious bandages—called skin substitutes—that come with eye-popping prices. Some are made from medical waste, like dried bits of discarded placentas or infant foreskin, and many have not gone through rigorous testing to prove they offer any advantage over standard bandages. Yet, in some cases, Medicare reportedly paid for bandages priced at more than $21,000 per square inch. And individual patients have quickly racked up bills over $1 million just for their bandaging—some who puzzlingly didn't even have a wound.</p>
<p>Private insurance companies largely do not cover these bandages, declaring many of them "<a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-medical-drug/skin-soft-tissue-substitutes.pdf">unproven and not medically necessary</a>." But Medicare's current coverage seems to tie back to a rule change in 2020 that opened the door to broader use of them—and the market for these dubious skin substitutes, often used for diabetic ulcers, exploded. Since 2023, more than 100 new products have been introduced, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/health/skin-substitutes-medicare-costs.html">an investigative report from The New York Times in April</a>.</p>
<p>The Times investigation highlighted two big reasons why they're so pricy: First, due to an oddity in pricing rules, Medicare initially sets the reimbursement rate for the bandages at whatever price the manufacturer chooses—for the first six months at least. The second is that doctors are granted steep discounts, incentivizing them to use the pricy products for bigger reimbursements. After the initial six-month period, Medicare reimburses only what doctors pay after manufacturer discounts. However, some bandage makers get around this by just rolling out new products that are suspiciously similar to the old ones, maintaining the large reimbursement rates.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/bandages-made-of-medical-waste-cost-medicare-10b-last-year-limits-are-coming/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI launched <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/">ChatGPT Agent</a>, a new feature that lets the company's AI assistant complete multi-step tasks by controlling its own web browser. The update merges capabilities from OpenAI's earlier <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">Operator</a> tool and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/after-24-hour-hackathon-hugging-faces-ai-research-agent-nearly-matches-openais-solution/">Deep Research</a> feature, allowing ChatGPT to navigate websites, run code, and create documents while users maintain control over the process.</p>
<p>The feature marks OpenAI's latest entry into what the tech industry calls "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openai-pushes-ai-agent-capabilities-with-new-developer-api/">agentic AI</a>"—systems that can take autonomous multi-step actions on behalf of the user. OpenAI says users can ask Agent to handle requests like assembling and purchasing a clothing outfit for a particular occasion, creating PowerPoint slide decks, planning meals, or updating financial spreadsheets with new data.</p>
<p>The system uses a combination of web browsers, terminal access, and API connections to complete these tasks, including "ChatGPT Connectors" that integrate with apps like Gmail and GitHub.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/chatgpts-new-ai-agent-can-browse-the-web-and-create-powerpoint-slideshows/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is hosting its annual Pixel event on August 20, which will likely feature the Pixel 10 series and the Pixel Watch 4. The new Pixel phones are expected to retain the physical design of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/the-pixel-9-phones-are-big-cameras-and-screens-soldered-onto-gemini-ai-ambitions/">last year's phones</a>, but a new report claims Google's smartwatch is getting an important hardware upgrade—it may finally be repairable.</p>
<p>Google has stuck with the same design for all three generations of the Pixel Watch, making changes only to internal components, displays, and charging. Even with the year-to-year design consistency, Google has neglected to make replacement parts available—not to consumers and not to repair shops. A report from <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-watch-4-repairable">Android Headlines</a> claims that Google will make changes to the construction that will allow for repairs.</p>
<p>The Pixel Watch, Watch 2, and the current <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/googles-pixel-watch-3-has-a-bigger-screen-and-pixel-buds-pro-2-are-smaller/">Watch 3</a> have the same sleek construction, featuring a curved glass cover that merges seamlessly with the aluminum housing. It looks great, but there's no easy way to disassemble it. Even if you manage to get inside, it's nigh impossible to find replacement parts. We don't yet know if the supposed redesign will make the Pixel Watch 4 look different, but the report claims it has been designed specifically with repairs in mind.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/the-pixel-watch-4-might-not-become-e-waste-if-you-damage-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A former cop in the United Kingdom was sentenced to five and a half years in prison Wednesday after pleading guilty to covering up his theft of 50 bitcoins seized during an investigation into the now-defunct illicit dark web marketplace Silk Road.</p>
<p>In 2014, the former UK National Crime Agency (NCA) officer, Paul Chowles, assisted in the arrest of Thomas White, a man "who had launched Silk Road 2.0 less than a month after the FBI had shut down the original site in 2013," the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/ex-nca-officer-jailed-theft-50-bitcoin-now-worth-ps44m-during-investigation-crime-dark-web">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Chowles was tapped to analyze and extract "relevant data and cryptocurrency" from White's seized devices, specifically due to Chowles' reputation for being "technically minded and very aware of the dark web and cryptocurrencies," CPS said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/ex-cop-gets-5-years-for-stealing-bitcoins-he-helped-seize-from-silk-road/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Karl Urban takes a break from <em>The Boys</em> to play a washed-up Johnny Cage in the trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_II_(film)"><em>Mortal Kombat II</em></a>, a sequel to 2021's <em>Mortal Kombat</em> reboot and the fourth live-action film in the franchise based on the 1990s video game series. It comes one day after Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncaged-fury-trailer-mortal-kombat-2-johnny-cage-karl-urban">released a (very entertaining) fake trailer</a> for a new in-universe, faux 1990s Johnny Cage movie, <em>Uncaged Fury</em>. (Cage's prior fake film credits apparently include <em>Cool Hand Cage, Hard to Cage</em>, and <em>Rebel Without a Cage</em>.)</p>
<p>The first live-action <em>Mortal Kombat</em> film turns 30 this year. It was a box office success but a critical failure, although it has since evolved into a campy cult classic—and Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa is still considered by many to be the definitive portrayal of sorcerer Shang Tsung.  A 1997 sequel, <em>Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</em>, however, bombed both critically and financially. And Midway, the game publisher, filed for bankruptcy soon after.</p>
<p>However, Warner Bros. bought the rights and eventually tapped Simon McQuoid to direct a reboot more than 20 years after the original's release, focusing on MMA fighter Cole Young (Lewis Tan). The 2021 film earned mixed reviews, but performed sufficiently well at the box office for Warner Bros. to green-light a sequel, also directed by McQuoid. The 2021 film ended with Cole heading to Los Angeles to look for martial arts movie star Johnny Cage, who is the main protagonist of <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/karl-urban-is-a-wise-cracking-johnny-cage-in-mortal-kombat-ii/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Gamers of a certain age will remember a period roughly 15 years ago when the industry collectively decided <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/hands-on-3d-without-the-glasses-comes-into-focus-at-ces/">stereoscopic 3D was going to be the next big thing in gaming</a>. From <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/01/ces-2009-nvidia-shows-off-3d-glasses-with-left-4-dead/">Nvidia's "3D Vision" glasses system</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/01/hands-on-with-the-nintendo-3ds-at-ces/">Nintendo's glasses-free 3DS</a> to Sony's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/06/sony-announces-24-3d-playstation-tv-god-of-war-team-ico-3d-collections/">3D TV aimed specifically at gamers</a>, major gaming companies put a lot of effort into bringing a sense of real depth to the flat video game scenes of the day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for those companies, the stereoscopic 3D gaming hype faded almost as quickly as it rose; by 2012, most companies were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/what-happened-to-the-stereoscopic-gaming-revolution/">scaling back their stereoscopic investments</a> in light of underwhelming public demand (case in point: Nintendo's pivot to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/hands-on-with-the-nintendo-2ds-surprisingly-small-and-comfortable/">the 3D-free 2DS</a> line of portables). And while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/lenovo-adds-glasses-free-3d-to-a-27-inch-monitor-for-2999/">some stray</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/asus-new-16-inch-workstation-laptops-have-3d-oled-screens/">upstarts</a> have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/the-glasses-free-technology-that-made-me-believe-in-3d-tv-again/">tried to revive the stereoscopic gaming dream in the years since</a>, the idea seemed destined to be a footnote in gaming tech history.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/samsungs-odyssey-3d-monitor-delivers-great-glasses-free-3d-for-a-handful-of-games/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The premiere of <em>Alien: Earth</em> is just weeks away, and FX/Hulu dropped one last trailer to pique our interest, along with a much more detailed synopsis. It's meditative and existential in tone, with a haunting tune playing over footage of mysterious alien craft, dead bodies, blood-spattered humans fleeing through futuristic corridors, and, of course, a spooky silhouette of a xenomorph in the distance.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/fx-hulu-releases-sinister-alien-earth-trailer/">previously reported</a>, the eight-episode series is set in 2120, two years before the events of the first film, <em>Alien</em> (1979), in a world where corporate interests are competing to unlock the key to human longevity—maybe even immortality. Showrunner Noah Hawley <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/noah-hawley-alien-series-prometheus-backstory-not-useful-1235871454/">has said</a> that the style and mythology will be closer to that film than <em>Prometheus</em> (2012) or <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, both of which were also prequels.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US Senate voted to rescind two years' worth of funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), delivering a blow to public radio and television stations around the country. The CPB is a publicly funded nonprofit corporation that supports NPR and PBS stations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00411.htm">51-48 vote</a> today on President Trump's rescissions package would eliminate $1.1 billion that was allocated to public broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. All 51 yes votes came from Republicans, while Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted against. The $1.1 billion <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-118publ47/pdf/PLAW-118publ47.pdf">includes</a> $60 million for "costs associated with replacing and upgrading the public broadcasting interconnection system" and other back-end infrastructure for public media.</p>
<p>"Without federal funding, many local public radio and television stations will be forced to shut down. Parents will have fewer high quality learning resources available for their children," CPB CEO Patricia Harrison <a href="https://cpb.org/pressroom/Statement-response-US-Senate-approval-rescission-package-eliminating-CPB-funding">said</a>. "Millions of Americans will have less trustworthy information about their communities, states, country, and world with which to make decisions about the quality of their lives. Cutting federal funding could also put Americans at risk of losing national and local emergency alerts that serve as a lifeline to many Americans in times of severe need."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/senate-votes-to-kill-entire-public-broadcasting-budget-in-blow-to-npr-and-pbs/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>How many Google AI researchers does it take to screw in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbulb_joke">lightbulb</a>? A recent research paper <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">detailing</a> the technical core behind Google's Gemini AI assistant may suggest an answer, listing an eye-popping 3,295 authors.</p>
<p>It's a number that recently caught the attention of machine learning researcher David Ha (known as "hardmaru" online), who <a href="https://x.com/hardmaru/status/1944385851435205035">revealed</a> on X that the first 43 names also contain a hidden message. "There’s a secret code if you observe the authors’ first initials in the order of authorship," Ha <a href="https://x.com/hardmaru/status/1944385851435205035">wrote</a>, relaying the Easter egg: "GEMINI MODELS CAN THINK AND GET BACK TO YOU IN A FLASH."</p>
<p>The paper, titled "Gemini 2.5: Pushing the Frontier with Advanced Reasoning, Multimodality, Long Context, and Next Generation Agentic Capabilities," <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06261">describes</a> Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/googles-best-gemini-ai-model-is-showing-up-in-more-places/">Gemini 2.5 Flash</a> AI models, which were released in March. These large language models, which power Google's chatbot AI assistant, feature <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">simulated reasoning</a> capabilities that produce a string of "thinking out loud" text before generating responses in an attempt to help them solve more difficult problems. That explains "think" and "flash" in the hidden text.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/why-it-takes-3295-people-to-write-one-google-ai-paper/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It's widely accepted conventional wisdom that when it comes to creative works—TV shows, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02758">films</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122417728662">music</a>, books—consumers crave an optimal balance between novelty and familiarity. What we choose to consume and share with others, in turn, drives cultural evolution.</p>
<p>But what if that conventional wisdom is wrong? An analysis based on data from a massive online fan fiction (fanfic) archive contradicts this so-called "balance theory," according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-05166-3">paper</a> published in the journal Humanities and Social Sciences Communications. The fanfic community seems to overwhelmingly prefer more of the same, consistently choosing familiarity over novelty; however, they reported greater overall enjoyment when they took a chance and read something more novel. In short: "Sameness entices, but novelty enchants."</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, authors have always copied characters and plots from other works (cf. many of William Shakespeare's plays), although the advent of copyright law complicated matters. Modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction">fan fiction</a> as we currently think of it arguably emerged with the 1967 publication of the first <em>Star Trek</em> fanzine (Spockanalia), which included spinoff fiction based on the series. <em>Star Trek</em> also spawned the subgenre of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction">slash fiction</a>, when writers began creating stories featuring Kirk and Spock (Kirk/Spock, or K/S) in a romantic (often sexual) relationship.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/what-fanfic-can-teach-us-about-cultural-evolution/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Delta has become the first airline to announce that it is using AI to boost profits by personalizing pricing through a pilot program that for months has caused customers to pay different prices for the same flights based on their data profile.</p>
<p>Critics have warned that this use of AI goes beyond airline practices that charge people who book flights ahead less than people who book flights at the last minute—and could ultimately mean the end of cheap flights across the board if other airlines follow.</p>
<p>On an <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/181345880/files/doc_earnings/2025/q2/transcript/CORRECTED-TRANSCRIPT_-Delta-Air-Lines-Inc-DAL-US-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call.pdf">earnings call</a> last week, Delta Air Lines President Glen William Hauenstein confirmed that seats on about 3 percent of domestic flights were sold using the AI pricing system over the past six months.

<p>Some measures have been aimed at decreasing adoption of electric vehicles—for example the IRS clean vehicle tax credit will be eliminated at the end of September. Others have targeted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/new-epa-doe-fuel-regs-give-automakers-longer-to-reduce-co2-emissions/">federal fuel economy regulations</a> that require automakers to meet specific fleet efficiency averages or face punishing fines for polluting too much.
