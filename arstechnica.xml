<p>The FBI and law enforcement partners worldwide have seized BreachForums, a website that openly trafficked malware and data stolen in hacks.</p>
<p>The site has operated for years as an online trading post where criminals could buy and sell all kinds of compromised data, including passwords, customer records, and other often-times sensitive data. Last week, a site user advertised the sale of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/dell-warns-of-incident-that-may-have-leaked-customers-personal-info/">Dell customer data</a> that was obtained from a support portal, forcing the computer maker to issue a vague warning to those affected. Also last week, Europol <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/europol-confirms-web-portal-breach-says-no-operational-data-stolen/">confirmed to Bleeping Computer</a> that some of its data had been exposed in a breach of one of its portals. The data was put up for sale on BreachForums, Bleeping Computer reported.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the normal BreachForums front page was replaced with one that proclaimed: “This website has been taken down by the FBI and DOJ with assistance from international partners.” It went on to say agents are analyzing the backend data and invited those with information about the site to contact them. A graphic shown prominently at the top showed the forum profile images of the site's two administrators, Baphomet and ShinyHunters, positioned behind prison bars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024837#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024837&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday at Google I/O 2024, Google announced <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/">Veo</a>, a new AI video synthesis model that can create HD videos from text, image, or video prompts, similar to OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">Sora</a>. It can generate 1080p videos lasting over a minute and edit videos from written instructions, but it has not yet been released for broad use.</p>

<p>Veo reportedly includes the ability to edit existing videos using text commands, maintain visual consistency across frames, and generate video sequences lasting up to and beyond 60 seconds from a single prompt or a series of prompts that form a narrative. The company says it can generate detailed scenes and apply cinematic effects such as time-lapses, aerial shots, and various visual styles</p>
<p>Since the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/when-ai-images-were-mind-blowing-early-users-recall-the-first-days-of-dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a> in April 2022, we've seen a parade of new image synthesis and video synthesis models that aim to allow anyone who can type a written description to create a detailed image or video. While neither technology has been fully refined, both AI image and video generators have been steadily growing more capable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024749#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024749&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Within approximately 12 seconds, two highly educated brothers allegedly stole $25 million by tampering with the ethereum blockchain in a never-before-seen cryptocurrency scheme, according to an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/US-v-Bueno-Sealed-Indictment-5-15-2024.pdf">indictment</a> that the US Department of Justice unsealed Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-brothers-arrested-attacking-ethereum-blockchain-and-stealing-25m-cryptocurrency">press release</a>, US Attorney Damian Williams said the scheme was so sophisticated that it "calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question."</p>
<p>"The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of ethereum users across the globe," Williams said. "And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024782#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024782&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>RealVNC will soon end its "Home" plan that's free to use for up to three users and five devices. If you still wanted a non-commercial just-in-case plan, there is one, but you're going to have to hunt a bit.</p>
<p>RealVNC users with Home subscriptions will likely receive an email from the company with the subject line: "Important changes to your Home subscription." The email notes that the firm is "Retiring our Home plan" as of June 17, 2024.</p>
<p>After "launching a wider range of tiered plans designed to better cater to more users" and to "maintain a cohesive set of plan options," the email states, Home must be retired. RealVNC, asking itself FAQ-style, "What do I need to do?" notes that the easiest way to avoid disruption is to upgrade to a paid plan. Switch now and you can save 20 percent, after hitting the big blue button labeled "SAVE MY ACCOUNT," RealVNC suggests.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024689#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024689&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hey, football fans! You're already watching the NFL on CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC, ESPN, ESPN Plus, Peacock, Amazon Prime Video, NFL Network, and YouTube TV, right? Well, get ready for one more: Netflix! The biggest streaming provider that wasn't showing NFL games is now jumping into the pile. The NFL and Netflix <a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/Netflix-Will-Be-the-Home-to-Live-NFL-Games-This-Christmas-Day.aspx">have signed</a> a three-year deal that will put exclusive Christmas games on the streaming service.</p>
<p>The first Netflix Christmas games will be this season, on December 25, 2024, (that's <em>a Wednesday,</em> by the way). Netflix will get two Christmas games this year, Chiefs at Steelers and Ravens at Texans, with exact times to be announced later tonight at the NFL's live schedule unveiling extravaganza (even the schedule release is an event now). The NFL says 2025 and 2026 will see "at least one" game on the service each Christmas. The exact terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>In the quickly changing landscape of TV, the NFL has long been one of the few things left that is still appointment television. Of the top 100 highest-rated US TV broadcasts in 2023, <a href="https://www.sportico.com/business/media/2024/nfl-posts-93-of-top-100-tv-broadcasts-2023-1234761753/">93 percent</a> of them were NFL games. In the hyper-fragmented world of streaming, landing a few exclusive NFL games is a great way to hook people into your service. NBC's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/first-streaming-only-nfl-playoff-game-breaks-records-with-23-million-viewers/">exclusive Peacock playoff game</a> brought in 23 million viewers last year. And even if that was a bit low by NFL standards, NBC called it "the most streamed event ever in US history" and "a milestone moment in media and sports history." You might think NFL fans would immediately cancel after the final kneel-down, but <a href="https://barrettsportsmedia.com/2024/03/22/study-peacock-retained-71-of-nfl-wild-card-game-subscribers-seven-weeks-later/">one study</a> showed a shocking 71 percent of users that signed up for the NFL game were still on Peacock seven weeks later.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024680#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024680&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an ironic twist, cable TV and Internet provider Comcast has announced that it, too, will sell a bundle of video-streaming services for a discounted price. The announcement comes as Comcast has been rapidly losing cable TV subscribers to streaming services and seeks to bring the same type of bundling that originally drew people away from cable to streaming.</p>
<p>Starting on an unspecified date this month, the bundle, called Streamsaver, will offer Peacock, which Comcast owns, Apple TV+, and Netflix to people who subscribe to Comcast's cable TV and/or broadband. Comcast already offers Netflix or Apple TV+ as add-ons to its cable TV, but Streamsaver expands Comcast's streaming-related bundling efforts.</p>
<p>Comcast didn't say how much the streaming bundle would cost, but CEO Brian Roberts said that it will “come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today" when announcing the bundle on Tuesday at MoffettNathanson’s 2024 Media, Internet and Communications Conference in New York, per <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/peacock-netflix-apple-tv-plus-bundle-streaming-comcast-1236002375/">Variety</a>. If we factor in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/all-the-ways-streaming-services-are-aggravating-their-subscribers-this-week/">Peacock's upcoming price hike</a>, subscribing to Apple TV+, Netflix, and Peacock separately would cost $39.47 per month without ads, or $24.97/month with ads.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024632#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024632&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Department of Justice yesterday said it has determined that Boeing violated a 2021 agreement spurred by two fatal crashes and is now facing a potential criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Boeing violated the agreement "by failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations," the DOJ said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.342881/gov.uscourts.txnd.342881.199.0_1.pdf">filing</a> in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Because of this, "Boeing is subject to prosecution by the United States for any federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge," the DOJ said.</p>
<p>The US government is still determining whether to initiate a prosecution and said it will make a decision by July 7. Under terms of the 2021 agreement, Boeing has 30 days to respond to the government's notice.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024655#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024655&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google's I/O conference is still happening, and while the big keynote was yesterday, major Android beta releases have apparently been downgraded to Day 2 of the show. Google really seems to want to be primarily an AI company now. Android already had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-wants-ai-to-listen-to-your-phone-calls-detect-scam-callers/">some AI news</a> yesterday, but now that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-dusts-off-the-failed-google-playbook-to-fight-chatgpt/">code-red requirements</a> have been met, we have actual OS news.</p>
<p>One of the big features in this release is "Private Space," which Google says is a place where users can "keep sensitive apps away from prying eyes, under an additional layer of authentication." First, there's a new hidden-by-default portion of the app drawer that can hold these sensitive apps, and revealing that part of the app drawer requires a second round of lock-screen authentication, which can be different from the main phone lock screen.</p>
<p>Just like "Work" apps, the apps in this section run on a separate profile. To the system, they are run by a separate "user" with separate data, which your non-private apps won't be able to see. Interestingly, Google says, "When private space is locked by the user, the profile is paused, i.e., the apps are no longer active," so apps in a locked Private Space won't be able to show notifications unless you go through the second lock screen.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024211#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024211&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Infrastructure used to maintain and distribute the Linux operating system kernel was infected for two years, starting in 2009, by sophisticated malware that managed to get a hold of one of the developers’ most closely guarded resources: the /etc/shadow files that stored encrypted password data for more than 550 system users, researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The unknown attackers behind the compromise infected at least four servers inside kernel.org, the Internet domain underpinning the sprawling Linux development and distribution network, the researchers from security firm ESET said. After obtaining the cryptographic hashes for 551 user accounts on the network, the attackers were able to convert half into plaintext passwords, likely through password-cracking techniques and the use of an advanced credential-stealing feature built into the malware. From there, the attackers used the servers to send spam and carry out other nefarious activities. The four servers were likely infected and disinfected at different times, with the last two being remediated at some point in 2011.</p>
<h2>Stealing kernel.org’s keys to the kingdom</h2>
<p>An infection of kernel.org <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2011/08/31/linux_kernel_security_breach/">came to light</a> in 2011, when kernel maintainers revealed that 448 accounts had been compromised after attackers had somehow managed to gain unfettered, or “root,” system access to servers connected to the domain. Maintainers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/who-rooted-kernel-org-servers-two-years-ago-how-did-it-happen-and-why/">reneged on a promise</a> to provide an autopsy of the hack, a decision that has limited the public’s understanding of the incident.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024591#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024591&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission's Office of Technology has issued a warning to automakers that sell connected cars. Companies that offer such products "do not have the free license to monetize people’s information beyond purposes needed to provide their requested product or service," <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/05/cars-consumer-data-unlawful-collection-use">it wrote in a blog post on Tuesday</a>. Just because executives and investors want recurring revenue streams, that does not "outweigh the need for meaningful privacy safeguards," the FTC wrote.</p>
<p>Based on your feedback, connected cars might be one of the least-popular modern inventions among the Ars readership. And who can blame them? <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/hackers-discover-that-vulnerabilities-are-rife-in-the-auto-industry/">Last January</a>, a security researcher revealed that a vehicle identification number was sufficient to access remote services for multiple different makes, and yet more had APIs that were easily hackable.</p>
<p>Later, in 2023, the Mozilla Foundation published an extensive report examining the various automakers' policies regarding the use of data from connected cars; the report concluded that "cars are the worst product category we have ever reviewed for privacy."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024643#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024643&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton">John Milton</a> is widely considered to be one of the greatest English poets who ever lived—just ask such luminaries as John Dryden, Alexander Pope, Samuel Jonson, and Voltaire, who once declared, "Milton remains the glory and the wonder of England." But while Milton's own books continue to be widely read and studied, there are only a handful of books in collections today known to have been part of his personal library.</p>
<p>Add one more title to that small list, as scholars recently discovered a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holinshed%27s_Chronicles">Holinshed's<em> Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland</em></a> in the Phoenix Public Library, containing handwritten notes in Milton's distinctive hand. This makes the volume extra-special, since only two other books once owned by Milton also contain handwritten notes. The scholars detailed their findings in <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/john-milton-annotated-holinshed-chronicles-commentary/">a new article</a> published in the Times Literary Supplement.</p>
<p>Holinshed's <em>Chronicles</em> is a hugely influential and comprehensive three-volume history of Great Britain, first published in 1577; it was followed by a second edition in 1587. A London printer named Reginald Wolfe started the project and hired Raphael Holinshed and William Harrison to help him create a "universal cosmography of the whole world." Wolfe died before the book could be completed, and the project was eventually scaled down to a history of England, Scotland, and Ireland, complete with maps and illustrations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024241#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024241&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Broadcom's acquisition of VMware last year has led to widespread upheaval at the company, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-cuts-at-least-2800-vmware-jobs-following-69-billion-acquisition/">layoffs</a>, big changes to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">how it approaches software licensing</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/vmware-admits-sweeping-broadcom-changes-are-worrying-customers/">general angst</a> from customers and partners. Broadcom also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/broadcom-owned-vmware-kills-the-free-version-of-esxi-virtualization-software/">discontinued</a> the free-to-use version of VMware's vSphere Hypervisor/ESXi earlier this year, forcing home users <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/proxmox-adds-easy-import-option-for-vms-after-broadcom-kills-vmwares-esxi/">to find alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>But today there's <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/05/14/vmware-desktop-hypervisor-pro-apps-now-available-for-personal-use/">a bit of good news</a>—for home users, at least. Broadcom is making <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2024/05/fusion-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html">VMware Fusion Pro 13</a> and <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html">VMWare Workstation Pro</a> free for personal use.</p>
<p>Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro certainly aren't the only free-to-use virtualization products—<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> has existed for years, and there are many indie projects that make use of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/how-to-use-free-virtualization-apps-to-safely-test-the-macos-ventura-betas/">Apple's virtualization frameworks for macOS</a>.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>LOS ANGELES—Let's face it: The American power grid is a hot mess. The system is outdated and overstressed by amp-sucking appliances, air conditioning units, and extreme weather. Depending on where you live, it's likely only a matter of time before your home will experience a blackout. GM Energy, a subsidiary of General Motors, is here to help.</p>
<p>At a demonstration in a swanky 10,000-square-foot mansion in Beverly Hills, California, where I counted 51 recessed lights in the great room, the new home products from GM Energy easily kept the electrons flowing, eschewing the grid and drawing power from the 200 kWh battery in a 2024 Chevrolet Silverado RST.</p>
<p>It all starts with the GM Energy PowerShift charger. On an 80 A circuit, the charger can charge your EV at a whopping 19.2 kW, and its bi-directional technology can push electrons from the truck's battery into an inverter to convert it to the AC power your home requires. The happy little AC current then goes into the Home Hub that distributes the power to the appropriate circuits, and voilà—the lights are on.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024596#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024596&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On a fall evening in 2022, scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory were busy with the final stages of a planetary defense mission. As Andy Rivkin, one of the team leaders, was getting ready to appear in NASA’s live broadcast of the experiment, a colleague posted a photo of a pair of asteroids: the half-mile-wide Didymos and, orbiting around it, a smaller one called Dimorphos, taken about 7 million miles from Earth.</p>
<p>“We were able to see Didymos and this little dot in the right spot where we expected Dimorphos to be,” Rivkin recalled.</p>
<p>After the interview, Rivkin joined a crowd of scientists and guests to watch the mission’s finale on several big screens: As part of an asteroid deflection mission called DART, a spacecraft was closing in on Dimorphos and photographing its rocky surface in increasing detail.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024593#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024593&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <p><em>Ars Technica AI Reporter and tech historian Benj Edwards has co-written a book on the Virtual Boy with Dr. Jose Zagal. In this exclusive excerpt, Benj and Jose take you back to Nintendo of the early '90s, where a unique 3D display technology captured the imagination of legendary designer Gunpei Yokoi and set the stage for a daring, if ultimately ill-fated, foray into the world of stereoscopic gaming.
<br><br>
<em>Seeing Red: Nintendo's Virtual Boy</em> is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045063/seeing-red/">now available for purchase</a> in print and ebook formats.

<p>Nearly 30 years after the launch of the Virtual Boy, not much is publicly known about how, exactly, Nintendo came to be interested in developing what would ultimately become its ill-fated console. Was Nintendo committed to VR as a future for video games and looking for technological solutions that made business sense? Or was the Virtual Boy primarily the result of Nintendo going “off script” and seizing a unique, and possibly risky, opportunity that presented itself? The answer is probably a little bit of both.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the Virtual Boy was not an anomaly in Nintendo’s history with video game platforms. Rather, it was the result of a deliberate strategy that was consistent with Nintendo’s way of doing things and informed by its lead creator Gunpei Yokoi’s design philosophy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017218#p3">Read 47 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017218&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday evening, OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322">announced</a> that he is leaving the company he co-founded, six months after he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/report-sutskever-led-board-coup-at-openai-that-ousted-altman-over-ai-safety-concerns/">participated in the coup</a> that temporarily ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. <span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Jan Leike</span>, a fellow member of Sutskever's <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/14/1085344/openai-super-alignment-rogue-agi-gpt-4/">Superalignment</a> team, is reportedly <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openais-chief-scientist-a-former-foe-of-ceo-altman-resigns-with-key-ally">resigning with him</a>.</p>

<p>"After almost a decade, I have made the decision to leave OpenAI," Sutskever <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322">tweeted</a>. "The company’s trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I’m confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial under the leadership of @sama, @gdb, @miramurati and now, under the excellent research leadership of @merettm. It was an honor and a privilege to have worked together, and I will miss everyone dearly."</p>
<p>Sutskever has been with the company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211006105333/https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/">since its founding</a> in 2015 and is widely seen as one of the key engineers behind some of OpenAI's biggest technical breakthroughs. As a former OpenAI board member, he played a key role in the removal of Sam Altman as CEO in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/11/openai-fires-ceo-sam-altman-citing-less-than-candid-communications/">shocking firing</a> last November. While it later emerged that Altman's firing primarily stemmed from a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-conduct-did-not-mandate-removal-says-independent-review/">power struggle</a> with former board member Helen Toner, Sutskever sided with Toner and personally delivered the news to Altman that he was being fired on behalf of the board.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024533#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024533&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A large, long-term trial of the weight-loss medication Wegovy (semaglutide) found that people tended to lose weight over the first 65 weeks on the drug—about one year and three months—but then hit a plateau or "set point." But that early weight loss was generally maintained for up to four years while people continued taking the weekly injections.</p>
<p>The findings, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02996-7">published Monday in Nature Medicine</a>, come from a fresh analysis of data from the SELECT trial, which was designed to look at the drug's effects on cardiovascular health. The trial—a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial—specifically enrolled people with existing cardiovascular disease who also were overweight or obese but did not have diabetes. In all, the trial included 17,604 people from 41 countries. Seventy-two percent of them were male, 84 percent were white, and the average age was about 62 years old.</p>
<p>Last year, researchers <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563">published the trial's primary results</a>, which showed that semaglutide reduced participants' risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular-related deaths <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/11/obesity-drug-wegovy-reduces-cardiovascular-risks-for-those-at-high-risk/">by 20 percent</a> over the span of a little over three years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024518#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024518&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YN2H_sKcmGw?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>House of the Dragon</em> returns to HBO Max for an action-packed second season next month. </p></div>
<p>The second season of <em>House of the Dragon</em> premieres in about a month, and we have one final action-packed trailer to boost anticipation. While the first season felt smaller and quieter—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-house-of-the-dragon-prequel-series-makes-a-solid-debut/">in a good way</a>, more focused on character relationships and political maneuvering—the show seems to be pulling out all the stops in S2 as all-out war breaks out in the legendary "Dance of Dragons."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tensions-rise-between-targaryens-in-first-teaser-for-house-of-the-dragon-s2/">previously reported</a>, the series is set nearly 200 years before the events of <em>Game of Thrones </em>and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen's reign. The primary source material is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-uri="1e4524e735173b30ff50f2f666a28acc"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a>, a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap">





<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCwmXY_f-e0?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Charlie Vicker's Sauron is front and center in the teaser for S2 of <em>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em>. </p></div>
<p>Amazon's Prime Video made a major investment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power"><em>The Rings of Power</em></a> when it acquired the rights to the source material from the Tolkien estate, even committing to multiple seasons upfront. The casting was strong and the visuals were quite spectacular (including the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/this-youtube-star-re-created-rings-of-power-title-sequence-in-chladni-figures/">opening credits</a>). But while the first season had its moments, personally I found it a bit plodding, often more concerned with establishing this rich fictional world and the characters within it than moving the story forward.</p>
<p>Showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/10-burning-questions-about-amazons-the-rings-of-power">have said</a> that this was deliberate. They wanted to avoid a "villain-centric" story in S1 but promised they would be delving more deeply into "the lore and the stories people have been waiting to hear." That would be the rise of Sauron (Charlie Vickers), the forging of the titular rings of power, and the last alliance between elves and men to defeat Sauron's evil machinations. Judging by the teaser that dropped today, we'll be getting lots more action in S2, with the shape-shifting Sauron now handily disguised as an elf. Bonus: There's an accompanying behind-the-scenes preview of the second season.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>After backlash over Google's search engine becoming the primary traffic source for deepfake porn websites, Google has started burying these links in search results, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-14/google-moves-deepfake-porn-sites-lower-in-its-search-rankings">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Google has been driving millions to controversial sites distributing AI-generated pornography depicting real people in fake sex videos that were created without their consent, Similarweb found. While anyone can be targeted—police already are bogged down with dealing with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/surge-of-fake-ai-child-sex-images-thwarts-investigations-into-real-child-abuse/">flood of fake AI child sex images</a>—female celebrities are the most common victims. And their fake non-consensual intimate imagery is more easily discoverable on Google by searching just about any famous name with the keyword "deepfake," Bloomberg noted.</p>
<p>Google refers to this content as "involuntary fake" or "synthetic pornography." The search engine provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9116649?hl=en">path</a> for victims to report that content whenever it appears in search results. And when processing these requests, Google also removes duplicates of any flagged deepfakes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024472#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024472&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
