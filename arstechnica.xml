<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington to Munich and accommodation so Ars could be briefed about the A6 e-tron as well as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/heres-audis-next-a5-and-all-the-stuff-we-wont-get-in-the-us/">A5</a> we wrote about several weeks ago, and another model you can read about in the coming weeks. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>MUNICH—The sedan is not quite dead—at least not yet. While it's true that car buyers are <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americas-love-affair-with-the-suv-is-killing-the-trusty-sedan-150138154.html">voting with their wallets</a> and <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/heres-the-exact-year-suv-sales-overtook-sedan-sales-in-america/">opting for crossovers and SUVs</a>, not every automaker has given up on the form factor, even when it comes to electric vehicles. For example, Audi's next EV will be the new A6 e-tron, which goes on sale in the US next year.</p>
<p>The pedants might quibble with calling the A6 e-tron a sedan, as the one we're getting here is a midsize five-door, meaning it has a rear hatch instead of a trunk. In Audi lingo, that means it's an A6 Sportback e-tron, with more of a two-box rather than three-box shape like the outgoing (internal combustion engine-powered) A6. Not that that's a bad thing in our eyes—the rear hatch will make it easier to load or unload larger items (like a bicycle) into the cargo area.</p>
<p>"We were determined to give the A6 e-tron <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/this-electric-fastback-is-the-next-audi-a6-e-tron-due-in-late-2022/">the attractive proportions of the concept car,</a>" said Audi designer Wolf Seebers. "I'm talking about the classic Sportback silhouette that Audi fans are familiar with," Seebers said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040162#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040162&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Extreme weather is, by definition, rare on our planet. Ferocious storms, searing heatwaves, and biting cold snaps illustrate what the climate is capable of at its worst. However, since Earth’s climate is rapidly warming, predominantly due to <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change#:%7E:text=Fossil%20fuels%20%E2%80%93%20coal%2C%20oil%20and,they%20trap%20the%20sun's%20heat.">fossil fuel burning</a>, the range of possible weather conditions, including extremes, is changing.</p>
<p>Scientists define “climate” as the distribution of possible weather events observed over a length of time, such as the range of temperatures, rainfall totals, or hours of sunshine. From this, they construct statistical measures, such as the average (or normal) temperature. Weather varies on several timescales—from <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL075483">seconds to decades</a>—so the longer the period over which the climate is analyzed, the more accurately these analyses capture the infinite range of possible configurations of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Typically, meteorologists and climate scientists use a 30-year period to represent the climate, which is updated every 10 years. The most recent climate period is 1991–2020. The difference between each successive 30-year climate period serves as a very literal record of climate change.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040166#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040166&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A mysterious family of Android malware with a demonstrated history of effectively concealing its myriad spying activities has once again been found in Google Play after more than two years of hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>The apps, disguised as file-sharing, astronomy, and cryptocurrency apps, hosted Mandrake, a family of highly intrusive malware that security firm Bitdefender <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/329/Bitdefender-PR-Whitepaper-Mandrake-creat4464-en-EN-interactive.pdf">called out</a> in 2020. Bitdefender said the apps appeared in two waves, one in 2016 through 2017 and again in 2018 through 2020. Mandrake’s ability to go unnoticed then was the result of some unusually rigorous steps to fly under the radar. They included:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Not working in 90 countries, including those comprising the former Soviet Union</li>
<li aria-level="1">Delivering its final payload only to victims who were extremely narrowly targeted</li>
<li aria-level="1">Containing a kill switch the developers named seppuku (Japanese form of ritual suicide) that fully wiped all traces of the malware</li>
<li aria-level="1">Fully functional decoy apps in categories including finance, Auto &amp; Vehicles, Video Players &amp; Editors, Art &amp; Design, and Productivity</li>
<li aria-level="1">Quick fixes for bugs reported in comments</li>
<li aria-level="1">TLS <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning">certificate pinning</a> to conceal communications with command and control servers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lurking in the shadows</h2>
<p>Bitdefender estimated the number of victims in the tens of thousands for the 2018 to 2020 wave and “probably hundreds of thousands throughout the full 4-year period.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040171#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040171&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>United Launch Alliance delivered a classified US military payload to orbit Tuesday for the last time with an Atlas V rocket, ending the Pentagon's use of Russian rocket engines as national security missions transition to all-American launchers.</p>
<p>The Atlas V rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 6:45 am EDT (10:45 UTC) Tuesday, propelled by a Russian-made RD-180 engine and five strap-on solid-fueled boosters in its most powerful configuration. This was the 101st launch of an Atlas V rocket since its debut in 2002, and the 58th and final Atlas V mission with a US national security payload since 2007.</p>
<p>The US Space Force's Space Systems Command confirmed a successful conclusion to the mission, code-named USSF-51, on Tuesday afternoon. The rocket's Centaur upper stage released the top secret USSF-51 payload about seven hours after liftoff, likely in a high-altitude geostationary orbit over the equator. The military did not publicize the exact specifications of the rocket's target orbit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039968#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039968&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has some minor updates for all its operating systems, and the releases include iOS 17.6, iPadOS 17.6, tvOS 17.6, watchOS 10.6, and macOS Sonoma 14.6.</p>
<p>Apple's notes for these updates simply say they include bug fixes, security updates, or optimizations. However, there are a few hidden features.</p>
<p>macOS 14.6 reportedly enables multi-display support in clamshell mode on the M3 MacBook Pro, allowing users of that device to use two external displays at once. That was already possible on the M3 Pro and M3 Max variations. Apple had previously released a similar update to bring that functionality to the M3 MacBook Air.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040130#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040130&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, AI-powered search engine Perplexity <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-the-perplexity-publishers-program">unveiled</a> a new revenue-sharing program for publishers, marking a significant shift in its approach to third-party content use, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/perplexity-ai-to-share-revenue-with-publishers-after-plagiarism-accusations.html">reports</a> CNBC. The move comes after plagiarism allegations from major media outlets, including <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/06/07/buzzy-ai-search-engine-perplexity-is-directly-ripping-off-content-from-news-outlets/">Forbes</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-plagiarized-our-story-about-how-perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/">Wired</a>, and Ars parent company <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/cond-nast-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-ai-search-engine-perplexity">Condé Nast</a>. Perplexity, valued at over $1 billion, aims to compete with search giant Google.</p>

<p>"To further support the vital work of media organizations and online creators, we need to ensure publishers can thrive as Perplexity grows," writes the company in a <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-the-perplexity-publishers-program">blog post</a> announcing the problem. "That’s why we’re excited to announce the Perplexity Publishers Program and our first batch of partners: TIME, Der Spiegel, Fortune, Entrepreneur, The Texas Tribune, and WordPress.com."</p>
<p>Under the program, Perplexity will share a percentage of ad revenue with publishers when their content is cited in AI-generated answers. The revenue share applies on a per-article basis and potentially multiplies if articles from a single publisher are used in one response. Some content providers, such as WordPress.com, plan to pass some of that revenue on to content creators.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039978#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039978&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) easily passed the Senate today despite critics' concerns that the bill may <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/the-kids-online-safety-act-isnt-all-right-critics-say/#:~:text=Debate%20continues%20to%20rage%20over,Haugen's%20shocking%20revelations%20to%20Congress.">risk creating more harm than good for kids</a> and perhaps censor speech for online users of all ages if it's signed into law.</p>
<p>KOSA received broad bipartisan support in the Senate, passing with a 91–3 vote alongside the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Action (COPPA) 2.0. Both laws seek to control how much data can be collected from minors, as well as regulate the platform features that could harm children's mental health.</p>
<p>Only Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah) opposed the bills.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040074#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040074&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've watched any Olympics coverage this week, you've likely been confronted with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgtHJKn0Mck">an ad for Google's Gemini AI called "Dear Sydney."</a> In it, a proud father seeks help writing a letter on behalf of his daughter, who is an aspiring runner and superfan of world-record-holding hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty good with words, but this has to be just right," the father intones before asking Gemini to "Help my daughter write a letter telling Sydney how inspiring she is..." Gemini dutifully responds with a draft letter in which the LLM tells the runner, on behalf of the daughter, that she wants to be "just like you."</p>
<p>Every time I see this ad, it puts me on edge in a way I've had trouble putting into words (though <a href="https://gemini.google.com/share/815f28b9c364">Gemini itself has some helpful thoughts</a>). As someone who writes words for a living, the idea of outsourcing a writing task to a machine brings up <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/google-demos-unsettling-tool-to-help-journalists-write-the-news/">some vocational anxiety</a>. And the idea of someone who's "pretty good with words" doubting his abilities when the writing "has to be just right" sets off alarm bells regarding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/07/superhuman-go-ais-still-have-trouble-defending-against-these-simple-exploits/">the superhuman framing of AI capabilities</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040001#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040001&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Charter Communications agreed to pay a $15 million fine after admitting that it failed to notify more than a thousand 911 call centers about an outage caused by a denial-of-service attack and separately failed to meet the Federal Communications Commission's reporting deadlines for hundreds of planned maintenance outages.</p>
<p>"As part of the settlement, Charter admits to violating the agency's rules regarding notifications to public safety officials and the Commission in connection with three unplanned network outages and hundreds of planned, maintenance-related network outages that occurred last year," the FCC said in an <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404306A1.pdf">announcement</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-708A1.pdf">consent decree</a> said Charter admits that it "failed to timely notify more than 1,000 PSAPs [Public Safety Answering Points] of an outage on February 19, 2023." The decree notes that failure to notify the PSAPs, or 911 call centers, "impedes the ability of public safety officials to mediate the effects of an outage by notifying the public of alternate ways to contact emergency services."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040032#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040032&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon failed to adequately alert more than 300,000 customers to serious risks—including death and electrocution—that US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) testing found with more than 400,000 products that third parties sold on its platform.</p>
<p>The CPSC unanimously voted to hold Amazon legally responsible for third-party sellers' defective products. Now, Amazon must make a CPSC-approved plan to properly recall the dangerous products—including highly flammable children's pajamas, faulty carbon monoxide detectors, and unsafe hair dryers that could cause electrocution—which the CPSC fears may still be widely used in homes across America.</p>
<p>While Amazon scrambles to devise a plan, the CPSC summarized the ongoing risks to consumers:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040006#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040006&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber recently discussed the possibility of one day selling a mouse that customers can use "forever." The executive said such a mouse isn't "necessarily super far away" and will rely on software updates, likely delivered through a subscription model.</p>
<p>Speaking on a July 29 episode of The Verge's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview">Decoder</a> podcast, Faber, who Logitech appointed as CEO in October, said that members of a "Logitech innovation center" showed her "a forever mouse" and compared it to a nice but not "super expensive" watch. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>... I’m not planning to throw that watch away ever. So why would I be throwing my mouse or my keyboard away if it’s a fantastic-quality, well-designed, software-enabled mouse? The forever mouse is one of the things that we’d like to get to.</p></blockquote>
<p>The concept mouse that Faber examined was "a little heavier" than the typical mouse. But what drives its longevity potential for Logitech is the idea of constantly updated software and services.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039972#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039972&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The electric car manufacturer Tesla had to issue a massive recall this month to fix faulty hood latches that can open while its cars are driving. The problem affects more than 1.8 million cars, which means it's slightly smaller than the recall in December that applied to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/more-than-2-million-teslas-are-being-recalled-due-to-unsafe-autopilot/">more than 2 million Teslas</a>.</p>
<p>The problem, according to the official National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V554-1225.PDF">Part 573 safety recall report</a>, affects model year 2021–2024 Model 3s (built between September 21, 2020, and June 2, 2024), model year 2021–2024 Model Ss (built between January 26, 2021, and July 15, 2024), model year 2021–2024 Model Xs (built between August 18, 2021, and July 15, 2024), and model year 2020–2024 Model Ys (built between January 9, 2020, and July 15, 2024).</p>
<p>The problem first became apparent to Tesla in March of this year after complaints about unintended hood opening from Chinese customers. By April, it had identified the problem as deformation of the hood latch switch, "which could prevent the customer from being notified about an open hood state."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039948#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039948&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are no wild ligers. Indeed, hybrids were once thought to be rare in nature—and of little consequence in an evolutionary sense. But now we know they can play an important role in speciation—the creation of new, genetically distinct populations.</p>
<p>As it turns out, hybridization in nature is quite common. Some 25 percent of plant species hybridize and some 10 percent of animals do the same.</p>
<p>“Hybridization as an event is rare,” said Jeremie Fant, a conservation scientist with the Chicago Botanic Garden who has worked on plant hybridization. “But in evolutionary history, it's been very common. Hybrids in the plant kingdom are everywhere. They are scattered through most lineages. When hybridization does occur, it can have important evolutionary impacts.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036554#p3">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036554&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Among the many highlights of last weekend's San Diego Comic-Con was the official full trailer for the second season of <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.</em> Sauron has returned and is plotting his takeover of Middle-earth. Will donning the titular rings make the wearers his adversaries—or his collaborators?</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/05/saurons-dark-rise-is-front-and-center-in-the-rings-of-power-s2-teaser/">previously reported</a>, Prime Video made a major investment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power"><em>The Rings of Power</em></a> when it acquired the rights to the source material from the Tolkien estate, even committing to multiple seasons upfront. Pretty much everyone guessed long before the S1 finale's reveal that Halbrand (Charlie Vickers), king of the Southlands, was Sauron in disguise. Fans even dubbed him "Hot Sauron." He took advantage of the fact that the elvish light of Valar was fading, putting the race of elves in danger of extinction unless they returned to Valinor to preserve their immortality. The discovery of the precious ore mithril gave the elves another option championed by Elrond (Robert Aramayo), Galadriel (Morfydd Clark), and the elven smith Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039912#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039912&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The merging of Warner Bros. and Discovery effectively put an end to one DC Extended Universe era while placing the fate of several planned projects in limbo. Chief among those was <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/03/the-batman-2-release-date-2026-1235856229/">a sequel</a> to 2022's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Batman_(film)"><em>The Batman</em></a> and an associated spinoff series, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Penguin_(TV_series)">The Penguin</a>.</em> Both projects have survived the merger, and DC Studio unveiled the first full trailer for <em>The Penguin—</em>starring Colin Farrell reprising his <em>The Batman</em> role of Oswald Cobblepot—during its panel at San Diego Comic-Con last weekend.</p>
<p>The panel also included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc83MIHaI-k">a first look</a> and <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/batman-caped-crusader-penguin-minnie-driver-sdcc-2024/">a screening</a> of the first episode of Prime Video's new animated series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14681596/"><em>Batman: Caped Crusader</em></a>, with Minnie Driver voicing a gender-swapped version of the Penguin named Oswalda Cobblepot. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdzSiO-7LyM">official trailer</a> dropped last month.</p>

<p>Dark mode, night mode, light-on-dark design, or whatever you want to call the version of computer content that doesn't feel blindingly bright at night, had something of a peak moment around 2019–2020. That's when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/android-11-preview-hands-on-notification-changes-dark-mode-options-and-more/">Android</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/ios-13-apple-brings-dark-mode-to-iphones-and-multitasking-overhaul-to-ipads/">iOS</a> designed a system-wide way to implement a darker theme, and signal to compatible apps to do the same. Many, many systems, apps, websites, and other digital tools soon followed.</p>
<p>Except, most notably, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Despite being one of the sites most sympathetic to late-night mind wandering, Wikipedia had no official way to switch its iconic white pages into something more sleep and eyeball-friendly. Now, after great effort from its community, a dark mode (technically a dark "Color" setting) is available to most Wikipedia visitors on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>On desktop, look for a sidebar on the right-hand side that has buttons for setting text size and width, and then "Color (beta)." If you don't see a sidebar, look for an eyeglasses-like icon in the upper-right corner near the search and account tools. On mobile, look for the three horizontal bars (aka hamburger button) in the upper-left corner of a page, choose Settings, then pick your Color. There is the standard Light you know, Dark, and Automatic, which takes its color cues from your system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039811#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039811&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft is urging users of VMware’s ESXi hypervisor to take immediate action to ward off ongoing attacks by ransomware groups that give them full administrative control of the servers the product runs on.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-37085, allows attackers who have already gained limited system rights on a targeted server to gain full administrative control of the ESXi hypervisor. Attackers affiliated with multiple ransomware syndicates—including Storm-0506, Storm-1175, Octo Tempest, and Manatee Tempest—have been exploiting the flaw for months in numerous post-compromise attacks, meaning after the limited access has already been gained through other means.</p>

<h2>Admin rights assigned by default</h2>
<p>Full administrative control of the hypervisor gives attackers various capabilities, including encrypting the file system and taking down the servers they host. The hypervisor control can also allow attackers to access hosted virtual machines to either exfiltrate data or expand their foothold inside a network. Microsoft discovered the vulnerability under exploit in the normal course of investigating the attacks and reported it to VMware. VMware parent company Broadcom <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24505">patched</a> the vulnerability on Thursday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039863#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039863&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0jTyLSP-sTM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">"Lower decks! Lower decks!" The fifth season of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> will be the animated series' last (boo!). </p></div>
<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> is a particular favorite among Ars staffers; it's arguably the best of the recent crop of Star Trek shows, along with <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>. So we were disappointed when we learned that the animated series would be ending with its fifth season. Paramount+ debuted the first teaser for S5 during the Star Trek panel at San Diego Comic-Con over the weekend, along with a teaser for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Section_31"><em>Star Trek: Section 31</em></a>—a spinoff film from <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> featuring Michelle Yeoh's Philippa Georgiou—a clip from <em>Strange New Worlds</em> S3, and the latest news about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_television_series#Starfleet_Academy"><em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Lower Decks</em> teaser opens with a suitably nostalgic recap of some of the highlights of the adventures of the plucky crew of the USS <em>Cerritos,</em> inviting viewers to join them for one last adventure. Cue Boimler (Jack Quaid) and Mariner (Tawny Newsome) in voiceover objecting to that description ("Yeah, right, we're not done voyaging—we've hardly even cracked one quadrant yet"). Their S5 mission involves a "quantum fissure" that is causing "space potholes" to pop up all over the Alpha Quadrant ("boo interdimensional portals!"), and the <em>Cerritos</em> crew must close them—while navigating angry Klingons, an Orion war, and who knows what other crazy developments?</p>
<p>The final season of <em>Lower Decks</em> premieres on Paramount+ on October 24, 2024, and will run through December 19.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039676#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039676&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
