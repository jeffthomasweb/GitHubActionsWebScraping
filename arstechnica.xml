<p>What comes after OLED?</p>
<p>With OLED-equipped TVs, monitors, and other gadgets slowly becoming more readily available at lower prices, attention is turning to what the next landmark consumer display tech will be.</p>
<p>Micro LED often features in such discussions, but the tech is not expected to start hitting consumer devices <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/MicroLED-smartphones-will-not-arrive-until-the-2030s-notebooks-and-monitors-a-little-earlier.785333.0.html">until the 2030s</a>. Display makers are also playing with other futuristic ideas, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/who-would-want-this-the-4-most-outlandish-displays-at-ces-2024/">transparent</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/portable-monitors-could-make-foldable-screen-gadgets-finally-make-sense/">foldable</a> screens. But when it comes to technology that could seriously address top user concerns—like image quality<strong>, </strong>price<strong>,</strong> and longevity—quantum dots seem the most pertinent at the moment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000924#p3">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000924&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In June 1924, a British mountaineer named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory">George Leigh Mallory</a> and a young engineering student named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Irvine_(mountaineer)">Andrew "Sandy" Irvine</a> set off for the summit of Mount Everest and disappeared—just two casualties of a peak that has claimed over 300 lives to date. Mallory was an alumnus of Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge, which maintains a collection of his personal correspondence, much of it between Mallory and his wife, Ruth. The college has now digitized the entire collection for public access. The letters can be accessed and downloaded <a href="https://magdalene.maxarchiveservices.co.uk/index.php/mallory-george-herbert-leigh">here</a>.</p>
<p>“It has been a real pleasure to work with these letters," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1041766?">said Magdalene College archivist Katy Green</a>. "Whether it’s George’s wife Ruth writing about how she was posting him plum cakes and a grapefruit to the trenches (he said the grapefruit wasn’t ripe enough), or whether it’s his poignant last letter where he says the chances of scaling Everest are '50 to 1 against us,' they offer a fascinating insight into the life of this famous Magdalene alumnus.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/natgeo-expedition-hunts-for-1924-climbers-body-in-lost-on-everest-documentary/">previously reported</a>, Mallory is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1923/03/18/archives/climbing-mount-everest-is-work-for-supermen-a-member-of-former.html">the man credited</a> with uttering the famous line "because it's there" in response to a question about why he would risk his life repeatedly to summit Everest. An avid mountaineer, Mallory had already been to the mountain twice before the 1924 expedition: once in 1921 as part of a reconnaissance expedition to produce the first accurate maps of the region and again in 1922—his first serious attempt to summit, although he was forced to turn back on all three attempts. A sudden avalanche killed seven Sherpas on his third try, sparking accusations of poor judgement on Mallory's part.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018634#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018634&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>With Earth Day fast approaching once again, it's time for another new documentary from National Geographic and Disney+:  <em>Secrets of the Octopus</em>. It's the third in what has become a series, starting with the remarkable 2021 documentary <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/secrets-of-the-whales-explores-language-social-structure-of-giants-of-the-deep/"><em>Secrets of the Whales</em></a> (narrated by Sigourney Weaver) and 2023's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/elephants-must-adapt-to-a-rapidly-changing-world-in-secrets-of-the-elephants/"><em>Secrets of the Elephants</em></a> (Natalie Portman as narrator). James Cameron served as producer on all three.</p>
<p><em>Secrets of the Octopus</em> is narrated by Paul Rudd. Per the official synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Octopuses are like aliens on Earth: three hearts, blue blood and the ability to squeeze through a space the size of their eyeballs. But there is so much more to these weird and wonderful animals. Intelligent enough to use tools or transform their bodies to mimic other animals and even communicate with different species, the secrets of the octopus are more extraordinary than we ever imagined.</p></blockquote>
<p>Each of the three episodes focuses on a specific unique feature of these fascinating creatures: "Shapeshifters," "Masterminds," and "Social Networks." The animals were filmed in their natural habitats over 200 days and all that stunning footage is accompanied by thoughtful commentary by featured scientists.  One of those scientists is <a href="https://www.alex-schnell.com">Dr. Alex Schnell</a>,  a native Australian and self described storytelling who has worked at Macquarie University, the University of Cambridge, and the Marine Biological Laboratory, among other institutions. Her research focuses on the intelligence of marine animals, particularly cuttlefish and octopuses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017625#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017625&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Fungi are an indispensable part of your <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/microbiome/">microbiome</a>, keeping the body’s host of microorganisms healthy as part of a system of checks and balances. But when you’re hit by an <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/infectious-disease/">infection</a>, fungi can be thrown out of equilibrium with other organisms inside you, leading to a more severe infection and other symptoms of illness.</p>
<p>For this reason, the pandemic immediately set off alarms for Iliyan Iliev, an immunologist at Weill Cornell Medical School. “We were thinking, the first thing that’s going to happen is people will start getting fungal co-infections,” he says. With the microbiome unbalanced, fungi might start running riot inside <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/covid-19/">Covid</a>patients, Iliev reasoned. His fears were soon realized.</p>
<p>In research published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01637-4"><i>Nature Immunology</i></a>, he and his team discovered that in patients with severe Covid, certain strains of gut fungi—knocked off-kilter by the virus—set off a prolonged immune response that could last long after the initial infection. This response potentially led to some of the respiratory symptoms experienced by these patients. These results, Iliev says, point to the critical role of the gut microbiome in the human immune response and could lead to better disease treatments down the line.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018856#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018856&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been just over a week since the Fallout TV series premiered on Amazon Prime, and one thing's for sure: It's a huge hit. You can hardly open a social media app without seeing content about it, the reviews are positive, and the active players for the Fallout games have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">doubled over the past week</a>.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I shared some spoiler-free impressions of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/three-episodes-in-the-fallout-tv-series-absolutely-nails-it/">the first three episodes</a>. I loved what I'd seen up to that point—the show seemed faithful to the games, but it was also a great TV show. A specific cocktail of tongue-in-cheek humor, sci-fi campiness, strong themes, great characters, and visceral violence really came together into a fantastic show.</p>
<p>Still, I had some questions at that point: Would the franchise's penchant for satire and its distinct political and social viewpoint come through? Where was all this headed?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018371#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018371&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Across the country, teams of students at 15 different universities are in the middle of a four-year project, dissecting an electric vehicle and figuring out ways to make it even better. The program, called the EcoCar EV Challenge, was founded more than three decades ago by the US Department of Energy and is run by the DOE's Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Over the last 35 years, more than 30,000 students from 95 universities have participated in the EcoCar Challenge, part of the DOE's Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition. Each segment spans four years, with the most recent cycle beginning in 2023 with a new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/">Cadillac Lyriq</a> donated by the General Motors automaker.</p>
<p>The students take this competition very seriously, as participation alone brings a lot of benefits, including the potential for a lifelong career path.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013389#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013389&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>About seven years ago, Aaron Silverbook and his then-girlfriend, a biologist, were perusing old scientific literature online. “A romantic evening,” joked Silverbook. That night, he came across a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC97174/">study</a> from 2000 that surprised him. Scientists had genetically engineered an oral bacterium that they said could possibly prevent tooth decay: “I read it and sort of boggled at it and said, ‘Wow, this is a cavity vaccine. Why don't we have this?’”</p>
<p>So, Silverbook tracked down the primary author, Jeffrey Hillman, a now-retired oral biologist formerly at the University of Florida, to see if he could pick up the torch.</p>
<p>In 2023, Silverbook founded Lantern Bioworks, which made a deal with Oragenics, the company Hillman co-founded and that owned the technology, for the materials. Lantern Bioworks then launched the genetically engineered bacteria under the name Lumina Probiotic. “I didn’t expect it to happen in my lifetime,” said Hillman.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018793#p3">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018793&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intermittent fasting, aka time-restricted eating, can help people lose weight—but the reason why may not be complicated hypotheses about changes from fasting metabolism or diurnal circadian rhythms. It may just be because restricting eating time means people eat fewer calories overall.</p>
<p>In a randomized-controlled trial, people who followed a time-restricted diet lost about the same amount of weight as people who ate the same diet without the time restriction, according to <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M23-3132">a study published Friday in Annals of Internal Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The finding offers a possible answer to a long-standing question for time-restricted eating (TRE) research, which has been consumed by small feeding studies of 15 people or fewer, with mixed results and imperfect designs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018837#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018837&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On March 29, 2022, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/rip-cnn-march-2022-april-2022/">CNN+</a>, CNN's take on a video streaming service, debuted. On <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2022/04/cnn-plus-shutting-down">April 28, 2022</a>, it shuttered, making it the fastest shutdown of any launched streaming service. Despite that discouraging superlative, CNN has plans for another subscription-based video streaming platform, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d6e8f7d5-2ef1-4b53-9a96-2f5920df3ba9">Financial Times</a> (FT) reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mark Thompson, who took CNN's helm in August 2023, over a year after CNN+'s demise, spoke with FT about evolving the company. The publication reported that Thompson is "working on plans for a digital subscription streaming service." The executive told the publication that a digital subscription, including digital content streaming, is "a serious possibility," adding, "no decisions had been made, but I think it’s quite likely that we’ll end up there."</p>
<p>CNN++, or whatever a new CNN streaming package might be named, would not just be another CNN+, per Thompson.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018728#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018728&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first-ever model of Star Trek's<em> USS Enterprise NCC-1701</em> has been returned to the Roddenberry family, according to an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/long-lost-uss-enterprise-model-returned-star-trek-109386944?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2fUsb8n33X5AE2pXxqmR1KrgNLwdpF8txWq8lMvtlEjVkcLqPbSaojNL4_aem_AdnrLvI49wv5ubUSx_g-D0qkhneh3dE3rOoPCqdrU0rC-mui7MewaEkTA1Dh_tiWFLp5RJJqOtwhVb22UqMzATaY">ABC News</a> report.</p>
<p>The three-foot model was used to shoot the pilot and credits scene for Star Trek's original series in the 1960s and was used occasionally for shots throughout the series. (Typically, a larger, 11-foot model was used for shots after the pilot.) The model also sat on series creator Gene Roddenberry's desk for several years.</p>
<p>It went missing in the late 1970s; historians and collectors believe it belonged to Roddenberry himself, that he lent it to a production house working on Star Trek: The Motion Picture<em>,</em> and that it was never returned. Its whereabouts were unknown until last fall, when a listing for a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/11/after-decades-lost-star-treks-original-enterprise-model-may-have-been-found/">mysterious model of the <em>Enterprise</em> appeared on eBay</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018712#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018712&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Perhaps the first clue that something was not quite right about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427740/Cities_Skylines_II__Beach_Properties/"><em>Beach Properties</em></a>, the first $10 DLC "expansion" for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/4/">the already off-kilter city-building sim </a><em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/4/">Cities: Skylines 2</a>, </em>was that it did not contain a real beach house, which one might consider a key beach property. The oversight seemed indicative of a content pack that lacked for content.</p>
<p><em>C:S2</em>'s developers and publisher now agree and have published <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-way-forward-an-update-from-the-team-behind-cities-skylines.1665858/">a letter to <em>Cities</em> fans</a>, in which they offer apologies, updates, and refunds. <em>Beach Properties </em>is now a free add-on, individual buyers will be refunded (with details at <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/faq-the-way-forward.1663862/">a FAQ page</a>), and Ultimate Edition owners will receive additional Creator Packs and Radio Stations, since partial refunds are tricky across different game stores.</p>
<p>"We thought we could make up for the shortcomings of the game in a timeframe that was unrealistic, and rushed out a DLC that should not have been published in its current form. For all this, we are truly sorry," reads the letter, signed by the CEOs of developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive. "When we’ve made statements like this one before, it’s included a pledge to keep making improvements, and while we are working on these updates, they haven’t happened at a speed or magnitude that is acceptable, and it pains us that we've now lost the trust of many of you. We want to do better."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018726#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018726&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An executive producer of the Netflix hit <em>What Jennifer Did</em> has responded to accusations that the true crime documentary used AI images when depicting Jennifer Pan, a woman currently imprisoned in Canada for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2024/04/11/the-chilling-true-story-behind-netflixs-what-jennifer-did-your-questions-answered">orchestrating a murder-for-hire scheme targeting her parents</a>.</p>
<p><em>What Jennifer Did</em> shot to the top spot in Netflix's global top 10 when it debuted in early April, attracting swarms of true crime fans who wanted to know more about why Pan paid hitmen $10,000 to murder her parents. But quickly the documentary became a source of controversy, as fans started noticing glaring flaws in images used in the movie, from weirdly mismatched earrings to her nose appearing to lack nostrils, the Daily Mail <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13328073/Netflix-Jennifer-Did-AI-images-killer-Jennifer-Pan.html">reported</a>, in a post showing a plethora of examples of images from the film.</p>
<p>Futurism was among the first to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/netflix-what-jennifer-did-true-crime-ai-photos">point out</a> that these flawed images (around the 28-minute mark of the documentary) "have all the hallmarks of an AI-generated photo, down to mangled hands and fingers, misshapen facial features, morphed objects in the background, and a far-too-long front tooth." The image with the long front tooth was even used in Netflix's poster for the movie.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018753#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018753&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

The latest phone has a new name: "<a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/pura70-ultra/">Huawei Pura 70</a>." While you wouldn't ever want to deal with the cobbled-together SoC or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/">whatever is going on</a> with Huawei's software, the "Ultra" model does have a cool party trick up its sleeve: a pop-out main camera lens.</p>
<p>In the years before the smartphone took over all entry-level photography, there used to be a thing called a "point-and-shoot camera." This was a purpose-built device that only took photos, couldn't go on the Internet, and wouldn't let you watch the latest TikTok videos. The trademark feature of these devices was a retractable camera lens, where the front lens (there was only one!) would grow out of the front of the camera when you turned it on. This would give your camera better, longer lens geometry to work with when the camera was on, and would collapse down for easier storage when it was off.</p>
<p>Huawei's latest phone is replicating that. The giant rear camera lens actually grows out of the phone somewhat, thanks to some complicated gearing inside the phone. It's only the tiniest few millimeters, but it's a start. Smartphone manufacturers often resist adding bigger lenses to their devices because they want to still have pocketable devices. A pop-up lens would give the camera engineers more room to work with while still maintaining pocketability.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018419#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018419&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ever since the Voyager mission sent home images of Jupiter's moon Io spewing material into space, we've gradually built up a clearer picture of Io's volcanic activity. It slowly became clear that Io, which is a bit smaller than Mercury, is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, with all that activity driven by the gravitational strain caused by Jupiter and its three other giant moons. There is so much volcanism that its surface has been completely remodeled, with no signs of impact craters.</p>
<p>A few more details about its violence came to light this week, with new images being released of the moon's features, including an island in a lake of lava, taken by the Juno orbiter. At the same time, imaging done using an Earth-based telescope has provided some indications that this volcanism has been reshaping Io from almost the moment it formed.</p>
<h2>Fiery, glassy lakes</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/">Juno orbiter's</a> mission is primarily focused on studying Jupiter, including the dynamics of its storms and its internal composition. But many of its orbital passes have taken it right past Io, and this week, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory released <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-gives-aerial-views-of-mountain-lava-lake-on-io">some of the best images</a> from these flybys. They include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg2Szj_OG_Q">a shot of Loki Patera</a>, a lake of lava that has an island within it. Also featured: the impossibly sheer slopes of Io's Steeple Mountain.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018730#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018730&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The miniaturization of retro tech has always been a major obsession for modders, from the person who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/hobbyist-grinds-down-original-chips-by-hand-to-make-a-game-boy-sized-nes/">fit an original NES</a> into a Game Boy-sized portable to the person who made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/honey-i-shrunk-the-mac-enthusiast-makes-the-mac-mini-more-mini/">a mini-er version of Apple's Mac mini</a>.</p>

<p>One mod in this storied genre that caught our eye this week is the "Short Stack," a scale model of the Nintendo Wii that packs the 2006 console's internal hardware into a 3D-printed enclosure roughly the size of a deck of playing cards.</p>
<p>"You could fit 13.5 of these inside an original Wii," writes James Smith (aka loopj), the person behind the project. All the design details, custom boards, and other information about recreating the mod <a href="https://github.com/loopj/short-stack?tab=readme-ov-file">are available on GitHub</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018682#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018682&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Everyone with a Roku TV or streaming device will eventually be forced to enable two-factor authentication after the company disclosed two separate incidents in which roughly 600,000 customers had their accounts accessed through credential stuffing.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing">Credential stuffing</a> is an attack in which usernames and passwords exposed in one leak are tried out against other accounts, typically using automated scripts. When people reuse usernames and passwords across services or make small, easily intuited changes between them, actors can gain access to accounts with even more identifying information and access.</p>
<p>In the case of the Roku attacks, that meant access to stored payment methods, which could then be used to buy streaming subscriptions and Roku hardware. <a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/protecting-your-roku-account">Roku wrote on its blog</a>, and in <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Template%20Notification%203-8-2024.pdf">a mandated data breach report</a>, that purchases occurred in "less than 400 cases" and that full credit card numbers and other "sensitive information" was not revealed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018661#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018661&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple said it complied with orders from the Chinese government to remove the Meta-owned WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China. Apple also removed Telegram and Signal from China.</p>
<p>"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree," Apple said in a statement quoted by several news outlets. "The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns.

<p>An AI test pilot has successfully flown a jet fighter in dogfights against human opponents. It's the latest development for DARPA's Air Combat Evaluation program, which is trying to develop aerospace AI agents <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/air-combat-evolution">that can be trusted</a> to perform safely.</p>
<p>Human test pilots have a bit of a reputation thanks to popular culture—from <em>The Right Stuff</em> to <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, the profession has been portrayed as a place for loose cannons with a desire to go fast and break the rules. The reality is pretty far from that these days, especially where DARPA is concerned.</p>
<p>The agency instead wants a machine-learning agent that can safely fly a real aircraft autonomously, with no violations of training rules. After all, neural networks have their own reputation—at this point well-earned—for finding ways to exploit situations <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/sony-trains-superhuman-ai-to-race-in-gran-turismo/">that hadn't occurred to humans.</a> And the consequences when controlling a real jet fighter can be a lot more severe than just testing <em>in silico</em>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018649#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018649&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
