<p>Photos of Brazilian kids—sometimes spanning their entire childhood—have been used without their consent to power AI tools, including popular image generators like Stable Diffusion, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/06/10/brazil-childrens-personal-photos-misused-power-ai-tools">warned on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>This act poses urgent privacy risks to kids and seems to increase risks of non-consensual AI-generated images bearing their likenesses, HRW's report said.</p>
<p>An HRW researcher, Hye Jung Han, helped expose the problem. She analyzed "less than 0.0001 percent" of LAION-5B, a dataset built from Common Crawl snapshots of the public web. The dataset does not contain the actual photos but includes image-text pairs derived from 5.85 billion images and captions posted online since 2008.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030521#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030521&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As many as 165 customers of cloud storage provider Snowflake have been compromised by a group that obtained login credentials through information-stealing malware, researchers said Monday.</p>
<p>On Friday, Lending Tree subsidiary QuoteWizard confirmed it was among the customers notified by Snowflake that it was affected in the incident. Lending Tree spokesperson Megan Greuling said the company is in the process of determining whether data stored on Snowflake has been stolen.</p>
<p>“That investigation is ongoing,” she wrote in an email. “As of this time, it does not appear that consumer financial account information was impacted, nor information of the parent entity, Lending Tree.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030619#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030619&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>German archaeologists discovered that the skulls of three medieval Viking women found on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea showed evidence of an unusual procedure to elongate their skulls. The process gave them an unusual and distinctive appearance, according to <a href="https://publicera.kb.se/csa/article/view/10726">a paper</a> published in the journal Current Swedish Archaeology. Along with evidence that the Viking men from the island may have deliberately filed their teeth, the discovery sheds light on the role body modification may have played in Viking culture</p>
<p>When people hear about Viking body modification, they probably think of Viking tattoos, particularly since the History Channel series <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/gruesome-viking-blood-eagle-ritual-is-anatomically-possible-study-finds/">Vikings</a></em> popularized that notion. But whether actual Vikings <a href="https://www.medievalists.net/2018/05/tattooed-vikings-a-look-at-medieval-body-art/">sported tattoos</a> is a matter of considerable debate. There is no mention of tattoos in the few Norse sagas and poetry that have survived, although other unusual physical characteristics are often mentioned, such as scars.</p>
<p>The only real evidence comes from a 10th century travel account by an Arab traveler and trader named Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, whose travel account, <em>Mission to the Volga</em>, describes the Swedish Viking traders ("Rusiyyah") he met in the Middle Volga region of Russia. "They are dark from the tips of their toes right up to their necks—trees, pictures, and the like," Ibn Fadlan wrote. But the precise Arabic translation is unclear, and there is no hard archaeological evidence, since human skin typically doesn't preserve for centuries after a Viking burial.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014895#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014895&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google has killed off the Google Pay app. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/09/gpay-us/">9to5Google</a> reports Google's old payments app stopped working recently, following shutdown plans that <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/payment-apps-update/">were announced</a> in February. Google is shutting down the Google Pay app in the US, while in-store NFC payments seem to still be branded "Google Pay." Remember, this is Google's dysfunctional payments division, so all that's happening is Google Payment app No. 3 (Google Pay) is being shut down in favor of Google Payment app No. 4 (Google Wallet). The shutdown caps off the implosion of Google's payments division after a lot of poor decisions and failed product launches.</p>
<p>Google's NFC payment journey started <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/09/google-wallet-now-available-for-a-select-group-of-users/">in 2011</a> with Google Wallet (apps No. 1 and No. 4 are both called Google Wallet). In 2011, Google was a technology trailblazer and basically popularized the idea of paying for something with your phone in many regions (with the notable exception <a href="https://en.komoju.com/blog/payment-method/japan-payments/">of Japan</a>). Google shipped the first non-Japanese phones with the feature, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/12/verizon-delays-approval-of-google-wallet-blesses-own-isis-payment-app/">fought carriers</a> trying to stop phone payments from happening, and begged stores to get new, compatible terminals. Google's entire project was blown away when Apple Pay launched in 2014, and Google's response was its second payment app, Android Pay, in 2015. This copied much of Apple's setup, like sending payment tokens instead of the actual credit card number. Google Pay was a rebrand of this setup and arrived in 2018.</p>
<p>The 2018 version of Google Pay was a continuation of the Android Pay codebase, which was a continuation of the Google Wallet codebase. Despite all the rebrands, Google's payment apps were an evolution, and none of the previous apps were really "shut down"—they were in-place upgrades. Everything changed in 2021 when a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/the-new-google-pay-repeats-all-the-same-mistakes-of-google-allo/">new version</a> of Google Pay was launched, which is when Google's payment division started to go off the rails.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030018#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030018&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ipados-18-adds-machine-learning-wizardry-with-handwriting-math-features/">iPadOS 18</a> updates are mostly good news for users of older Apple devices—with the exception of 2018's sixth-generation iPad, the new updates will run on all the same hardware that can run iOS 17 and iPadOS 17.</p>
<p>For iPhones, that will cover everything from the iPhone XR/XS and newer, including the second-gen iPhone SE; the seventh-gen iPad and newer; the third-gen iPad Air and newer; the fifth-gen iPad mini and newer; all 11-inch iPad Pros; and the third-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro and later. Here are the full support lists:</p>

        <div class="gallery-item-content">
          <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-10-at-3.05.43%E2%80%AFPM-980x575.jpeg" alt=""></div>

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>It's a bit odd that the seventh-gen iPad makes the cutoff while the sixth-gen model does not, given that both use the same Apple A10 processor. But the seventh-gen iPad has 3GB of RAM instead of 2GB. This is the same amount as the third-gen iPad Air and fifth-gen iPad mini—apparently that extra gigabyte is crucial for running iPadOS 18's new features.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030142#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030142&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>First up is Siri, which can tap into ChatGPT to answer voice questions. If Siri thinks ChatGPT can help answer your question, you'll get a pop-up permission box asking if you want to send your question to the chatbot. The response will come back in a window indicating that the information came from an outside source. This is the same way Siri treats a search engine (namely, Google), so how exactly Siri draws a line between ChatGPT and a search engine will be interesting. In Apple's lone example, there was a "help" intent, with the input saying to "help me plan a five-course meal" given certain ingredient limitations. That sort of ultra-specific input is something you can't do with a traditional search engine.</p>
<p>Siri can also send photos to ChatGPT. In Apple's example, the user snapped a picture of a wooden deck and asked Siri about decorating options. It sounds like the standard generative AI summary features will be here, too, with Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi mentioning that "you can also ask questions about your documents, presentations, or PDFs."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030392#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030392&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, Apple debuted "<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a>," a new suite of free AI-powered features for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia that includes creating email summaries, generating images and emoji, and allowing Siri to take actions on your behalf. These features are achieved through a combination of on-device and cloud processing, with a strong emphasis on privacy. Apple says that Apple Intelligence features will be widely available later this year and will be available as a beta test for developers this summer.</p>

<p>The announcements came during a livestream <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/">WWDC keynote</a> and a simultaneous event attended by the press on Apple's campus in Cupertino, California. In an introduction, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company has been using machine learning for years, but the introduction of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to elevate the capabilities of Apple products. He emphasized the need for both personalization and privacy in Apple's approach.</p>
<p>At last year's WWDC, Apple avoided using the term "AI" completely, instead preferring terms like "machine learning" as Apple's way of avoiding buzzy hype while integrating applications of AI into apps in useful ways. This year, Apple figured out a new way to largely avoid the abbreviation "AI" by coining "Apple Intelligence," a catchall branding term that refers to a broad group of machine learning, LLM, and image generation technologies. By our count, the term "AI" was used sparingly in the keynote—most notably near the end of the presentation when Apple executive Craig Federighi said, "It's AI for the rest of us."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030143#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030143&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With most large language models being run on remote, cloud-based server farms, some users have been reluctant to share personally identifiable and/or private data with AI companies. In its WWDC keynote today, Apple stressed that the new "Apple Intelligence" system it's integrating into its products will use a new "Private Cloud Compute" to ensure any data processed on its cloud servers is protected in a transparent and verifiable way.</p>
<p>"You should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analyzed in someone's AI cloud," Apple Senior VP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said.</p>
<h2>Trust, but verify</h2>
<p>Part of what Apple calls "a brand new standard for privacy and AI" is achieved through on-device processing. Federighi said "many" of Apple's generative AI models can run entirely on a device powered by an A17+ or M-series chips, eliminating the risk of sending your personal data to a remote server.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030487#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030487&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Most owners of aging Intel Macs got a bit of a reprieve today when Apple announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-announces-macos-15-sequoia/">macOS 15 Sequoia</a>—this new macOS release will run on the vast majority of the hardware that can currently run macOS 14 Sonoma. Intel Macs released between December of 2017 and 2020 are mostly eligible for the new update, though newer models with Apple Silicon chips will be needed to support some of the new features.</p>
<p>Apple's full support list for Sequoia is as follows:</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-10-at-2.50.50%E2%80%AFPM.jpeg"><img alt="The support list for macOS 15 Sequoia." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-10-at-2.50.50%E2%80%AFPM-980x609.jpeg"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-10-at-2.50.50%E2%80%AFPM.jpeg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">The support list for macOS 15 Sequoia.</a> (credit: Apple)</p></div>
<p>Generally, all of these Macs include Apple's T2 chip, a co-processor installed in late-model Intel Macs that bridged the gap between the Intel and Apple Silicon eras. There are two exceptions. The biggest is the 2018 MacBook Air, which did come with an Apple T2 but also shipped with a weak dual-core processor and integrated GPU that Apple has apparently decided aren't up to the task of handling Sequoia. The other is the 2019 iMac, which for whatever reason shipped without a T2. Apple says the iPhone mirroring feature does require the T2 chip, so it presumably won't work on the 2019 iMac.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030138#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030138&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>High-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) has been touted as the go-to fuel for powering next-gen nuclear reactors, which include the sodium-cooled <a href="https://www.terrapower.com/">TerraPower</a> or the space-borne system powering Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/demonstration-rocket-for-agile-cislunar-operations">DRACO</a>). That’s because it was supposed to offer higher efficiency while keeping uranium enrichment “well below the threshold needed for weapons-grade material,” <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/beyond-oppenheimer-how-nuclear-weapons-and-nuclear-reactors-are-different">according to</a> the US Department of Energy.</p>
<p>This justified huge government investments in HALEU production in the US and UK, as well as relaxed security requirements for facilities using it as fuel. But now, a team of scientists has published an article in Science that argues that you can make a nuclear bomb using HALEU.</p>
<p>“I looked it up and DRACO space reactor will use around 300 kg of HALEU. This is marginal, but I would say you could make one a weapon with that much,” says Edwin Lyman, the director of Nuclear Power Safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists and co-author of the paper.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030408#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030408&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Internet service providers are again urging the Federal Communications Commission to impose new fees on Big Tech firms and use the money to subsidize broadband network deployment and affordability programs. If approved, the request would force Big Tech firms to pay into the FCC's Universal Service Fund (USF), which in turn distributes money to broadband providers.</p>
<p>The request was made on June 6 by USTelecom, a lobby group for AT&amp;T, Verizon, CenturyLink/Lumen, and smaller telcos. USTelecom has made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/att-verizon-lobby-group-pushes-for-payments-from-big-tech/">similar arguments</a> before, but its latest request to the FCC argues that the recent death of a broadband discount program should spur the FCC to start extracting money from Big Tech.</p>
<p>"Through focusing on the Big Tech companies who benefit most from broadband connectivity, the Commission will fairly allocate the burden of sustaining USF," USTelecom wrote in the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10606146133542/1">FCC filing</a> last week.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030318#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030318&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—After going into detail about iOS 18, Apple took a few moments in its WWDC 2024 keynote to walk through some changes.</p>
<p>There are a few minor UI changes and new features across Apple's first party apps. That includes a new floating tab bar. The bar expands into the side bar when you want to dig in, and you can customize the tab bar to include the specific things you want to interact with the most. Additionally, SharePlay allows easier screen sharing and remote control of another person's iPad.</p>
<p>But the big news is that the Calculator app we've all used on the iPhone to the iPad, after years of the iPad having no first-party calculator app at all. The iPad Calculator app can do some things the iPhone version can't do with the Apple Pencil; a feature called Math Notes can write out expressions like you would on a piece of paper, and the app will solve the expressions live as you scribble them—plus various other cool live-updating math features. (These new Math Notes features work in the Notes app, too.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030308#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030308&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has formally announced macOS 15 at its Worldwide Developers Conference. Codenamed Sequoia, the new release brings a combination of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/">iOS 18 features</a> and a few Mac-specific things to the devices it supports.</p>
<p>Users who split their time between Windows and macOS will be the most excited to see that Apple has finally implemented a form of automated window tiling in macOS. This makes it easier to arrange windows automatically on your screen without manually dragging and resizing each one individually or switching into full-screen mode.</p>
<p>Another feature called iPhone Mirroring sends your iPhone's screen to your Mac, so you can use apps directly on your phone while manipulating them using your Mac's keyboard and trackpad. The iPhone audio is also streamed to your Mac. For privacy's sake, your phone's screen stays locked while apps are streaming to your Mac, and your Mac can also receive your iPhone notifications alongside your Mac notifications (no word on how the operating systems will handle duplicate notifications from Messages, Calendar, or other apps that are getting the same updates on both platforms).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030136#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030136&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The biggest feature in iOS 18, the one that affects the most people, was a single item in a comma-stuffed sentence by Apple software boss Craig Federighi: "Support for RCS."</p>
<p>As we noted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/apple-announces-rcs-support-for-imessage/">when Apple announced its support</a> for "RCS Universal Profile," a kind of minimum viable cross-device rich messaging, iPhone users getting RCS means SMS chains with Android users "will be slightly less awful." SMS messages will soon have read receipts, higher-quality media sending, and typing indicators, along with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rcs-texting-security/">better security</a>. And RCS messages can go over Wi-Fi when you don't have a cellular signal. Apple is certainly downplaying a major cross-platform compatibility upgrade, but it's a notable quality-of-life boost.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—Apple kicked off the keynote for its annual developer conference by announcing a new version of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the company's pricey but impressive Vision Pro mixed reality headset.</p>
<p>The updates in visionOS 2 are modest, not revolutionary—mostly iterative changes, quality-of-life improvements, and some features that were originally expected in the first version of visionOS. That's not too surprising given that visionOS just went out to users four months ago.</p>
<p>Vision Pro users hoping for multiple virtual Mac monitors will be disappointed that's not planned this time around, but Apple plans to add the next-best thing: Users will be able to take advantage of a larger and higher-resolution single virtual display, including a huge, wraparound ultrawide monitor mode that Apple says is equivalent to two 4K monitors.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030181#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030181&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The strain of H5N1 bird flu isolated from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/we-still-dont-understand-how-one-human-apparently-got-bird-flu-from-a-cow/2/">a dairy worker in Texas</a> was 100 percent fatal in ferrets used to model influenza illnesses in humans. However, the virus appeared inefficient at spreading via respiratory droplets, according to newly released <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2023-2024/ferret-study-results.htm#study">study results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>The data confirms that H5N1 infections are significantly different from seasonal influenza viruses that circulate in humans. Those annual viruses make ferrets sick but are not deadly. They have also shown to be highly efficient at spreading via respiratory droplets, with 100 percent transmission rates in laboratory settings. In contrast, the strain from the Texas man (A/Texas/37/2024) appeared to have only a 33 percent transmission rate via respiratory droplets among ferrets.</p>
<p>"This suggests that A/Texas/37/2024-like viruses would need to undergo changes to spread efficiently by droplets through the air, such as from coughs and sneezes," the CDC said in its data summary. The agency went on to note that "efficient respiratory droplet spread, like what is seen with seasonal influenza viruses, is needed for sustained person-to-person spread to happen."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030152#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030152&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A new survey suggests that some US companies implemented return-to-office (RTO) policies in the hopes of getting workers to quit. And despite the belief that such policies could boost productivity compared to letting employees work from home, the survey from HR software provider BambooHR points to remote and in-office employees spending an equal amount of time working.</p>
<p>BambooHR surveyed 1,504 full-time US employees, including 504 human resources (HR) workers who are a manager or higher, from March 9 to March 22. According to the firm, the sample group used for its report "<a href="https://www.bamboohr.com/resources/guides/return-to-office">The New Surveillance Era: Visibility Beats Productivity for RTO &amp; Remote</a>" is equally split across genders and includes "a spread of age groups, race groups, and geographies." Method Research, the research arm of technology PR and marketing firm Method, prepared the survey, and data collection firm Rep Data distributed it.</p>
<h2>Trying to make people quit</h2>
<p>Among those surveyed, 52 percent said they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/job-flexibility-and-security-linked-to-better-mental-health-among-workers/">prefer working remotely</a> compared to 39 percent who prefer working in an office.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030066#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030066&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/2006-03-20-yet-another-microsoft-portable-media-gaming-device-rumor.html">extremely long-standing rumors</a> regarding Microsoft making a portable game console got a strong shot in the arm over the weekend from none other than Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. Speaking on stage as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbYl4_y7N14">part of an IGN Live interview</a>, Spencer said directly that "I think we should have a handheld, too."</p>
<p>The comment stops just short of an official announcement that Microsoft is actively working on portable gaming hardware for the first time. But if anyone is in a position to make an "I think we should..." into an operational reality, it's Spencer.</p>
<p>"The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome," Spencer continued during the IGN presentation. "And the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about it."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030086#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030086&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Friday, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/microsoft-makes-recall-feature-off-by-default-after-security-and-privacy-backlash/">announced major changes to its upcoming Recall feature</a> after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned/">overwhelming criticism</a> from security researchers, the press, and its users. Microsoft is turning Recall off by default when users set up PCs that are compatible with the feature, and it's adding additional authentication and encryption that will make it harder to access another user's Recall data on the same PC.</p>

<p>It's likely not a coincidence that Microsoft also <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/">quietly pulled</a> the build of the Windows 11 24H2 update that it had been testing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/biggest-windows-11-update-in-2-years-nearly-finalized-enters-release-preview/">in its Release Preview channel</a> for Windows Insiders. It's not unheard of for Microsoft to stop distributing a beta build of Windows after releasing it, but the Release Preview channel is typically the last stop for a Windows update before a wider release.</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't provided a specific rationale for pulling the update; the blog post says the pause is "temporary" and the rollout will be resumed "in the coming weeks." Windows Insider Senior Program Manager Brandon LeBlanc <a href="https://x.com/brandonleblanc/status/1799478915582542199">posted</a> on social media that the team was "working to get it rolling out again shortly."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030031#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030031&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Saturday, the <em>VSS Unity</em> space plane made its final flight, carrying four passengers to an altitude of 54.4 miles (87.5 km) above the New Mexico desert. The spacecraft will now be retired after just seven commercial space flights, all made within the last year.</p>
<p>Although the flight was characterized by its chief executive Michael Colglazier as a "celebratory moment" for Virgin Galactic, the company now finds itself at a crossroads.</p>
<p>After an impressive but brief flurry of spaceflight activity—seven human spaceflights in a year, even to suborbital space, is unprecedented for a private company—Virgin Galactic will now be grounded again for at least two years. That's because Colglazier and Virgin Galactic are betting it all on the development of a future "Delta class" of spaceships modeled on <em>VSS Unity</em>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029999#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029999&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
