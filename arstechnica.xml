              <![CDATA[<p>A person in Louisiana is hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu after having contact with sick and dying birds suspected of carrying the virus, <a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/H5N1-2024">state health officials announced Friday</a>.</p>
<p>It is the first human H5N1 case detected in Louisiana. For now, the case is considered a "presumptive" positive until testing is confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health officials say that the risk to the public is low but caution people to stay away from any sick or dead birds.</p>
<p>Although the person has been hospitalized, their condition was not immediately reported. It's also unclear what kind of birds the person had contact with—wild, backyard, or commercial birds. Ars has reached out to Louisiana's health department and will update this piece with any additional information.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/person-hospitalized-in-louisiana-with-bird-flu-health-officials-report/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Multifaceted, high-precision campaign targets malicious and benevolent hackers alike.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A sophisticated and ongoing supply-chain attack operating for the past year has been stealing sensitive login credentials from both malicious and benevolent security personnel by infecting them with Trojanized versions of open source software from GitHub and NPM, researchers said.</p>
<p>The campaign, first reported three weeks ago by security firm <a href="https://checkmarx.com/blog/dozens-of-machines-infected-year-long-npm-supply-chain-attack-combines-crypto-mining-and-data-theft/">Checkmarx</a> and again on Friday by <a href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/mut-1244-targeting-offensive-actors/">Datadog Security Labs</a>, uses multiple avenues to infect the devices of researchers in security and other technical fields. One is through packages that have been available on open source repositories for over a year. They install a professionally developed backdoor that takes pains to conceal its presence. The unknown threat actors behind the campaign have also employed spear phishing that targets thousands of researchers who publish papers on the arXiv platform.</p>
<h2>Unusual longevity</h2>
<p>The objectives of the threat actors are also multifaceted. One is the collection of SSH private keys, Amazon Web Services access keys, command histories, and other sensitive information from infected devices every 12 hours. When this post went live, dozens of machines remained infected, and an online account on Dropbox contained some 390,000 credentials for WordPress websites taken by the attackers, most likely by stealing them from fellow malicious threat actors. The malware used in the campaign also installs cryptomining software that was present on at least 68 machines as of last month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/yearlong-supply-chain-attack-targeting-security-pros-steals-390k-credentials/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog">Werner Herzog</a> has made more than 60 films over his illustrious career. His documentaries alone span an impressive topical range, from the life and death of bear enthusiast <a title="Timothy Treadwell" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Treadwell">Timothy Treadwell</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_Man"><em>Grizzly Man</em></a>) to people who choose to live and work in Antarctica (the Oscar-nominated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encounters_at_the_End_of_the_World"><em>Encounters at the End of the World</em></a>) or a haunting exploration of the oldest human paintings in France's Chauvet Cave (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Forgotten_Dreams"><em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams</em></a>). His latest offering, <em>Theater of Thought</em>, tackles what might be his most ambitious subject yet: the mysterious inner workings of the brain.</p>
<p><em>Theater of Thought</em> premiered in 2022 at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado and is now getting a theatrical release. Herzog's inspiration grew out of his conversations with <a href="https://ntc.columbia.edu/rafael-yuste/">Rafael Yuste</a>, a Columbia University neurobiologist who also served as scientific advisor on the film. "How can we read thoughts?" he writes in his director's statement. "Can you implant a chip in your brain and in my brain, and see my new film without a camera? Why is it that some young people immerse themselves in video games and become addicted to completely artificial worlds? Sometimes mice even prefer invented cartoon worlds, so who is the ghost writer of our mind, of our reality?"</p>
<p>The topic might be scientific in nature, but <em>Theater of Thought</em> is not really a science documentary, despite Herzog's use of the classic talking head format. It's more of a personal, almost quixotic quest, with plenty of random branching digressions along the way. "It was like a road movie, one Monument Valley and one Grand Canyon, then one Mount Everest after the other," Herzog told Ars. "You just couldn't stop wondering and enjoying." For the viewer, it's as much a journey through the eccentric workings of Herzog's endlessly curious, nimble mind.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/werner-herzog-muses-on-mysteries-of-the-brain-in-theater-of-thought/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk has at least one more battle to wage against Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who will be leaving the agency when President-elect Trump takes over in January.</p>
<p>Musk yesterday <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1867357433493872874">posted</a> a copy of a letter sent to Gensler by Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro. The letter dated December 12 says the SEC issued a settlement demand in its investigation into whether Musk violated federal securities laws in connection with 2022 purchases of Twitter stock, and that the SEC is investigating Neuralink. The Spiro letter said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday the Commission Staff issued a settlement demand that required Mr. Musk agree within 48 hours to either accept a monetary payment or face charges on numerous counts. They indicated that this demand was the result of a directive from their superiors and that charges would be brought imminently unless Mr. Musk acquiesced. This demand follows a multi-year investigation and more than six years of harassment of Mr. Musk by the Commission and its Staff. More recently, the Staff subpoenaed me, Mr. Musk's attorney, for testimony and threatened to send a process server if I did not immediately cooperate. I categorically refused. This week, the Commission has also reopened an investigation into Neuralink.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spiro accused the SEC of "an improperly motivated campaign" against Musk, his companies, and people associated with him. "We demand to know who directed these actions—whether it was you or the White House," Spiro wrote. "These tactics and misguided scheme will not intimidate us. We reserve all rights."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/elon-musk-slams-sec-as-agency-threatens-charges-in-twitter-stock-probe/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A bitcoin investor who went to increasingly great lengths to hide $1 million in cryptocurrency gains on his tax returns was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-sentenced-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency">sentenced</a> to two years in prison on Thursday.</p>
<p>It seems that not even his most "sophisticated" tactics—including using mixers, managing multiple wallets, and setting up in-person meetings to swap bitcoins for cash—kept the feds from tracing crypto trades that he believed were untraceable.</p>
<p>The Austin, Texas, man, Frank Richard Ahlgren III, started buying up bitcoins in 2011. In 2015, he upped his trading, purchasing approximately 1,366 using Coinbase accounts. He waited until 2017 before cashing in, earning $3.7 million after selling about 640 at a price more than 10 times his initial costs. Celebrating his gains, he bought a house in Utah in 2017, mostly funded by bitcoins he purchased in 2015.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/dont-use-crypto-to-cheat-on-taxes-bitcoin-bro-gets-2-years/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1’s recent popularity still feels a little strange to longtime fans of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/formula-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sport</a>, particularly in the US, where it had been so niche for so long. But the past five years have seen F1 rise meteorically, and a new, much younger fanbase infused with enthusiasm for the cutting-edge race cars and the athletes who pilot them has emerged. F1 Arcade capitalizes on that popularity, combining food and drinks—including Lewis Hamilton's agave tipple—with dozens and dozens of race simulators that let you race against friends or compete in teams against others.</p>
<p>With Washington, DC, chosen for F1 Arcade's second US location, I obviously had to go check it out.</p>
<p>My first visit to the arcade in DC's Union Market district was several weeks ago at the launch party, an affair that was packed with influencers and loud music. But I returned earlier this week, having booked a 45-minute, five-race session playing head-to-head against a friend. Prices vary depending on the number of races and whether you're that at peak time, starting at $22/player for three races off-peak and going up to $42/player for five races at peak time. There's no charge for people who are just spectating (or eating and drinking), not racing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/12/f1-arcade-trip-report-great-sims-make-for-a-compelling-experience/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>ORLANDO, Florida—Earlier this year, officials at US Space Command released a list of priorities and needs, and among the routine recitation of things like cyber defense, communications, and surveillance was a relatively new term: "integrated space fires."</p>
<p>This is a new phrase in the esoteric terminology the military uses to describe its activities. Essentially, "fires" are offensive or defensive actions against an adversary. The Army <a href="https://api.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/2021/10/06/869ca62b/afc-concept-for-fires-2028-oct21.pdf">defines fires</a> as "the use of weapon systems to create specific lethal and nonlethal effects on a target."</p>
<p>The inclusion of this term in a Space Command <a href="https://www.spacecom.mil/Portals/57/USSPACECOM%20J8%20Trifold%2014%20Aug%202024%20APPROVED.pdf">planning document</a> was another signal that Pentagon leaders, long hesitant to even mention the possibility of putting offensive weapons in space for fear of stirring up a cosmic arms race, see the taboo of talking about space warfare as a thing of the past.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/the-us-military-is-now-talking-openly-about-going-on-the-attack-in-space/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The gap of time between how long Americans live and how much of that time is spent in good health only grew wider in the last two decades, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827753">a new study published in JAMA Network Open</a>.</p>
<p>The study, which looked at global health data between 2000 and 2019—prior to the COVID-19 pandemic—found the US stood out for its years of suffering. By 2019, Americans had a gap between their lifespan and their healthspan of 12.4 years, the largest gap of any of the 183 countries included in the study. The second largest gap was Australia's, at 12.1 years, followed by New Zealand at 11.8 years and the UK at 11.3 years.</p>
<p>America also stood out for having the largest burden of noncommunicable diseases in the world, as calculated by the years lived with disease or disability per 100,000 people.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/americans-are-living-longer-but-most-of-the-extra-time-is-spent-being-sick/">Read full article</a></p>

I hardly can. The biggest question left in launch is whether Blue Origin will make its deadline for launching New Glenn by the end of this year. It's been a long-time goal of founder Jeff Bezos, but the clock is ticking. We wish them luck!</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Large language models have found great success so far by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using their transformer architecture</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/heres-whats-really-going-on-inside-an-llms-neural-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively predict the next words</a> (i.e., language tokens) needed to respond to queries. When it comes to complex reasoning tasks that require abstract logic, though, some researchers have found that interpreting everything through this kind of "language space" can start to cause some problems, even for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-new-200-mo-chatgpt-subscription-will-buy-you-more-compute-time/">modern "reasoning" models</a>.</p>
<p>Now, researchers are trying to work around these problems by crafting models that can work out potential logical solutions completely in "latent space"—the hidden computational layer just before the transformer generates language. While this approach doesn't cause a sea change in an LLM's reasoning capabilities, it does show distinct improvements in accuracy for certain types of logical problems and shows some interesting directions for new research.</p>
<h2>Wait, what space?</h2>
<p>Modern reasoning models like ChatGPT's o1 tend to work by generating a "chain of thought." Each step of the logical process in these models is expressed as a sequence of natural language word tokens that are fed back through the model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/are-llms-capable-of-non-verbal-reasoning/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a blog, C.AI said it took a month to develop the teen model, with the goal of guiding the existing model "away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content."</p>
<p>C.AI said "evolving the model experience" to reduce the likelihood kids are engaging in harmful chats—including bots allegedly teaching a teen with high-functioning autism to self-harm and delivering inappropriate adult content to all kids whose families are suing—it had to tweak both model inputs and outputs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/character-ai-steps-up-teen-safety-after-bots-allegedly-caused-suicide-self-harm/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of sites running WordPress remain unpatched against a critical security flaw in a widely used plugin that was being actively exploited in attacks that allow for unauthenticated execution of malicious code, security researchers said.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-11972">CVE-2024-11972</a>, is found in <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hunk-companion/#description">Hunk Companion</a>, a plugin that runs on 10,000 sites that use the WordPress content management system. The vulnerability, which carries a severity rating of 9.8 out of a possible 10, was patched earlier this week. At the time this post went live on Ars, figures provided on the Hunk Companion page indicated that less than 12 percent of users had installed the patch, meaning nearly 9,000 sites could be next to be targeted.</p>
<h2>Significant, multifaceted threat</h2>
<p>“This vulnerability represents a significant and multifaceted threat, targeting sites that use both a ThemeHunk theme and the Hunk Companion plugin,” Daniel Rodriguez, a researcher with WordPress security firm WP Scan, <a href="https://wpscan.com/blog/unauthorized-plugin-installation-activation-in-hunk-companion/">wrote</a>. “With over 10,000 active installations, this exposed thousands of websites to anonymous, unauthenticated attacks capable of severely compromising their integrity.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/thousands-of-sites-remain-unpatched-against-actively-exploited-wordpress-plugin-bug/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon reportedly are not notifying most customers whose call records were stolen in the ongoing attack attributed to Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon. NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/phone-hack-data-chinese-salt-typhoon-metadata-fbi-security-encrypt-rcna183233">reported today</a> that "the vast majority of people whose call records have been stolen by Chinese hackers have not been notified, according to industry sources, and there is no indication that most affected people will be notified in the near future."</p>
<p>US government officials <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/us-recommends-encrypted-messaging-as-chinese-hackers-linger-in-telecom-networks/">said last week</a> that major telecom companies have been unable to fully evict the Chinese state-sponsored hackers from their networks. There have been direct notifications to specific targets, such as government officials, whose calls were listened to and whose text messages were accessed. "President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance, senior congressional staffers and an array of US security officials were among scores of individuals to have their calls and texts directly targeted," The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/dozens-of-countries-hit-in-chinese-telecom-hacking-campaign-top-u-s-official-says-2a3a5cca">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>For most other victims, the data accessed apparently didn't include the contents of communications. It instead consisted of metadata like the numbers that phones called and when. These people are not receiving notifications from carriers, NBC News wrote today:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/report-att-verizon-arent-notifying-most-victims-of-chinese-call-records-hack/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The No. 1 nuisance with smartphones and smartwatches is that we need to charge them every day. As warm-blooded creatures, however, we generate heat all the time, and that heat can be converted into electricity for some of the electronic gadgetry we carry.</p>
<p>Flexible thermoelectric devices, or F-TEDs, can convert thermal energy into electric power. The problem is that F-TEDs weren’t actually flexible enough to comfortably wear or efficient enough to power even a smartwatch. They were also very expensive to make.</p>
<p>But now, a team of Australian researchers thinks they finally achieved a breakthrough that might take F-TEDs off the ground.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/thermoelectric-material-gets-flexible-efficient/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[We may owe our tiny sliver of Neanderthal DNA to just a couple of hundred Neanderthals.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Two recent studies suggest that the gene flow (as the young people call it these days) between Neanderthals and our species happened during a short period sometime between 50,000 and 43,500 years ago. The studies, which share several co-authors, suggest that our torrid history with Neanderthals may have been shorter than we thought.</p>
<h2><b>Pinpointing exactly when Neanderthals met <em>H. sapiens</em>  </b></h2>
<p>Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology scientist Leonardo Iasi and his colleagues examined the genomes of 59 people who lived in Europe between 45,000 and 2,200 years ago, plus those of 275 modern people whose ancestors hailed from all over the world. The researchers cataloged the segments of Neanderthal DNA in each person’s genome, then compared them to see where those segments appeared and how that changed over time and distance. This revealed how Neanderthal ancestry got passed around as people spread around the world and provided an estimate of when it all started.</p>
<p>“We tried to compare where in the genomes these [Neanderthal segments] occur and if the positions are shared among individuals or if there are many unique segments that you find [in people from different places],” said University of California Berkeley geneticist Priya Moorjani in a recent press conference. “We find the majority of the segments are shared, and that would be consistent with the fact that there was a single gene flow event.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/studies-pin-down-exactly-when-humans-and-neanderthals-swapped-dna/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/when-counting-quickly-openais-new-voice-mode-stops-to-catch-its-breath/">ChatGPT</a> users can now talk to a simulated version of Santa Claus through the app's voice mode, using AI to bring a North Pole connection to mobile devices, desktop apps, and web browsers during the holiday season.</p>
<p>The company added Santa's voice and personality as a preset option in ChatGPT's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a>. Users can access Santa by tapping a snowflake icon next to the prompt bar or through voice settings. The feature works on iOS and Android mobile apps, chatgpt.com, and OpenAI's Windows and MacOS applications. The Santa voice option will remain available to users worldwide until early January.</p>
<p>The conversations with Santa exist as temporary chats that won't save to chat history or affect the model's memory. OpenAI designed this limitation specifically for the holiday feature. Keep that in mind, because if you let your kids talk to Santa, the AI simulation won't remember what kids have told it during previous conversations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-introduces-santa-mode-to-chatgpt-for-ho-ho-ho-voice-chats/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like with much of physical media, the onslaught against optical media is ongoing. In the latest hit against physical media fans, LG has discontinued its remaining Blu-ray players. However, this doesn't spell the end for Blu-rays, which, in at least some categories, are seeing growing interest.</p>
<p>LG has no plans to make more Blu-ray players, <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1733902062">FlatpanelsHD</a> reported on Wednesday. Its most recent players, the <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/blu-ray-dvd-players/lg-ubk90-blu-ray-player">UBK90</a> and <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/blu-ray-dvd-players/lg-ubk80-blu-ray-player">UBK80</a>, came out in 2018 and are no longer available for purchase on LG’s website. You can still find them at third-party retailers, but when stock runs out, LG won’t be replenishing. Trying to access LG's "Blu-ray &amp; DVD Players" webpage now results in a redirect to LG's 4K TVs. We can take a hint, LG.</p>
<p>FlatpanelsHD spoke with LG Korea, which reportedly didn’t commit to a permanent exit from Blu-ray players. But for the foreseeable future, the company won’t be selling a type of device that it hasn’t updated in almost seven years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/the-optical-disc-onslaught-continues-with-lg-quitting-blu-ray-players/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Citing "years of investment in AI, AR, and VR," Google is stepping into the augmented reality market once more with <a href="https://www.android.com/xr/">Android XR</a>. It's an operating system that Google says will power future headsets and glasses that "transform how you watch, work, and explore."</p>
<p>The first version you'll see is Project Moohan, a mixed-reality headset built by Samsung. It will be available for purchase next year, and not much more is known about it. Developers have access to <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/12/introducing-android-xr-sdk-developer-preview.html">the new XR version of Android</a> now.</p>
<p>"We've been in this space since Google Glass, and we have not stopped," said Juston Payne, director of product at Google for XR in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn5uG1ys-pE">Android XR's launch video</a>. Citing established projects like Google Lens, Live View for Maps, instant camera translation, and, of course, Google's general-purpose Gemini AI, XR promises to offer such overlays in both dedicated headsets and casual glasses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/google-steps-into-extended-reality-once-again-with-android-xr/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Intel doesn't have a ton to show for its dedicated GPU efforts yet.</p>
<p>After much anticipation, many delays, and an anticipatory <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/poor-dx11-performance-arc-gpus-constant-work-in-progress">apology tour for its software quality</a>, Intel launched its first Arc GPUs at the end of 2022. There were things to like about the A770 and A750, but buggy drivers, poor performance in older games, and relatively high power use made them difficult to recommend. They were more notable as curiosities than as consumer graphics cards.</p>
<p>The result, after more than two years on the market, is that Arc GPUs remain a statistical nonentity in the GPU market, according to <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/shipments-of-graphics-aibs-see-significant-surge-in-q2-2024/">analysts</a> and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>. But it was always going to take time—and probably a couple of hardware generations—for Intel to make meaningful headway against entrenched competitors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/review-intel-arc-b580-is-a-compelling-if-incredibly-tardy-250-midrange-gpu/">Read full article</a></p>
