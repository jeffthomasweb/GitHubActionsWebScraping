<p>Most robots rely on complex control systems, AI-powered or otherwise, that govern their movement. These centralized electronic brains need time to react to changes in their environment and produce movements that are often awkwardly, well, robotic.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. A team of Dutch scientists at the FOM Institute for Molecular and Atomic Physics (AMOLF) in Amsterdam built a new kind of robot that can run, go over obstacles, and even swim, all driven only by the flow of air. And it does all that with no brain at all.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/dutch-scientists-built-a-brainless-soft-robot-that-runs-on-air/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>This week's Tuesday Telescope photo is pretty meta as it features... a telescope.</p>
<p>This particular telescope is under construction in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, one of the darkest places on Earth with excellent atmospheric visibility. The so-called "Extremely Large Telescope" is being built on a mountaintop in the Andes at an elevation of about 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>And it really is extremely large. The primary mirror will be 39 meters (128 feet) in diameter. Like, that's gigantic for an optical telescope. It is nearly <em>four</em> times larger than the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_optical_reflecting_telescopes">operational reflecting telescopes in the world</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/tuesday-telescope-taking-a-look-at-the-next-generation-of-telescopes/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission is proposing a DOGE-style overhaul of the agency's operations, including large cuts to the Universal Service Fund that subsidizes broadband deployment and access.</p>
<p>FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington said the fund should reduce spending on fiber networks and give money to Starlink—helping Elon Musk, the man in charge of President Trump's DOGE initiative. Simington also argued that the FCC is using too many staff hours on reviewing license applications and should instead use automated systems to approve most license requests.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A day after the US Copyright Office dropped a bombshell pre-publication <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/ai/Copyright-and-Artificial-Intelligence-Part-3-Generative-AI-Training-Report-Pre-Publication-Version.pdf">report</a> challenging artificial intelligence firms' argument that all AI training should be considered fair use, the Trump administration fired the head of the Copyright Office, Shira Perlmutter—sparking speculation that the controversial report hastened her removal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tensions have apparently only escalated since. Now, as industry advocates decry the report as overstepping the office's authority, social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fisherdanar.bsky.social/post/3loyan4hg5222">posts</a> on Monday described an apparent standoff at the Copyright Office between Capitol Police and men rumored to be with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A source familiar with the matter <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-copyright-office-trump-takeover/">told Wired</a> that the men were actually "Brian Nieves, who claimed he was the new deputy librarian, and Paul Perkins, who said he was the new acting director of the Copyright Office, as well as acting Registrar," but it remains "unclear whether the men accurately identified themselves." A spokesperson for the Capitol Police told Wired that no one was escorted off the premises or denied entry to the office.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/copyright-office-head-fired-after-reporting-ai-training-isnt-always-fair-use/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday, white smoke emerged from a chimney at the Sistine Chapel, signaling that cardinals had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/newly-anointed-pope-leo-xiv-is-our-first-confirmed-gamer-pontiff/">elected a new pope</a>. That's a rare event in itself, but one of the many unprecedented aspects of the election of Chicago-born Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV is one of the main reasons he chose his papal name: artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the new pope gave his <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250510-collegio-cardinalizio.html">first address</a> to the College of Cardinals, explaining his name choice as a continuation of Pope Francis' concerns about technological transformation.</p>
<p>"Sensing myself called to continue in this same path, I chose to take the name Leo XIV," he <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250510-collegio-cardinalizio.html">said</a> during the address. "There are different reasons for this, but mainly because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> in his historic Encyclical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerum_novarum">Rerum Novarum</a> addressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/new-pope-chose-his-name-based-on-ais-threats-to-human-dignity/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Over the weekend, America's top health official, Robert F.

<p>The creek is known for having a sewage overflow problem and posing a health hazard to any who enter it. The National Park Service, which manages the Rock Creek Park, strictly bars all swimming and wading in Rock Creek and the park's other waterways due to the contamination, specifically "high levels of bacteria."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/germ-theory-skeptic-rfk-jr-goes-swimming-in-sewage-tainted-water/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Switch and Switch 2 users who try to hack their consoles or play pirated copies of games may find their devices rendered completely inoperable by Nintendo. That new warning was buried in a recent update to the Nintendo User Account Agreement, as <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-emulation-hacking-brick-warning-terms-of-service">first noticed by Game File last week</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/eula-update/">May 2025 EULA update</a> adds new language concerning the specific ways users are allowed to use "Nintendo Account Services" on the console, a term defined here to encompass the use of "video games and add-on content." Under the new EULA, any unlicensed use of the system not authorized by Nintendo could lead the company to "render the Nintendo Account Services <em>and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part." </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>That language would apply to both the current Switch and the upcoming Switch 2.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/nintendo-threatens-to-brick-switch-consoles-for-hacking-piracy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 2012, clinicians at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia treated Emily Whitehead, a 6-year-old with leukemia, with altered immune cells from her own body. At the time, the treatment was experimental, but it worked: The cells targeted the cancer and eradicated it. Thirteen years later, Whitehead is still cancer-free.</p>
<p>The modified cells, called <a href="https://undark.org/2019/10/23/cart-t-behind-scenes-cancer-cure/">CAR-T cells</a>, are a form of immunotherapy, where doctors change parts of the immune system into cancer-attacking instruments. About five years after Whitehead’s <a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/emily-whitehead-first-pediatric-patient-receive-car-t-cell-therapy-celebrates-cure-10-years">treatment</a>, the first CAR-T drugs were approved by the FDA and were heralded, along with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0488-6">immunotherapy</a> more broadly, as one of the most promising modern cancer treatments. Today, there are seven FDA-approved CAR-T therapies, including the one used to treat Whitehead.</p>
<p>Since then, however, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03084-6">studies</a> have linked CAR-T to fatal complications due to treatment toxicity, and the treatment has had a harder time addressing certain types of cancers, particularly solid tumors affecting the breast and pancreas, although some small clinical trials have been <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cells#closing-in-on-car-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-tumors">starting to show</a> positive results for solid cancers. “After a decade, a decade and a half, we arrive at the point that there are patients who answer, most of the patients still do not answer,” said George Calin, a researcher at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/a-new-era-in-cancer-therapies-is-at-hand/">Read full article</a></p>

<p class="p1">Program, that is, but not make—that’s the job of the <a href="https://fellowproducts.com/products/aiden-precision-coffee-maker">Fellow Aiden</a>, a coffee maker that <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/fellow-aiden-precision-coffee-maker/">crafts automated, precision pour-overs</a> in a countertop-ready cube.

<p class="p1">Strictly speaking, absolutely none of this is necessary. Humans can make great coffee with fresh beans, decent gear, time, patience, and experience. Experiments will reveal the differences in light and dark roasts, Ethiopian and Venezuelan, washed and honey-processed beans, or how often one agitates the grounds. But faced with something brand new, even an experienced brewer can be stumped and spend a good deal of time and none-too-cheap beans trying to get everything just right.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/the-tinkerers-who-opened-up-a-fancy-coffee-maker-to-ai-brewing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here every Monday morning</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: We're five episodes into this season of <em>The Last of Us</em>, and most of the infected we've seen have still been of the "mindless, screeching horde" variety. But in the first episode of the season, we saw Ellie encounter a single "smart" infected person, a creature that retained some sense of strategy and a self-preservation instinct. It implied that the show's monsters were not done evolving and that the seemingly stable fragments of civilization that had managed to take root were founded on a whole bunch of incorrect assumptions about what these monsters were and what they could do.</p>
<p>Amidst all the human-created drama, the changing nature of the Mushroom Zombie Apocalypse is the backdrop of this week's entire episode, starting and ending with the revelation that a 2003-vintage cordyceps nest has become a hotbed of airborne spores, ready to infect humans with no biting required.</p>
<p>This is news to me, as a Non-Game Player! But Kyle, I'm assuming this is another shoe that you knew the series was going to drop.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Actually, no. I suppose it's possible I'm forgetting something, but I think the "some infected are actually pretty smart now" storyline is completely new to the show. It's just one of myriad ways the show has diverged enough from the games at this point that I legitimately don't know where it's going to go or how it's going to get there at any given moment, which is equal parts fun and frustrating.</p>
<p>I will say that the "smart zombies" made for my first real "How are Ellie and Dina going to get out of this one?" moment, as Dina's improvised cage was being actively torn apart by a smart and strong infected. But then, lo and behold, here came Deus Ex Jesse to save things with a timely re-entrance into the storyline proper. You had to know we hadn't seen the last of him, right?</p>

<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: As with last week's subway chase, I'm coming to expect that any time Ellie and Dina seem to be truly cornered, some other entity is going to swoop down and "save" them at the last minute. This week it was an actual ally instead of another enemy that just happened to take out the people chasing Ellie and Dina. But it's the same basic narrative fake-out.</p>
<p>I assume their luck will run out at some point, but I also suspect that if it comes, that point will be a bit closer to the season finale.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Without spoiling anything from the games, I will say you can expect both Ellie and Dina to experience their fair share of lucky and unlucky moments in the episodes to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of unlucky moments, while our favorite duo is hiding in the park we get to see how the local cultists treat captured WLF members, and it is extremely not pretty. I'm repeating myself a bit from last week, but the lingering on these moments of torture feels somehow more gratuitous in an HBO show, even when compared to similarly gory scenes in the games.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Well we had just heard these cultists compared to "Amish people" not long before, and we already know they don't have tanks or machine guns or any of the other Standard Issue <em>The Last of Us</em> Paramilitary Goon gear that most other people have, so I guess you've got to do something to make sure the audience can actually take the cultists seriously as a threat. But yeah, if you're squeamish about blood-and-guts stuff, this one's hard to watch.</p>
<p>I do find myself becoming more of a fan of Dina and Ellie's relationship, or at least of Dina as a character. Sure, her tragic backstory's a bit trite (she defuses this criticism by pointing out in advance that it is trite), but she's smart, she can handle herself, she is a good counterweight to Ellie's rush-in-shooting impulses. They are still, as Dina points out, doing something stupid and reckless. But I am at least rooting for them to make it out alive!</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personality wise the Dina/Ellie pairing has just as many charms as the Joel/Ellie pairing from last season. But while I always felt like Joel and Ellie had a clear motivation and end goal driving them forward, the thirst for revenge pushing Dina and Ellie deeper into Seattle starts to feel less and less relevant the more time goes on.</p>
<p>The show seems to realize this, too, stopping multiple times since Joel's death to kind of interrogate whether tracking down these killers is worth it when the alternative is just going back to Jackson and prepping for a coming baby. It's like the writers are trying to convince themselves even as they're trying (and somewhat failing, in my opinion) to convince the audience of their just and worthy cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, I did notice the points where Our Heroes paused to ask "are we sure we want to be doing this?" And obviously, they <em>are</em> going to keep doing this, because we have spent all this time setting up all these different warring factions and we're going to <em>use</em> them, dang it!! But this has never been a thing that was going to bring Joel back, and it only seems like it can end in misery, especially because I assume Jesse's plot armor is not as thick as Ellie or Dina's.</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personally I think the "Ellie and Dina give up on revenge and prepare to start a post-apocalyptic family (while holding off zombies)" would have been a brave and interesting direction for a TV show. It would have been even braver for the game, although very difficult for a franchise where the main verbs are "shoot" and "stab."</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah if <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> had been a city-building simulator where you swap back and forth between managing the economy of a large town and building defenses to keep out the hordes, fans of the first game might have been put off. But as an <em>Adventure of Link</em> fan I say: bring on the sequels with few-if-any gameplay similarities to their predecessors!</div>

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: "We killed Joel" team member Nora definitely would have preferred if Ellie and Dina were playing that more domestic kind of game. As it stands, Ellie ends up pursuing her toward a miserable-looking death in a cordyceps-infested basement.</p>
<p>The chase scene leading up to this mirrors a very similar one in the game in a lot of ways. But while I found it easy to suspend my disbelief for the (very scripted) chase on the PlayStation, watching it in a TV show made me throw up my hands and say "come on, these heavily armed soldiers can't stop a little girl that's making this much ruckus?"</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah Jesse can pop half a dozen "smart" zombies in half a dozen shots, but when it's a girl with a giant backpack running down an open hallway everyone suddenly has <em>Star Wars</em> Stormtrooper aim. The visuals of the cordyceps den, with the fungified guys breathing out giant clouds of toxic spores, is effective in its unsettling-ness, at least!</p>
<p>This episode's <em>other</em> revelation is that what Joel did to the Fireflies in the hospital at the end of last season is apparently <em>not</em> news to Ellie, when she hears it from Nora in the episode's final moments. It could be that Ellie, Noted Liar, is lying about knowing this. But Ellie is also totally incapable of controlling her emotions, and I've got to think that if she had been surprised by this, we would have been able to tell.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, saying too much about what Ellie knows and when would be risking some major spoilers. For now I'll just say the way the show decided to mix things up by putting this detailed information in Nora's desperate, spore-infested mouth kind of landed with a wet thud for me.</p>
<p>I was equally perplexed by the sudden jump cut from "Ellie torturing a prisoner" to "peaceful young Ellie flashback" at the end of the episode. Is the audience supposed to assume that this is what is going on inside Ellie's head or something? Or is the narrative just shifting without a clutch?</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: I took it to mean that we were about to get a timeline-breaking departure episode next week, one where we spend some time in flashback mode filling in what Ellie knows and why before we continue on with Abby Quest. But I guess we'll see, won't we!</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Oh, I've been waiting with bated breath for a bevy of flashbacks I knew were coming in some form or another. But the particular <em>way</em> they shifted to the flashback here, with mere seconds left in this particular brutal episode, was baffling to me.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think you do it that way to get people hyped about the possibility of seeing Joel again next week. Unless it's just a cruel tease! But it's probably not, right? Unless it is!</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Now I kind of hope the next episode just goes back to Ellie and Dina and doesn't address the five seconds of flashback at all. Screw you, audience!</div>

      John Cena reprises his titular role for the second season of <em>Peacemaker</em>.

</div>
<p>What's a reformed villain gotta do to impress the Justice League? That's the dilemma faced by John Cena's titular antihero in the first teaser for S2 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacemaker_(TV_series)"><em>Peacemaker</em></a>, James Gunn's Emmy-nominated series spun off from his 2021 film, <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. We've got the same colorful cast of characters, but the new season will serve as something of a "soft reboot" as part of the new DC Universe (DCU) franchise.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 and <em>The Suicide Squad</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>The eight-episode first season was set five months after the events of <em>The Suicide Squad.</em> Having survived a near-fatal shooting, Peacemaker—aka Christopher Smith—is recruited by the US government for a new mission: the mysterious Project Butterfly, led by a mercenary named Clemson Murn (Chukwudi Iwuji). The team also includes A.R.G.U.S. agent John Economos (Steve Agee) of the Belle Reve Penitentiary, National Security Agency agent and former Waller aide Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), and new team member Leota Adebayo (Danielle Brooks).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/watch-the-first-s2-teaser-for-peacemaker/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A starry sky can be stunning—even inside a hospital emergency room.</p>
<p>But instead of celestial bodies sparkling in the night, doctors in South Korea were gazing at bright brain lesions punctuating a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The resulting pattern, called a "starry sky," meant that their 57-year-old patient had a dangerous form of tuberculosis. The doctors <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2415077?logout=true">report the case</a> in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>The man had previously been treated for the infection in his lungs but came into the hospital's emergency department after two weeks of unexplained headaches, neck pain, and tingling in his right hand. The MRI and Computed-Tomography (CT) scans clearly revealed the problem: rare nodules and lesions, called tuberculomas, speckling his lungs and central nervous system, including both cerebral hemispheres, the basal ganglia deep inside the brain, the cerebellum at the back of the brain, the brain stem, and the upper spinal cord.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/when-doctors-describe-your-brain-scan-as-a-starry-sky-its-not-good/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/">unveiled</a> LegoGPT, an AI model that creates physically stable Lego structures from text prompts. The new system not only designs Lego models that match text descriptions (prompts) but also ensures they can be built brick by brick in the real world, either by hand or with robotic assistance.</p>
<p>"To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions," the researchers wrote in their paper, which was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05469">posted</a> on arXiv, "and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction."</p>
<p>This trained model generates Lego designs that match text prompts, like "a streamlined, elongated vessel" or "a classic-style car with a prominent front grille." The resulting designs are simple, using just a few brick types to create primitive shapes—but they stand up. As one Ars Technica staffer joked this morning upon seeing the research, "It builds Lego <a href="https://www.toysperiod.com/lego-set-reference/by-decade/1970s/">like it's 1974</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/new-ai-model-generates-buildable-lego-creations-from-text-descriptions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fitness tracker company Whoop has upset some long-time customers by ending an upgrade system that promised free hardware upgrades to anyone who had a subscription with the company for at least six months.</p>
<p>Whoop makes fitness tracker bracelets that let users access things like sleep tracking, menstrual tracking, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) via a subscription companion app. Since the first Whoop wearable came out in 2015, the Boston-based company’s business has been built on subscriptions. Whoop has traditionally lured customers in by giving its hardware away for “free” to Whoop app subscribers. Further, customers who subscribed to the Whoop app for at least six months got access to free hardware upgrades.</p>
<p>“Instead of purchasing new hardware every time an updated model is produced, WHOOP members receive the next-generation device for free after having been a member for six months or more,” said a webpage on Whoop’s website that is no longer active but was accessible as recently as March 28, as reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664111/whoop-5-0-upgrade-anger-wearables">The Verge</a> and confirmed via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250328102036/https:/www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/best-fitness-trackers/">the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/wearables-firms-endless-free-hardware-upgrades-were-too-good-to-be-true/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last year, United States District Court Judge Amit Mehta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">ruled that Google violated antitrust law</a> by illegally maintaining a monopoly in search. Now, Google and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have had their say in the remedy phase of the trial, which wraps up today. It will determine the consequences for Google's actions, potentially changing the landscape for search as we rocket into the AI era, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>The remedy trial featured over 20 witnesses, including representatives from some of the most important technology firms in the world. Their statements about the past, present, and future of search moved markets, but what does the testimony mean for Google?</p>
<h2>Everybody wants Chrome</h2>
<p>One of the DOJ's proposed remedies is to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">force Google to divest Chrome</a> and the open source Chromium project. Google has been adamant both in and out of the courtroom that it is the only company that can properly run Chrome. It says selling Chrome would negatively impact privacy and security because Google's technology is deeply embedded in the browser. And regardless, Google Chrome would be too expensive for anyone to buy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Intel's i486 was the first "computer number" I ever really understood. Sure, my elementary school computer lab had both the Apple IIGS and Apple IIc, and one of them was slightly more useful, for reasons unexplained to me. But soon after my father brought home his office's discarded Gateway desktop with a 486DX 33 MHz inside, I was catapulted into my first Intel sorting scheme. I learned there was an x86 before this one (i386), and there were models with different trailing numbers (16–100 MHz) and "DX" levels. This was my first grasp of what hardware I was actually using and what could improve inside it.</p>
<p>More than 36 years after the release of the 486 and 18 years after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061009060120/http://developer.intel.com/design/pcn/Processors/D0106013.pdf">Intel stopped making them</a>, leaders of the Linux kernel believe the project can improve itself by leaving i486 support behind. Ingo Molnar, <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250425084216.3913608-1-mingo@kernel.org/">quoting Linus Torvalds</a> regarding "zero real reason for anybody to waste one second" on 486 support, submitted a patch series to the 6.15 kernel that updates its minimum support features. Those requirements now include TSC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter">Time Stamp Counter</a>) and CX8 (i.e., "fixed" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Older_implementations">CMPXCH8B</a>, its own <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000008595/processors.html">whole thing</a>), features that the 486 lacks (as do some early non-Pentium 586 processors).</p>
<p>It's not the first time Torvalds has suggested dropping support for 32-bit processors and relieving kernel developers from implementing archaic emulation and work-around solutions. "We got rid of i386 support back in 2012. Maybe it's time to get rid of i486 support in 2022," <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wikUaRM5H_y1Bc+QyvGi40dKDL8fnCTyz7ECbwK7aHNPQ@mail.gmail.com/">Torvalds wrote in October 2022</a>. Failing major changes to the 6.15 kernel, which will likely arrive <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-rc4-Released">late this month</a>, i486 support will be dropped.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/linux-to-end-support-for-1989s-hottest-chip-the-486-with-next-release/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump said he is killing a broadband grant program that was authorized by Congress, claiming that the Digital Equity Act of 2021 is racist and unconstitutional.</p>
<p>"I have spoken with my wonderful Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, and we agree that the Biden/Harris so-called 'Digital Equity Act' is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL. No more woke handouts based on race! The Digital Equity Program is a RACIST and ILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway. I am ending this IMMEDIATELY, and saving Taxpayers BILLIONS OF DOLLARS!" Trump wrote in a Truth Social <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114474136573150113">post</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>The Digital Equity Act provided $2.75 billion for three grant programs. As a National Telecommunications and Information Administration <a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/funding-programs/digital-equity-act-programs">webpage</a> says, the grants "aim to ensure that all people and communities have the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/trump-is-killing-broadband-grants-because-some-of-them-help-minorities/">Read full article</a></p>
