<p>The CEO of a failed hospital system who was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/as-hospitals-failed-and-patients-died-ceo-reportedly-netted-250m/">paid hundreds of millions of dollars while patients were allegedly "killed and maimed"</a> in his resource-starved and rotting facilities, was a no-show at a Senate hearing on Thursday—despite a bipartisan subpoena compelling him to appear.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Ralph de la Torre—the Harvard University-trained cardiac surgeon who took over the Steward Health Care System in 2020—told senators in a letter last week that he was unable to testify at the hearing. Despite previously agreeing to the hearing, de la Torre and his lawyers argued that a federal court order stemming from Steward's bankruptcy case, filed in May, prevented him from discussing anything amid reorganization and settlement efforts.</p>
<p>But that argument was found to be without merit by the Senate committee that issued the subpoena in July—the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), chaired by Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). In <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bernie-sanders-steward-ceo-senate-subpoena-hearing-a3cd1d5ace8fe4073ae271ec228e56a1">comments to the Associated Press Wednesday</a>, Sanders said there were plenty of topics he could have safely discussed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049589#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049589&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Curiosity is the driving force behind all science, which may explain why so many scientists sometimes find themselves going in some decidedly eccentric research directions. Did you hear about the WWII plan to train pigeons as missile guidance systems? How about experiments on the swimming ability of a dead rainbow trout or that time biologists tried to startle cows by popping paper bags by their heads? These and other unusual research endeavors were honored tonight in a virtual ceremony to announce the 2024 recipients of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes. Yes, it's that time of year again, when the serious and the silly converge—for science.</p>
<p>Established in 1991, the Ig Nobels are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/the-serious-science-of-the-ig-nobel-prizes-will-make-you-laugh-then-think/" data-uri="b76aa749304ed60430d3dfdf9db8dee9">a good-natured parody</a> of the Nobel Prizes; they honor "achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think." The unapologetically campy awards ceremony features miniature operas, scientific demos, and the 24/7 lectures whereby experts must explain their work twice: once in 24 seconds and the second in just seven words. Acceptance speeches are limited to 60 seconds. And as the motto implies, the research being honored might seem ridiculous at first glance, but that doesn't mean it's devoid of scientific merit.</p>
<p>Viewers can tune in for the usual 24/7 lectures, as well as the premiere of a "non-opera" featuring various songs about water, in keeping with the evening's theme. In the weeks following the ceremony, the winners will also give free public talks, which will be posted on the Improbable Research website.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048255#p3">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048255&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Earlier this year, we got a look at something unusual: the results of an internal investigation conducted by Harvard Business School that concluded one of its star faculty members had committed research misconduct. Normally, these reports are kept confidential, leaving questions regarding the methods and extent of data manipulations.</p>
<p>But in this case, the report became public because the researcher had filed a lawsuit that alleged defamation on the part of the team of data detectives that had first identified potential cases of fabricated data, as well as Harvard Business School itself. Now, the court has ruled on motions to dismiss the case. While the suit against Harvard will go on, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.259933/gov.uscourts.mad.259933.74.0.pdf">the court has ruled</a> that evidence-backed conclusions regarding fabricated data cannot constitute defamation—which is probably a very good thing for science.</p>
<h2>Data and defamation</h2>
<p>The researchers who had been sued, Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson, and Joe Simmons, run a blog called <a href="https://datacolada.org/">Data Colada</a> where, among other things, they note cases of suspicious-looking data in the behavioral sciences. As we detailed in our earlier coverage, they published a series of blog posts describing an apparent case of fabricated data in four different papers published by the high-profile researcher Francesca Gino, a professor at Harvard Business School.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049567#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049567&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Unity, maker of a popular cross-platform engine and toolkit, will not pursue a broadly unpopular Runtime Fee that would have charged developers based on game installs rather than per-seat licenses. The move comes exactly one year after the fee's initial announcement.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">a blog post</a> attributed to President and CEO Matt Bromberg, the CEO writes that the company cannot continue "democratizing game development" without "a partnership built on trust." Bromberg states that customers understand the necessity of price increases, but not in "a novel and controversial new form." So game developers will not be charged per installation, but they will be sorted into Personal, Pro, and Enterprise tiers by level of revenue or funding.</p>
<p>"Canceling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners," Bromberg writes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049485#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049485&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>OpenAI finally unveiled its rumored "Strawberry" AI language model on Thursday, claiming significant improvements in what it calls "reasoning" and problem-solving capabilities over previous large language models (LLMs). Formally named "<a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">OpenAI o1</a>," the model family will initially launch in two forms, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/">o1-preview</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-reasoning/">o1-mini</a>, available today for ChatGPT Plus and certain API users.</p>

<p>OpenAI claims that o1-preview outperforms its predecessor, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>, on multiple benchmarks, including competitive programming, mathematics, and "scientific reasoning." However, people who have used the model say it does not yet outclass GPT-4o in every metric. Other users have <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-details-on-openais-strawberry-apples-siri-makeover-larry-ellison-doubles-down-on-data-centers">criticized</a> the delay in receiving a response from the model, owing to the multi-step processing occurring behind the scenes before answering a query.</p>
<p>In a rare display of public hype-busting, OpenAI product manager Joanne Jang <a href="https://x.com/joannejang/status/1834286774140498368">tweeted</a>, "There's a lot of o1 hype on my feed, so I'm worried that it might be setting the wrong expectations. what o1 is: the first reasoning model that shines in really hard tasks, and it'll only get better. (I'm personally psyched about the model's potential &amp; trajectory!) what o1 isn't (yet!): a miracle model that does everything better than previous models. you might be disappointed if this is your expectation for today's launch—but we're working to get there!"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049445#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049445&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Unicode Consortium has finalized and released <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/">version 16.0 of the Unicode standard</a>, the elaborate character set that ensures that our phones, tablets, PCs, and other devices can all communicate and interoperate with each other. The update <a href="https://blog.unicode.org/2024/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-160.html">adds</a> 5,185 new characters to the standard, bringing the total up to a whopping 154,998.</p>
<p>Of those 5,185 characters, the ones that will get the most attention are the eight new emoji characters, including a shovel, a fingerprint, a leafless tree, a radish (formally classified as "root vegetable"), a harp, a purple splat that evokes <a href="https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Nickelodeon?file=Nickelodeon_1993.svg">the '90s Nickelodeon logo</a>, and a flag for the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sark">Sark</a>. The standout, of course, is "face with bags under eyes," whose long-suffering thousand-yard stare perfectly encapsulates the era it has been born into. Per usual, Emojipedia has <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/whats-new-in-unicode-16-0/">sample images</a> that give you some idea of what these will look like when they're implemented by various operating systems, apps, and services.</p>
<p>Unicode 16.0 also adds support for seven new modern and historical scripts: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garay_alphabet">West African Garay alphabet</a>; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khema_script">Gurung Khema</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirat_Rai">Kirat Rai</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol_Onal">Ol Onal</a>, and <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/sunuwar.htm">Sunuwar</a> scripts from Northeast India and Nepal; and historical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todhri_alphabet">Todhri</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigalari_script">Tulu-Tigalari</a> scripts from Albania and Southwest India, respectively.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049432#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049432&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the things enterprise storage and destruction company Iron Mountain does is handle the archiving of the media industry's vaults. What it has been seeing lately should be a wake-up call: roughly one-fifth of the hard disk drives dating to the 1990s it was sent are entirely unreadable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mixonline.com/business/inside-iron-mountain-its-time-to-talk-about-hard-drives">Music industry publication Mix</a> spoke with the people in charge of backing up the entertainment industry. The resulting tale is part explainer on how music is so complicated to archive now, part warning about everyone's data stored on spinning disks.</p>
<p>"In our line of work, if we discover an inherent problem with a format, it makes sense to let everybody know," Robert Koszela, global director for studio growth and strategic initiatives at Iron Mountain, told Mix. "It may sound like a sales pitch, but it's not; it's a call for action."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049391#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049391&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Belief in conspiracy theories is rampant, particularly in the US, where some estimates suggest as much as 50 percent of the population believes in at least one outlandish claim. And those beliefs are notoriously difficult to debunk. Challenge a committed conspiracy theorist with facts and evidence, and they'll usually just double down—a phenomenon psychologists usually attribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning#:~:text=Motivated%20reasoning%20is%20a%20cognitive,how%20new%20information%20is%20perceived.">motivated reasoning</a>, i.e., a biased way of processing information.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq1814">new paper</a> published in the journal Science is challenging that conventional wisdom, however. Experiments in which an AI chatbot engaged in conversations with people who believed at least one conspiracy theory showed that the interaction significantly reduced the strength of those beliefs, even two months later. The secret to its success: the chatbot, with its access to vast amounts of information across an enormous range of topics, could precisely tailor its counterarguments to each individual.</p>
<p>"These are some of the most fascinating results I've ever seen," co-author Gordon Pennycook, a psychologist at Cornell University, said during a media briefing. "The work overturns a lot of how we thought about conspiracies, that they're the result of various psychological motives and needs. [Participants] were remarkably responsive to evidence. There's been a lot of ink spilled about being in a post-truth world. It's really validating to know that evidence does matter. We can act in a more adaptive way using this new technology to get good evidence in front of people that is specifically relevant to what they think, so it's a much more powerful approach."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048587#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048587&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last month, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/tim-walz-coach.html">a profile of newly named Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz</a>, The New York Times included a throwaway line about "the time his wife had seized his Dreamcast, the Sega video game console, because he had been playing to excess." Weeks later, that anecdote formed the unlikely basis for the unlikely <a href="https://edward-la-barbera.itch.io/crazy-taxi-tim-walz-edition"><em>Crazy Taxi: Tim Walz Edition</em></a> mod, which inserts the Minnesota governor (and top-of-the-ticket running mate Kamala Harris) into the Dreamcast classic driving game.</p>
<p>"Rumor has it that Tim Walz played <em>Crazy Taxi</em> so much his wife took his Dreamcast away from him... so I decided to put him in the game," modder <a href="https://edward-la-barbera.itch.io/">Edward La Barbera</a> wrote on <a href="https://edward-la-barbera.itch.io/crazy-taxi-tim-walz-edition">the game's Itch.io page</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the pay-what-you-want mod can't just be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/play-a-new-official-ecco-the-dolphin-game-on-your-dreamcast-right-now/">burned to a CD-R and played on actual Dreamcast hardware</a>.

<p>Federal authorities have seized more than 350 websites after an undercover investigation revealed that the sites were used to illegally import gun parts into the US from China. To get the illegal items through customs, the sites described the items as toys, necklaces, car parts, tools, and even a fidget spinner.</p>
<p>The sites violated import bans and the National Firearms Act by selling switches—which are "parts designed to convert semiautomatic pistols into fully automatic machineguns"—and silencers—which "suppress the sound of a firearm when discharged," a Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/federal-authorities-seize-over-350-website-domains-used-import-illegal-switches-and">press release</a> said.</p>
<p>Some sites also marketed counterfeit Glock parts, infringing trademark laws, including a phony Glock switch that Glock confirmed to investigators was "never manufactured."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049393#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049393&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Several years ago, General Motors and EVgo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/gm-teams-up-with-evgo-to-deploy-more-than-2700-new-dc-fast-chargers/">teamed up</a> to build out a network of fast chargers for electric vehicles. As Tesla proved, giving your customers confidence that they won't be stranded on a long drive with a dead battery really helps sell EVs, and GM's sometimes-shifting target currently stands at deploying 2,850 chargers. Today, the two partners showed off their concept for an improved charging experience, which they say will come to a number of flagship charger locations around the US.</p>
<p>The most obvious thing to notice is the large canopy, co-branded with EVgo and GM Energy, similar to those found at virtually every gas station across the country. The gas station vibes don't end there, either. Ample lighting and security cameras are meant to combat the sometimes sketchy vibes that can be found at other banks of (often dimly lit) fast chargers after dark, located as they often are in the far reaches of a mall parking lot.</p>
<p>And the chargers are sited between the charging bays the same way gas pumps are located, allowing a driver to pull through. Most fast chargers require a driver to pull in or back into the space even when the chargers are located to one side, a fact that complicates long-distance towing with an EV.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049348#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049348&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A panel of independent experts reported this week that NASA lacks funding to maintain most of its decades-old facilities, could lose its engineering prowess to the commercial space industry, and has a shortsighted roadmap for technology development.</p>
<p>"NASA’s problem is it always seems to have $3 billion more program than it has of funds," said Norm Augustine, chair of the National Academies panel chartered to examine the critical facilities, workforce, and technology needed to achieve NASA's long-term strategic goals and objectives. Augustine said a similar statement could sum up two previous high-level reviews of NASA's space programs that he chaired in 1990 and 2009. But the report released Tuesday put NASA's predicament in stark terms.</p>
<h2>Grumbling about crumbling infrastructure</h2>
<p>Around 83 percent of NASA's facilities are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/nasas-buildings-are-even-older-than-its-graying-workforce/">beyond their design lifetimes</a>, and the agency has a $3.3 billion backlog in maintenance. When you consider NASA's $250 million estimate for normal year-to-year maintenance, it would take a $600 million uptick in NASA's annual budget for infrastructure repairs to catch up on the backlog within the next 10 years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049191#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049191&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google is under investigation by Europe’s privacy watchdog over its processing of personal data in the development of one of its artificial intelligence models, as regulators ramp up their scrutiny of Big Tech’s AI ambitions.</p>
<p>Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, said it had launched a statutory inquiry into the tech giant’s Pathways Language Model 2, or PaLM 2.</p>
<p>PaLM 2 was launched in May 2023 and predates Google’s latest Gemini models, which power its AI products. Gemini, which was launched in December of the same year, is now the core model behind its text and image-generation offering.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049305#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049305&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Two of the world's largest automakers are becoming closer friends, we learned this morning. Hyundai Motor Group and General Motors, which together sold 13.5 million cars last year, have decided to try and collaborate in a range of areas in the coming years, including vehicle design, technology development, and even supply chain sourcing.</p>
<p>GM is one of the world's oldest and most established automakers and has a long legacy of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/08/running-hot-and-cold-with-the-2017-chevrolet-volt/">clever engineering</a> solutions, albeit one <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/after-ditching-its-hybrids-gm-says-it-needs-to-build-more-hybrids/">often hamstrung</a> by corporate decision-making.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GM was just a year from its 60th birthday when HMG got going, and while the Korean automaker was not taken particularly seriously in the US as a budget brand at launch, over the last 15 years its products have been class-leading, especially its electric vehicles.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049289#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049289&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Not being able to solder puts a hard cap on the kinds of devices you can fix at home. As more modern devices add in circuit boards and discrete electronics (needed or otherwise), soldering is often the only way to save an otherwise functional object from ending up in a junk drawer, or landfill.</p>
<p>That's the kind of roadblock iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/fixhub">FixHub</a> is intended to address. The repair store and repairability advocate now offers battery-powered soldering tools and beginner's kits, intended to make soldering something you can do almost anywhere, quickly, with a few features intended to help out novices and those feeling a bit rusty.</p>

            iFixit's soldering tools are meant to be used together or separately. The battery pack can control the soldering iron temperature, but so can a browser.                          [credit:

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When it comes to working out, I'm a data nerd. A Google spreadsheet contains every bike ride I've been on for the past four years, tracking data points ranging from average moving speed to normalized power output. Sometimes I ride just for fun—road cycling is one of my favorite activities, period—so I'm not always thinking about cadence and power curves when I'm on the bike. Fitness-focused rides, on the other hand, mean a lot of looking away from the road and down at my bike computer. That's comfortable for me most of the time, but sometimes the cars are flying by or frost heaves are coming fast and furious, so the smart move is keeping my eyes down the road. So I was intrigued when I had a chance to check out ActiveLook's <a href="https://engoeyewear.com/products/engo-2?srsltid=AfmBOoqhkd4XNbCj4TXgNTSWaKwXwcwoMrQcjG_QI7HE0X0IkJrUSV_6">Engo 2 augmented reality sunglasses</a> with a built-in head-up display.</p>
<p>Priced at $299 (or $349 for photochromic lenses), the Engo 2 essentially takes data from your Garmin bike computer, watch, or fitness tracker; Apple Watch; Android Wear device, Suunto watch, or ActiveLook's homegrown app and projects it toward the top inside part of the right lens. (Garmin is the only bike computer supported by ActiveLook.)</p>

<p>From most angles, the Engo 2 looks like a normal pair of sports-oriented sunglasses, with wide, curved, and extensive lenses. The only oddity is a small metal plate in the middle of the glasses, right over the bridge of the nose, which is a sensor. Swipe from left to right, and the display will switch to another view or shut off—if your finger isn't too sweaty or your swipe is insufficiently forceful.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047555#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047555&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Polaris Dawn mission took a firm step into the future on Thursday morning when two private citizens, Jared Isaacman and Sarah Gillis, briefly ventured outside their Dragon spacecraft.</p>
<p>Although each only spent about eight minutes outside the capsule, the spacewalk was unquestionably a major success for SpaceX and the four astronauts flying in orbit. This marked the first time that a private company, SpaceX, conducted a spacewalk. Funded by Isaacman, the mission spurred a frenetic two-year period of spacesuit development, testing, and simulations by the California company to reach Thursday's remarkably smooth operations.</p>
<p>Isaacman emerged from Dragon at 6:52 am ET (10:52 UTC) as the spacecraft passed near Australia on the planet below. A billionaire, entrepreneur, and avid pilot, Isaacman paused for just a moment as he stood on the edge of eternity and looked back at Earth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049192#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049192&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Growing up, if I wanted to experiment with something technical, my dad made it happen. We shared dozens of tech <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/204">adventures</a> together, but those adventures were cut short when he died of cancer in 2013. Thanks to a new AI image generator, it turns out that my dad and I still have one more adventure to go.</p>

<p>Recently, an anonymous AI hobbyist discovered that an image synthesis model called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/">Flux</a> can reproduce someone's handwriting very accurately if specially trained to do so. I decided to experiment with the technique using written journals my dad left behind. The results astounded me and raised deep questions about ethics, the authenticity of media artifacts, and the personal meaning behind handwriting itself.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm also happy that I get to see my dad's handwriting again. Captured by a neural network, part of him will live on in a dynamic way that was impossible a decade ago. It's been a while since he died, and I am no longer grieving. From my perspective, this is a celebration of something great about my dad—reviving the distinct way he wrote and what that conveys about who he was.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045545#p3">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045545&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft has updated a key cryptographic library with two new encryption algorithms designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers.</p>
<p>The updates were made last week to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/SymCrypt">SymCrypt</a>, a core cryptographic code library for handing cryptographic functions in Windows and Linux. The library, started in 2006, provides operations and algorithms developers can use to safely implement secure encryption, decryption, signing, verification, hashing, and key exchange in the apps they create. The library supports federal certification requirements for cryptographic modules used in some governmental environments.</p>
<h2>Massive overhaul underway</h2>
<p>Despite the name, SymCrypt supports both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms. It’s the main cryptographic library Microsoft uses in products and services including Azure, Microsoft 365, all supported versions of Windows, Azure Stack HCI, and Azure Linux. The library provides cryptographic security used in email security, cloud storage, web browsing, remote access, and device management. Microsoft documented the update in a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-s-quantum-resistant-cryptography-is-here/ba-p/4238780">post</a> on Monday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049244#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049244&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You might sideload an Android app, or manually install its APK package, if you're using a custom version of Android that doesn't include Google's Play Store. Alternately, the app might be experimental, under development, or perhaps no longer maintained and offered by its developer. Until now, the existence of sideload-ready APKs on the web was something that seemed to be tolerated, if warned against, by Google.</p>
<p>This quiet standstill is being shaken up by a new feature in Google's Play Integrity API. As <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/play-integrity-sideloading-detection-3480639/">reported by Android Authority</a>, developer tools to push "remediation" dialogs during sideloading <a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/f757438a-844f-4c59-8dd4-9a5580a5e23d/">debuted</a> at Google's I/O conference in May, have begun showing up on users' phones. Sideloaders of apps from the British shop <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/cannot-install-the-new-tesco-clubcard-app-fp4/93824/10">Tesco</a>, fandom app <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Beyblade/comments/16bi9hh/getting_this_message_when_i_open_the_bbx_app/">BeyBlade X</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1833700730349515062?t=BYKpcVNNC-8z7Jems7j37Q&amp;s=19">ChatGPT</a> have reported "Get this app from Play" prompts, which cannot be worked around. An Android gaming handheld user encountered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retroid/comments/1dihb9d/how_to_bypass_get_this_app_from_play_on_rp2s/">a similarly worded prompt from <em>Diablo Immortal</em></a> on their device three months ago.</p>
<p>Google's Play Integrity API is how apps have previously blocked access when loaded onto phones that are in some way modified from a stock OS with all Google Play integrations intact. Recently, a popular two-factor authentication app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/loss-of-popular-2fa-tool-puts-security-minded-grapheneos-in-a-paradox/">blocked access on phones with modified firmware</a>, including GrapheneOS, which aims to surpass the security of Android's stock system. Apps can call the Play Integrity API and get back an "integrity verdict," relaying if the phone has a "trustworthy" software environment, has Google Play Protect enabled, and passes other software checks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049138#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049138&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
