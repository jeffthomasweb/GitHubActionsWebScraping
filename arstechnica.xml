<p>John Wick fans hoping for a fifth film in the hugely popular action franchise will at least be able to return to "Wick-World" next year with the release of a spinoff film, <em>Ballerina</em>, set between the events of 2019's <em>Chapter 3—Parabellum</em> and <em>Chapter 4</em> (2023). (The full title is the decidedly unwieldy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_World_of_John_Wick:_Ballerina"><em>From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</em></a>.) Lionsgate just dropped the first trailer, and it has all the tight action choreography and eye-popping visuals we've come to expect from the franchise—including a cameo by none other than the Baba Yaga himself (Keanu Reeves).</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>John Wick Chapter 3</em> and <em>Chapter 4</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Parabellum</em> found Wick declared excommunicado from the High Table for killing crime lord Santino D'Antonio on the grounds of the Continental. On the run with a bounty on his head, he makes his way to the headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston). That's where we learned Wick was originally named Jardani Jovonovich and trained as an assassin with the syndicate. The Director also trains young girls to be ballerina-assassins, and one young ballerina (played by Unity Phelan) is shown rehearsing in the scene. That dancer is the main character in <em>Ballerina</em>, now played by Ana de Armas.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052825#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052825&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Tor Project, the nonprofit that maintains software for the Tor anonymity network, is joining forces with Tails, the maker of a portable operating system that uses Tor. Both organizations seek to pool resources, lower overhead, and collaborate more closely on their mission of online anonymity.</p>
<p>Tails and the Tor Project began discussing the possibility of merging late last year, the two organizations <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-tails-join-forces/">said</a>. At the time, Tails was maxing out its current resources. The two groups ultimately decided it would be mutually beneficial for them to come together.</p>
<h2>Amnesic onion routing</h2>
<p>“Rather than expanding Tails’s operational capacity on their own and putting more stress on Tails workers, merging with the Tor Project, with its larger and established operational framework, offered a solution,” Thursday’s joint statement said. “By joining forces, the Tails team can now focus on their core mission of maintaining and improving Tails OS, exploring more and complementary use cases while benefiting from the larger organizational structure of The Tor Project.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052906#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052906&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The printer industry is <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52327424">in a rut</a>.</p>
<p>With the digitization of, well, nearly everything, people just don’t print like they used to. More modern ways of storing and sharing information, changes in communication preferences at home and in offices, and environmental concerns have stonewalled the printing industry and challenged stakeholders like HP.</p>
<p>I’d argue that it’s not just technological, economic, and societal changes that have diminished printer businesses. For the average person, printers and their capabilities have become boring. When’s the last time you’ve heard of a new killer printer feature?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052751#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052751&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, AI hosting platform Hugging Face <a href="https://x.com/flngr/status/1839305927385903269">surpassed</a> 1 million AI model listings for the first time, marking a milestone in the rapidly expanding field of machine learning. An AI model is a computer program (often using a neural network) trained on data to perform specific tasks or make predictions. The platform, which started as a chatbot app in 2016 before pivoting to become an open source hub for AI models in 2020, now hosts a wide array of tools for developers and researchers.</p>

<p>The machine-learning field represents a far bigger world than just large language models (LLMs) like the kind that power ChatGPT. In a post on X, Hugging Face CEO Clément Delangue <a href="https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305">wrote</a> about how his company hosts many high-profile AI models, like "Llama, Gemma, Phi, Flux, Mistral, Starcoder, Qwen, Stable diffusion, Grok, Whisper, Olmo, Command, Zephyr, OpenELM, Jamba, Yi," but also "999,984 others."</p>
<p>The reason why, Delangue says, stems from customization. "Contrary to the '1 model to rule them all' fallacy," he wrote, "smaller specialized customized optimized models for your use-case, your domain, your language, your hardware and generally your constraints are better. As a matter of fact, something that few people realize is that there are almost as many models on Hugging Face that are private only to one organization—for companies to build AI privately, specifically for their use-cases."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052715#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052715&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>California recently became the first state to ban deceptive sales of so-called "disappearing media."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/24/governor-newsom-signs-consumer-protection-bills-targeting-medical-debt-overdraft-fees-and-unfair-subscription-practices/">signed</a> AB 2426 into law, protecting consumers of digital goods like books, movies, and video games from being duped into purchasing content without realizing access was only granted through a temporary license.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Democratic assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, the law makes it illegal to "advertise or offer for sale a digital good to a purchaser with the terms buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good, or alongside an option for a time-limited rental."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052859#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052859&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Maryland woman was sentenced to 18 years in prison and a lifetime of supervised release "for conspiring to destroy the Baltimore region power grid," the US Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/maryland-woman-sentenced-conspiring-destroy-baltimore-region-power-grid">announced yesterday</a>. Sarah Beth Clendaniel, 36, admitted as part of a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.530115/gov.uscourts.mdd.530115.93.0_3.pdf">plea agreement</a> in May to conspiracy to damage energy facilities.</p>
<p>"Sarah Beth Clendaniel sought to 'completely destroy' the city of Baltimore by targeting five power substations as a means of furthering her violent white supremacist ideology," US Attorney General Merrick Garland said. The planned shooting attacks were prevented by law enforcement.</p>
<p>Family members of Clendaniel spoke to the media last year about her beliefs. "She would have no problem saying she's racist," her nephew Daniel Clites <a href="https://apnews.com/article/accidents-racism-religion-and-politics-rail-florida-ece17f4230fdbe39134ff61157a430d4">told the Associated Press</a>.

<p>The clash between SpaceX and the Federal Aviation Administration escalated this week, with Elon Musk calling for the head of the federal regulator to resign after he defended the FAA's oversight and fines levied against the commercial launch company.</p>
<p>The FAA has said it doesn't expect to determine whether to approve a launch license for SpaceX's next Starship test flight until late November, two months later than the agency previously communicated to Musk's launch company. Federal regulators are reviewing changes to the rocket's trajectory necessary for SpaceX to bring Starship's giant reusable Super Heavy booster back to the launch pad in South Texas. This will be the fifth full-scale test flight of Starship but the first time SpaceX attempts such a maneuver on the program.</p>
<p>This week, SpaceX assembled the full Starship rocket on its launch pad at the company's Starbase facility near Brownsville, Texas. "Starship stacked for Flight 5 and ready for launch, pending regulatory approval," SpaceX posted on X.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052226#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052226&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

But it's far from the first time that the suits in Detroit have seen storm clouds arriving from far-off lands.</p>
<p>In 1957, Detroit automakers' dominance of the US market seemed unbeatable. Smaller, independent American automakers Studebaker, Packard, Nash, Hudson, Kaiser, and Willys-Overland underwent various mergers to match the might of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler to little avail.</p>
<p>Yet America's Big Three faced a small but growing problem: foreign automakers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052637#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052637&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Scientists at the University of Washington have re-created the distinctive spiral shapes of shark intestines in 3D-printed pipes in order to study the unique fluid flow inside the spirals. Their prototypes kept fluids flowing in one preferred direction with no need for flaps to control that flow and performed significantly better than so-called "Tesla valves," particularly when made of soft polymers, according to a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2406481121">new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/spiral-shark-intestines-work-like-nikola-teslas-water-valve-study-finds/">reported previously</a>, in 1920, Serbian-born inventor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" data-uri="c935da0d1bc8593842b7272ae6eb670e">Nikola Tesla</a> designed and patented what he called a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_valve" data-uri="b63e19516ab6b909285223e1f4343d10">valvular conduit</a>": a pipe whose internal design ensures that fluid will flow in one preferred direction, with no need for moving parts, making it ideal for microfluidics applications, among other uses. The key to Tesla's ingenious valve design is a set of interconnected, asymmetric, tear-shaped loops.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US1329559">his patent application</a>, Tesla described this series of 11 flow-control segments as being made of "enlargements, recessions, projections, baffles, or buckets which, while offering virtually no resistance to the passage of fluid in one direction, other than surface friction, constitute an almost impassable barrier to its flow in the opposite direction." And because it achieves this with no moving parts, a Tesla valve is much more resistant to the wear and tear of frequent operation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1918321#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1918321&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI Chief Technical Officer Mira Murati <a href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027">announced</a> she is leaving the company in a surprise resignation shared on the social network X. Murati joined OpenAI in 2018, serving for six-and-a-half years in various leadership roles, most recently as the CTO. Also on Wednesday, OpenAI Chief Research Officer <a href="https://x.com/bobmcgrewai/status/1839099787423134051">Bob McGrew</a> and VP of Research <a href="https://x.com/barret_zoph/status/1839095143397515452">Barret Zoph</a> resigned independently of each other, but perhaps precipitated by the Murati news, <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1839093415226524114">according</a> to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</p>

<p>"After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAI," Murati wrote in a letter to the company's staff. "While I'll express my gratitude to many individuals in the coming days, I want to start by thanking Sam and Greg for their trust in me to lead the technical organization and for their support throughout the years," she continued, referring to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman. "There's never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right."</p>
<p>At OpenAI, Murati was in charge of overseeing the company's technical strategy and product development, including the launch and improvement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/when-ai-images-were-mind-blowing-early-users-recall-the-first-days-of-dall-e-2/">DALL-E</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/">Codex</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">Sora</a>, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> platform, while also leading research and safety teams.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Battery-electric vehicles accounted for 8 percent of new vehicle sales in June and July of this year and should be above 8 percent for September, according to estimates from S&amp;P Global Mobility. While growth has slowed from the 50 percent year over year <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/tesla-is-losing-market-share-as-ev-adoption-grows-and-prices-fall/">we experienced in 2023</a>, the trend is still positive, with market share increasing from 7 percent in the first three months of the year. That also has to be seen in the wider context of overall new vehicle sales, which are expected to drop by 12 percent this month.</p>
<p>"New vehicle sales remain stuck in neutral," said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&amp;P Global Mobility. "The overall tenor of the auto demand environment remains one of consistent, but unmotivated volume levels as consumers in the market continue to be pressured by high interest rates and slow-to-recede vehicle prices, which are translating to high monthly payments."</p>
<p>The rapid growth of BEV sales in the US was, until recently, mostly a tale about Tesla. During the pandemic, it flourished, as car buyers could order their Tesla online, and the automaker displayed far more flexibility over supply-chain hiccups than its legacy rivals. Sales soared, but not as much as the share price.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052735#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052735&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today marks the debut of the first full trailer for the second season of <em>The Last of Us</em>, the grim but compelling post-apocalyptic drama on HBO that's based on the popular video game of the same name.</p>
<p>The trailer revisits the first season's two protagonists—Joel and Ellie—five years after Joel's fateful choice. Here's the simple, straightforward logline HBO provided:</p>
<blockquote><p>After five years of peace following the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie’s collective past catches up to them, drawing them into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to returning characters, we get some glimpses of some new characters and the actors who will play them. Jeffrey Wright (<em>Westworld</em>, <em>American Fiction</em>) will reprise his role as Isaac from the game, while Kaitlyn Dever (<em>Booksmart</em>, <em>Justified</em>) will play Abby, a key character in the sequel.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052716#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052716&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, some links to the notorious shadow library Library Genesis (Libgen) couldn't be reached after a US district court judge, Colleen McMahon, <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cengage-v-LibGen-Default-Judgment-9-24-24.pdf">ordered</a> what TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-court-orders-libgen-to-pay-30m-to-publishers-issues-broad-injunction-240925/">called</a> "one of the broadest anti-piracy injunctions" ever issued by a US court.</p>
<p>In her order, McMahon sided with textbook publishers who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/most-notorious-illegal-shadow-library-sued-by-textbook-publishers/">accused Libgen of willful copyright infringement</a> after Libgen completely ignored their complaint.</p>
<p>To compensate rightsholders, McMahon ordered Libgen to pay $30 million, but because nobody knows who runs the shadow library, it seems unlikely that publishers will be paid any time soon, if ever.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052719#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052719&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>By the summer, Intel had tracked down one root cause of the problems and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/fix-for-intel-cpu-crashes-causes-minor-situational-slowdowns-requires-bios-update/">had released a microcode update to resolve it</a>: The CPUs were making “elevated voltage requests,” which could degrade performance and stability and damage the hardware over time. The company and motherboard makers released separate BIOS updates to fix the incorrect default power settings and the elevated voltage requests, but Intel said in August that it was still looking into other possible problems and fixes.</p>

<p>Today, the company is releasing what should be the final fix for the problem, which, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-finds-root-cause-of-cpu-crashing-and-instability-errors-prepares-new-and-final-microcode-update">as Tom's Hardware reports,</a> is a confluence of four issues: too-high motherboard defaults, a bug that kept some CPUs from downshifting when they were running too hot, a bug where CPUs were being given too much voltage for an extended period, and a bug where CPUs were given too much voltage when they were idle.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052674#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052674&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A 10th person has died in the nationwide <em>Listeria </em>outbreak connected to Boar's Head deli meats, which otherwise appears to be slowing, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24.html">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.</a></p>
<p>In an update about the outbreak on Wednesday, the CDC said that since its last update on August 28, only two new cases have been identified, bringing the outbreak's current total to 59 cases in 19 states. All 59 cases were hospitalized. One new death was reported in New York, bringing the total deaths to 10.</p>
<p>In an alert to the media, the agency noted that "Illness reports have started to decrease, and CDC will update this notice less frequently." However, the risk of more life-threatening infections is not yet over.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052717#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052717&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the last few years, large swaths of the game industry have embraced generative AI, both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/game-developer-survey-50-work-at-a-studio-already-using-generative-ai-tools/">on the development side</a> and for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/are-robloxs-new-ai-coding-and-art-tools-the-future-of-game-development/">new user-generated content tools</a>. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/12/nintendos-miyamoto-stepping-down-working-on-smaller-games/">legendary Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto</a> says his company "would rather go in a different direction" when it comes to AI technology.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html">a recent interview with The New York Times</a>, Miyamoto said this wasn't just contrarianism on Nintendo's part. “It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special,” Miyamoto said. “There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.”</p>
<p>Miyamoto's statement comes a few months after a more noncommittal position Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa took <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">in a July investor Q&amp;A</a>. "Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights," Furukawa said at the time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052651#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052651&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to hold Ralph de la Torre—the wealthy CEO of a now-bankrupt Steward hospital chain—in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/rich-ceo-of-failed-hospitals-could-face-prison-time-as-contempt-charges-advance/">contempt</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/ceo-of-health-care-terrorists-faces-contempt-charges-after-senate-no-show/?itm_source=parsely-api">failing to comply with a congressional subpoena</a>.</p>
<p>With the vote, the case is referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution for contempt of Congress, which would have de la Torre facing a fine of up to $100,000 and a prison sentence of up to 12 months if convicted.</p>
<p>The subpoena de la Torre rejected was a rare one issued in July by the Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP). The HELP committee, chaired by Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), aimed to compel de la Torre to testify on allegations that while he and other executives reaped millions from the hospital system, individual facilities were put under such dire financial strain that health care workers were forced to practice "third-world medicine," and outsiders described Steward leadership as "healthcare terrorists."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052657#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052657&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/">reported</a> that OpenAI is working on a plan to restructure its core business into a for-profit benefit corporation, moving away from control by its nonprofit board. The shift marks a dramatic change for the AI company behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, potentially making it more attractive to investors while raising questions about its commitment to sharing the benefits of advanced AI with "all of humanity," as written in its <a href="https://openai.com/charter/">charter</a>.</p>

<p>A for-profit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">benefit corporation</a> is a legal structure that allows companies to pursue both financial profits and social or environmental goals, ostensibly balancing shareholder interests with a broader mission to benefit society. It's an approach taken by some of OpenAI's competitors, such as Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI.</p>
<p>In a notable change under the new plan, CEO Sam Altman would receive equity in the for-profit company for the first time. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-25/openai-cto-mira-murati-says-she-will-leave-the-company">reports</a> that OpenAI is discussing giving Altman a 7 percent stake, though the exact details are still under negotiation. This represents a departure from Altman's previous stance of not taking equity in the company, which he had maintained was in line with OpenAI's mission to benefit humanity rather than individuals.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052614#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052614&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, it has never been clearer that the cycle of radical invention has given way to iterative updates—not just on an annual basis, but a monthly one, due to delayed features coming in later software updates during the iOS 18 cycle.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/iphone-15-and-15-pro-review-the-final-form/4/">final form of the smartphone as we know it</a> has been reached and nearly perfected. Nothing fundamental is changing anymore. But if you take the long view of just a few years, you can still see some impressive progress.</p>
<p>Year after year, the iPhone 16 is Apple’s most lightly iterative flagship phone release ever. But if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 13 or earlier, you’ll still feel like you’re graduating to a whole new experience.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052243#p3">Read 77 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052243&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
