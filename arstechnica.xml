              <![CDATA[<p>Uncertainty about the election getting to you? Is anxiety the dominant feature of your emotional landscape, maybe with a small sprinkling of impending doom?</p>
<p>You are not alone. A recent survey found that <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/stress-in-america/2024">69 percent of American adults are seriously stressed</a> about the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>It’s difficult not to be worked up about politics in today’s polarized climate. Regardless of which side of the political aisle you sit on, you may find yourself glued to your browser or TV, gobbling up every tiny tidbit of news and feeling your stress levels skyrocket.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/here-are-3-science-backed-strategies-to-rein-in-election-anxiety/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Some of my favorite games deny me the thing I think I want most. <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty.1482655/">Elden Ring</a> </em>refuses to provide manageable save files (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-ground-me-into-dust-which-is-why-i-recommend-it/#gsc.tab=0">I paid for it</a>). <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/balatro-arrives-on-phones-sept-26-so-plan-your-sick-days-accordingly/#gsc.tab=0"><em>Balatro</em></a> withholds the final math on each hand played (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-the-long-dark">its developer suggests avoiding calculators</a>). And the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review-a-world-worth-saving/">modern X-COM games</a> force me to realize just how much a 98 percent chance to hit is not the same as 100 percent.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379910/Dystopika/"><em>Dystopika</em></a> (Steam, Windows) is a city builder in maybe the strictest definition of that two-word descriptor, because it steadfastly refuses to distract you with non-building details. The game is described by its single developer, Matt Marshall, as having "No goals, no management, just creativity and dark cozy vibes."<em> Dystopika</em> does very little to explain how you should play it, because there's no optimal path for doing so. Your only job is to enjoy yourself, poking and prodding at a dark cyberpunk cityscape, making things that look interesting, pretty, grim, or however you like. It might seem restrictive, but it feels very freeing.</p>

<p>The game's interface is a small rail on the left side of the screen. Select "Building" and a random shape attaches to your cursor. You can right-click to change it, but you can't pick one. Place it, and then optionally place the cursor near its top to change its height. Making one building taller will raise smaller buildings nearby. Reaching certain heights, or densities, or something (it's not explained) will "unlock" certain new buildings, landmarks, and decorations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/dystopika-takes-all-the-management-out-of-a-cyberpunk-city-simulator/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fungi can be enigmatic organisms. Mushrooms or other structures may be visible above the soil, but beneath lurks a complex network of filaments, or hyphae, known as the mycelium. It is even possible for fungi to communicate through the mycelium—despite having no brain.</p>
<p>Other brainless life-forms (such as slime molds) have surprising ways of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/organism-without-a-brain-creates-external-memories-for-navigation/">navigating their surroundings</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/01/slime-mold-macdonald-farms-its-bacterial-meals/">surviving through communication</a>. Wanting to see whether fungi could recognize food in different arrangements, researchers from Tohoku University and Nagaoka College in Japan observed how the mycelial network of <i>Phanerochaete velutina,</i> a fungus that feeds off dead wood, grew on and around wood blocks arranged in different shapes.</p>
<p>The way the mycelial network spread out, along with its wood decay activity, differed based on the wood block arrangements. This suggests communication because the fungi appeared to find where the most nutrients were and grow in those areas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/fungi-may-not-think-but-they-can-communicate/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Old-school Apple fans probably remember a time, just before the iPhone became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/07/iphone-users-spend-147-hours-a-month-playing-games/">a massive gaming platform in its own right</a>, when Apple released a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/05/wicked-cool-apple-gaming-wednesday/">wide</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/09/5439/">range</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/12/peggle-and-bomberman-keep-the-good-ipod-gaming-times-flowin/">games</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/games-games-games-one-for-your-ipod-and-one-for-your-iphone/">designed</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/11/new-ipod-game-phase-rhythm-games-on-a-clickwheel-yippee/">late-model</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/09/tetris-ms-pac-man-sudoku-for-new-ipods-released/">clickwheel</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/07/game-review-song-summoner-the-unsing-heroes-ipod/">iPods</a>. While those clickwheel-controlled titles <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/looking-back-at-the-history-of-ipod-click-wheel-games/">didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire</a>, they represent an important historical stepping stone in Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/the-mac-gaming-console-time-has-forgot/">long journey</a> through the game industry.</p>
<p>Today, though, these clickwheel iPod games are on the verge of becoming lost media—impossible to buy or redownload from iTunes and protected on existing devices by incredibly strong Apple DRM. Now, the classic iPod community is engaged in <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject">a quest to preserve these games</a> in a way that will let enthusiasts enjoy these titles on real hardware for years to come.</p>
<h2>Perhaps too well-protected</h2>
<p>The short heyday of iPod clickwheel gaming ran from late 2006 to early 2009, when Apple partnered with major studios like Sega, Square Enix, and Electronic Arts to release 54 distinct titles for $7.49 each. By 2011, though, the rise of iOS gaming made these clickwheel iPod titles such an afterthought that Apple <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-removes-ipod-click-wheel-games-from-itunes-store/">completely removed them from the iTunes store</a>, years before the classic iPod line was discontinued for good in 2014.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, North Korea apparently completed a successful test of its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile, lofting it nearly 4,800 miles into space before the projectile fell back to Earth.</p>
<p>This solid-fueled, multi-stage missile, named the Hwasong-19, is a new tool in North Korea's increasingly sophisticated arsenal of weapons. It has enough range—perhaps as much as 9,320 miles (15,000 kilometers), according to Japan's government—to strike targets anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>The test flight of the Hwasong-19 on Thursday was North Korea's first test of a long-range missile in nearly a year, coming as North Korea deploys some 10,000 troops inside Russia just days before the US presidential election. US officials condemned the missile launch as a "provocative and destabilizing" action in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/in-exchange-for-troops-in-ukraine-russian-aid-to-north-korea-may-extend-to-space/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hackers working on behalf of the Chinese government are using a botnet of thousands of routers, cameras, and other Internet-connected devices to perform highly evasive password spray attacks against users of Microsoft’s Azure cloud service, the company warned Thursday.</p>
<p>The malicious network, made up almost entirely of TP-Link routers, was first documented in October 2023 by a researcher who named it <a href="link">Botnet-7777</a>. The geographically dispersed collection of more than 16,000 compromised devices at its peak got its name because it exposes its malicious malware on port 7777.</p>
<h2>Account compromise at scale</h2>
<p>In July and again in August of this year, security researchers from <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/solving-the-7777-botnet-enigma-a-cybersecurity-quest/">Serbia</a> and <a href="https://www.team-cymru.com/post/botnet-7777-are-you-betting-on-a-compromised-router">Team Cymru</a> reported the botnet was still operational. All three reports said that Botnet-7777 was being used to skillfully perform password spraying, a form of attack that sends large numbers of login attempts from many different IP addresses. Because each individual device limits the login attempts, the carefully coordinated account-takeover campaign is hard to detect by the targeted service.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/microsoft-warns-of-8000-strong-botnet-used-in-password-spraying-attacks/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Starlink's home Internet service has come to the National Radio Quiet Zone after a multi-year engineering project that had the goal of minimizing interference with radio telescopes. Starlink operator SpaceX began "a one-year assessment period to offer residential satellite Internet service to 99.5% of residents within the NRQZ starting October 25," the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and Green Bank Observatory <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/over-99-5-of-residents-in-the-national-radio-quiet-zone-can-now-receive-satellite-internet-service/">announced last week</a>.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of people within the areas of Virginia and West Virginia collectively known as the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) can now receive high speed satellite Internet service," the announcement said. "The newly available service is the result of a nearly three-year collaborative engineering effort between the US National Science Foundation (NSF), SpaceX, and the NSF National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NSF NRAO), which operates the NSF Green Bank Observatory (NSF GBO) in West Virginia within the NRQZ."</p>
<p>There's a controversy over the 0.5 percent of residents who aren't included and are said to be newly blocked from using the <a href="https://www.starlink.com/us/roam">Starlink Roam</a> service. Starlink markets Roam as a service for people to use while traveling, not as a fixed home Internet service.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/starlink-enters-national-radio-quiet-zone-but-reportedly-cut-off-access-for-some/">Read full article</a></p>

      Jude Law stars as Force-user Jod Na Nawood in <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>It's no secret that the new spinoff series, <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew,</em> was inspired by the 1985 film <em>The Goonies</em>. Executive Producer Kathleen Kennedy (who co-produced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies"><em>The Goonies</em></a>) has publicly confirmed as much. The latest trailer really leans into that influence: The series feels like something not created specifically for kids, but rather telling a story that just happens to be about kids going on an adventure.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/jude-laws-jedi-befriends-kids-lost-in-space-in-star-wars-skeleton-crew-trailer/">previously reported</a>, the eight-episode standalone series is set in the same timeframe as <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>Ahsoka</em>. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Skeleton Crew</em> follows the journey of four kids who make a mysterious discovery on their seemingly safe home planet, then get lost in a strange and dangerous galaxy, crossing paths with the likes of Jod Na Nawood, the mysterious character played by [Jude] Law. Finding their way home—and meeting unlikely allies and enemies—will be a greater adventure than they ever imagined.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jude Law leads the cast as the quick-witted and charming (per Law) "Force-user" Jod Na Nawood. Ravi Cabot-Conyers plays Wim, Ryan Kiera Armstrong plays Fern, Kyriana Kratter plays KB, and Robert Timothy Smith plays Neil. Nick Frost will voice a droid named SM 33, the first mate of a spaceship called the <em>Onyx Cylinder</em>. The cast also includes Fred Tatasciore as Brutus, Jaleel White as Gunther, Mike Estes as Pax, Marti Matulis as Vane, and Dale Soules as Chaelt. Tunde Adebimpe and Kerry Condon will appear in as-yet-undisclosed roles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/new-skeleton-crew-trailer-really-channels-the-goonies/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Humane’s AI Pin was already struggling to take off, but the company's troubles deepened on Thursday as it recalled the product's portable charging case.</p>
<p>Humane released the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-a-700-voice-command-box-definitely-wont-replace-your-phone/">AI Pin</a> in April 2024. It’s a lapel pin that features an integrated camera and speaker, AI voice assistant, and laser projector. The device launched at a $700 starting price before dropping to $500 in June. The AI Pin also requires a subscription ($24 per month without fees). The wearable lacks a screen or app support, and despite marketing claims that it could replace smartphones, initial <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review">reviews</a> of the product were abysmal (YouTuber Marques Brownlee famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA">dubbed</a> the pin "The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed").</p>
<p>The AI Pin's wireless Charge Case Accessory is sold separately; it differs from the home charging dock included with the AI Pin, which isn't impacted by this week's recall. The Charge Case Accessory is charged via USB-C.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/charger-recall-spells-more-bad-news-for-humanes-maligned-ai-pin/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Many species of bats use echolocation to avoid obstacles like tree branches and hunt small insects as they fly through the dark. But it turns out echolocation for bats is much more than just a short-range obstacle-avoidance and prey-targeting system. A recent study shows that one species of bats can stitch together thousands upon thousands of sound signatures into acoustic maps they use to successfully navigate several kilometers over their hunting grounds. The maps work even if the bats are completely blindfolded.</p>
<h2>Blindfolded bats</h2>
<p>“What echolocating bats do is they emit sounds, ultrasonic or not, and use the characteristics of the reflected echo to sense objects they have in front of them. We wanted to know if they use it for large-scale navigation. Most people think, 'Of course they do,' but the reality is we didn’t know that,” says Aya Goldshtein, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany. Goldshtein collaborated with scientists at Tel Aviv University on a study of how a species of bats called Kuhl’s pipistrelle navigate in their natural environment.</p>
<p>There were several reasons that navigation via echolocation wasn’t obvious at all. For starters, echolocation is hopelessly limited when it comes to range. Bats can use it to sense objects that are at most a few dozen meters away. It’s a tool closer to an ultrasonic parking sensor in a car than to a long-distance sonar in a submarine. It is also not omnidirectional. The cone of coverage bats get from echolocation is usually a maximum of 120 degrees, although they can modulate it to an extent, depending on the shape of their mouths.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/bats-use-echolocation-to-make-mental-maps-for-navigation/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Humans who think they can multitask while sitting at the wheel of a moving car continue to be a problem—one that claimed more than 3,300 lives in 2022, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The problem is almost entirely down to our smartphones—while we know they're distracting, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/put-the-phone-down-new-studies-show-were-still-bad-at-distracted-driving/">too many drivers</a> just can't help checking that email when they shouldn't. Now <a href="https://distracted-driving-simulator.quanata.com/#home">a new online tool</a> provides an easy way to grasp just how much of the road we can miss while playing with that phone.</p>
<p>The distracted driving tool was developed by Quanta, a "context-based insurance provider," which wants to raise awareness of the problem. "Quanata’s technology aims to create a future where risk-informed choices enable safer drivers and better lives. We recognize that a lot of the danger on our roads is caused by distracted driving and we want to help minimize that," said Jim Ryan, SVP of business development at Quanta.</p>
<p>The tests include preparing a text message while your car drives at 70 mph and then a comparison of reaction times at 70 mph when concentrating on the task of driving versus trying to assemble an order in a fast food app.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/distracted-driving-simulator-shows-why-you-shouldnt-text-on-the-highway/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Language models seem to treat "masculine and White concepts... as the 'default' value."]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Anyone familiar with HR practices probably knows of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1243713272/resume-bias-study-white-names-black-names">the decades of studies</a> showing that résumé with Black- and/or female-presenting names at the top get fewer callbacks and interviews than those with white- and/or male-presenting names—even if the rest of the résumé is identical. A new study shows those same kinds of biases also show up when large language models are used to evaluate résumés instead of humans.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/article/view/31748/33915">a new paper</a> published during last month's <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/issue/view/609">AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics and Society</a>, two University of Washington researchers ran hundreds of publicly available résumés and job descriptions through three different Massive Text Embedding (MTE) models. These models—based on the Mistal-7B LLM—had each been fine-tuned with slightly different sets of data to improve on the base LLM's abilities in "representational tasks including document retrieval, classification, and clustering," according to the researchers, and had achieved "state-of-the-art performance" in <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb">the MTEB benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than asking for precise term matches from the job description or evaluating via a prompt (e.g., "does this résumé fit the job description?"), the researchers used the MTEs to generate embedded relevance scores for each résumé and job description pairing. To measure potential bias, the résuméwere first run through the MTEs without any names (to check for reliability) and were then run again with various names that achieved high racial and gender "distinctiveness scores" based on their actual use across groups in the general population. The top 10 percent of résumés that the MTEs judged as most similar for each job description were then analyzed to see if the names for any race or gender groups were chosen at higher or lower rates than expected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/study-ais-prefer-white-male-names-on-resumes-just-like-humans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Microsoft launched its Copilot+ AI PC initiative over the summer, one of the flagship features was Recall, a feature that would log months' worth of your PC usage, with the stated goal of helping you remember things you did and find them again. But if you've heard of Recall, it's probably because of the problems that surfaced in preview builds of Windows before the feature could launch: It <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned/">stored all of its data in plaintext</a>, and it was relatively trivial for other users on the PC (or for malicious software) to access the database and screenshots, potentially exposing huge amounts of user data.</p>
<p>Microsoft was supposed to launch Recall over the summer but delayed the feature to rework it. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/microsoft-details-security-privacy-overhaul-for-windows-recall-ahead-of-relaunch/">went into detail</a> on the new version of Recall's security protections in late September, declaring that a preview would be ready in time for Windows Insider Program testers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/microsoft-will-try-the-data-scraping-windows-recall-feature-again-in-october/">in October</a>. Now that we're past October, Microsoft has officially announced that the Recall preview is being delayed yet again and that it will begin rolling out to testers in December.</p>
<p>“We are committed to delivering a secure and trusted experience with Recall. To ensure we deliver on these important updates, we’re taking additional time to refine the experience before previewing it with Windows Insiders,” said Microsoft Windows Insider Senior Program Manager Brandon LeBlanc in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284572/microsoft-recall-delay-december-windows-insider-testing">a statement provided to The Verge</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-delays-rollout-of-the-windows-11-recall-feature-yet-again/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Becky Carroll was missing a few teeth, others were stained or crooked. Ashamed, she smiled with lips pressed closed. Her dentist offered to fix most of her teeth with root canals and crowns, Carroll said, but she was wary of traveling a long road of dental work.</p>
<p>Then Carroll saw a TV commercial for another path: ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers. The company advertises that it can give patients “<a href="https://www.clearchoice.com/why-clearchoice/one-day-dental-implants/">a new smile in as little as one day</a>” by surgically replacing teeth instead of fixing them.</p>
<p>So Carroll saved and borrowed for the surgery, she said. In an interview and a lawsuit, Carroll said that at a ClearChoice clinic in New Jersey in 2021, she agreed to pay $31,000 to replace all her natural upper teeth with pearly white prosthetic ones. What came next, Carroll said, was “like a horror movie.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/more-dentists-are-pulling-healthy-teeth-to-sell-pricy-implants-experts-warn/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Boeing's Starliner spacecraft safely landed empty in the New Mexico desert about eight weeks ago, marking a hollow end to the company's historic first human spaceflight. The vehicle's passengers during its upward flight to the International Space Station earlier this summer, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, remain in space, awaiting a ride home on SpaceX's Crew Dragon.</p>
<p>Boeing has been steadfastly silent about the fate of Starliner since then. Two senior officials, including Boeing's leader of human spaceflight, John Shannon, were originally due to attend a post-landing news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston. However, just minutes before the news conference was to begin, two seats were removed—the Boeing officials were no-shows.</p>
<p>In lieu of speaking publicly, Boeing issued a terse statement early on the morning of September 8, attributing it to Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's commercial crew program. "We will review the data and determine the next steps for the program," Nappi said, in part.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/nearly-two-months-after-starliners-return-boeing-remains-mum-on-its-future/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.18 of the Rocket Report! One of the most intriguing bits of news this week is the rolling of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket out to its launch complex in Florida. With two months remaining in 2024, will the company make owner Jeff Bezos' deadline for getting to orbit this year? We'll have to see, as the Rocket Report is not prepared to endorse any timelines at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>ESA selects four companies for reusable launch</strong>. The European Space Agency announced this week the selection of Rocket Factory Augsburg, The Exploration Company, ArianeGroup, and Isar Aerospace to develop reusable rocket technology, <a href="https://europeanspaceflight.com/esa-selects-four-companies-to-develop-reusable-rocket-technology/">European Spaceflight reports</a>. The four awardees are divided into two initiatives focused on the development of reusable rocket technology: the Technologies for High-thrust Reusable Space Transportation (THRUST!) project and the Boosters for European Space Transportation (BEST!) project. The awarded companies will now begin contract negotiations with ESA to further develop and test their solutions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/rocket-report-new-glenn-shows-out-ula-acknowledges-some-fairing-issues/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The European Commission announced Thursday it plans to sign a contract with the continent's leading space companies before the end of the year to begin development of a 290-satellite broadband Internet network estimated to cost more than 10 billion euros (about $10.9 billion).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/iris2-european-commission-awards-concession-contract-spacerise-consortium-2024-10-31_en">press release announcing the contract award</a> to IRIS²—known as Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite—did not specify the financial details of the agreement, but European media has widely reported the 10 billion euro cost. The commission's decision follows an evaluation of the best-and-final offer from the SpaceRISE consortium formed by European satellite network operators SES, Eutelsat, and Hispasat.</p>
<h2>We’ll do it ourselves</h2>
<p>The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/europes-major-satellite-players-line-up-to-build-starlink-competitor/">managing the IRIS² program</a>, which will also receive funding from the European Space Agency and European industry in a public-private partnership. European governments previously expected to provide around 60 percent of the funding for the initiative. Under that plan, European industry would supply roughly 40 percent of the money in a public-private partnership. The specifics of the final cost-sharing arrangement were not available Thursday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/finally-a-sign-of-life-for-europes-sovereign-satellite-internet-constellation/">Read full article</a></p>
