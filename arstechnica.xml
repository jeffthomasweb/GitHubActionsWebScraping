<p>The first Long March 12A rocket, roughly the same height and diameter of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center at 9:00 pm EST Monday (02:00 UTC Tuesday).</p>
<p>Less than 10 minutes later, rocket's methane-fueled first stage booster hurtled through the atmosphere at supersonic speed, impacting in a remote region about 200 miles downrange from the Jiuquan spaceport in northwestern China. The booster failed to complete a braking burn to slow down for landing at a prepared location near the edge of the Gobi Desert.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/china-just-carried-out-its-second-reusable-launch-attempt-in-three-weeks/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[It's purportedly the first of four planned teasers, one per week, showing before <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5rps3Hy73k?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>You've no doubt heard some version of the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43816/to-a-mouse-56d222ab36e33">Robert Burns adage</a> about the best-laid plans. Marvel Studios had an elaborate marketing plan in place to introduce four teaser trailers for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> as previews prior to screenings of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>, with one teaser rolling out each successive week. But the first one leaked online a few days early, revealing that (as rumored) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter.</p>
<p>So maybe you've seen a bootleg version floating around the Internet, but Marvel has now released the HD version to the public. Merry Christmas! And we can look forward to three more: one focused on Thor, one on Doctor Doom, and the final one is purportedly a more traditional teaser trailer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/robert-downey-jr-returns-to-mcu-as-doctor-doom-in-two-new-avengers-movies/">previously reported</a>, Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (<em>The Kang Dynasty</em>) around Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror (and associated variants), introduced in <em>Loki</em> and <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>. But then Majors was convicted of domestic violence, and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/steve-rogers-returns-in-avengers-doomsday-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Monday, the FCC added drones to its <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/supplychain/coveredlist">Covered List</a>, which it says are communications equipment and services “that are deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons.” The list was already populated by Kaspersky, ZTE, Huawei, and others.</p>

The NCMEC’s CyberTipline is a Congressionally authorized clearinghouse for reporting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other forms of child exploitation.</p>
<p>Companies are required by law to report <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-using-sora-2-to-make-child-fetish-content/">apparent child exploitation</a> to the CyberTipline. When a company sends a report, NCMEC reviews it and then forwards it to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation.</p>
<p>Statistics related to NCMEC reports can be nuanced. Increased reports can sometimes indicate changes in a platform’s automated moderation, or the criteria it uses to decide whether a report is necessary, rather than necessarily indicating an increase in nefarious activity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openais-child-exploitation-reports-increased-sharply-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CBS cannot contain the online spread of a "60 Minutes" segment that its editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, tried to block from airing.</p>
<p>The episode, "Inside CECOT," featured testimonies from US deportees who were tortured or suffered physical or sexual abuse at a notorious Salvadoran prison, the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism. "Welcome to hell," one former inmate was told upon arriving, the segment reported, while also highlighting a clip of Donald Trump praising CECOT and its leadership for “great facilities, very strong facilities, and they don’t play games."</p>
<p>Weiss controversially pulled the segment on Monday, claiming it could not air in the US because it lacked critical voices, as no Trump officials were interviewed. She claimed that the segment "did not advance the ball" and merely echoed others' reporting, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cbs-news-el-salvador-cecot-prison-sharyn-alfonsi-bari-weiss-rcna250618">reported</a>. Her plan was to air the segment when it was "ready," insisting that holding stories "for whatever reason" happens "every day in every newsroom."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/yo-what-limewire-re-emerges-in-online-rush-to-share-pulled-60-minutes-segment/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There's still another couple of months before the 2026 crop of F1 cars takes to the track for the first preseason test. It's a year of big change for the sport, which is adopting new power unit rules that place much more emphasis on the electric motor's contribution. The switch to the new power units was meant to attract new manufacturers to the sport, and in that regard, it has succeeded. But controversy has erupted already as loopholes appear and teams exploit them.</p>
<p>Since 2014, F1 cars have used 1,000 hp (745 kW) power units that combine a turbocharged 1.6 L V6 gasoline engine with a pair of hybrid systems. One is the MGU-H, which recovers energy from (or deploys it to) the turbocharger's turbine; the other is a 160 hp (120 kW) MGU-K that harvests and deploys energy at the rear wheels. Starting next year, the MGU-H is gone, and the less-powerful 1.6 L V6 should generate about 536 hp (400 kW). That will be complemented by a 483 hp (350 kW) MGU-K, plus a much larger battery to supply it.</p>
<p>And the new rules have already attracted new OEMs to the sport. After announcing its departure at the end of 2021—sort of— Honda changed its mind and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/perfecting-hondas-2026-f1-powertrain-is-not-so-easy-says-racing-boss/">signed on to the 2026 regs</a>, supplying Aston Martin. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/audi-goes-full-minimalism-for-its-first-ever-formula-1-livery/">Audi signed up</a> and bought the Sauber team. Red Bull decided to build its own internal combustion engines, hiring heavily from the Mercedes program, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/ford-will-return-to-f1-in-2026-as-an-engine-builder/">Ford is providing Red Bull</a> with the MGU-K and the rest of the hybrid system. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/cadillac-f1-will-be-able-to-race-from-2026-despite-previous-snub/">Cadillac</a> has started an engine program, albeit one that won't take the grid until 2029.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/f1s-new-engines-are-causing-consternation-over-compression-ratios/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since I’m fascinated by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/samsungs-micro-rgb-tv-proves-the-value-of-rgb-backlights-for-premium-displays/">new</a> display <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/hdr10-advanced-joins-dolby-vision-2-in-trying-to-make-you-like-motion-smoothing/">technologies</a> and by improving image quality, I’ve never been a fan of home projectors. Projectors lack the image quality compared to good TVs and monitors, and they’re pretty needy. Without getting into the specific requirements of different models, you generally want a darker room with a large, blank wall for a projector to look its best. That can be a lot to ask for, especially in small, densely decorated homes like mine.</p>
<p>That said, a projector can be a space-efficient alternative to a big-screen TV or help you watch TV or movies outside. A projector can be versatile when paired with the right space, especially if that projector makes sure the “right space” is included in the device.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arovia.com/products/splay-the-ultimate-2-in-1-expandable-display-ultra-short-throw-projector-solution?srsltid=AfmBOorUqjtA0JXHkKaNhYH1bz9oPH3SfFEfMBbSuXndKI3LSj5-JlPR">The Splay </a>was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/splaydisplay/splay-display">crowdfunded in 2021</a>, and its maker, Arovia, describes it as the “first fully collapsible monitor and projector.” In short, it’s a portable projector with an integrated fabric shroud that can serve as a big-screen (24.5 or 34.5 inches diagonally, depending on the model) portable monitor. Or, you can take off the fabric shroud and use the Splay as an ultra-short-throw projector and cast a display that measures up to 80 inches diagonally onto a wall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/the-splay-is-a-subpar-monitor-but-an-exciting-portable-projector/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tory Bruno, a veteran engineer and aerospace industry executive, has resigned from the top job at United Launch Alliance after more than a decade competing against the growing dominance of SpaceX, the company announced Monday.</p>
<p>The news of Bruno's sudden resignation was unexpected. His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA's market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/ulas-vulcan-rocket-shot-for-the-moon-on-debut-launch-and-hit-a-bullseye/">successful debut of ULA's Vulcan rocket</a>, followed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/ula-aimed-to-launch-up-to-10-vulcan-rockets-this-year-it-will-fly-just-once/">struggles to ramp up</a> the new rocket's launch cadence.</p>
<p>Bruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin's ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA's leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/in-a-surprise-announcement-tory-bruno-is-out-as-ceo-of-united-launch-alliance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the better part of two months last year, most of us had no idea how serious the problems were with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft docked at the International Space Station. A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA's workforce.</p>
<p>On its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing's Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.</p>
<p>The Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore <a href="http://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/the-harrowing-story-of-what-flying-starliner-was-like-when-its-thrusters-failed/">lost his ability to control</a> the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/safety-panel-says-nasa-should-have-taken-starliner-incident-more-seriously/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The world's largest shadow library—which is increasingly funded by AI developers—shocked the Internet this weekend by <a href="https://annas-archive.li/blog/backing-up-spotify.html">announcing</a> it had "backed up Spotify" and started distributing 300 terabytes of metadata and music files in bulk torrents.</p>
<p>According to Anna's Archive, the data grab represents more than 99 percent of listens on Spotify, making it "the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks." It's also "the world’s first 'preservation archive' for music which is fully open," with 86 million music files, the archive boasted.</p>
<p>The music files supposedly represent about 37 percent of songs available on Spotify as of July 2025. The scraped files were prioritized by popularity, with Anna's Archive weeding out many songs that are never streamed or are of poor quality, such as AI-generated songs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the US Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-protects-us-national-security-pausing-offshore-wind-leases">announced</a> that it was pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the US. The move comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. In what appears to be an attempt to avoid legal scrutiny, the Interior is blaming the decisions on a classified report from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The second Trump administration announced its animosity toward offshore wind power <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/">literally on day one</a>, issuing an executive order on inauguration day that called for a temporary halt to issuing permits for new projects pending a re-evaluation. Earlier this month, however, a judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trumps-order-blocking-wind-development-thrown-out-by-court/">vacated that executive order</a>, noting that the government has shown no indication that it was even attempting to start the re-evaluation it said was needed.</p>
<p>But a number of projects have gone through the entire permitting process, and construction has started. Before today, the administration had attempted to stop these in an erratic, halting manner. Empire Wind, an 800 MW farm being built off New York, was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/us-interior-secretary-orders-offshore-wind-project-shut-down/">stopped by the Department of the Interior</a>, which alleged that it had been rushed through permitting. That <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">hold was lifted</a> following lobbying and negotiations by New York and the project developer Orsted, and the Department of the Interior never revealed why it changed its mind. When the Interior Department blocked a second Orsted project, Revolution Wind offshore of southern New England, the company took the government to court and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">won a ruling</a> that let it continue construction.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/us-government-finds-new-excuse-to-stop-construction-of-offshore-wind/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Director Christopher Nolan won two well-deserved Oscars for 2023's <em>Oppenheimer</em>, and Hollywood was soon buzzing about what his next project might be. A vampire period piece, perhaps? Or maybe a reboot of 1983's <em>Blue Thunder</em> or British 1960s spy series <em>The Prisoner</em>? Instead, Nolan chose to adapt one of the greatest epic sagas in history: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">Homer's <em>Odyssey</em></a>. At long last, Universal has released the first official trailer for Nolan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey_(2026_film)"><em>The Odyssey</em></a>, starring Matt Damon as the wandering Ithacan king. Frankly, it looks appropriately epic.</p>
<p>Most of us read some version of <em>The Odyssey</em> in high school, so we're familiar with the story: Odysseus, legendary Greek king of Ithaca, begins the long journey home after 10 years of fighting in the Trojan War. (We actually catch a glimpse of the famous Trojan horse in the trailer.) But the journey does not go smoothly, as Odysseus and his men encounter the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, and an enchantress named Circe, among other obstacles. Meanwhile, his long-suffering wife Penelope is warding off hundreds of suitors eager to usurp Odysseus' position.</p>
<p>It's difficult to overestimate the tremendous influence Homer's epic has had on global culture. Nolan himself recalled seeing the <em>Odyssey</em> performed as a school play when he was just 5 or 6 years old. "I remember the Sirens and him being strapped to the mast and things like that," he recently told Empire. "I think it's in all of us, really. And when you start to break down the text and adapt it, you find that all of these other films—and all the films I've worked on—you know, they're all from the <i>Odyssey</i>. It's foundational."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/odyssey-trailer-brings-the-myth-to-vivid-life/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple was hit with a $115 million fine Monday after Italy's competition authority alleged the tech giant was abusing its dominant position to harm third-party developers in its App Store.</p>
<p>In a <a href="ttps://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2025/12/A561">press release</a>, the Italian Competition Authority said that an "App Tracking Transparency" (ATT) privacy policy that Apple introduced in 2021 forced third-party developers to seek consent twice for the same data collection.</p>
<p>Requiring such "double consent" was "extremely burdensome" and "harmful" to some developers—especially the smallest developers, the regulator <a href="https://en.agcm.it/dotcmsdoc/pressrelease/A561_SUMMARY.pdf">said</a>. Many developers struggled to earn ad revenue after the policy was introduced, as users increasingly declined to opt into personalized ads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/apple-hit-with-115m-for-extremely-burdensome-app-store-privacy-policy/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>NASA's first astronauts who will fly by the moon in more than 50 years participated in a practice launch countdown on Saturday, December 20, including taking their first trip on a transport vehicle steeped in almost the entire span of US space history—from Apollo through to the ongoing commercial crew program.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>San Francisco was affected by <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/pg-e-outage-40-000-customers-without-power-21254326.php">a massive power outage</a> over the weekend. It started with a fire at a substation in the city on Saturday afternoon, causing a blackout that at times affected as much as a third of the city, leaving more than 130,000 homes without power. Among the city's affected critical systems were the traffic lights, which paralyzed Waymo's fleet of robotaxis, stopping them in their tracks and clogging traffic.</p>
<p>Any recent visitor to San Francisco can't help but notice the profusion of sensor-festooned autonomous vehicles on the roads, especially the all-white Jaguar I-Paces that belong to Waymo. The robotaxi company has more than 800 AVs in its Bay Area fleet; that can feel like a conservative estimate when you see five or six at a time—invariably with no occupants—within a block.</p>
<p>The cars navigate the city, combining high-resolution maps with inputs from lidar, optical, and other sensors on the upfitted Jags. The cars drive conservatively, but they can get confused in edge cases—earlier this month, Waymo <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/06/nx-s1-5635614/waymo-school-buses-recall">issued a recall</a> to fix a problem in which its robotaxis would illegally pass stopped school buses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/power-outage-paralyzes-waymo-robotaxis-when-traffic-lights-go-out/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Before he became chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr seemed to be a big believer in the agency's role as an independent branch of the federal government. According to the pre-2025 version of Brendan Carr, the White House interfered with the agency's independence when a Democratic president publicly urged the FCC to adopt net neutrality rules.</p>
<p>When the Biden-era FCC reinstated Obama-era net neutrality rules in 2024, <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-52A3.pdf">Carr alleged</a> that President Biden "took the extraordinary step to pressure the FCC—an independent agency that is designed to operate outside undue political influence from the Executive Branch." As evidence, Carr pointed to a <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">2021 executive order</a> in which Biden called on agency heads to "consider using their authorities" for various types of pro-competitive policies, including the adoption of net neutrality rules.</p>
<p>Carr said that President Obama similarly "pressure[d] an independent agency into grabbing power that the Legislative Branch never said it had delegated." Obama's intrusion into this independence, according to Carr, came in November 2014 when the president released a two-minute video <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/11/obama-urges-fcc-to-regulate-broadband-as-a-utility/">urging the agency</a> to implement net neutrality rules and reclassify broadband providers as common carriers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/no-one-loves-president-trump-more-than-fcc-chairman-brendan-carr/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p class="article-subhead">Caroline Muller looks at clouds differently than most people. Where others may see puffy marshmallows, wispy cotton candy or thunderous gray objects storming overhead, Muller sees fluids flowing through the sky. She visualizes how air rises and falls, warms and cools, and spirals and swirls to form clouds and create storms.</p>
<p>But the urgency with which Muller, a climate scientist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, considers such atmospheric puzzles has surged in recent years. As our planet swelters with global warming, storms are becoming more intense, sometimes dumping two or even three times more rain than expected. Such was the case in Bahía Blanca, Argentina, in March 2025: Almost half the city’s yearly average rainfall fell in less than 12 hours, causing deadly floods.</p>
<p>Atmospheric scientists have long used computer simulations to track how the dynamics of air and moisture might produce varieties of storms. But existing models hadn’t fully explained the emergence of these fiercer storms. A roughly 200-year-old theory describes how warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air: an extra 7 percent for every degree Celsius of warming. But in models and weather observations, climate scientists have seen rainfall events far exceeding this expected increase. And those storms can lead to severe flooding when heavy rain falls on already saturated soils or follows humid heatwaves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/when-clouds-flock-together/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>'Tis the season for all kinds of festive titles to start appearing in our to-watch queues. For folks who celebrate Christmas in any form, there are a million different movies and TV specials vying for your attention. There are the beloved favorites that we'll make the time to revisit year after year, plus the seemingly endless number of new titles arriving on the various streaming services this season.</p>
<p>But in all honesty, most of these movies are made for and by the mainstream. So if you don't want a broad family slapstick or yet another big city girl going back to her small town to learn the meaning of Christmas, here are a few options to bring some geekiness to your screen. Make the season nerdy and bright!</p>
<h2>Let's get it out of the way immediately: <em>Star Wars Holiday Special</em></h2>
<p>It's almost too bizarre to be believed, but yes, this was a thing that existed, and it lives on in legend. The cast of <em>Star Wars</em> returned for this TV special, where the gang goes to the Wookie planet Kashyyyk to celebrate Life Day. They're joined by some surprising guests. <em>Golden Girls</em> icon Bea Arthur is in it alongside The Honeymooners' Art Carney, acclaimed multi-disciplinary performer Diahann Carroll, and the band Jefferson Starship.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/12/discworld-daleks-and-deep-13-a-geeky-holiday-tv-and-movie-watchlist/">Read full article</a></p>
