                            <![CDATA[<p>While tech companies market AI as a productivity tool for everyone, a UK government study reveals an unexpected result: Neurodiverse employees may be benefiting far more from chatbots than their neurotypical colleagues.</p>
<p>The UK's Department for Business and Trade recently <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68adbe409e1cebdd2c96a19d/dbt-microsoft-365-copilot-evaluation.pdf">released</a> evaluation results from its Microsoft 365 Copilot trial showing that while overall satisfaction was 72 percent, neurodiverse employees reported statistically higher satisfaction (at a 90 percent confidence level) and were more likely to recommend the tool (at a 95 percent confidence level) than other respondents.</p>
<p>"It's leveled the playing field," one participant with ADHD told researchers during follow-up interviews. One user with dyslexia said that the tool "empowered" them to perform tasks with confidence they previously lacked, particularly in report writing. Another dyslexic participant drew direct comparisons to existing accessibility software, noting that Copilot "does a hell of a lot more" than traditional assistive technology while being "embedded in your applications" rather than requiring separate programs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/study-finds-neurodiverse-workers-more-satisfied-with-ai-assistants/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hackers planted malicious code in open source software packages with more than 2 billion weekly updates in what is likely to be the world’s biggest supply-chain attack ever.</p>
<p>The attack, which compromised nearly two dozen packages hosted on the npm repository, came to public notice on Monday in <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@derekheld/115169311485030806">social</a> <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/115169391665497997">media</a> posts. Around the same time, Josh Junon, a maintainer or co-maintainer of the affected packages, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bad-at-computer.bsky.social/post/3lydioq5swk2y">said</a> he had been “pwned” after falling for an email that claimed his account on the platform would be closed unless he logged in to a site and updated his two-factor authentication credentials.</p>
<h2>Defeating 2FA the easy way</h2>
<p>“Sorry everyone, I should have paid more attention,” Junon, who uses the moniker Qix, wrote. “Not like me; have had a stressful week. Will work to get this cleaned up.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/software-packages-with-more-than-2-billion-weekly-downloads-hit-in-supply-chain-attack/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, Meta has blanketed TV screens around the world with commercials touting the privacy of Whatsapp, its encrypted messenger with a monthly user base of 3 billion people.</p>
<p>“It’s private,” one <a href="link">ad</a> campaign featuring the former cast of the <em>Modern Family</em> TV show says. “On Whatsapp, no one can see or hear your personal messages … not even us,” a different series of ads declares.</p>
<h2>“Serious risks to user data”</h2>
<p>On Monday, the former head of security for the Meta-owed messaging app filed a federal whistleblower lawsuit that tells a far different narrative. The suit, filed in US District Court for the District of Northern California, recites a litany of purported security and privacy flaws that Meta not only didn’t fix after becoming aware of them, but also kept secret, allegedly in violation of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/ftc-fines-facebook-5-billion-imposes-new-privacy-oversight/">$5 billion settlement</a> then-Whatsapp parent company Facebook reached with the Federal Trade Commission.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Is the web thriving or faltering? Google has an unexpected take in a new legal filing. Google is heading back to court soon in hopes of convincing a judge that it should not have to split up its ad business. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/google-loses-ad-tech-monopoly-trial-faces-additional-breakups/">lost its adtech antitrust case</a> earlier this year, and now it's up to the court to decide on remedies for the illegal conduct. In its response to the Department of Justice's requested remedies, Google made a startling claim: "The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline."</p>
<p>Google says that forcing it to divest its AdX marketplace would hasten the demise of wide swaths of the web that are dependent on advertising revenue. This is one of several reasons Google asks the court to deny the government's request. The DOJ also tried to force a divestment of Chrome in the search antitrust trial, but the judge in that case <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-rules/">declined to order that</a> in the remedies.</p>
<p>Google's advertising business has turned it into an unrivaled Internet juggernaut. Google increasingly is the Internet—websites have no choice but to adhere to Google's standards for search and ads because there's no substantial competition. The court in this case ruled that in tying its display ad services with the AdX marketplace, Google suppressed the adoption of rival technologies, and this gave it an opportunity to preference its own services in ad auctions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/in-court-filing-google-concedes-the-open-web-is-in-rapid-decline/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist and former Caltech president David Baltimore—who found himself at the center of controversial allegations of fraud against a co-author—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/07/science/david-baltimore-dead.html">has died</a> at 87 from cancer complications. He shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology for his work upending the then-consensus that cellular information flowed only in one direction. Baltimore is survived by his wife of 57 years, biologist Alice Huang, as well as a daughter and granddaughter.</p>
<p>"David Baltimore's contributions as a virologist, discerning fundamental mechanisms and applying those insights to immunology, to cancer, to AIDS, have transformed biology and medicine," current Caltech President Thomas F. Rosenbaum said in a statement. "David's profound influence as a mentor to generations of students and postdocs, his generosity as a colleague, his leadership of great scientific institutions, and his deep involvement in international efforts to define ethical boundaries for biological advances fill out an extraordinary intellectual life."</p>
<p>Baltimore was born in New York City in 1938. His father worked in the garment industry, and his mother later became a psychologist at the New School and Sarah Lawrence. Young David was academically precocious and decided he wanted to be a scientist after spending a high school summer learning about mouse genetics at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine. He graduated from Swarthmore College and earned his PhD in biology from Rockefeller University in 1964 with a thesis on the study of viruses in animal cells. He joined the Salk Institute in San Diego, married Huang, and moved to MIT in 1982, founding the Whitehead Institute.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/nobel-laureate-david-baltimore-dead-at-87/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday authorizing the Department of Defense to refer to itself as the Department of War, reverting to a more bellicose title used until a 1940s-era military shakeup in the aftermath of World War II.</p>
<p>The order approves the Pentagon's use of the Department of War name as an "additional secondary title" for the Department of Defense while the Trump administration seeks congressional approval to officially change the name. Until Congress votes on the issue, the name change is effectively a rebrand of the DoD that could be reversed with the signature of a future president.</p>
<p>But there was another potential name change revealed by the Pentagon on Friday, just hours before Trump signed the War Department order. This one may have more staying power.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/the-pentagons-department-of-war-rebrand-extends-to-space/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX's complaints to the Federal Communications Commission have helped the satellite company land a $17 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from EchoStar.</p>
<p>The deal consists of up to $8.5 billion in cash and up to $8.5 billion in SpaceX stock, EchoStar said. SpaceX also agreed to pay $2 billion worth of interest payments on EchoStar debt through November 2027.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1041417129693/1">SpaceX alleged</a> that EchoStar subsidiary Dish Network "barely uses" its spectrum and urged the FCC to make the spectrum available to other carriers, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr announced an investigation into EchoStar and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/fcc-threatens-echostar-licenses-for-spectrum-that-spacex-wants-to-use/">threatened to revoke</a> its spectrum licenses. EchoStar countered that it had met the network construction deadlines associated with its spectrum licenses, but decided to start selling off the licenses instead of fighting the FCC.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/spacex-complaints-to-fcc-pay-off-with-17-billion-spectrum-buy-from-echostar/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Today, Polestar debuted its newest model. Just as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-polestar-3-drives-sporty-looks-sharp-can-be-a-little-annoying/">three</a> is followed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-2025-polestar-4-great-steering-and-a-small-carbon-footprint-stand-out/">four</a>, next in the series comes five—in this case the Polestar 5. And the new EV is a little departure from the products we've seen so far from this Swedish/Chinese startup. It's a handsome if angular sedan that, like the Polestar 4 SUV, eschews a rear window in favor of more headroom for passengers and a rear-view camera.</p>
<p>"Polestar 5 is bringing the future to our present. Our vision for Polestar's design, technology, and sustainability direction is no longer a dream but a reality our customers can buy," said Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller. "With its pure Scandinavian design inside and out, unique platform, powerful motors, sophisticated chassis, cutting-edge technology, and consciously sustainable materials, the Polestar 5 is a guiding star for the industry and the perfect Polestar flagship."</p>
<p>As we found out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/watch-out-porsche-polestar-is-working-on-a-proper-taycan-rival/">when we met the car early during its development</a>, the Polestar 5 uses a bonded aluminum chassis, similar to various Lotuses and most current Aston Martins. Indeed, plenty of the development engineers working at Polestar's UK R&amp;D center in Coventry can count those brands on their CVs. The bonded aluminum approach results in a very stiff but quite light chassis, making it a good starting point for a performance car.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/polestar-unveils-electric-gt-rival-to-the-porsche-taycan/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) might just turn out to be Rian Johnson's greatest creation. Introduced in 2019's <em>Knives Out</em>, Blanc's syrupy Southern drawl and idiosyncratic approach to solving a mysterious New England death charmed audiences worldwide and launched a modern whodunnit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knives_Out_(film_series)">franchise</a>.</p>
<p>The third installment in the series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_Dead_Man"><em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em></a>, has already garnered early rave reviews after screening at the <a href="https://www.tiff.net/films/wake-up-dead-man-a-knives-out-mystery">Toronto International Film Festival</a> (TIFF) over the weekend. And now Netflix has released the official trailer, showcasing Blanc tackling the inexplicable death of a parish priest in a spookily Gothic small-town setting.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In five years, you won’t be able to spell IT without AI, Gartner predicted today.</p>
<p>VP analysts Alicia Mullery and Daryl Plummer delivered the sentiment at their keynote address at Gartner’s IT Symposium in Gold Coast, Australia, as reported by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/08/ai_impact_it_departments/">The Register</a>. Gartner believes that by 2030, all work performed by an IT department will involve the use of AI. That’s a progression from the 81 percent of IT work that’s done today without any use of AI, per Mullery.</p>
<p>By 2030, not only will all IT work rely on AI, but much of it will be performed by bots without the help of humans, Gartner’s analysts said. They predicted that in five years, 25 percent of IT work will be totally performed by bots, while 75 percent of IT workloads will be performed by humans with the help of AI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/no-ai-jobs-bloodbath-as-ai-permeates-all-it-work-over-the-next-5-years/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>President Trump's attempt to fire a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission was given a boost today, as Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/25A264.html">granted</a> a stay that temporarily blocks a lower-court ruling against Trump.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court hasn't ruled on the merits of the case. Today's order from Roberts stayed the lower-court ruling "pending further order of The Chief Justice or of the Court." Roberts set a September 15 deadline for Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Democrat who was fired from the FTC, to file a response to the government's motion for a longer-term stay.</p>
<p>Slaughter <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/trump-cant-fire-ftc-commissioners-just-because-he-wants-to-judges-rule/">beat Trump last week</a> in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which affirmed a District Court ruling that Trump violated US law and Supreme Court precedent with her firing. Slaughter was <a href="https://x.com/RKSlaughterFTC/status/1963319497517142079">back in her office</a> temporarily. Her name was re-added to the FTC website's list of commissioners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250903144010/https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/commissioners">after last week's ruling</a>, but was off the list again <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/commissioners">as of today</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/supreme-court-chief-justice-lets-trump-fire-ftc-democrat-at-least-for-now/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[The excitement came at the start and toward the end of this rather quick race.]]>
                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1 held its Italian Grand Prix at Monza this past weekend. It's the third-oldest purpose-built racetrack on the planet, and even includes an old and rather dangerous-looking oval that, while no longer in use, is accessible on foot if you feel like exploring. It's a deceptively simple-looking track where it's all about top speed and nailing your braking into the four heavy deceleration zones. Downforce is actually an impediment here, and that means the pecking order that we have become familiar with this season got a little upended.</p>
<p>That was apparent from free practice on Friday, topped by the Ferraris of Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc, with Carlos Sainz's Williams in third. Verstappen looked quick in his Red Bull, armed with a new Monza-spec rear wing that made his car cut through the air even more efficiently. The McLarens of title contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris got faster through the practice sessions, with the Williams of Alex Albon and Sainz continuing to look strong.</p>

<p>Qualifying did not go well for the Williams drivers. The time constraints of the qualifying sessions meant neither Albon nor Sainz was able to get their tires into the right temperature window, and the two were relegated in Q2. Hopes of a home pole for Ferrari—and a repeat of last year's win—were not to be, as Leclerc could manage only fourth on the grid. Hamilton was just over a tenth of a second slower in fifth, but would have to take a grid penalty as a consequence of last weekend's Dutch Grand Prix.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/f1-in-italy-look-what-happens-when-the-downforce-comes-off/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, we reported on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">the efforts of classic iPod fans to preserve playable copies of the downloadable clickwheel games</a> that Apple sold for a brief period in the late '00s. The community was working to get around <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/728B5C4B-0A35-40BE-A2E7-E5464C68B80A.html">Apple's onerous FairPlay DRM</a> by having people who still owned original copies of those (now unavailable) games sync their accounts to a single iTunes installation <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">via a coordinated Virtual Machine</a>. That "master library" would then be able to provide playable copies of those games to any number of iPods in perpetuity.</p>
<p>At the time, the community was still searching for iPod owners with syncable copies of the last few titles needed for their library. With <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi/">today's addition of <em>Real Soccer 2009</em></a> to the project, though, all 54 official iPod clickwheel games are now available together in an easily accessible format for what is likely the first time.</p>
<h2>All at once, then slowly</h2>
<p>GitHub user Olsro, the originator of <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">the iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project</a>, tells Ars that he lucked into contact with three people who had large iPod game libraries in the first month or so after the project's launch last October. That includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thatnostalgicnerd">one YouTuber</a> who had purchased and maintained copies of 39 distinct games, even repurchasing some of the upgraded versions Apple sold separately for later iPod models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There are myriad questions about how NASA's budget process will play out in the coming weeks, with the start of the new fiscal year on October 1 looming.</p>
<p>For example, the Trump administration may seek to shut off dozens of science missions that are either already in space or in development. Although Congress has signaled a desire to keep these missions active, absent a confirmed budget, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/trump-administration-moves-to-tighten-the-noose-around-nasa-science-missions/">the White House has made plans</a> to turn off the lights.</p>
<p>Some answers may be forthcoming this week, as the House Appropriations Committee will take up the Commerce, Justice, and Science budget bill on Wednesday morning. However, great uncertainty remains about whether there will be a budget passed by October 1 (unlikely), a continuing resolution, or a government shutdown.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/congress-and-trump-may-compromise-on-the-sls-rocket-by-axing-its-costly-upper-stage/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>It’s 2025, and the global vinyl record market has reached $2 billion in annual sales and is <a href="https://www.imarcgroup.com/vinyl-record-market-statistics">still growing</a> at roughly 7 percent annually, according to market research firm Imarc. Vinyl record sales now account for over 50 percent of physical media sales for music (and this is despite a recent resurgence in both cassette and CD sales among Millennials). It's in this landscape that Tiny Vinyl founders Neil Kohler and Jesse Mann decided to come up with a fun new collectible vinyl format.</p>
<h2 id="an-aha-moment">An “aha” moment</h2>
<p>Kohler’s day job is working with toy companies to develop and market their ideas. He was involved in helping Funko popularize its stylized vinyl figurines, now a ubiquitous presence at pop culture conventions, comic book stores, and toy shops of all kinds. Mann has worked in production, marketing, and the music business for nearly three decades, including a stint at LiveNation and years of running operations for the annual summer music festival Bonnaroo. Both men are based in Nashville—Music City, USA—and the proximity to one of the main centers of the music industry clearly had an impact.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/tiny-vinyl-is-a-new-pocketable-record-format-for-the-spotify-age/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Today, Porsche debuted a new 911 variant at the IAA Mobility show in Munich, Germany. It's the most powerful 911 to date, excluding some limited-run models, and may well be the quickest to 60 mph from a standing start, dispatching that dash in just 2.4 seconds. And it's all thanks to one of the most interesting hybrid powertrains on sale today.</p>
<p>Rather than just bolting an electric motor to an existing 911, Porsche designed an entirely new 3.6 L flat-six engine, taking the opportunity to ditch the belt drive and move some of the ancillaries, which can instead be powered by the car's 400 V traction battery.</p>
<p>The system debuted in the 911 GTS T-Hybrid, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/porsches-best-daily-driver-911-the-2025-carrera-gts-t-hybrid-review/">which Ars recently reviewed</a>. For that car, Porsche added a single electric turbocharger, which works like the MGU-H in a Formula 1 car. It spins up almost instantly to 120,000 rpm to eliminate throttle lag, but also recaptures excess energy from the spinning turbine and sends that to the 1.9 kWh battery pack.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/porsches-insanely-clever-hybrid-engine-comes-to-the-911-turbo-s/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It was in 2002, during the George W. Bush administration, when NASA decided to put a satellite into orbit to track emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas pumped into the atmosphere through human activity.</p>
<p>After many twists and turns, NASA's 23-year remit of charting greenhouse gas emissions could come to a close as soon as the end of this month. President Donald Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/trump-administration-moves-to-tighten-the-noose-around-nasa-science-missions/">budget request to Congress</a> calls for terminating 41 of NASA's 124 science missions in development or operations, and another 17 would see their funding zeroed out in the near future. Overall, the proposed budget slashes NASA's spending by 25 percent and cuts NASA's science funding in half.</p>
<p>This year's federal budget runs out September 30, and although lawmakers from both parties have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/congress-moves-to-reject-bulk-of-white-houses-proposed-nasa-cuts/">signaled they will reject most of Trump's cuts</a>, it's far from certain that Congress will pass a budget for the next fiscal year before the looming deadline. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has directed NASA managers to make plans to close out the missions tagged for cancellation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/gop-may-finally-succeed-in-unrelenting-quest-to-kill-two-nasa-climate-satellites/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As fall approaches and COVID cases tick up, you might be thinking about getting this season's COVID-19 vaccine. The annually updated shots have previously been easily accessible to anyone over 6 months of age. Most people could get them at no cost by simply walking into their neighborhood pharmacy—and that's what most people did.</p>
<p>However, the situation is much different this year with an ardent anti-vaccine activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the country's top health official. Since taking the role, Kennedy has worked diligently to dismantle the country's premier vaccination infrastructure, as well as directly hinder access to lifesaving shots. That includes restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines—something he's done by brazenly flouting all standard federal processes while providing no evidence-based reasoning for the changes.</p>
<h2>How we got here</h2>
<p>In late May, Kennedy unilaterally decided that all healthy children and pregnant people should <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-axes-covid-shot-guidance-for-pregnant-people-kids/">no longer have access to the shots</a>. He announced the unprecedented change not through official federal channels, but via a video posted on Elon Musk's X platform. Top vaccine and infectious disease officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—which sets federal vaccination recommendations—said they also learned of the change via X.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/who-can-get-a-covid-vaccine-and-how-its-complicated/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Authors revealed today that Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion and destroy all copies of the books the AI company pirated to train its artificial intelligence models.</p>
<p>In a press release provided to Ars, the authors confirmed that the settlement is "believed to be the largest publicly reported recovery in the history of US copyright litigation." Covering 500,000 works that Anthropic pirated for AI training, if a court approves the settlement, each author will receive $3,000 per work that Anthropic stole. "Depending on the number of claims submitted, the final figure per work could be higher," the press release noted.</p>
<p>Anthropic has already agreed to the settlement terms, but a court must approve them before the settlement is finalized. Preliminary approval may be granted this week, while the ultimate decision may be delayed until 2026, the press release noted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/first-of-its-kind-ai-settlement-anthropic-to-pay-authors-1-5-billion/">Read full article</a></p>
