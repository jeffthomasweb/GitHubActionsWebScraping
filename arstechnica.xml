              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/windows-11-24h2-the-biggest-update-in-two-years-starts-rolling-out-today/">Windows 11 2024 Update</a>, also known as Windows 11 24H2, started rolling out last week. Your PC may have even installed it already!</p>
<p>The continuous feature development of Windows 11 (and Microsoft's phased update rollouts) can make it a bit hard to track exactly what features you can expect to be available on any given Windows PC, even if it seems like it's fully up to date.</p>
<p>This isn't a comprehensive record of all the changes in the 2024 Update, and it doesn't reiterate some basic but important things like Wi-Fi 7 or 80Gbps USB4 support. But we've put together a small list of new and interesting changes that you're guaranteed to see when your version number rolls over from 22H2 or 23H2 to 24H2. And while Microsoft's announcement post spent most of its time on Copilot and features unique to Copilot+ PCs, here, we'll only cover things that will be available on any PC you install Windows 11 on (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-whether-your-pc-is-supported-or-not/">whether it's officially supported or not</a>).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/eleven-things-to-know-about-in-the-windows-11-2024-update/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.15 of the Rocket Report! It's a big week for big rockets, with SpaceX potentially launching its next Starship test flight and a Falcon Heavy rocket with NASA's Europa Clipper mission this weekend. And a week ago, United Launch Alliance flew its second Vulcan rocket, which lost one of its booster nozzles in midair and amazingly kept going to achieve a successful mission. Are you not entertained?</p>

<p><b>PLD Space is aiming high. </b>Spanish launch provider PLD Space has revealed a family of new rockets that it plans to introduce beyond its Miura 5 rocket, which is expected to make its inaugural flight in 2025, <a href="https://europeanspaceflight.com/pld-space-unveils-three-new-rockets-and-a-crew-capsule/">European Spaceflight reports</a>. The company also revealed that it was working on a crew capsule called Lince (Spanish for Lynx). PLD Space introduced its Miura Next, Miura Next Heavy, and Miura Next Super Heavy launch vehicles, designed in single stick, triple core, and quintuple core configurations with reusable boosters. At the high end of the rocket family's performance, the Miura Next Super Heavy could deliver up to 53 metric tons (nearly 117,000 pounds) of payload to low-Earth orbit. The Lince capsule could become Europe's first human-rated crew transportation spacecraft.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/rocket-report-europa-clipper-on-hold-for-milton-spanish-startups-big-ambitions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Intel's 14th-generation desktop processors were a mild update on top of a mild update: a barely faster revision of the 13th-gen Core CPUs, which were themselves a modest tweak to 2021's 12th-gen Core processors. The new Core Ultra CPUs (and their underlying architectural changes) were exclusive to laptops.</p>
<p>Today, that changes: The Core Ultra 200S processors (codenamed Arrow Lake) will bring to desktops many of the changes Intel has made to its Core Ultra 100- and 200-series laptop CPUs (Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake, respectively). Changes include a new chiplet-based design, new manufacturing technologies, updated CPU and GPU architectures, and a neural processing unit (NPU) for accelerating some AI and machine learning workloads.</p>
<p>All of the new processors launch on October 24th.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/intels-core-ultra-200s-cpus-are-its-biggest-desktop-refresh-in-three-years/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Breakdancing has become a global phenomenon since it first emerged in the 1970s, even making its debut as an official event at this year's Summer Olympics. But hardcore breakers are prone to injury (sprains, strains, tendonitis), including a bizarre condition known as "headspin hole" or "breakdance bulge"—a protruding lump on the scalp caused by repeatedly performing the power move known as a headspin. A <a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2024-261854">new paper</a> published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) describes one such case that required surgery to redress.</p>
<p>According to the authors, there are very few published papers about the phenomenon; they cite two in particular. A <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1109219">2009 German study</a> of 106 breakdancers found that 60.4 percent of them experienced overuse injuries to the scalp because of headspins, with 31.1 percent of those cases reporting hair loss, 23.6 percent developing head bumps, and 36.8 percent experiencing scalp inflammation. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37218638/">2023 study</a> of 142 breakdancers reported those who practiced headspins more than three times a week were much more likely to suffer hair loss.</p>
<p>So when a male breakdancer in his early 30s sought treatment for a pronounced bump on top of his head, Mikkal Bundgaard Skotting and Christian Baastrup Søndergaard of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark seized the opportunity to describe the clinical case study in detail, taking an MRI, surgically removing the growth, and analyzing the removed mass.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/breakdancers-at-risk-for-headspin-hole-doctors-warn/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After more than nine months in an unusual, highly elliptical orbit, the US military's X-37B spaceplane will soon begin dipping its wings into Earth's atmosphere to lower its altitude before eventually coming back to Earth for a runway landing, the Space Force said Thursday.</p>
<p>The aerobraking maneuvers will use a series of passes through the uppermost fringes of the atmosphere to gradually reduce its speed with aerodynamic drag while expending minimal fuel. In orbital mechanics, this reduction in velocity will bring the apogee, or high point, of the X-37B's orbit closer to Earth.</p>
<h2>Bleeding energy</h2>
<p>The Space Force called the aerobraking a "novel space maneuver" and said its purpose was to allow the X-37B to "safely dispose of its service module components in accordance with recognized standards for space debris mitigation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/the-us-militarys-x-37b-spaceplane-is-preparing-for-a-novel-space-maneuver/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/?srsltid=AfmBOoqFcGYssZc4Vo6od5nMHME7iqiGQMmryujLeHHkw8GfFke6zZE3">announced</a> Sound Clock Alarmo, a $99 bedside smart clock that uses motion sensors to detect when users move during sleep to keep track of sleep patterns. The clock, which is only available to Nintendo Online subscribers until January 2025, changes appearance based on the selected alarm, with different clock faces corresponding to various Nintendo games like <em>Super Mario</em> Odyssey, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike other sleep trackers that require you to physically wear something (such as the Apple Watch), Alarmo uses millimeter-wave presence sensors to track user movement, and it feeds that data into an internal system that keeps track of user sleep patterns (Alarmo does not send any sleep information to Nintendo).</p>
<p>The clock tracks how long the person has been sleeping and how long it took them to get out of bed after the alarm went off. Sleepy users can also use gestures to trigger a snooze function without physically touching the clock.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nintendos-new-clock-tracks-your-movement-in-bed/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel today slammed Donald Trump for his repeated attacks on TV news networks. Trump, the former president and current presidential candidate, has been calling for licenses to be revoked from TV news organizations whose coverage he dislikes.</p>
<p>"While repeated attacks against broadcast stations by the former President may now be familiar, these threats against free speech are serious and should not be ignored," Rosenworcel said in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-406463A1.pdf">statement</a> issued today. "As I've said before, the First Amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy. The FCC does not and will not revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage."</p>
<p>The FCC press release said that Rosenworcel issued the statement "after repeated calls by former President Trump to revoke the licenses of broadcast stations for political reasons."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-chair-slams-trumps-call-to-revoke-cbs-and-abc-broadcast-licenses/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple TV+ will now be available as an add-on in Amazon Prime Video bundles, and users will be able to watch Apple TV+ films and shows in Prime Video apps and devices without downloading a separate app, the two companies <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/apple-tv-shows-amazon-prime-video-subscription">announced</a>.</p>
<p>The offering from Amazon promises to give users the option to stick with a familiar app and manage payments through one billing system.</p>
<p>Despite considerable media buzz and critical acclaim for its shows, Apple TV+ has lagged behind many of its competitors in terms of both total subscribers and retention. The deal with Amazon could expose Apple TV+ to new customers, and the bundled nature of this subscription could help retain them even in slower content periods.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazon-apple-make-a-deal-to-offer-apple-tv-in-a-prime-bundle/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Dan Riccio, one of Apple's most prominent executives for more than two decades, will retire from the company this month, according to a report in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-09/apple-s-dan-riccio-key-executive-in-both-the-jobs-and-cook-eras-to-retire">Bloomberg</a> that cites people with knowledge of the move.</p>
<p>Reportedly, Riccio has said he has been planning his retirement for the past five years, and his last day will be Friday, October 11.</p>
<p>Riccio began working at Apple in 1998, and by 2012, he had become the chief of hardware engineering. In that role, he oversaw several major hardware developments for Apple, including AirPods, the evolution of the modern iPhone, the iPad Pro, and more.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/former-apple-hardware-chief-dan-riccio-is-retiring/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There has been a rash of iPhone thefts around the US the past few months, conducted by "porch pirates" often seen on doorbell camera videos scooping up boxes right after they are delivered. Phones shipped by AT&amp;T are being targeted more than those of Verizon and T-Mobile, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/porch-pirates-att-iphone-fedex-279ff419">Wall Street Journal article</a> published yesterday.</p>
<p>"The key to these swift crimes, investigators say: The thieves are armed with tracking numbers. Another factor that makes packages from AT&amp;T particularly vulnerable is that AT&amp;T typically doesn't require signature on delivery... Verizon and T-Mobile require a signature on delivery for smartphones; AT&amp;T generally doesn't," the article said.</p>
<p>The WSJ talked to Chris Brown, a police lieutenant in Deer Park, Texas, who "said the suspects were armed with inside information: AT&amp;T parcel tracking numbers. Deer Park police are working with AT&amp;T to investigate how the suspects got that information, he said."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/using-inside-info-iphone-thieves-arrive-at-your-house-right-after-fedex/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, the Italian energy company Enel X <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/if-you-own-a-juicebox-ev-charger-you-need-to-read-this/">announced an abrupt withdrawal</a> from the North American market. For its residential customers—owners of the popular Juicebox level 2 home chargers—the physical hardware will continue to work, but from tomorrow Enel X will have ended all software support, including updates and its apps. But Enel X also had commercial clients, and they're even more out of luck—from tomorrow those stations "will lose functionality in the absence of software continuity," Enel X <a href="http://www.juiceboxnorthamerica.com">says</a>.</p>
<h2>Juicebox</h2>
<p>For Juicebox customers, the loss of Enel X's servers and apps isn't great—they will lose the ability to remotely manage the charger, or schedule charging sessions from it. But most electric vehicles—both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs—have their own built-in software to schedule charging sessions, and to hear some owners tell it, Enel X's software was a poor substitute for the original Juicebox software written by eMotorworks, which was bought by Enel X in 2017.</p>
<p>Whether owners still have any kind of warranty support remains up in the air. A community of volunteers called <a href="https://juice-rescue.org">Juice Rescue</a> has put together <a href="https://juice-rescue.org/documents/2024-10-09-preparing-for-enel-x-juicebox-software-abandonment.pdf">a guide on preparing</a> for the shutdown tomorrow. This includes useful advice like making a note of the device's Juicebox ID and double-checking that the charger's maximum capacity is correctly set for its circuit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/the-juicebox-and-enel-x-shutdown-what-comes-next/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, NYC-based <a href="http://apps.spreen.co/">software developer</a> Nick Spreen received a surprising alert on his iPhone 15 Pro, delivered through an early test version of Apple's upcoming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/">Apple Intelligence</a> text message summary feature. "No longer in a relationship; wants belongings from the apartment," the AI-penned message reads, summing up the content of several separate breakup texts from his girlfriend—that arrived on his birthday, no less.</p>
<p>Spreen shared a screenshot of the AI-generated message in a <a href="https://x.com/spreen_co/status/1844229642120724645">now-viral tweet</a> on the X social network, writing, "for anyone who’s wondered what an apple intelligence summary of a breakup text looks like." Spreen told Ars Technica that the screenshot does not show his ex-girlfriend's full real name, just a nickname.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Using ChatGPT to research cyber threats has backfired on bad actors, OpenAI revealed in a <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/threat-intelligence-reports/influence-and-cyber-operations-an-update_October-2024.pdf">report</a> analyzing emerging trends in how AI is currently amplifying online security risks.</p>
<p>Not only do ChatGPT prompts expose what platforms bad actors are targeting—and in at least one case enabled OpenAI to link a covert influence campaign on X and Instagram for the first time—but they can also reveal new tools that threat actors are testing to evolve their deceptive activity online, OpenAI claimed.</p>
<p>OpenAI's report comes amid heightening scrutiny of its tools during a major election year where officials globally fear AI might be used to boost disinformation and propaganda like never before. Their report detailed 20 times OpenAI disrupted covert influence operations and deceptive networks attempting to use AI to sow discord or breach vulnerable systems.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/using-chatgpt-to-make-fake-social-media-posts-backfires-on-bad-actors/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Analysis of Denuvo DRM cracking shows significant impacts on publishers' bottom lines.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Throughout the game industry's short history, there's been ample debate about how much piracy actually impacts a game's legitimate sales. On one side, some publishers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/09/software-piracy-and-job-growth-a-zero-sum-game/">try to argue</a> that every single pirated download should count as a "lost sale" that they would have logged in a theoretical piracy-free world. On the other side, some wiseacres argue that most pirates would never consider paying for a legitimate version of the game in the first place or that piracy can actually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/eu-study-finds-piracy-doesnt-hurt-game-sales-may-actually-help/">be useful</a> as a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/how-one-game-developer-is-making-the-pirate-bay-work-for-him/">word-of-mouth promotional tool</a>.</p>
<p>While the true effect of piracy on sales revenue is likely somewhere between those two extremes, piracy's precise financial impact on a game has always been hard to nail down. Now, though, a recently published study uses <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/denuvos-drm-ins-now-being-cracked-within-hours-of-release/">post-release cracks</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/denuvo-wants-to-convince-you-its-drm-isnt-evil/">Denuvo's DRM protections</a> as a sort of natural experiment on games sales in pre- and post-piracy worlds. The results "imply an average proportionate loss of revenue of around 19 percent in each week of release if a crack is available," according to the study, suggesting that effective DRM can actually have a significant impact on a publisher's bottom line.</p>
<h2>The data dance</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952124002532?dgcid=author#fn9">"The Revenue Effects of Denuvo Digital Rights Management on PC Video Games,"</a> published in the peer-reviewed journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/entertainment-computing">Entertainment Computing</a>, UNC research associate <a href="https://uncipc.org/index.php/people/william-volckmann/">William Volckmann</a> examines 86 different Denuvo-protected games initially released on Steam between September 2014 and the end of 2022. That sample includes many games where Denuvo protection endured for at least 12 weeks (when new sales tend to drop off to "negligible" amounts for most games) and many others where earlier cracks allowed for widespread piracy at some point.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/the-true-cost-of-game-piracy-20-percent-of-revenue-according-to-a-new-study/">Read full article</a></p>

      Shazad Latif stars as Captain Nemo in Prime Video's new series, <em>Nautilus</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Captain Nemo is one of 19th-century French novelist Jules Verne's most captivating fictional characters, appearing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Seas"><em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em></a> (1870) and <em>The Mysterious Island</em> (1875). Prime Video is bringing us a 10-episode series exploring Nemo's origin story, loosely based on the former, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_(TV_series)"><em>Nautilus</em></a>, premiering in a couple of weeks. The official trailer just dropped, and it has all the swashbuckling, deep sea diving adventures, and exotic sea creatures one would expect from a classic Verne tale—including that infamous giant squid and a plucky romantic interest for good measure.</p>
<p><strong>(Minor spoilers for the novels below.)</strong></p>
<p>In Verne's novels, Nemo is a mysterious figure also known as Prince Dakkar, who lost his kingdom and his family in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He devotes himself to science and builds an electrically powered submersible ship called the <em>Nautilus</em>, salvaging gold bullion from shipwrecks to fund his travels, occasionally coming to the aid of people in need (a pearl diver under a shark attack or castaways in need of rescue). He is well-read, has a Western education, and is fluent in several languages, as well as being a gifted engineer. And he appreciates the fine arts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/nautilus-trailer-explores-captain-nemos-origins/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tabletop board games and video games typically offer ways to reduce their difficulty. But getting and keeping a group together for game nights, across different schedules and experience levels? That can be fiendishly hard.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That, more than anything, is what <a href="https://www.sunderfolk.com/"><span class="s2"><i>Sunderfolk</i></span></a> wants to make easier. At its core, it’s a turn-based tactical RPG with well-worn hero classes and mechanics familiar to fans of crunchy tabletop games and CRPGs. But this upcoming game from Secret Door, led by Blizzard veteran and tabletop aficionado Chris Sigaty, wants to bring more people into the game-night fold. By fusing <em>Jackbox</em>-like accessibility with tabletop mechanics and letting the game do all the hard work, <em>Sunderfolk</em> aims to reduce learning curves, eliminate setup, and encourage game nights with friends.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Also, you use your phone as a controller, connected to one "big screen," local or remote. But it makes sense, and it worked, at least in the two hours I got to play <i>Sunderfolk.</i> The phone (or tablet) is both a controller and a replacement for all the cards, tokens, and other ephemera a tabletop player would have in front of them. And it allows for quick setup of couch co-op or screencasted play. <i>Sunderfolk</i> is a game that can make use of the QR-code-scanning, Discord-arranging skills many of us learned during the pandemic.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really/">Read full article</a></p>

If you're on the East Coast and want to come hang out with Ars EIC Ken Fisher and me while we talk to some neat speakers and learn some stuff, then read on!</p>
<p>Continuing our partnership with IBM, Ars presents "AI in DC: Privacy, Compliance, and Making Infrastructure Smarter." Our tone this time around will be a little more policy-oriented than our San Jose event. We intend to have three panel discussions, with the overall topics looking like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The key to compliance with emerging technologies</li>
<li>Data security in the age of AI-assisted cyber-espionage</li>
<li>The best infrastructure solution for your AI/ML strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, here are our panels and the panelists we've confirmed:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/join-ars-in-dc-for-infrastructure-cocktails-and-spycraft-on-october-29/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Raspberry Pi owners have always been prone to coming up with elaborate, technically interesting but practically questionable projects, and Pi enthusiast Jeff Geerling has<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/use-external-gpu-on-raspberry-pi-5-4k-gaming"> an exciting new submission to that canon</a>: connecting an old AMD Radeon RX 460 GPU to the Raspberry Pi 5's PCI Express bus and managing to play demanding titles like <em>Doom 3</em> (2004) and <em>Tux Racer </em>at a crisp 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Geerling's maze of adapters, software tweaks, and workarounds is a testament both to his ingenuity and the flexibility of the Raspberry Pi and its ecosystem. By default, the Pi 5 provides a single PCI Express 2.0 lane for use with external accessories (most commonly M.2 SSDs for storage). Geerling uses an M.2 slot on the Pi and then connects it to an external GPU dock using an M.2-to-Oculink adapter. This gets the GPU connected to the Pi's PCIe bus.</p>
<p>But there were other problems that had to be solved as well. The Pi's PCIe slot can only provide 5 W of power for external accessories, far short of the 75 W that a desktop graphics card would be able to get from a typical PCIe slot in a motherboard. Geerling needed to provide external power to both the GPU and to the slot itself to make sure that the RX 460 could draw all the power it needed to.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/maze-of-adapters-software-patches-gets-a-dedicated-gpu-working-on-a-raspberry-pi/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Helene crossed the Gulf of Mexico at a time when sea surface temperatures were at record highs and then barreled into a region where heavy rains had left the ground saturated. The result was historic, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/were-only-beginning-to-understand-the-historic-nature-of-helenes-flooding/">catastrophic flooding</a>.</p>
<p>One key question is how soon we might expect history to repeat itself. Our rapidly warming planet has tilted the odds in favor of some extreme weather events in a way that means we can expect some events that had been extremely rare to start occurring with some regularity. Our first stab at understanding climate change's influence on Helene was <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-key-driver-of-catastrophic-impacts-of-hurricane-helene-that-devastated-both-coastal-and-inland-communities/">released on Wednesday</a>, and it suggests that rainfall of the sort experienced by the Carolinas may now be a once-in-70-year event, which could have implications for how we rebuild some of the communities shattered by the rain.</p>
<h2>Rapid attribution</h2>
<p>The quick analysis was done by the World Weather Attribution project, which has developed peer-reviewed methods of looking for the fingerprints of climate change in major weather events. In general, this involves identifying the key weather patterns that produced the event and then exploring their frequency using climate models run with and without the carbon dioxide we've added to the atmosphere.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/helenes-carolina-rainfall-made-70-percent-more-likely-by-climate-change/">Read full article</a></p>
