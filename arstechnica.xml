                            <![CDATA[<p>In the 1800s, astronomers were mystified by the discovery of stars that displayed highly unusual emission lines. It was only after 1868, when scientists discovered the element helium, that astronomers were able to explain the broad emission bands due to the presence of helium in these stars.</p>
<p>Over time, these stars became known as Wolf-Rayet stars (Charles Wolf was a French astronomer, and helium was first detected by the French scientist Georges Rayet and others), and astronomers came to understand that they were the central stars within planetary nebulae, and continually ejecting gas at high velocity.</p>
<p>This gives Wolf-Rayet stars a distinctive appearance in the night sky. And this week, Chris McGrew has shared a photo of WR 134—a variable Wolf-Rayet star about 6,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus—which he captured from a dark sky location in southwestern New Mexico.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/tuesday-telescope-a-howling-wolf-in-the-night-sky/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a blog Tuesday, Cloudflare explained that its "pay-per-crawl" feature is currently in a private beta. A small number of publishers—including AdWeek, The Associated Press, The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, Fortune, Gannett, and Ars Technica owner Condé Nast—will participate in the experiment. Each publisher will be able to set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content, Cloudflare said.</p>
<p>Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, said the feature would ensure that the Internet as we know it will survive "the age of AI."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/pay-up-or-stop-scraping-cloudflare-program-charges-bots-for-each-crawl/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>A boomerang carved from a mammoth tusk is one of the oldest in the world, and it may be even older than archaeologists originally thought, according to a recent round of radiocarbon dating.</p>
<p>Archaeologists unearthed the mammoth-tusk boomerang in Poland’s Oblazowa Cave in the 1990s, and they originally dated it to around 18,000 years old, which made it one of the world’s oldest intact boomerangs. But according to recent analysis by University of Bologna researcher Sahra Talamo and her colleagues, the boomerang may have been made around 40,000 years ago. If they’re right, it offers tantalizing clues about how people lived on the harsh tundra of what’s now Poland during the last Ice Age.</p>
<h2><b>A boomerang carved from mammoth tusk</b></h2>
<p>The mammoth-tusk boomerang is about 72 centimeters long, gently curved, and shaped so that one end is slightly more rounded than the other. It still bears scratches and scuffs from the mammoth’s life, along with fine, parallel grooves that mark where some ancient craftsperson shaped and smoothed the boomerang. On the rounded end, a series of diagonal marks would have made the weapon easier to grip. It’s smoothed and worn from frequent handling: the last traces of the life of some Paleolithic hunter.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-mammoth-tusk-boomerang-from-poland-is-40000-years-old/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's Vision Pro hasn't made huge waves in the market, partly due to its steep price and "everything including the kitchen sink" feature set. But Apple hasn't given up on the platform yet; a prominent analyst with a strong record of accurate projections for Apple's product lineup, Ming-Chi Kuo, <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple-vision-series-and-smart-glasses-roadmap-2025-2028-smart-glasses-set-to-drive-the-next-wave-e082d819aa9a">published a roadmap</a> that shows Apple beginning to roll out a new wave of mixed reality devices in 2027.</p>
<p>Kuo says Apple still "views head-mounted devices as the next major trend in consumer electronics." We already knew Apple CEO Tim Cook felt that way before the Vision Pro came out, but continued investment seems to indicate that Apple hasn't been dissuaded by the relatively low sales of the Vision Pro as a niche product. However, Kuo notes that "Apple is not expected to launch any new head-mounted devices in 2026."</p>
<p>Launches are planned for 2027 and 2028, though. You might expect a sort of Vision Pro 2, and Kuo believes that's coming—but not until at least mid-2028. When it arrives, it's expected to jump from Apple's M2 system-on-a-chip to the M5, which should offer a significant performance leap. Based on his supply line sources, Kuo believes the new headset will feature a completely new design that is "significantly" lighter than the first Vision Pro and a lower price point.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apple-will-introduce-vision-air-and-smart-glasses-in-2027-analyst-projects/">Read full article</a></p>

This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. June's list includes the final results from the Muon g-2 experiment, re-creating the recipe for Egyptian blue, embedding coded messages in ice bubbles, and why cats seem to have a marked preference for sleeping on their left sides.</p>
<h2>Re-creating Egyptian blues</h2>

<p>Artists in ancient Egypt were particularly fond of the color known as Egyptian blue—deemed the world's oldest synthetic pigment—since it was a cheap substitute for pricier materials like lapis lazuli or turquoise. But archaeologists have puzzled over exactly how it was made, particularly given the wide range of hues, from deep blue to gray or green. That knowledge had long been forgotten. However, scientists at Washington State University have finally succeeded in recreating the recipe, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s40494-025-01699-7">a paper</a> published in the journal npj Heritage Science.</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary team came up with 12 different potential recipes using varying percentages of silicon dioxide, copper, calcium, and sodium carbonate. They heated the samples to 1,000° Celsius (about what ancient artists could have achieved), varying the time between one and 11 hours. They also cooled the samples at different rates. Then they analyzed the samples using microscopy and other modern techniques and compared them to the Egyptian blue on actual Egyptian artifacts to find the best match.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/research-roundup-6-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico hacked the phone of an FBI official investigating kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán as part of a surveillance campaign “to intimidate and/or kill potential sources or cooperating witnesses,” according to a recently published report by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/25-065_t.pdf">report</a>, which cited an “individual connected to the cartel,” said a hacker hired by its top brass “offered a menu of services related to exploiting mobile phones and other electronic devices.” The hired hacker observed “'people of interest' for the cartel, including the FBI Assistant Legal Attache, and then was able to use the [attache's] mobile phone number to obtain calls made and received, as well as geolocation data, associated with the [attache's] phone."</p>
<p>“According to the FBI, the hacker also used Mexico City's camera system to follow the [attache] through the city and identify people the [attache] met with,” the heavily redacted report stated. “According to the case agent, the cartel used that information to intimidate and, in some instances, kill potential sources or cooperating witnesses.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/mexican-drug-cartel-hacked-fbi-officials-phone-to-track-informant-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Making art used to be a uniquely human endeavor, but machines have learned to distill human creativity with generative AI. Whether that content counts as "art" depends on who you ask, but Spotify doesn't discriminate. A new band called The Velvet Sundown debuted on Spotify this month and has already amassed more than half a million listeners. But by all appearances, The Velvet Sundown is not a real band—it's AI.</p>
<p>While many artists are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/billie-eilish-pearl-jam-200-artists-say-ai-poses-existential-threat-to-their-livelihoods/">vehemently opposed</a> to using AI, some have leaned into the trend to assist with music production. However, it doesn't seem like there's an artist behind this group. In less than a month, The Velvet Sundown has <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2GRtyAXWUiisGYub5SGMrb?flow_ctx=347923fd-a81d-4da0-8872-bb1f35eea33b%3A1751327600">released two albums on Spotify</a>, titled "Floating On Echoes" and "Dust and Silence." A third album is releasing in two weeks. The tracks have a classic rock vibe with a cacophony of echoey instruments and a dash of autotune. If one of these songs came up in a mix, you might not notice anything is amiss. Listen to one after another, though, and the bland muddiness exposes them as a machine creation.</p>
<p>Some listeners began to have doubts about The Velvet Sundown's existence over the past week, with multiple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify/comments/1lk9ag2/ai_band_in_recommended_with_300k_monthly_with/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SilentGarrett/status/1938257726129193351">X threads</a> pointing out the lack of verifiable information on the band. The bio lists four members, none of whom appear to exist outside of The Velvet Sundown's album listings and social media. The group's songs have been mysteriously added to a large number of user-created playlists, which has helped swell its listener base in a few short weeks. When Spotify users began noticing The Velvet Sundown's apparent use of AI, the profile had around 300,000 listeners. It's now over 500,000 in less than a week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/half-a-million-spotify-users-are-unknowingly-grooving-to-an-ai-generated-band/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Cruz bill could take 6 GHz spectrum away from Wi-Fi, give it to mobile carriers.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has a plan for spectrum auctions that could take frequencies away from Wi-Fi and reallocate them for the exclusive use of wireless carriers. The plan would benefit AT&amp;T, which is based in Cruz's home state, along with Verizon and T-Mobile.</p>
<p>Cruz's proposal revives a years-old controversy over whether the entire 6 GHz band should be devoted to Wi-Fi, which can use the large spectrum band for faster speeds than networks that rely solely on the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. Congress is on the verge of passing legislation that would require spectrum to be auctioned off for full-power, commercially licensed use, and the question is where that spectrum will come from.</p>
<p>When the House of Representatives passed its so-called "One Big Beautiful Bill," it <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text#:~:text=Exclusion.%2D%2DThe%20term%20%60%60covered%20band%27%27%20does%20not%20%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20include%20the%20following%3A">excluded</a> all of the frequencies between 5.925 and 7.125 gigahertz from the planned spectrum auctions. But Cruz's <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/6/chairman-cruz-releases-updated-budget-reconciliation-text">version</a> of the budget reconciliation bill, which is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/senate-vote-trump-tax-bill-022bd480">moving quickly toward a final vote</a>, removed the 6 GHz band's protection from spectrum auctions. The Cruz bill is also controversial because it would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/ted-cruz-cant-get-all-republicans-to-back-his-fight-against-state-ai-laws/">penalize states</a> that regulate artificial intelligence.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/senate-gop-budget-bill-has-little-noticed-provision-that-could-hurt-your-wi-fi/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A political effort to relocate the space shuttle <em>Discovery</em> from the Smithsonian to Space Center Houston has been merged with the so-called "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major economic and policy package now nearing a vote in the US Senate.</p>
<p>The "<a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-063025a-big-beautiful-bill-space-shuttle-discovery-move-houston.html">Bring the Space Shuttle Home Act</a>," first introduced by Texas Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn in April, has now been added to the Senate's version of the bill championed by President Donald Trump. While the latter legislation primarily focuses on tax cuts and spending increases, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science &amp; Transportation, chaired by Cruz, added the retired orbiter's relocation as part of an additional $9.995 billion in funding for NASA's programs, including the return of astronauts to the Moon and sending humans to Mars.</p>
<p>"One of the things in the Big Beautiful Bill we're talking about, there's about a $10 billion appropriation for NASA," said Cornyn at a June 20 press conference at Space Center Houston. "We're optimistic that bill that started out as a beautiful bill in the House will become even more beautiful in the Senate this week."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/relocation-of-space-shuttle-discovery-may-hinge-on-big-beautiful-bill/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Senate Republicans' version of President Trump's tax bill would slash federal spending on health provisions—Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act—by $1.1 trillion by 2034. And in that time, an estimated 11.8 million people would lose their health insurance.</p>
<p>That’s according to <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61534">an analysis</a> released over the weekend by the Congressional Budget Office. The massive piece of legislation is likely to change as senators are currently running a "vote-a-rama" for rapid-fire amendment proposals.</p>
<p>The bulk of the estimated reductions in health spending come from Medicaid, which will lose more than $1 trillion. Of the 11.8 million people who could lose health insurance, 1.4 million are people without "verified citizenship" or "satisfactory immigration status," the CBO noted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/nearly-12-million-people-would-lose-health-insurance-under-senate-gop-bill/">Read full article</a></p>

      Phil Lord and Christopher Miller co-direct <em>Project Hail Mary</em>, based on Andy Weir's 2021 novel.

<p>We here at Ars were big fans of 2015's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/the-martian-brings-science-largely-unchanged-from-book-to-screen/"><em>The Martian</em></a>, adapted from Andy Weir's novel of the same name. So our interest was naturally piqued when he heard about a new film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary_(film)"><em>Project Hail Mary</em></a>, based on Weir's bestselling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary">2021 novel</a>. Amazon MGM Studios just released the first trailer, and the movie looks great—very much in the vein of <em>The Martian</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but nothing that isn't in the trailer.)</strong></p>
<p>The studio acquired the rights for Weir's novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for <em>The Martian</em>, so it's an excellent choice.) They tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (<em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie</em>) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/ryan-gosling-is-a-reluctant-astronaut-in-project-hail-mary-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Section 230 has so far failed to shield Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance from a lawsuit raised by a mother who alleged that her son's wrongful death followed a flood of "subway surfing" videos platforms intentionally targeted to teens in New York.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Nazario-v-Meta-6-30-25-Decision.pdf">decision</a> Monday, New York State Supreme Court Judge Paul Goetz largely denied social media companies' motions to dismiss claims they argued should be barred under Section 230 and the First Amendment. Goetz said that the mother, Norma Nazario, had adequately alleged that subway surfing content "was purposefully fed" to her son Zackery "because of his age" and "not because of any user inputs that indicated he was interested in seeing such content."</p>
<p>Unlike other Section 230 cases in which platforms' algorithms were determined to be content-neutral, Goetz wrote that in this case, "it is plausible that the social media defendants’ role exceeded that of neutral assistance in promoting content and constituted active identification of users who would be most impacted by the content."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/meta-tiktok-cant-toss-wrongful-death-suit-from-mom-of-subway-surfing-teen/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that could determine whether Internet service providers must terminate users who are accused of copyright infringement.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/063025zor_7647.pdf">list of orders</a> released today, the court granted a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-171.html">petition</a> filed by cable company Cox. The ISP, which was sued by Sony Music Entertainment, is trying to overturn a ruling that it is liable for copyright infringement because it failed to terminate users accused of piracy. Music companies want ISPs to disconnect users whose IP addresses are repeatedly connected to torrent downloads.</p>
<p>"We are pleased the US Supreme Court has decided to address these significant copyright issues that could jeopardize Internet access for all Americans and fundamentally change how Internet service providers manage their networks," Cox <a href="https://newsroom.cox.com/2025-06-30-U-S-Supreme-Court-Agrees-to-Hear-Significant-Copyright-Case">said</a> today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/supreme-court-to-decide-whether-isps-must-disconnect-users-accused-of-piracy/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Blocked just hours before taking effect, the controversial digital services tax (DST) would have charged big US tech companies like Apple, Google, and Meta a 3 percent tax on all digital services revenue earned from Canadian users. Frustrating US tech giants, Canada also sought to collect retroactive taxes dating back to 2022.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, President Donald Trump claimed the tax was a "direct and blatant attack" on US tech companies and terminated the trade talks, while threatening to impose a new tariff rate on Canadian goods by July 4.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trumps-tariff-threat-pushes-canada-to-scrap-digital-services-tax/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Rory de Vries, an associate professor of virology in the Netherlands, was lifting weights at the gym when he noticed a WhatsApp message from his research partners at Columbia University, telling him his research funding had been cancelled. The next day he received the official email: “Hi Rory, Columbia has received a termination notice for this contract, including all subcontracts,” it stated. “Unfortunately, we must advise you to immediately stop work and cease incurring charges on this subcontract.”</p>
<p>De Vries was disappointed, though not surprised—his team knew this might happen under the new Trump administration. His projects focused on immune responses and a new antiviral treatment for respiratory viruses like Covid-19. Animals had responded well in pre-clinical trials, and he was about to explore the next steps for applications in humans. But the news, which he received in March, left him with a cascade of questions: What would happen to the doctoral student he had just hired for his project, a top candidate plucked from a pool of some 300 aspiring scientists? How would his team comply with local Dutch law, which, unlike the US, forbids terminating a contract without cause or notice?

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-begins-rolling-out-today-to-pixel-devices/">released Android 16</a>, which brings a smattering of new features for Pixel phones, with promises of additional updates down the road. The numbering scheme has not been consistent over the years, and as a result, Android 16 is actually the 36th major release in a lineage that stretches back nearly two decades. In 2008, we didn't fully understand how smartphones would work, so there was a lot of trial and error. In 2025, the formula has been explored every which way. Today's smartphones run mature software, and that means less innovation in each yearly release. That trend is exemplified and amplified by Google's approach to Android 16.</p>
<p>The latest release is perhaps the most humdrum version of the platform yet, but don't weep for Google. The company has been working toward this goal for years: a world where the average phone buyer doesn't need to worry about Android version numbers.</p>
<h2>A little fun up front</h2>
<p>When you install Android 16 on one of Google's Pixel phones, you may need to check the settings to convince yourself that the update succeeded. Visually, the changes are so minuscule that you'll only notice them if you're obsessive about how Android works. For example, Google changed the style of icons in the overview screen and added a few more options to the overview app menus. There are a lot of these minor style tweaks; we expect more when Google releases Material 3 Expressive, but that's still some way off.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-review-post-hype/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of the 1995 Oscar-winning film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13_(film)"><em>Apollo 13</em></a>, director Ron Howard's masterful love letter to NASA's Apollo program in general and the eponymous space mission in particular. So we're taking the opportunity to revisit this riveting homage to American science, ingenuity, and daring.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Apollo 13</em> is a fictional retelling of the aborted 1970 lunar mission that became a "successful failure" for NASA because all three astronauts made it back to Earth alive against some pretty steep odds. The film opens with astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) hosting a watch party in July 1969 for Neil Armstrong's historic first walk on the Moon. He is slated to command the Apollo 14 mission, and is ecstatic when he and his crew—Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton)—are bumped to Apollo 13 instead. His wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) is more superstitious and hence less thrilled: "It had to be 13." To which her pragmatic husband replies, "It comes after 12."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ars-reflects-on-apollo-13-turning-30/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hawking, a British physicist and arguably the most famous man suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), communicated with the world using a sensor installed in his glasses. That sensor used tiny movements of a single muscle in his cheek to select characters on a screen. Once he typed a full sentence at a rate of roughly one word per minute, the text was synthesized into speech by a DECtalk TC01 synthesizer, which gave him his iconic, robotic voice.</p>
<p>But a lot has changed since Hawking died in 2018. Recent brain-computer-interface (BCI) devices have made it possible to translate neural activity directly into text and even speech. Unfortunately, these systems had significant latency, often limiting the user to a predefined vocabulary, and they did not handle nuances of spoken language like pitch or prosody. Now, a team of scientists at the University of California, Davis has built a neural prosthesis that can instantly translate brain signals into sounds—phonemes and words. It may be the first real step we have taken toward a fully digital vocal tract.</p>
<h2>Text messaging</h2>
<p>“Our main goal is creating a flexible speech neuroprosthesis that enables a patient with paralysis to speak as fluently as possible, managing their own cadence, and be more expressive by letting them modulate their intonation,” says Maitreyee Wairagkar, a neuroprosthetics researcher at UC Davis who led the study. Developing a prosthesis ticking all these boxes was an enormous challenge because it meant Wairagkar’s team had to solve nearly all the problems BCI-based communication solutions have faced in the past. And they had quite a lot of problems.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-neural-brain-implant-provides-near-instantaneous-speech/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s a tumultuous time for copyright in the United States, with dozens of potentially <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/disney-universal-sue-midjourney/">economy-shaking</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-copyright-case-tracker/">AI copyright lawsuits</a> winding <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-scores-victory-ai-copyright-case/">through the courts</a>. It’s also the most turbulent moment in the US Copyright Office’s history. Described as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/technology/ai-copyright-office-law.html">sleepy</a>” in the past, the Copyright Office has taken on new prominence during the AI boom, issuing <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-art-copyright-matthew-allen/">key rulings</a> about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-copyright-office-loosens-up-a-little-on-ai/">AI and copyright</a>. It also hasn’t had a leader in more than a month.</p>
<p>In May, Copyright Register Shira Perlmutter was abruptly fired by email by the White House’s deputy director of personnel. Perlmutter is now <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.280893/gov.uscourts.dcd.280893.1.0_2.pdf">suing</a> the Trump administration, alleging that her firing was invalid; the government <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70345542/33/perlmutter-v-blanche/">maintains</a> that the executive branch has the authority to dismiss her. As the legality of the ouster is debated, the reality within the office is this: There’s effectively nobody in charge. And without a leader actually showing up at work, the Copyright Office is not totally business-as-usual; in fact, there’s debate over whether the copyright certificates it’s issuing could be challenged.</p>
<p>The firing followed a pattern. The USCO is part of the Library of Congress; Perlmutter had been appointed to her role by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. A few days before Perlmutter’s dismissal, Hayden, who had been in her role since 2016, was also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-library-of-congress-carla-hayden-20a1862ce6d2e0d51a84a37b264ce2ef">fired by the White House via email</a>.
