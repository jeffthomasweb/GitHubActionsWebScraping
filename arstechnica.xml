                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Lots of startups use Google's productivity suite, known as Workspace, to handle email, documents, and other back-office matters. Relatedly, lots of business-minded webapps use Google's OAuth, i.e. "Sign in with Google." It's a low-friction feedback loop—up until the startup fails, the domain goes up for sale, and somebody forgot to close down all the Google stuff.</p>
<p>Dylan Ayrey, of Truffle Security Co., <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/millions-at-risk-due-to-google-s-oauth-flaw">suggests in a report</a> that this problem is more serious than anyone, especially Google, is acknowledging. Many startups make the critical mistake of not properly closing their accounts—on both Google and other web-based apps—before letting their domains expire.</p>
<p>Given the number of people working for tech startups (6 million), the failure rate of said startups (90 percent), their usage of Google Workspaces (50 percent, all by Ayrey's numbers), and the speed at which startups tend to fall apart, there are a lot of Google-auth-connected domains up for sale at any time. That would not be an inherent problem, except that, as Ayrey shows, buying a domain with a still-active Google account can let you re-activate the Google accounts for former employees.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/startup-necromancy-dead-google-apps-domains-can-be-compromised-by-new-owners/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments that could determine if a Texas age-gating law preventing kids from accessing pornography online is overly burdensome for adults. A ruling against Texas could put an end to allegedly invasive age-verification laws in nearly 20 states.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A decision isn't expected until summer 2025, so it's too soon to say which way the court is leaning.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/supreme-court-will-review-texas-law-requiring-age-verification-on-porn-sites/">question before the court</a> is whether the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/texas-can-require-age-verification-on-porn-sites-5th-circuit-judges-rule/">5th Circuit was right</a> to stay a preliminary injunction that had previously been blocking Texas from enforcing the law or whether that decision should be reversed and remanded based on the level of constitutional scrutiny that the 5th Circuit applied.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/texas-age-verification-law-masks-broader-anti-porn-agenda-lawyer-warns-scotus/">Read full article</a></p>

      Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock returns in Marvel's new series <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p><em>Daredevil</em> is among <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/wilson-fisk-is-back-and-better-than-ever-in-season-3-of-daredevil/">my favorite stories</a> in the Netflix <em>Defenders</em> universe—along with <em>Jessica Jones—</em>in large part because Wilson Fisk (aka Kingpin, played to perfection by Vincent D'Onofrio), was such an incredibly complex and even occasionally sympathetic villain in the first and second seasons. I'm far from alone in this assessment, which explains why it was such a blow to fans when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/the-bloodbath-continues-netflix-cancels-daredevil-after-three-seasons/">Netflix canceled</a> the critically acclaimed <em>Daredevil</em> (and the rest of its <em>Defenders</em> series) in 2018, despite the showrunners' plans for a fourth season.</p>
<p>Charlie Cox's titular vigilante hero has since made a couple of cameos in other Marvel projects, most notably as a one-night stand for Tatiana Maslany's <em>She-Hulk</em> in 2022. That kept hope alive that <em>Daredevil</em> might be revived and/or re-imagined. The hope has paid off because Marvel Studios just released a trailer for the new nine-episode series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil:_Born_Again"><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em></a>. And the studio has already confirmed a second season as part of the MCU's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Five">Phase Five</a>.</p>
<p>D'Onofrio's Fisk (who also appeared in the limited series <em>Echo</em> and <em>Hawkeye</em>) is back, of course. Per the official premise: "Murdock, a blind lawyer with heightened abilities, is fighting for justice through his bustling law firm, while former mob boss Wilson Fisk pursues his own political endeavors in New York. When their past identities begin to emerge, both men find themselves on an inevitable collision course."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/the-trailer-for-daredevil-born-again-is-here/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Washington-based launch company <a href="https://www.stokespace.com/stoke-space-announces-260-million-in-new-investment/">announced Wednesday</a> that it has raised $260 million in Series C funding, a significant capital raise at a time when it has become more difficult for some space companies to attract funding.</p>
<p>"The market is tough, but I think what we’re doing is poised to go straight to the end state of the industry, and I think investors recognize that," said Andy Lapsa, Stoke Space's co-founder and chief executive officer, in an interview with Ars after the announcement.</p>
<p>By "end state of the industry," Lapsa means that Stoke is developing a fully reusable medium-lift rocket named Nova. The vehicle's first stage will land vertically, similarly to a Falcon 9 rocket, and the second stage, which has a novel metallic heat shield and engine design, will also land back on Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/stoke-space-raises-a-ton-of-money-as-it-moves-closer-to-debut-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Here at Ars, we're suckers for stories about hackers getting <em>Doom</em> running on everything from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/someone-made-a-captcha-where-you-play-doom-on-nightmare-difficulty/">CAPTCHA robot checks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/how-to-get-doom-running-in-windows-notepad-exe/">Windows' notepad.exe</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-model-can-hallucinate-a-game-of-1993s-doom-in-real-time/">AI hallucinations</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/can-it-run-doom-gut-bacteria-edition/">fluorescing gut bacteria</a>. Despite all that experience, we were still thrown for a loop by a recent demonstration of <a href="https://doompdf.pages.dev/doom.pdf"><em>Doom</em> running in the usually static confines of a PDF file</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://github.com/ading2210/doompdf">the Github page for the quixotic project</a>, coder ading2210 discusses how Adobe Acrobat included some robust support for JavaScript in the PDF file format. That JS coding support—which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121002164234/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/acrobat/sdk/AcroJSGuide.pdf">dates back decades</a> and is <a href="https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/jsapiref/JS_API_AcroJS.html">still fully documented</a> in Adobe's official PDF specs—is currently implemented in a more limited, more secure form as part of <a href="https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/HEAD/README.md">PDFium</a>, the built-in PDF-rendering engine of Chromium-based browsers.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Tires might be one of the more prosaic parts of a car, but they are undoubtedly among the most important. Bench racers might obsess about powertrain specs, and average consumers mostly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/from-rain-sensors-to-wireless-charging-the-10-tech-features-car-buyers-want/">want to know that there's wireless charging for their phones</a>, but it's the tires that actually make contact with the road. Without them, no one is going anywhere. At least not very far.</p>
<p>In the past, tires have been considered somewhat mysterious, with secret blends of rubber, carbon, and other stuff combined with clever arrangements of belts and wires to hold the whole thing together as it rotates faster and faster without flying apart. These days, we know an awful lot about how tires work. Or at least tire companies like Goodyear do, having amassed enough testing data to be able to simulate them accurately enough to shave months off a development schedule.</p>
<p>In fact, the use of simulation in tire research and development has quite a long history. Chris Helsel, who is now Goodyear's CTO, joined the company back in 1996; he was hired as part of a tiny team doing computer tire simulation. "At Goodyear in '96, it felt like almost late to the party in terms of doing what we call finite element analysis, which is basically breaking a large structure down into little parts," Helsel said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/tire-simulation-is-so-good-its-replacing-real-world-testing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Elon Musk yesterday over his late disclosure of a Twitter stock purchase in early 2022. Before Musk bought the whole company, he purchased a 9 percent stake in Twitter and failed to disclose it within 10 days as required under US law.</p>
<p>"Defendant Elon Musk failed to timely file with the SEC a beneficial ownership report disclosing his acquisition of more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Twitter's common stock in March 2022, in violation of the federal securities laws," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.276446/gov.uscourts.dcd.276446.1.0.pdf">SEC lawsuit</a> in US District Court for the District of Columbia. "As a result, Musk was able to continue purchasing shares at artificially low prices, allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his beneficial ownership report was due."</p>
<p>Twitter's stock price rose 27 percent once Musk belatedly disclosed his stake, the lawsuit said. "During the period that Musk was required to publicly disclose his beneficial ownership but had failed to do so, he spent more than $500 million purchasing additional shares of Twitter common stock," it said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/sec-sues-elon-musk-says-he-cheated-twitter-investors-out-of-150-million/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It has been a few years since AI began successfully tackling the challenge of predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins, complex molecules that are essential for all life. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/deepmind-adds-a-diffusion-engine-to-latest-protein-folding-software/">Next-generation tools</a> are now available, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/protein-structure-and-design-software-gets-the-chemistry-nobel/">Nobel Prizes have been handed out</a>. But people not involved in biology can be forgiven for asking whether any of it can actually make a difference.</p>
<p>A nice example of how the tools can be put to use is being released in Nature on Wednesday. A team that includes the University of Washington's David Baker, who picked up his Nobel in Stockholm last month, used software tools to design completely new proteins that are able to inhibit some of the toxins in snake venom. While not entirely successful, the work shows how the new software tools can let researchers tackle challenges that would otherwise be difficult or impossible.</p>
<h2>Blocking venom</h2>
<p>Snake venom includes a complicated mix of toxins, most of them proteins, that engage in a multi-front assault on anything unfortunate enough to get bitten. Right now, the primary treatment is to use a mix of antibodies that bind to these toxins, produced by injecting sub-lethal amounts of venom proteins into animals. But antivenon treatments tend to require refrigeration, and even then, they have a short shelf life. Ensuring a steady supply also means regularly injecting new animals and purifying more antibodies from them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/researchers-use-ai-to-design-proteins-that-block-snake-venom-toxins/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In 2023, AI researchers at Meta interviewed 34 native Spanish and Mandarin speakers who lived in the US but didn’t speak English. The goal was to find out what people who constantly rely on translation in their day-to-day activities expect from an AI translation tool. What those participants wanted was basically a Star Trek universal translator or the Babel Fish from the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>: an AI that could not only translate speech to speech in real time across multiple languages, but also preserve their voice, tone, mannerisms, and emotions. So, Meta assembled a team of over 50 people and got busy building it.</p>
<p>What this team came up with was a next-gen translation system called Seamless. The first building block of this system is described in Wednesday’s issue of Nature; it can translate speech among 36 different languages.</p>
<h2>Language data problems</h2>
<p>AI translation systems today are mostly focused on text, because huge amounts of text are available in a wide range of languages thanks to digitization and the Internet. Institutions like the United Nations or European Parliament routinely translate all their proceedings into the languages of all their member states, which means there are enormous databases comprising aligned documents prepared by professional human translators. You just needed to feed those huge, aligned text corpora into neural nets (or hidden Markov models before neural nets became all the rage) and you ended up with a reasonably good machine translation system. But there were two problems with that.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/meta-takes-us-a-step-closer-to-star-treks-universal-translator/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>News stories about the likely existence of extraterrestrial life, and our chances of detecting it, tend to be positive. We are often told that we might discover it any time now. Finding life beyond Earth is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-66950930">“only a matter of time,”</a> we were told in September 2023. “<a href="https://www.space.com/seti-nathalie-cabrol-the-secret-life-of-the-universe">We are close</a>” was a headline from September 2024.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why. Headlines such as “We’re probably not close” or “Nobody knows” aren’t very clickable. But what does the relevant community of experts actually think when considered as a whole? Are optimistic predictions common or rare? Is there even a consensus? In our new paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02451-0">published in Nature Astronomy</a>, we’ve found out.</p>
<p>During February to June 2024, we carried out four surveys regarding the likely existence of basic, complex, and intelligent extraterrestrial life. We sent emails to astrobiologists (scientists who study extraterrestrial life), as well as to scientists in other areas, including biologists and physicists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/is-humanity-alone-in-the-universe-what-scientists-really-think/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I almost missed it. Amid a bout of prime-time doomscrolling, a social media post reminded me there was something worth seeing in the sky. Mars disappeared behind the full Moon for a little more than an hour Monday night, an event visible across most of North America and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>So I grabbed my camera, ran outside, and looked up just as Mars was supposed to emerge from the Moon's curved horizon. Seen with the naked eye, the Moon's brightness far outshined Mars, casting soft shadows on a cold winter evening in East Texas.</p>
<p>Viewing the Moon through binoculars, the red planet appeared just above several large partially shadowed craters at the edge of the Moon's curved limb. I quickly snapped dozens of photos with my handheld Canon 80D fitted with a 600 mm lens. Within a few minutes, Mars rose farther above the Moon's horizon. Thanks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax">parallax effect</a>, the Moon's relative motion in its orbit around Earth appears significantly faster than the movement of Mars in its orbit around the Sun.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/there-was-a-straight-shot-from-earth-to-the-moon-and-mars-last-night/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The FBI <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-fbi-conduct-international-operation-delete-malware-used-china-backed">said today</a> that it removed Chinese malware from 4,258 US-based computers and networks by sending commands that forced the malware to use its "self-delete" function.</p>
<p>The People's Republic of China (PRC) government paid the Mustang Panda group to develop a version of PlugX malware used to infect, control, and steal information from victim computers, the FBI said. "Since at least 2014, Mustang Panda hackers then infiltrated thousands of computer systems in campaigns targeting US victims, as well as European and Asian governments and businesses, and Chinese dissident groups," the FBI said.</p>
<p>The malware has been <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2017/04/27/intrusions-affecting-multiple-victims-across-multiple-sectors">known for years</a>, but many Windows computers were still infected while their owners were unaware. The FBI learned of a method to remotely remove the malware from a French law enforcement agency, which had gained access to a command-and-control server that could send commands to infected computers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/fbi-forces-chinese-malware-to-delete-itself-from-thousands-of-us-computers/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Sonos won't replace Maxime Bouvat-Merlin in "redundant" role. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A day after announcing that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/sonos-ceo-behind-disastrous-app-exits-with-1-9-million-severance/">CEO Patrick Spence is departing</a> the company, Sonos revealed that Chief Product Officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin is also leaving. Bouvat-Merlin has been CPO since 2023.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/sonos-chief-product-officer-to-leave-interim-ceo-to-take-role">Bloomberg</a>, Sonos will not fill the chief product officer role. Instead, Tom Conrad, the interim CEO Sonos announced yesterday, will take on the role's responsibilities. In an email to staff cited by Bloomberg (you can read the letter in its entirety at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343873/sonos-product-officer-maxime-bouvat-merlin-leaving">The Verge</a>), Conrad explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>With my stepping in as CEO, the board, Max, and I have agreed that my background makes the chief product officer role redundant. Therefore, Max’s role is being eliminated and the product organization will report directly to me. I’ve asked Max to advise me over the next period to ensure a smooth transition and I am grateful that he’s agreed to do that.</p></blockquote>
<p>In May, Sonos released an update to its app that led to customers, many of them long-time users, revolting over broken features, like accessibility capabilities and the ability to set timers. Sonos expects that remedying the app and Sonos' reputation will cost it at least <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/app-redesign-blowback-will-cost-sonos-up-to-30-million-ceo-says/">$20 million to $30 million. </a></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/sonos-ousts-executive-blamed-for-rushing-botched-app-update/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Eli Lilly and other drugmakers are reportedly planning to urge the Trump administration to pause Medicare drug-price negotiations that were put in place by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).</p>
<p>"They need to fix [the IRA]," <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-13/lilly-asks-biden-administration-to-pause-drug-price-negotiations">Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told Bloomberg</a> at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/big-name-drugs-see-price-drops-in-first-round-of-medicare-negotiations/">The results of the first round of IRA negotiations</a>, announced in August, saw the list prices of 10 high-cost drugs get slashed by as much as 79 percent. Collectively, the negotiated prices are estimated to save seniors $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs in 2026, when the prices go into effect. The savings will likely be well received, given that KFF polling has found that <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/public-opinion-on-prescription-drugs-and-their-prices/">over a quarter of Americans struggle to afford prescription medications</a>, and 31 percent say they haven't taken medicines as prescribed due to costs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/maker-of-weight-loss-drugs-to-ask-trump-to-pause-price-negotiations-report/">Read full article</a></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg reviewed the internal memo explaining the cuts, which was posted to Meta's internal Workplace forum Tuesday. In it, Zuckerberg confirmed that Meta was shifting its strategy to "move out low performers faster" so that Meta can hire new talent to fill those vacancies this year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management," Zuckerberg said. "We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/meta-says-5-staff-cut-is-critical-to-further-ai-social-media/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday it is sending over $1 million in refunds to 6,764 consumers who purchased <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/review-i-wore-razers-zephyr-n95-mask-for-two-weeks-so-you-dont-have-to/">Razer Zephyr masks</a> that were deceptively marketed as providing N95 protection during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The FTC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/ftc-fines-razer-for-every-cent-made-selling-bogus-n95-grade-rgb-masks/">sued Razer</a> in April 2024, and the gaming-hardware company agreed to a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Razer-PACER-No3-1-ProposedStipulatedOrder.pdf">settlement,</a> including a $100,000 fine and $1,071,254.33 toward a fund for consumer relief. The payments are being distributed to mask buyers imminently, the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-sends-more-1-million-full-refunds-customers-deceived-false-claims-n95-grade-zephyr-face-masks">announced yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>"The FTC is sending checks and PayPal payments to 6,764 consumers who purchased the deceptively marketed products. Recipients will get a full refund," the agency said. "Consumers should cash their check within 90 days, as indicated on the check, or redeem their PayPal payment within 30 days."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/razer-sold-bogus-n95-mask-for-100-in-2021-users-finally-get-refunds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Plans to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/us-to-ban-chinese-connected-car-software-and-hardware-citing-security-risks/">block new vehicles</a> with software and hardware linked to either China or Russia are moving ahead. Today, the Department of Commerce published a final rule in the Federal Register that will prohibit the import of vehicles with Chinese or Russian connected-car vehicle software from model year 2027 and Chinese or Russian hardware from model year 2030.</p>
<p>While the move will no doubt protect domestic auto manufacturing from the threat of cheap imports, the ban has been proposed on national security grounds. Specifically, the US government has determined that "malign actors and foreign adversaries" could exploit the "progressively more complex hardware and software systems" on new cars. It also determined that the danger of that happening when that software or hardware is made by a company owned or controlled by either China or Russia is unacceptably high.</p>
<p>The proposed rule covers hardware and software that enable connectivity above 450 MHz and automated driving system software—the sensors or other ADS hardware is not covered by the rule. Originally, the government had also wanted to include OSes, telematics, battery management systems, and advanced driver assistance systems but narrowed the scope in response to public comments. (It also notes that while telematics are indeed a prime attack surface for a foreign adversary since they operate over cellular protocols, that's already covered.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/bidens-ban-on-chinese-and-russian-car-software-moves-ahead/">Read full article</a></p>
