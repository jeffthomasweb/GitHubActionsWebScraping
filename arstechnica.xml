<p>Earthquake scientists detected an unusual signal on monitoring stations used to detect seismic activity during September 2023. We saw it on sensors everywhere, from the Arctic to Antarctica.</p>
<p>We were baffled—the signal was unlike any previously recorded. Instead of the frequency-rich rumble typical of earthquakes, this was a monotonous hum, containing only a single vibration frequency. Even more puzzling was that the signal kept going for nine days.</p>
<p>Initially classified as a “USO”—an unidentified seismic object—the source of the signal was eventually traced back to a massive landslide in Greenland’s remote Dickson Fjord. A staggering volume of rock and ice, enough to fill 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, plunged into the fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high mega-tsunami and a phenomenon known as a seiche: a wave in the icy fjord that continued to slosh back and forth, some 10,000 times over nine days.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049682#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049682&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For many creatures, having a limb caught in a predator’s mouth is usually a death sentence. Not starfish, though—they can detach the limb and leave the predator something to chew on while they crawl away. But how can they pull this off?</p>
<p>Starfish and some other animals (including lizards and salamanders) are capable of autonomy (shedding a limb when attacked). The biology behind this phenomenon in starfish was largely unknown until now. An international team of researchers led by Maurice Elphick, professor of Animal Physiology and Neuroscience at Queen Mary University of London, have found that a neurohormone released by starfish is largely responsible for detaching limbs that end up in a predator’s jaws.</p>
<p>So how does this neurohormone (specifically a neuropeptide) let the starfish get away? When a starfish is under stress from a predatory attack, this hormone is secreted, stimulating a muscle at the base of the animal’s arm that allows the arm to break off.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049715#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049715&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are no strangers to time away from their families. Both are retired captains in the US Navy, served in war zones, and are veterans of previous six-month stays on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>When they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-successful-launch-boeings-starliner-runs-into-more-helium-leaks/">launched to the space station</a> on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5, the astronauts expected to be home in a few weeks, or perhaps a month, at most. Their minimum mission duration was eight days, but NASA was always likely to approve a short extension. Wilmore and Williams were the first astronauts to soar into orbit on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, a milestone achieved some seven years later than originally envisioned by Boeing and NASA.</p>
<p>However, the test flight fell short of all of its objectives. Wilmore and Williams are now a little more than three months into what has become an eight-month mission on the station. The Starliner spacecraft was beset by problems, culminating in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/after-latest-starliner-setback-will-boeing-ever-deliver-on-its-crew-contract/">decision last month by NASA officials</a> to send the capsules back to Earth without the two astronauts. Rather than coming home on Starliner, Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth in February on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049775#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049775&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In his announcement proposing to crack down on "unsafe, unfairly traded products," President Joe Biden accused China-founded e-commerce platforms selling cheap goods of abusing the "de minimis exemption" that makes shipments valued under $800 duty-free.</p>
<p>Platforms taking advantage of the exemption can share less information on packages and dodge taxes. Biden warned that "over the last 10 years, the number of shipments entering the United States claiming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis"><em>de minimis</em></a> exemption has increased significantly, from approximately 140 million a year to over 1 billion a year."

<p>Researchers still don’t know the cause of a recently discovered malware infection affecting almost 1.3 million streaming devices running an open source version of Android in almost 200 countries.</p>
<p>Security firm Doctor Web <a href="https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14900&amp;lng=en">reported Thursday</a> that malware named Android.Vo1d has backdoored the Android-based boxes by putting malicious components in their system storage area, where they can be updated with additional malware at any time by command-and-control servers. Google representatives said the infected devices are running operating systems based on the Android Open Source Project, a version overseen by Google but distinct from Android TV, a proprietary version restricted to licensed device makers.</p>
<h2>Dozens of variants</h2>
<p>Although Doctor Web has a thorough understanding of Vo1d and the exceptional reach it has achieved, company researchers say they have yet to determine the attack vector that has led to the infections.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049773#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049773&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tom Hardy is back for one last hurrah as investigative journalist Eddie Brock, host of an alien symbiote that imparts superhuman powers to its host, in the final trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom:_The_Last_Dance"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a>. The trailer has all the wise-cracking "buddy cop" vibes and fast-paced action we've come to expect from the franchise, including a trip to Vegas where Venom discovers the addictive allure of slot machines. But there are also hints of an inevitable bittersweet farewell—because this time they'll face off against Knull, god-creator of the symbiotes.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/its-the-battle-of-the-alien-symbiotes-in-venom-let-there-be-carnage-trailer/">previously reported</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(2018_film)">first film</a> in the franchise served as an origin story for our antihero. A bioengineering firm called the Life Foundation discovered a comet covered with symbiotic lifeforms and brought four samples back to Earth. Brock's then-fiancée, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), showed him classified documents revealing that the foundation was conducting human/symbiote experiments. The symbiotes needed oxygen-breathing hosts to survive, but they invariably ended up killing those hosts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049665#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049665&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Consumer Reports on Thursday reported the concentration of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-contaminants/high-lead-levels-in-cinnamon-powders-and-spice-mixtures-a4542246475/">lead it found in 36 ground cinnamon products</a>, leading to a round of startling headlines. The testing is particularly nerve-racking given that it closely follows the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/we-may-now-know-whos-behind-the-lead-tainted-cinnamon-in-toddler-fruit-pouches/">tragic poisoning</a> of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/news/outbreak-applesauce-pouches.html">at least 519 US children</a>, who were exposed to extremely high levels of lead from purposefully tainted cinnamon in applesauce snack pouches.</p>
<p>With that horrifying event in mind, parents are likely primed to be alarmed by any other lead findings in cinnamon. So, how concerning were the concentrations Consumer Reports found? And does one need to strictly adhere to the limits the organization recommends? By my calculations, not very and probably not. It's really not an alarming report.</p>
<p>Similar to the outlet's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/11/despite-spooky-consumer-reports-testing-metals-in-chocolates-arent-scary/">chocolate testing</a> before it, the lead concentrations found in cinnamons were largely within standard ranges. In all, the report is more of a reminder that trace amounts of heavy metals are present in various common foods. And such watchdog testing can play a crucial role in keeping consumers safe, especially with underfunded and underpowered regulators.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049761#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049761&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On Thursday, Google made <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15274899?hl=en">Gemini Live</a>, its voice-based AI chatbot feature, available for free to all Android users. The feature allows users to interact with Gemini through voice commands on their Android devices. That's notable because competitor OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode feature of ChatGPT, which is similar to Gemini Live, has not yet fully shipped.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Google unveiled Gemini Live during its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-phones-the-gemini-ai-stuff-reviewed/">Pixel 9 launch event</a> last month. Initially, the feature was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers, but now it's accessible to anyone using the Gemini app or its overlay on Android.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Gemini Live enables users to ask questions aloud and even interrupt the AI's responses mid-sentence. Users can choose from several voice options for Gemini's responses, adding a level of customization to the interaction.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049707#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049707&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earth has gone through many geologic phases, but it did have one striking period of stasis: Our planet experienced a tropical environment where algae and single-celled organisms flourished for almost 2 billion years. Then things changed drastically as the planet was plunged into a deep freeze.</p>
<p>It was previously unclear when Earth became a gargantuan freezer. Now, University College London researchers have found evidence in an outcrop of rocks in Scotland, known as the Port Askaig Formation, that show evidence of the transition from a tropical Earth to a frozen one 717 million years ago. This marks the onset of the Sturtian glaciation and would be the first of two "<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0303">snowball Earth</a>" events during which much of the planet’s surface was covered in ice. It is thought that multicellular life began to emerge after Earth thawed.</p>
<p>Found in the Scottish islands known as the Garvellachs, this outcrop within the Port Askaig Formation is unique because it offers the first conclusive evidence of when a tropical Earth froze over—underlying layers that are a timeline from a warmer era to a frigid one. Other rocks that formed during the same time period in other parts of the world lack this transitional evidence because ancient glaciers most likely scraped it off.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049611#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049611&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to my research, everyone has a butt.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean, when I'm imbibing my morning cuppa and reading up on the recent presidential debate, that I want to see an ad showing an illustrated derrière with a bar of soap clenched firmly between its two ripe cheeks.</p>

<p>More than 33,000 unionized Boeing workers went on strike Friday, rejecting what they say were unfair terms of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/to-avoid-strike-boeing-promises-25-pay-hike-and-to-build-next-jet-in-seattle/">deal the embattled aerospace company tentatively reached with their union</a>.</p>
<p>The rejected deal tried and failed to win over workers by offering a 25 percent wage increase and promised to build Boeing's next jet in the Puget Sound region in Washington, which Boeing claimed offered "job security for generations to come."</p>
<p>But after International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District 751 president Jon Holden urged the union to accept the deal—which Boeing said was the "largest-ever general wage increase" in the company's history—<a href="https://www.iam751.org/?zone=/unionactive/private_view_page.cfm&amp;page=IAM2FBoeing20Contract202024">hundreds of Boeing employees immediately began resisting</a> ahead of a Thursday vote that ultimately doomed the deal.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049657#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049657&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Almost nobody truly needed Neofetch, but the people who did use it? They really liked it.</p>
<p>Neofetch, run from a terminal, displayed key system information alongside an ASCII-art image of the operating system or distribution running on that system. You knew most of this data, but if you're taking a screenshot of your system, it looked cool and conveyed a lot of data in a small space. "The overall purpose of Neofetch is to be used in screen-shots of your system," wrote Neofetch's creator, Dylan Araps, on <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch">its Github repository</a>. "Neofetch shows the information other people want to see."</p>
<p>Neofetch did that, providing cool screenshots and proof-of-life images across nearly 150 OS versions until late April. The last update to the tool was made three years before that, and <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps">Araps' Github profile</a> now contains a rather succinct coda: "Have taken up farming." Araps joins "<a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/tromer/shelf/soul-machine.html">going to a commune in Vermont</a>" and "<a href="https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/267#issuecomment-695149477">I now make furniture out of wood</a>" in the pantheon of programmers who do not just leave the field, but flee into another realm entirely.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049004#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049004&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>United Airlines announced this morning that it is giving its in-flight Internet access an upgrade. It has signed a deal with Starlink to deliver SpaceX's satellite-based service to all its aircraft, a process that will start in 2025. And the good news for passengers is that the in-flight Wi-Fi will be free of charge.</p>
<p>The flying experience as it relates to consumer technology has come a very long way in the two-and-a-bit decades that Ars has been publishing. At the turn of the century, even having a power socket in your seat was a long shot. Laptop batteries didn't last that long, either—usually less than the runtime of whatever DVD I hoped to distract myself with, if memory serves.</p>
<p>Bring a spare battery and that might double, but it helped to have a book or magazine to read.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049628#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049628&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk has lambasted Australia’s government as “fascists” over proposed laws that could levy substantial fines on social media companies if they fail to comply with rules to combat the spread of disinformation and online scams.</p>
<p>The billionaire owner of social media site X posted the word “fascists” on Friday in response to the bill, which would strengthen the Australian media regulator’s ability to hold companies responsible for the content on their platforms and levy potential fines of up to 5 percent of global revenue. The bill, which was proposed this week, has yet to be passed.</p>
<p>Musk’s comments drew rebukes from senior Australian politicians, with Stephen Jones, Australia’s finance minister, telling national broadcaster ABC that it was “crackpot stuff” and the legislation was a matter of sovereignty.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049624#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049624&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It seems like common sense that being smart should increase the chances of survival in wild animals. Yet for a long time, scientists couldn’t demonstrate that because it was unclear how to tell exactly if a lion or a crocodile or a mountain chickadee was actually smart or not. Our best shots, so far, were looking at indirect metrics like brain size or doing lab tests of various cognitive skills such as reversal learning, an ability that can help an animal <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/bird-study-links-spatial-thinking-with-not-getting-eaten/">adapt to a changing environment</a>.</p>
<p>But a new, large-scale study on wild mountain chickadees, led by Joseph Welklin, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Nevada, showed that neither brain size nor reversal learning skills were correlated with survival. What mattered most for chickadees, small birds that save stashes of food, was simply remembering where they cached all their food. A chickadee didn’t need to be a genius to survive; it just needed to be good at its job.</p>

<p>“Chickadees cache one food item in one location, and they do this across a big area. They can have tens of thousands of caches. They do this in the fall and then, in the winter, they use a special kind of spatial memory to find those caches and retrieve the food. They are little birds, weight is like 12 grams, and they need to eat almost all the time. If they don’t eat for a few hours, they die,” explains Vladimir Pravosudov, an ornithologist at the University of Nevada and senior co-author of the study.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049604#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049604&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.11 of the Rocket Report! Outside of companies owned by American billionaires, the most imminent advancements in reusable rockets are coming from China's quasi-commercial launch industry. This industry is no longer nascent. After initially relying on solid-fueled rocket motors apparently derived from Chinese military missiles, China's privately funded launch firms are testing larger launchers, with varying degrees of success, and now performing hop tests reminiscent of SpaceX's Grasshopper and F9R Dev1 programs more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>Landspace hops closer to a reusable rocket. </b>Chinese private space startup Landspace has completed a 10-kilometer (33,000-foot) vertical takeoff and vertical landing test on its Zhuque-3 (ZQ-3) reusable rocket testbed, including a mid-flight engine reignition at near supersonic conditions, <a href="https://aviationweek.com/space/commercial-space/chinas-landspace-completes-zq-3-mid-flight-ignition-test">Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology reports</a>. The 18.3-meter (60-foot) vehicle took off from the Jiuquan launch base in northwestern China, ascended to 10,002 meters, and then made a vertical descent and achieved an on-target propulsive landing 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) from the launch pad. Notably, the rocket's methane-fueled variable-thrust engine intentionally shutdown in flight, then reignited for descent, as engines would operate on future full-scale booster flybacks. The test booster used grid fins and cold gas thrusters to control itself when its main engine was dormant, according to Landspace.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049526#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049526&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The CEO of a failed hospital system who was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/as-hospitals-failed-and-patients-died-ceo-reportedly-netted-250m/">paid hundreds of millions of dollars while patients were allegedly "killed and maimed"</a> in his resource-starved and rotting facilities, was a no-show at a Senate hearing on Thursday—despite a bipartisan subpoena compelling him to appear.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Ralph de la Torre—the Harvard University-trained cardiac surgeon who took over the Steward Health Care System in 2020—told senators in a letter last week that he was unable to testify at the hearing. Despite previously agreeing to the hearing, de la Torre and his lawyers argued that a federal court order stemming from Steward's bankruptcy case, filed in May, prevented him from discussing anything amid reorganization and settlement efforts.</p>
<p>But that argument was found to be without merit by the Senate committee that issued the subpoena in July—the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), chaired by Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). In <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bernie-sanders-steward-ceo-senate-subpoena-hearing-a3cd1d5ace8fe4073ae271ec228e56a1">comments to the Associated Press Wednesday</a>, Sanders said there were plenty of topics he could have safely discussed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049589#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049589&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Curiosity is the driving force behind all science, which may explain why so many scientists sometimes find themselves going in some decidedly eccentric research directions. Did you hear about the WWII plan to train pigeons as missile guidance systems? How about experiments on the swimming ability of a dead rainbow trout or that time biologists tried to startle cows by popping paper bags by their heads? These and other unusual research endeavors were honored tonight in a virtual ceremony to announce the 2024 recipients of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes. Yes, it's that time of year again, when the serious and the silly converge—for science.</p>
<p>Established in 1991, the Ig Nobels are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/the-serious-science-of-the-ig-nobel-prizes-will-make-you-laugh-then-think/" data-uri="b76aa749304ed60430d3dfdf9db8dee9">a good-natured parody</a> of the Nobel Prizes; they honor "achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think." The unapologetically campy awards ceremony features miniature operas, scientific demos, and the 24/7 lectures whereby experts must explain their work twice: once in 24 seconds and the second in just seven words. Acceptance speeches are limited to 60 seconds. And as the motto implies, the research being honored might seem ridiculous at first glance, but that doesn't mean it's devoid of scientific merit.</p>
<p>Viewers can tune in for the usual 24/7 lectures, as well as the premiere of a "non-opera" featuring various songs about water, in keeping with the evening's theme. In the weeks following the ceremony, the winners will also give free public talks, which will be posted on the Improbable Research website.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048255#p3">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048255&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Earlier this year, we got a look at something unusual: the results of an internal investigation conducted by Harvard Business School that concluded one of its star faculty members had committed research misconduct. Normally, these reports are kept confidential, leaving questions regarding the methods and extent of data manipulations.</p>
<p>But in this case, the report became public because the researcher had filed a lawsuit that alleged defamation on the part of the team of data detectives that had first identified potential cases of fabricated data, as well as Harvard Business School itself. Now, the court has ruled on motions to dismiss the case. While the suit against Harvard will go on, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.259933/gov.uscourts.mad.259933.74.0.pdf">the court has ruled</a> that evidence-backed conclusions regarding fabricated data cannot constitute defamation—which is probably a very good thing for science.</p>
<h2>Data and defamation</h2>
<p>The researchers who had been sued, Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson, and Joe Simmons, run a blog called <a href="https://datacolada.org/">Data Colada</a> where, among other things, they note cases of suspicious-looking data in the behavioral sciences. As we detailed in our earlier coverage, they published a series of blog posts describing an apparent case of fabricated data in four different papers published by the high-profile researcher Francesca Gino, a professor at Harvard Business School.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049567#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049567&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Unity, maker of a popular cross-platform engine and toolkit, will not pursue a broadly unpopular Runtime Fee that would have charged developers based on game installs rather than per-seat licenses. The move comes exactly one year after the fee's initial announcement.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">a blog post</a> attributed to President and CEO Matt Bromberg, the CEO writes that the company cannot continue "democratizing game development" without "a partnership built on trust." Bromberg states that customers understand the necessity of price increases, but not in "a novel and controversial new form." So game developers will not be charged per installation, but they will be sorted into Personal, Pro, and Enterprise tiers by level of revenue or funding.</p>
<p>"Canceling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners," Bromberg writes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049485#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049485&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
