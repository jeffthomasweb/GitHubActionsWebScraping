                            <![CDATA[<p>A high-severity zero-day in the widely used WinRAR file compressor is under active exploitation by two Russian cybercrime groups. The attacks backdoor computers that open malicious archives attached to phishing messages, some of which are personalized.</p>
<p>Security firm ESET <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/update-winrar-tools-now-romcom-and-others-exploiting-zero-day-vulnerability/">said Monday</a> that it first detected the attacks on July 18, when its telemetry spotted a file in an unusual directory path. By July 24, ESET determined that the behavior was linked to the exploitation of an unknown vulnerability in WinRAR, a utility for compressing files and has an installed base of about 500 million. ESET notified WinRAR developers the same day, and a fix was released six days later.</p>
<h2>Serious effort and resources</h2>
<p>The vulnerability seemed to have super Windows powers. It abused <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/c54dec26-1551-4d3a-a0ea-4fa40f848eb3">alternate data streams</a>, a Windows feature that allows different ways of representing the same file path. The exploit abused that feature to trigger a previously unknown path traversal flaw that caused WinRAR to plant malicious executables in attacker-chosen files paths %TEMP% and %LOCALAPPDATA%, which Windows normally makes off-limits because of their ability to execute code.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/high-severity-winrar-0-day-exploited-for-weeks-by-2-groups/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's been less than a week since the launch of OpenAI's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-launches-gpt-5-free-to-all-chatgpt-users/">GPT-5</a> AI model, and the rollout hasn't been a smooth one. So far, the release sparked one of the most intense user revolts in ChatGPT's history, forcing CEO Sam Altman to make an unusual public apology and reverse key decisions.</p>
<p>At the heart of the controversy has been OpenAI's decision to automatically remove access to all previous AI models in ChatGPT (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/some-chatgpt-users-now-face-9-ai-models-to-choose-from-after-gpt-4-1-launch/">approximately nine</a>, depending on how you count them) when GPT-5 rolled out to user accounts. Unlike API users who receive advance notice of model deprecations, consumer ChatGPT users had no warning that their preferred models would disappear overnight, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/8/surprise-deprecation-of-gpt-4o/">noted</a> independent AI researcher Simon Willison in a blog post.</p>
<p>The problems <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/chatgpt-users-outraged-as-gpt-5-replaces-the-models-they-love/">started immediately</a> after GPT-5's August 7 debut. A Reddit thread titled "GPT-5 is horrible" quickly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkd4l3/gpt5_is_horrible/">amassed</a> over 4,000 comments filled with users expressing frustration over the new release. By August 8, social media platforms were <a href="https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/chatgpt/chatgpt-users-are-not-happy-with-gpt-5-launch-as-thousands-take-to-reddit-claiming-the-new-upgrade-is-horrible">flooded</a> with complaints about performance issues, personality changes, and the forced removal of older models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-gpt-5-rollout-has-been-a-big-mess/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Boar's Head plans to reopen the Jarratt, Virginia, facility at the center of a deadly <em>Listeria </em>outbreak last year despite federal inspections continuing to find sanitation violations at three of the food company's other facilities, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/boars-head-deli-meat-listeria-e9a1cef1dca3f7545dba0024bf5ac594">according to federal records obtained by the Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>The AP obtained 35 pages of inspection reports via a Freedom of Information Act Request. Those reports cover inspections between January 1 and July 23 at three other Boar's Head facilities: Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia. Overall, the reports reveal a suite of violations, including mold, condensation dripping over food areas, overflowing trash, meat and fat residue built up on walls and equipment, drains blocked with meat scraps, and pooling meat juice. The reports also recorded staff who didn't wear the proper protective hairnets and aprons—and didn't wash their hands.</p>
<p>In one violation, reported in the Petersburg facility, inspectors found meat waste collecting under equipment, including "5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/boars-head-to-reopen-plant-as-mold-and-funky-meat-problems-pop-up-elsewhere/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After 34 years of connecting Americans to the Internet through phone lines, AOL <a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued">recently announced</a> it is shutting down its dial-up modem service on September 30, 2025. The announcement marks the end of a technology that served as the primary gateway to the World Wide Web for millions of users throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>AOL confirmed the shutdown date in a help message to customers: "AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. This service will no longer be available in AOL plans."</p>
<p>AOL's dial-up service launched as "America Online" in 1991, when the Internet consisted primarily of text-based content, although its dial-up roots extend back to a service launched in 1985 called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Link">Quantum Link</a> for Commodore computers. For the next few years, as the World Wide Web emerged, websites were measured in kilobytes, images were small and compressed, and video was essentially impossible. The service grew alongside the web itself, peaking at over 20 million subscribers in the early 2000s before broadband adoption accelerated its decline.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/aol-will-finally-end-1991-dial-up-internet-service-thats-older-than-smartphones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Reddit is now blocking the Internet Archive (IA) from indexing popular Reddit threads after allegedly catching sneaky AI firms—restricted from scraping Reddit—instead simply scraping data from IA's archived content.</p>
<p>Where before IA's Wayback Machine dependably archived Reddit pages, profiles, and comments—as part of its mission to archive the Internet—moving forward, only screenshots of the Reddit homepage will be archived. As The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757538/reddit-internet-archive-wayback-machine-block-limit">noted</a>, this means the archive will only be useful as a snapshot of popular posts and news headlines each day, rather than providing a backup documenting deleted posts or a window into various Reddit subcultures or any given user's activity.</p>
<p>Reddit has not confirmed which AI firms were scraping its data from the Wayback Machine. The company's spokesperson, Tim Rathschmidt, would only confirm to Ars that Reddit has become "aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/reddit-blocks-internet-archive-to-end-sneaky-ai-scraping/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has owned GitHub since 2018, but the widely used developer platform has operated with at least a little independence from the rest of the company, with its own separate CEO and other executives. But it looks like GitHub will be more fully folded into Microsoft's organizational chart starting next year—GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/goodbye-github/">announced today</a> that he would be leaving GitHub and Microsoft "to become a founder again."</p>
<p>"GitHub and its leadership team will continue its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more details shared soon," Dohmke wrote. "I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world."</p>
<p>Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/11/github-ceo-dohmke-step-down">reports</a> that Microsoft isn't directly replacing Dohmke, and GitHub's leadership team will be reporting to multiple executives in the CoreAI division.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/github-will-be-folded-into-microsoft-proper-as-ceo-steps-down/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia's parent organization lost a challenge to the UK Online Safety Act but can bring another case if the government tries to force it to verify the identity of Wikipedia users.</p>
<p>The High Court of Justice in London <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wikimedia-Foundation-and-another-v-Secretary-of-State-for-Science-Innovation-and-Technology.pdf">dismissed</a> claims from the Wikimedia Foundation, which challenged the lawfulness of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">categorization system</a> used to determine which sites must comply with obligations. But Justice Jeremy Johnson stressed "that this does not give Ofcom and the Secretary of State a green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia's operations."</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act has forced social media sites like Reddit to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/reddit-starts-verifying-ages-of-uk-users-to-comply-with-child-safety-law/">verify UK users' ages</a> before letting them view adult content. The Wikimedia Foundation is worried that it will be classified as a "Category 1" operator later this summer and <a href="https://medium.com/wikimedia-policy/wikipedias-nonprofit-host-brings-legal-challenge-to-new-online-safety-act-osa-regulations-0f9153102f29">criticized</a> the categorization regulations as "especially broad and vague."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/wikipedia-loses-uk-safety-act-challenge-worries-it-will-have-to-verify-user-ids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Early Monday morning, a Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from its original launch site in Florida. Remarkably, it was SpaceX's 100th launch of the year.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more notable was the rocket's payload: two-dozen Project Kuiper satellites, which were dispensed into low-Earth orbit on target. This was SpaceX's second launch of satellites for Amazon, which is developing a constellation to deliver low-latency broadband Internet around the world. SpaceX, then, just launched a direct competitor to its Starlink network into orbit. And it was for the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, who owns a rocket company of his own in Blue Origin.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent months, the AI industry has started <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-releases-new-simulated-reasoning-models-with-full-tool-access/">moving toward</a> so-called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">simulated reasoning models</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">use a "chain of thought" process</a> to work through tricky problems in multiple logical steps. At the same time, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/new-apple-study-challenges-whether-ai-models-truly-reason-through-problems/">recent</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/">research</a> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/">cast doubt</a> on whether those models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">have even a basic understanding of general logical concepts</a> or an accurate grasp of their own "thought process." Similar research shows that these "reasoning" models can often produce incoherent, logically unsound answers when questions include irrelevant clauses or deviate even slightly from common templates found in their training data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01191">a recent pre-print paper</a>, researchers from the University of Arizona summarize this existing work as "suggest[ing] that LLMs are not principled reasoners but rather sophisticated simulators of reasoning-like text." To pull on that thread, the researchers created a carefully controlled LLM environment in an attempt to measure just how well chain-of-thought reasoning works when presented with "out of domain" logical problems that don't match the specific logical patterns found in their training data.</p>
<p>The results suggest that the seemingly large performance leaps made by chain-of-thought models are "largely a brittle mirage" that "become[s] fragile and prone to failure even under moderate distribution shifts," the researchers write. "Rather than demonstrating a true understanding of text, CoT reasoning under task transformations appears to reflect a replication of patterns learned during training."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/researchers-find-llms-are-bad-at-logical-inference-good-at-fluent-nonsense/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta are reeling from a deadly shooting that unfolded Friday evening.</p>
<p>The shooting left one local police officer dead, <a href="https://x.com/cdcmonarez/status/1953989005122441401?s=46">at least four agency buildings</a> riddled with bullet holes, and terrified staffers feeling like "sitting ducks." Fortunately, no CDC staff or civilians were injured. But, it quickly drew a spotlight to US health secretary and zealous anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who critics accused of fueling the violence with his menacing and reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric.</p>
<p>Kennedy publicly <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1954197860754350238">responded to the shooting on social media</a> at about 11 am Eastern Time on Saturday, roughly 18 hours after the event. Former US Surgeon General Jerome Adams subsequently slammed Kennedy's delayed response as "<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/09/cdc-shooting-anti-vaccine-violence-rhetoric-public-health-workers/">tepid</a>" in a critical essay published in Stat. The news outlet <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/08/cdc-campus-attacked-kennedy-crisis/">separately pointed out</a> that Kennedy had posted on his personal social media account about 30 minutes prior to his response to the shooting, in which he shared <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1954188966367723917">pictures of a fishing trip</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/rfk-jr-posted-fishing-pics-as-cdc-reeled-from-shooting-linked-to-vaccine-disinfo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ahead of an August 12 deadline for a US-China trade deal, Donald Trump's tactics continue to confuse those trying to assess the country's national security priorities regarding its biggest geopolitical rival.</p>
<p>For months, Trump has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/tiktok-will-shut-down-soon-if-china-wont-agree-to-trumps-deal-official-says/">kicked the can down the road regarding a TikTok ban</a>, allowing the app to continue operating despite supposedly urgent national security concerns that China may be using the app to spy on Americans. And now, in the latest baffling move, a US official announced Monday that Trump got Nvidia and AMD to agree to "give the US government 15 percent of revenue from sales to China of advanced computer chips," Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-amd-pay-15-china-chip-sale-revenue-us-official-says-2025-08-11/">reported</a>. Those chips, about 20 policymakers and national security experts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/trump-caving-on-nvidia-h20-export-curbs-may-disrupt-his-bigger-trade-war/">recently warned Trump</a>, could be used to fuel China's frontier AI, which seemingly poses an even greater national security risk.</p>
<h2>Trump’s “wild” deal with US chip firms</h2>
<p>Reuters granted two officials anonymity to discuss Trump's deal with US chipmakers, because details have yet to be made public. Requiring US firms to pay for sales in China is an "unusual" move for a president, Reuters noted, and the Trump administration has yet to say what exactly it plans to do with the money.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/nvidia-amd-agree-to-pay-trumps-15-levy-on-china-chip-sales/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrC6I21URu4?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>It's easier than ever to manipulate video footage to deceive the viewer and increasingly difficult for fact checkers to detect such manipulations. Cornell University scientists developed a new weapon in this ongoing arms race: software that codes a "watermark" into light fluctuations, which in turn can reveal when the footage has been tampered with. The researchers presented the breakthrough over the weekend at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, British Columbia, and published a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3742892">scientific paper</a> in June in the journal ACM Transactions on Graphics.</p>
<p>“Video used to be treated as a source of truth, but that’s no longer an assumption we can make,” <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/07/hiding-secret-codes-light-protects-against-fake-videos">said</a> co-author <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/abe/group/">Abe Davis</a>, of Cornell University, who first conceived of the idea. “Now you can pretty much create video of whatever you want. That can be fun, but also problematic, because it’s only getting harder to tell what’s real.”</p>
<p>Per the authors, those seeking to deceive with video fakes have a fundamental advantage: equal access to authentic video footage, as well as the ready availability of advanced low-cost editing tools that can learn quickly from massive amounts of data, rendering the fakes nearly indistinguishable from authentic video. Thus far, progress on that front has outpaced the development of new forensic techniques designed to combat the problem. One key feature is information asymmetry: An effective forensic technique must have information not available to the fakers that cannot be learned from publicly available training data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/scientists-hid-secret-codes-in-light-to-combat-video-fakes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ford will debut a new midsize pickup truck in 2027 with a targeted price of $30,000, the automaker announced today. The as-yet unnamed pickup will be the first of a series of more affordable EVs from Ford, built using a newly designed flexible vehicle platform and US-made prismatic lithium iron phosphate batteries.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/ford-rethinks-ev-strategy-is-working-on-a-smaller-cheaper-ev-platform/">past few years</a>, a team of Ford employees has been hard at work on the far side of the country from the Blue Oval's base in Dearborn, Michigan. Sequestered in Long Beach and taking inspiration from Lockheed's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/05/kellys-heroes-lockheeds-five-finest-airplanes/">legendary</a> "skunkworks," the Electric Vehicle Development Center approached designing and building Ford's next family of EVs as a clean-sheet problem, presumably taking inspiration from the <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/764318/ford-ceo-china-evs-humbled/">Chinese EVs that have so impressed</a> Ford's CEO.</p>
<h2>It starts with a pickup</h2>
<p>Designing an EV from the ground up, free of decades of legacy cruft, is a good idea, but not one unique to Ford. In recent months, we've reviewed quite a few so-called software-defined vehicles, which replace dozens or even hundreds of discrete single-function electronic control units with a handful of powerful modern computers (usually known as domain controllers) on a high-speed network.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/ford-bets-big-on-universal-ev-production-system-and-30k-truck/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Later this summer, a fluorescent reddish-pink spiral will bloom across the Wilkinson Basin in the Gulf of Maine, about 40 miles northeast of Cape Cod. Scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will release the nontoxic water tracer dye behind their research vessel, where it will unfurl into a half-mile wide temporary plume, bright enough to catch the attention of passing boats and even satellites.</p>
<p>As it spreads, the researchers will track its movement to monitor a tightly controlled, federally approved experiment testing whether the ocean can be engineered to absorb more carbon, and in turn, help combat the climate crisis.</p>
<p>As the world struggles to stay below the 1.5° Celsius global warming threshold—a goal set out in the Paris Agreement to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change—experts agree that reducing greenhouse gas emissions won’t be enough to avoid overshooting this target. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, published in 2023, emphasizes the urgent need to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere, too.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/experiment-will-attempt-to-counter-climate-change-by-altering-ocean/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We have the first teaser for the second season of Netflix's live-action series adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece_(2023_TV_series)" data-uri="fd0ff1f4b7a902ace836feb2c9121a47"><em>One Piece</em></a>, subtitled <em>Into the Grand Line</em>. The streaming platform also released some first-look images and announced that the series has <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/one-piece-renewed-for-third-season-netflix-1236482980/">been renewed</a> for a third season.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/07/heres-the-trailer-for-the-live-action-one-piece-weve-been-waiting-for/">previously reported</a>, the original <em>One Piece</em> manga debuted in 1997, following the adventures of one Monkey D. Luffy, who heads a motley crew called the Straw Hat Pirates. There's swordsman Roronoa Zoro, thief and navigator Nami, sniper and compulsive liar Usopp, and a cook named Sanji. They're searching for the legendary One Piece, a mythical treasure that would make anyone who possesses it King of the Pirates. Monkey wants to be the Pirate King, but so do a host of other pirates with their own ships and crews.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/netflix-drops-one-piece-s2-teaser-renews-for-s3/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The first space race was about flags and footprints. Now, decades later, <a href="https://theconversation.com/returning-to-the-moon-can-benefit-commercial-military-and-political-sectors-a-space-policy-expert-explains-209300">landing on the Moon</a> is old news. The new race is to build there, and doing so hinges on power.</p>
<p>In April 2025, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-led-lunar-base-include-nuclear-power-plant-moons-surface-space-official-2025-04-23/">China reportedly</a> unveiled plans to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2035. This plant would support its planned <a href="https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202409/07/content_WS66dbeb9dc6d0868f4e8eab63.html">international lunar research station</a>. The <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/08/nasa-china-space-station-duffy-directives-00492172">United States countered</a> in August, when acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reportedly <a href="https://www.space.com/astronomy/moon/we-want-to-get-there-first-and-claim-that-for-america-nasa-chief-explains-push-for-nuclear-reactor-on-the-moon-video">suggested a US reactor</a> would be operational on the Moon by 2030.</p>
<p>While it might feel like a sudden sprint, this isn’t exactly breaking news. NASA and the Department of Energy have spent years quietly developing <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/space-technology-mission-directorate/tdm/fission-surface-power/">small nuclear power systems</a> to power lunar bases, mining operations, and long-term habitats.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/nasa-plans-to-build-a-nuclear-reactor-on-the-moon-a-space-lawyer-explains-why/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, researchers in the Netherlands <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tetra-radio-encryption-backdoor/">discovered an intentional backdoor</a> in an encryption algorithm baked into radios used by critical infrastructure–as well as police, intelligence agencies, and military forces around the world–that made any communication secured with the algorithm vulnerable to eavesdropping.</p>
<p>When the researchers publicly disclosed the issue in 2023, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), which developed the algorithm, advised anyone using it for sensitive communication to deploy an end-to-end encryption solution on top of the flawed algorithm to bolster the security of their communications.</p>
<p>But now the same researchers have found that at least one implementation of the end-to-end encryption solution endorsed by ETSI has a similar issue that makes it equally vulnerable to eavesdropping. The encryption algorithm used for the device they examined starts with a 128-bit key, but this gets compressed to 56 bits before it encrypts traffic, making it easier to crack. It’s not clear who is using this implementation of the end-to-end encryption algorithm, nor if anyone using devices with the end-to-end encryption is aware of the security vulnerability in them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/encryption-made-for-police-and-military-radios-may-be-easily-cracked/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Most adhesives can’t stick to wet surfaces because water and other fluids disrupt the adhesive’s bonding mechanisms. This problem, though, has been beautifully solved by evolution in remora suckerfish, which use an adhesive disk on top of their heads to attach to animals like dolphins, sharks, and even manta rays.</p>
<p>A team of MIT scientists has now taken a close look at these remora disks and reverse-engineered them. “Basically, we looked at nature for inspiration,” says Giovanni Traverso, a professor at MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering and senior author of the study.</p>
<h2>Sticking Variety</h2>
<p>Remora adhesive disks are an evolutionary adaptation of the fish’s first dorsal fin, the one that in other species sits on top of the body, just behind the head and gill covers. The disk rests on an intercalary backbone—a bone structure that most likely evolved from parts of the spine. This bony structure supports lamellae, specialized bony plates with tiny backward-facing spikes called spinules. The entire disk is covered with soft tissue compartments that are open at the top. “This makes the remora fish adhere very securely to soft-bodied, fast-moving marine hosts,” Traverso says.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/new-adhesive-surface-modeled-on-a-remora-works-underwater/">Read full article</a></p>
