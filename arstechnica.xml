              <![CDATA[<p>Although there's been a whole lot of pessimism recently, electric vehicle sales continue to grow, even if it is less quickly than many hoped. That's true in the commercial vehicle space as well—according to Cox Automotive, 87 percent of vehicle fleet operators expect to add EVs in the next five years, and more than half thought they were likely to buy EVs this year. And where and when to plug those EVs in to charge is a potential headache for fleet operators.</p>
<p>The good news is that charging infrastructure really is growing. It doesn't always feel that way—the $7.5 billion allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act for charging infrastructure has to be disbursed via state departments of transportation, so the process there has been anything but rapid. But according to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, the total number of public charging plugs <a href="https://driveelectric.gov/stations-growth?level_2=true&amp;dc_fast=true&amp;available=true&amp;temporarily_unavailable=true&amp;start_month=2021-01&amp;end_month=2024-11">has doubled since 2020</a>, to more than 144,000 level 2 plugs and closing in on 49,000 DC fast charger plugs.</p>
<p>There are ways to throw off a planned timeline when building out a station with multiple chargers. Obviously you need the funds to pay for it all—if these are to come from grants like the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, that had to wait for the states to each develop their own funding plans, then open for submissions, and so on, before even approving a project, for example.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/ev-charging-infrastructure-isnt-just-for-road-trippers/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Apple knowingly ignoring child porn is a "never-ending nightmare," lawsuit says.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of victims have <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Amy-et.-al.-v.-Apple-Case-24-cv-08832-Doc-1-Complaint-12-07-2024.pdf">sued</a> Apple over its alleged failure to detect and report illegal child pornography, also known as child sex abuse materials (CSAM).</p>
<p>The proposed class action comes after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/apple-details-reasons-to-abandon-csam-scanning-tool-more-controversy-ensues/">Apple scrapped a controversial CSAM-scanning tool</a> last fall that was supposed to significantly reduce CSAM spreading in its products. Apple defended its decision to kill the tool after <a href="applewebdata://EEFC054C-D7F9-4299-8D30-1A00EE287442/s">dozens of digital rights groups raised concerns</a> that the government could seek to use the functionality to illegally surveil Apple users for other reasons. Apple also was concerned that bad actors could use the functionality to exploit its users and sought to protect innocent users from false content flags.</p>
<p>Child sex abuse survivors suing have accused Apple of using the cybersecurity defense to ignore the tech giant's mandatory CSAM reporting duties. If they win over a jury, Apple could face more than $1.2 billion in penalties. And perhaps most notably for privacy advocates, Apple could also be forced to "identify, remove, and report CSAM on iCloud and implement policies, practices, and procedures to prevent continued dissemination of CSAM or child sex trafficking on Apple devices and services." That could mean a court order to implement the controversial tool or an alternative that meets industry standards for mass-detecting CSAM.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/thousands-of-child-sex-abuse-victims-sue-apple-for-lax-csam-reporting/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Archaeologists excavating a paleolithic cave site in Galilee, Israel, have found evidence that a deep-cave compound at the site may have been used for ritualistic gatherings, according to a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). That evidence includes the presence of a symbolically carved boulder in a prominent placement, and well as the remains of what may have been torches used to light the interior. And the acoustics would have been conducive to communal gatherings.</p>
<p>Dating back to the Early Upper Paleolithic period, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manot_Cave">Manot Cave</a> was found accidentally when a bulldozer broke open its roof during construction in 2008. Archaeologists soon swooped in and recovered such artifacts as stone tools, bits of charcoal, remains of various animals, and a nearly complete human skull.</p>
<p>The latter proved to be especially significant, as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14134">subsequent analysis</a> showed that the skull (dubbed Manot 1) had both Neanderthal and modern features and was estimated to be about 54,700 years old. That lent support to the hypothesis that modern humans co-existed and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3464203/">possibly interbred</a> with Neanderthals during a crucial transition period in the region, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3845641/">further bolstered</a> by genome sequencing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/paleolithic-deep-cave-compound-likely-used-for-rituals/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Reddit announced it would test an AI-powered search feature called "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/answers/">Reddit Answers</a>" that uses an AI model to create summaries from existing Reddit posts to respond to user questions, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/reddit-tests-ai-powered-feature-answer-user-queries-2024-12-09/">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The feature generates responses by searching through Reddit's vast collection of community discussions and comments. When users ask questions, Reddit Answers provides summaries of relevant conversations and includes links to related communities and posts.</p>
<p>The move potentially puts Reddit in competition with traditional search engines like Google and newer AI search tools like those from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openai-launches-chatgpt-with-search-taking-google-head-on/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/ai-search-engine-accused-of-plagiarism-announces-publisher-revenue-sharing-plan/">Perplexity</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>Cable broadband companies continue to insist that data caps are good for people with low incomes, pushing back against comments filed by consumer advocacy groups. NCTA—The Internet &amp; Television Association urged the Federal Communications Commission to avoid regulating the monthly data limits and overage charges that cable firms such as Comcast and Cox impose on many Internet plans.</p>
<p>Advocacy groups "suggest that usage-based pricing disproportionately harms low-income users, reasoning that these users are least able to afford overage fees if they exceed data thresholds," the NCTA said in <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/120202872553/1">comments</a> filed last week with the FCC. "However, in reality, usage-based pricing benefits low-income or price-sensitive consumers by providing additional options for less expensive plans."</p>
<p>The NCTA contends that "there is no basis for the assertion that regulation is warranted because low-income consumers are uniquely harmed by usage-based pricing. To the contrary, in many cases usage-based pricing provides more options for consumers, including lower-priced ones, which helps consumers stay connected."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/cable-isps-compare-data-caps-to-food-menus-dont-make-us-offer-unlimited-soup/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/">released</a> Sora Turbo, a new version of its text-to-video generation model, making it available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers through a <a href="https://sora.com/">dedicated website</a>. The model generates videos up to 20 seconds long at resolutions reaching 1080 p from a text or image prompt.</p>
<p>Open AI announced that Sora would be available today for ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers in the US and many parts of the world but is not yet available in Europe. As of early Monday afternoon, though, even existing Plus subscribers trying to use the tool are being presented with a message that "sign ups are temporarily unavailable" thanks to "heavy traffic."</p>
<p>Out of an abundance of caution, OpenAI is limiting Sora's ability to generate videos of people for the time being. At launch, uploads involving human subjects face restrictions while OpenAI refines its deepfake prevention systems. The platform also blocks content involving CSAM and sexual deepfakes. OpenAI says it maintains an active monitoring system and conducted testing to identify potential misuse scenarios before release.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/ten-months-after-first-tease-openai-launches-sora-video-generation-publicly/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like many sites, apps, and operating systems, Ars Technica has both "Light" and "Dark" visual styles. They look great! But even the "Light" mode has darker elements in it, and after our recent redesign, some Ars readers asked for an even lighter "Light" mode, one that would allow them to absolutely sear their own retinas with various shades of blinding white. (I kid, of course; for some readers, it's a serious visual comfort issue.)</p>
<p>We've spent the last month working up a third visual style to give the people what they want. Behold the fully armed and operational "Hyperlight" mode, our new visual theme featuring a white background, light gray headline boxes, and black text. You can activate it right now from the visual style menu on the navigation bar at the top of the page.</p>
<p>In total, we now have four visual modes. Hyperlight is the brightest of these, while Day &amp; Night is our rebranded "Light mode" and mixes light and dark elements. Dark is all dark backgrounds with light text. The fourth mode is System, which automatically switches between Day &amp; Night and Dark modes based on your operating system setting. (System will not switch the site to Hyperlight.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/12/meet-hyperlight-ars-technicas-new-even-brighter-light-mode/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Monday, TikTok filed an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TikTok-v-Garland-Temporary-Injunction-12-9-24.pdf">emergency motion</a> requesting a temporary injunction on a US law that requires its owner, ByteDance, to sell off TikTok by January 19 or else be banned in the US due to national security concerns.</p>
<p>Planning to appeal to the Supreme Court to block the law on First Amendment grounds, TikTok urged the court to delay enforcing the law until SCOTUS has ample time to review the constitutionality of the law, which would impact millions of American speakers who use TikTok each month. TikTok also argued that Trump could "moot" SCOTUS review if he decides to "save" TikTok, as he promised on the campaign trail.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/tiktok-asks-court-to-block-ban-ahead-of-scotus-appeal/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Nature released a paper from Google's quantum computing team that provides a key demonstration of the potential of quantum error correction. Thanks to an improved processor, Google's team found that increasing the number of hardware qubits dedicated to an error-corrected logical qubit led to an exponential increase in performance. By the time the entire 105-qubit processor was dedicated to hosting a single error-corrected qubit, the system was stable for an average of an hour.</p>
<p>In fact, Google told Ars that errors on this single logical qubit were rare enough that it was difficult to study them. The work provides a significant validation that quantum error correction is likely to be capable of supporting the execution of complex algorithms that might require hours to execute.</p>
<h2>A new fab</h2>
<p>Google is making a number of announcements in association with the paper's release (an earlier version of the paper has been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13687v1">up on the arXiv</a> since August). One of those is that the company is committed enough to its quantum computing efforts that it has built its own fabrication facility for its superconducting processors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/google-gets-an-error-corrected-quantum-bit-to-be-stable-for-an-hour/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Popular indie game platform itch.io says its domain was briefly taken down for a few hours Monday morning thanks to an "AI-driven" phishing report spurred by the company behind Funko Pop figures.</p>
<p>Itch.io management <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3lcu6h465bs2n">posted about the domain takedown on social media overnight</a>, complaining of a chain of events that started because "Funko of 'Funko Pop'... use some trash 'AI Powered' Brand Protection Software called BrandShield that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain," the post said.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42363727">a Hacker News comment</a>, <a href="https://leafo.itch.io/">Itch.io founder Leaf "Leafo" Cohran</a> said that the BrandShield complaint seems to have originated from a single itch.io user who "made a fan page for an existing Funko Pop video game (Funko Fusion), with links to the official site and screenshots of the game." That led to independent reports to Itch's host and registrar of "fraud and phishing" a few days ago.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/itch-io-platform-briefly-goes-down-to-ai-driven-anti-phishing-report/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the selling points of the Raspberry Pi 5 (released in October 2023) is that it was fast enough and had enough memory to be a credible general-purpose desktop PC, if not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/what-i-learned-from-using-a-raspberry-pi-5-as-my-main-computer-for-two-weeks/">an especially fast one</a>. For Pi-as-desktop enthusiasts, the company has a couple of new pre-holiday announcements. The biggest is the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-500/">Raspberry Pi 500</a>, which fits the components of an 8GB Pi 5 into a small keyboard-shaped case for $90.</p>
<p>It's a follow-up to the original Raspberry Pi 400, and like that system, it takes the components from the regular Pi 5 board and puts them on a different PCB with all of the ports positioned in a single row across the back of the device. It includes one USB 2.0 port, two USB 3.0 ports, a microSD slot, two micro HDMI ports, the 40-pin GPIO header, and a gigabit Ethernet port.</p>
<p>In addition to the standalone $90 system, the Pi 500 will also be sold as part of a Desktop Kit with a mouse, power supply, HDMI cable, and printed Beginner's Guide booklet for $120.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/raspberry-pi-500-updates-sub-100-desktop-pc-with-more-speed-optional-monitor/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this fall, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20obesity%20among,or%20in%20any%20age%20group.">reported</a> data showing that adult obesity rates—long trending upwards—had fallen modestly over the past few years, from 41.9 to 40.3 percent. The decline sparked discussion on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1fw6rhg/the_us_has_passed_peak_obesity_a_new_survey/?rdt=35656">social media</a> and in major <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/08/obesity-rate-ozempic-wegovy/">news</a> <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/health/obesity-rates-us-ozempic-weight-loss-b2624064.html">outlets</a> about whether the US has passed so-called “peak obesity”—and whether the growing use of certain weight-loss drugs might account for the shift.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/21bd0b9c-a3c4-4c7c-bc6e-7bb6c3556a56?">opinion piece</a> in the Financial Times suggested that the public health world might look back on the current moment in much the same way that it now reflects on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/01/archives/tobacco-industrys-peak-year-523-billion-cigarettes-smoked.html">1963</a>, when cigarette sales hit their high point and then dropped dramatically over the following decades. The article’s author, John Burn-Murdoch, speculated that the dip is “highly likely” to be caused by the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s, for weight loss.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why one might make that connection. Although GLP-1s have been <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7042958/#:~:text=">used for nearly two decades</a> in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, their use for obesity only took off more recently. In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4772342/">approved</a> a GLP-1 agonist named Saxenda specifically for this purpose. Then in the late 2010s, a GLP-1 drug named Ozempic, made from the active ingredient semaglutide, began to be <a href="https://healthcostinstitute.org/hcci-originals-dropdown/topics/diabetes-and-insulin/ozempic-users-with-diabetes-have-decreased-over-time-indicating-increased-off-label-use">used off-label</a>. The FDA also <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014">authorized</a> Wegovy, another semaglutide-based GLP-1 medication, explicitly for weight loss in 2021.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/obesity-rates-are-down-is-that-because-of-weight-loss-drugs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Physicists have been puzzling over conflicting observational results pertaining to the accelerating expansion rate of our Universe—a major discovery recognized by the 2011 <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2011/press-release/">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>. New observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed that prior measurements of distances between nearby stars and galaxies made by the Hubble Space Telescope are not in error, according to a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal. That means the discrepancy between observation and our current theoretical model of the Universe is more likely to be due to new physics.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/gravitational-lens-gives-us-a-third-estimate-of-the-universes-expansion/">previously reported</a>, the Hubble Constant is a measure of the Universe's expansion expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (Mpc). So, each second, every megaparsec of the Universe expands by a certain number of kilometers. Another way to think of this is in terms of a relatively stationary object a megaparsec away: Each second, it gets a number of kilometers more distant.</p>
<p>How many kilometers? That's the problem here. There are basically three methods scientists use to measure the Hubble Constant: looking at nearby objects to see how fast they are moving, gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes or neutron stars, and measuring tiny deviations in the afterglow of the Big Bang known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). However, the various methods have come up with different values. For instance, tracking distant supernovae produced a value of 73 km/s Mpc, while measurements of the CMB using the Planck satellite produced a value of 67 km/s Mpc.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/latest-james-webb-data-hints-at-new-physics-in-universes-expansion/">Read full article</a></p>

      <em>The Wheel of Time</em> returns to Prime Video in March.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Prime Video released a one-minute teaser for its fantasy series <em>The Wheel of Time</em> at CCXP24 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The series is adapted from the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jordan">Robert Jordan</a>'s bestselling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">14-book series</a> of epic fantasy novels, and Ars has been following it closely with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/09/things-get-serious-this-week-in-a-really-solid-the-wheel-of-time-episode/">regular recaps</a> through the first two seasons. Judging from the new teaser, the battle between light and dark is heating up as the Dragon Reborn comes into his power.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for first two seasons below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/the-wheel-of-time-teaser-is-here-and-it-looks-and-feels-exactly-right/">previously reported</a>, the series centers on Moiraine (<a href="https://deadline.com/2019/06/rosamund-pike-the-wheel-of-time-tv-adaptation-amazon-1202634993/">played by</a> Oscar-nominee Rosamund Pike), a member of a powerful, all-woman organization called the Aes Sedai. Magic, known as the One Power, is divided into male (<em>saidin</em>) and female (<em>saidar</em>) flavors. The latter is the province of the Aes Sedai. Long ago, a great evil, called the Dark One, caused the <em>saidin</em> to become tainted, such that most men who show an ability to channel that magic go mad. It's the job of the Aes Sedai to track down such men and strip them of their abilities—a process known as "gentling" that, unfortunately, is often anything but. There is also an ancient prophecy concerning the Dragon Reborn: the reincarnation of a person who will save or destroy humanity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/the-shadows-roots-take-hold-in-wheel-of-time-s3-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

      <em>Severance</em> returns to Apple TV+ in January for its sophomore season.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p><em>Severance</em> was one of the most talked-about TV series of 2022, receiving widespread critical acclaim. We loved the series so much that Ars staffers actually wrote <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/severance-is-a-show-about-connection-plus-melon-parties-cults-and-baby-goats/">a group review</a> so that everyone could weigh in with their thoughts on the first season, pronouncing it "one of the best shows on TV." Needless to say, we have been eagerly awaiting the second season next month. Apple TV+ just released the official trailer at CCXP24 in São Paulo, Brazil, and it does not disappoint.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for first season below.)</strong></p>
<p>In the world of <em>Severance</em>, people can completely disconnect their work and personal lives. Thanks to a new procedure developed by Lumon Industries, workers can bifurcate themselves into "innies" (work selves) and "outies" (personal selves)—with no sharing of memories between them. This appeals to people like Mark (Adam Scott), who lost his wife in a car crash and has struggled to work through the grief. Why not forget all that pain for eight hours a day?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/12/innie-rebellion-is-brewing-in-trippy-severance-s2-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On the evening of November 19, art adviser Adam Biesk was finishing work at his California home when he overheard a conversation between his wife and son, who had just come downstairs. The son, a kid in his early teens, was saying he had made a ton of money on a cryptocurrency that he himself had created.</p>
<p>Initially, Biesk ignored it. He knew that his son played around with crypto, but to have turned a small fortune before bedtime was too far-fetched. “We didn’t really believe it,” says Biesk. But when the phone started to ring off the hook and his wife was flooded with angry messages on Instagram, Biesk realized that his son was telling the truth—if not quite the full story.</p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth"><em>Lamborghini provided flights from Albany, New York, to Bologna, Italy, and accommodation so Ars could drive the Urus SE. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</em></aside>
<p>The original Urus was an SUV that nobody particularly wanted, even if the market was demanding it. With luxury manufacturers tripping over themselves to capitalize on a seemingly limitless demand for taller all-around machines, Lamborghini was a little late to the party.</p>
<p>The resulting SUV has done its job, boosting Lamborghini's sales and making up more than half of the company's volume last year. Even so, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/if-you-cant-beat-them-lamborghini-joins-the-suv-set/">the first attempt</a> was just a bit tame. That most aggressive of supercar manufacturers produced an SUV featuring the air of the company's lower, more outrageous performance machines, but it didn't quite deliver the level of prestige that its price demanded.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/the-fastest-suv-our-first-drive-in-lamborghinis-641-horsepower-urus/">Urus Performante</a> changed that, adding enough visual and driving personality to make itself a legitimately exciting machine to drive or to look at. Along the way, though, it lost a bit of the most crucial aspect of an SUV: everyday livability. On paper, the Urus SE is just a plug-in version of the Urus, with a big battery adding some emissions-free range. In reality, it's an SUV with more performance and more flexibility, too. This is the Urus' Goldilocks moment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/2025-lamborghini-urus-se-first-drive-the-total-taurean-package/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In March, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-genie-model-creates-interactive-2d-worlds-from-a-single-image/">showed off its first Genie AI model</a>. After training on thousands of hours of 2D run-and-jump video games, the model could generate halfway-passable interactive impressions of those games based on generic images or text descriptions.</p>
<p>Nine months later, this week's <a href="https://deep%20mind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/">reveal of the Genie 2 model</a> expands that idea into the realm of fully 3D worlds, complete with controllable third- or first-person avatars. Google's announcement talks up Genie 2's role as a "foundational world model" that can create a fully interactive internal representation of a virtual environment. That could allow AI agents to train themselves in synthetic but realistic environments, Google says, forming an important stepping stone on the way to artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>But while Genie 2 shows just how much progress Google's Deepmind team has achieved in the last nine months, the limited public information about the model thus far leaves a lot of questions about how close we are to these foundational model worlds being useful for anything but some short but sweet demos.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Within hours of NASA announcing its decision to fly the Artemis II mission aboard an Orion spacecraft with an unmodified heat shield, critics assailed the space agency, saying it had made the wrong decision.</p>
<p>"Expediency won over safety and good materials science and engineering. Sad day for NASA," Ed Pope, an expert in advanced materials and heat shields, wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7270570432926224384/">on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>There is a lot riding on NASA's decision, as the Artemis II mission involves four astronauts and the space agency's first crewed mission into deep space in more than 50 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/former-flight-director-who-reviewed-orion-heat-shield-data-says-there-was-no-dissent/">Read full article</a></p>
