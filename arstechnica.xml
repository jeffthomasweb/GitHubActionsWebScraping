                            <![CDATA[<p>Netflix held its Tudum Global Fan Event in Los Angeles this weekend to showcase its upcoming slate of programming. Among the highlights: the official trailer for the third and final season of <em>Squid Game</em>, the first six minutes of <em>Wednesday</em> S2, a teaser for Guillermo del Toro's <em>Frankenstein</em>, and date announcements for the fifth and final season of <em>Stranger Things,</em> as well as <em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<h2><em>Squid Game</em> S3</h2>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgGTVaG2UiQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/player-456-is-back-for-revenge-in-squid-game-s2-trailer/">previously reported</a>, S<em>quid Game</em>'s first season followed Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-Jae), a down-on-his-luck gambler who has little left to lose when he agrees to play children's playground games against 455 other players for money. The twist? If you lose a game, you die. If you cheat, you die. And if you win, you might also die. In the S1 finale, Gi-hun faced off against fellow finalist and childhood friend Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo) in the titular "squid game." He won their fight but refused to kill his friend. Sang-woo instead stabbed himself in the neck, leaving Gi-hun the guilt-ridden winner.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/netflix-drops-squid-game-s3-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

Among smart TVs, streaming sticks, and other streaming devices, Apple TVs are largely viewed as a safe haven.</p>
<p>"Just disconnect your TV from the Internet and use an Apple TV box."</p>
<p>That's the common guidance you'll hear from Ars readers for those seeking the joys of streaming without giving up too much privacy. Based on our research and the experts we've consulted, that advice is pretty solid, as Apple TVs offer significantly more privacy than other streaming hardware providers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/all-the-ways-apple-tv-boxes-do-and-mostly-dont-track-you/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's a regrettable reality that there is never time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. May's list includes a nifty experiment to make a predicted effect of special relativity visible; a ping-pong playing robot that can return hits with 88 percent accuracy; and the discovery of the rare genetic mutation that makes orange cats orange, among other highlights.</p>
<h2>Special relativity made visible</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most well-known feature of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity is time dilation and length contraction. In 1959, two physicists predicted another feature of relativistic motion: An object moving near the speed of light should also appear to be rotated. It has not been possible to demonstrate this experimentally, however—until now. Physicists at the Vienna University of Technology figured out how to reproduce this rotational effect in the lab using laser pulses and precision cameras, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02003-6">a paper</a> published in the journal Communications Physics.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/research-roundup-ping-pong-bots-the-genetic-key-for-ginger-cats-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/31/2025/white-house-expected-to-pull-nasa-nominee-isaacman">First reported</a> by Semafor, the decision appears to have been made because Isaacman was not politically loyal enough to the Trump administration.</p>
<p>"The Administrator of NASA will help lead humanity into space and execute President Trump’s bold mission of planting the American flag on the planet Mars," Liz Huston, a White House Spokesperson, said in a statement released Saturday. "It's essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump’s America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/trump-pulls-isaacman-nomination-for-space-source-nasa-is-fed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For years, members of the Russian cybercrime cartel <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/">Trickbot</a> unleashed a relentless hacking spree on the world. The group attacked thousands of victims, including businesses, schools, and hospitals. “Fuck clinics in the usa this week,” one member wrote in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/">internal Trickbot messages</a> in 2020 about a list of 428 hospitals to target. Orchestrated by an enigmatic leader using the online moniker “Stern,” the group of around 100 cybercriminals stole hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of roughly six years.</p>
<p>Despite a wave of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cyber-command-hackers-trickbot-botnet-precedent/">law enforcement</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conti-trickbot-ransomware-sanctions-uk-us/">disruptions</a> and a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/costa-rica-ransomware-conti/">damaging</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conti-leaks-ransomware-work-life/">leak of more than 60,000 internal chat messages</a> from Trickbot and the closely associated counterpart group Conti, the identity of Stern has remained a mystery. Last week, though, Germany’s federal police agency, the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA, and local prosecutors <a href="https://www.bka.de/DE/IhreSicherheit/Fahndungen/Personen/BekanntePersonen/Endgame_2/KVN/Sachverhalt.html">alleged that Stern’s real-world name is Vi­ta­ly Ni­ko­lae­vich Kovalev</a>, a 36-year-old, 5-foot-11-inch Russian man who cops believe is in his home country and thus shielded from potential extradition.</p>
<p>A recently issued Interpol <a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices/View-Red-Notices#2025-39252">red notice</a> says that Kovalev is wanted by Germany for allegedly being the “ringleader” of a “criminal organisation.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/german-police-say-theyve-identified-trickbot-ransomware-kingpin/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since Google released its Veo 3 AI model last week, social media users have been having fun with its ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">quickly generate highly realistic eight-second clips complete with sound and lip-synced dialogue</a>. TikTok's algorithm has been serving me plenty of Veo-generated videos featuring <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8MrUDpt/">impossible challenges</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@echofueltv/video/7510331996917304622?">fake news reports</a>, and even <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8MrCJNm/">surreal short narrative films</a>, to name just a few popular archetypes.</p>
<p>However, among all the AI-generated video experiments spreading around, I've also noticed a surprising counter-trend on my TikTok feed. Amid all the videos of Veo-generated avatars pretending to be real people, there are now also a bunch of videos of real people pretending to be Veo-generated avatars.</p>
<h2>“This has to be real. There’s no way it's AI.”</h2>
<p>I stumbled on this trend when the TikTok algorithm fed me <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kongosmusic/video/7509895663065500974">this video</a> topped with the extra-large caption "Google VEO 3 THIS IS 100% AI." As I watched and listened to the purported AI-generated band that appeared to be playing in the crowded corner of someone's living room, I read the caption containing the supposed prompt that had generated the clip: "a band of brothers with beards playing rock music in 6/8 with an accordion."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/real-tiktokers-are-pretending-to-be-veo-3-ai-creations-for-fun-attention/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>From its humble beginnings in the late 20th century, Google has come to dominate online searches, putting it squarely in the US government's antitrust crosshairs. The ongoing search antitrust case threatens to upend Google's dominance, giving smaller players a chance to thrive and possibly wiping others out. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/">wrapping up testimony</a> in the case earlier this month, lawyers for Google and the Department of Justice have now made their closing arguments.</p>
<p>The DOJ won the initial trial, securing a ruling that Google used anticompetitive practices to maintain its monopoly in general search. During the time this case has taken to meander its way through the legal system, the online landscape has been radically altered, making it harder than ever to envision a post-Google Internet.</p>
<p>To address Google's monopoly, the DOJ is asking United States District Judge Amit Mehta to impose limits on Google's business dealings and order a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">divestment of the Chrome browser</a>. Forcing the sale of Chrome would be a major penalty and a coup for the DOJ lawyers, but this issue has been overshadowed somewhat as the case drags on. During closing arguments, the two sides dueled over how Google's search deals and the rise of AI could change the Internet as we know it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-and-doj-tussle-over-how-ai-will-remake-the-web-in-antitrust-closing-arguments/">Read full article</a></p>

Technologies from other media conglomerates, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, are also enabling what the report’s authors deem an “industrial scale of theft."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.endersanalysis.com/reports/video-piracy-big-tech-clearly-unwilling-address-problem">The report</a>, "Video piracy: Big tech is clearly unwilling to address the problem," focuses on the European market but highlights the global growth of piracy of streaming services as they increasingly acquire rights to live programs, like sporting events.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3n7dx2174o">BBC</a>, the report points to the availability of multiple, simultaneous illegal streams for big events that draw tens of thousands of pirate viewers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/amazon-fire-sticks-enable-billions-of-dollars-worth-of-streaming-piracy/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Given that Laatsch was one of those who "watched the watchers," he appears to have had supreme confidence in his own ability to avoid detection should he decide to go rogue.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has failed to reverse a preliminary injunction currently blocking him from probing Media Matters for America (MMFA) in defense of Elon Musk's social media platform X.</p>
<p>On Friday, a US appeals court <a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2025/05/24-7059-2118197.pdf">upheld</a> the injunction. In his opinion, senior Circuit Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that there was "ample" evidence that Paxton "pursued a retaliatory campaign" against MMFA "because they published an unfavorable article about X.com." And MMFA has standing to raise a First Amendment defense, because "the First Amendment generally 'prohibits government officials from subjecting individuals to retaliatory actions after the fact for having engaged in protected speech," Edwards wrote.</p>
<p>Edwards noted that the day after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/elon-musk-sues-media-matters-despite-admitting-x-paired-ads-with-nazi-content/">X sued MMFA</a> over reporting on antisemitic posts appearing next to big brands' ads on X—alleging the report fraudulently spawned an ad boycott—Paxton announced a broad probe into MMFA that, he confirmed in a press release, was directly due to X's lawsuit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/texas-ag-loses-appeal-to-seize-evidence-for-elon-musks-ad-boycott-fight/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hugging Face is best known as a platform for machine learning and AI development, but it has also been dabbling in the world of robotics. This week, the company revealed two new robots it plans to bring to market—including a humanoid one that it would sell for around $3,000, far less than many of the other options that have been floated, like Unitree's $16,000 G1.</p>
<p>Dubbed the HopeJR, Hugging Face's robot has up to 66 actuated degrees of freedom. According to Hugging Face Principal Research Scientist Remi Cadene, it can walk and manipulate objects. As shown in <a href="https://x.com/RemiCadene/status/1928015436630634517">a short X video</a>, it has an accessible look that reminds us a bit of Bender from <em>Futurama</em>. (It's the eyes.)</p>
<p>Co-designed with French robotics company The Robot Studio, HopeJR will be open source. "The important aspect is that these robots are open source, so anyone can assemble, rebuild, [and] understand how they work, and [they’re] affordable, so that robotics doesn’t get dominated by just a few big players with dangerous black-box systems," Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/29/hugging-face-unveils-two-new-humanoid-robots/">told TechCrunch</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/hugging-face-hopes-to-bring-a-humanoid-robot-to-market-for-just-3000/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The online incel ("involuntary celibate") subculture is mostly known for its extreme rhetoric, primarily against women, sometimes erupting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Isla_Vista_killings">into violence</a>. But a growing number of self-identified incels are using their ideology as an excuse for not working or studying. This could constitute a kind of coping mechanism to make sense of their failures—not just in romantic relationships but also in education and employment, according to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gwao.13248">a paper</a> published in the journal Gender, Work, &amp; Organization.</p>
<p>Contrary to how it's often portrayed, the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere">manosphere,</a>" as it is often called, is not a monolith. Those who embrace the "Redpill" ideology, for example, might insist that women control the "sexual marketplace" and are only interested in ultramasculine "Chads." They champion self-improvement as a means to make themselves more masculine and successful, and hence (they believe) more attractive to women—or at least better able to manipulate women.</p>
<p>By contrast, the "Blackpilled" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel">incel</a> contingent is generally more nihilistic. These individuals reject the Redpill notion of alpha-male masculinity and the accompanying focus on self-improvement. They believe that dating and social success are entirely determined by one's looks and/or genetics. Since there is nothing they can do to improve their chances with women or their lot in life, why even bother?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/why-incels-take-the-blackpill-and-why-we-should-care/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Europa and Enceladus are two ocean moons that scientists have concluded have liquid water oceans underneath their outer icy shells. The Europa Clipper mission should reach Europa around April of 2030. If it collects data hinting at the moon’s potential habitability, robotic lander missions could be the only way to confirm if there’s really life in there or not.</p>
<p>To make these lander missions happen, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory team has been working on a robot that could handle the search for life and already tested it on the Matanuska Glacier in Alaska. “At this point this is a pretty mature concept,” says Kevin Hand, a planetary scientist at JPL who led this effort.</p>
<h2>Into the unknown</h2>
<p>There are only a few things we know for sure about conditions on the surface of Europa, and nearly all of them don’t bode well for lander missions. First, Europa is exposed to very harsh radiation, which is a problem for electronics. The window of visibility—when a potential robotic lander could contact Earth—lasts less than half of the 85 hours it takes for the moon to complete its day-night cycle due to the Europa-Jupiter orbit. So, for more than half the mission, the robot would need to fend for itself, with no human ground teams to get it out of trouble. The lander would also need to run on non-rechargeable batteries, because the vast distance to the Sun would make solar panels prohibitively massive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/nasa-robot-for-drilling-on-icy-moons-tested-on-alaskan-glacier/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Broadband lobby groups asked the Trump administration to block state laws that require Internet service providers to offer cheap plans to people with low incomes. The biggest lobby groups for the cable, telecom, and mobile industries made the request in a <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/ATR-2025-0001-0333">filing</a> with the US Department of Justice this week.</p>
<p>The groups want Trump's Justice Department to sue states such as New York, which requires ISPs to offer broadband for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/new-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill/">$15 or $20 a month</a> to people who meet income eligibility requirements. "The Antitrust Division should work with other components of the Department of Justice to consider bringing affirmative preemption litigation against the harmful state laws already on the books or soon enacted—particularly those that directly regulate broadband rates," the lobby groups said.</p>
<p>The lobby groups also said the Justice Department should collaborate with the Federal Communications Commission "to thoroughly examine every possible tool in the federal government's toolbox, including any and all ways in which the Commission can take regulatory action to preempt harmful state regulations." The filing was submitted by CTIA-The Wireless Association, NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association, and USTelecom-The Broadband Association.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/isps-urge-trump-admin-to-sue-states-that-require-cheaper-broadband-plans/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Using Google products in 2025 means using (or avoiding) AI features, which are becoming a core part of the experience across the board. Last year, Gmail gained the ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/gmails-ai-powered-email-summaries-can-dig-through-your-inbox-for-you/">summarize emails </a>on demand. Now, Google says AI summaries will be generated and displayed automatically in the Gmail app for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Before this latest change, you had to tap the "Summarize this email" chip at the top of the screen to generate an AI summary of the message contents. <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/gemini-summary-cards-gmail-app.html">Google has decided</a> to make this automatic for emails "where a summary is helpful." That means messages that are longer or threads that contain multiple replies. The announcement is a bit vague about how much detail will trigger a summary, but it probably won't take much, as Google wants people interacting with AI features as much as possible.</p>
<p>Gmail's AI summaries use Gemini to generate a brief list of bullet points that break down the content of the thread. It appears at the top of the app, which may not be ideal. In the same way that AI Overviews appear at the top of search results and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/">push the actual search results farther out of reach</a>, Gmail's AI summaries take up valuable real estate at the top of the screen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/the-gmail-app-will-now-create-ai-summaries-whether-you-want-them-or-not/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, a Google Maps glitch accidentally made it appear that the most desirable routes on German autobahns and highways were shut down, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/30/chaos-on-german-autobahns-as-google-maps-wrongly-says-they-are-closed">reported</a>.</p>
<p>It remains unclear what exactly unleashed a flood of stop signs on Google Maps in the area just ahead of a four-day holiday break when many drivers had travel plans. Maps of roadways in Belgium and the Netherlands were also affected.<br>
</p><div class="twitter-tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="de" dir="ltr">In ganz Deutschland<br>Chaos bei Google Maps: Dienst zeigt unzählige falsche Sperrungen<a href="https://t.co/qEfIRrIHx3">https://t.co/qEfIRrIHx3</a></p>— Peter Berger (@leosgeminix) <a href="https://twitter.com/leosgeminix/status/1928061782712586349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p>If drivers had stopped to check alternative apps, they would have learned that traffic was flowing normally and may have avoided clogging traffic on alternative routes or wasting time speculating about what could have happened to close so many major roads. Apple Maps and Waze accurately charted traffic patterns, and only Google Maps appeared to be affected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/google-maps-cant-explain-why-it-falsely-labeled-german-autobahns-as-closed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Once hailed as a triumph of public health, water fluoridation is now under intense attack in the US.</p>
<p>Despite decades of data proving its efficacy at protecting teeth from decay—particularly children's teeth—two states have now banned the use of fluoride in public water, and communities around the country have followed suit or are considering doing the same. The current US health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is known for his anti-vaccine advocacy and for peddling conspiracy theories, has pledged to remove fluoride from US water.</p>
<p>Now, a pair of researchers at Harvard—Sung Eun Choi and Lisa Simon—have modeled exactly what will happen in the US if Kennedy follows through on his pledge: The number of cavities and decayed teeth in American children and teens (ages 0–19) will increase by an estimated 7.5 percentage points over the first five years. That means there will be 25.4 million more rotten teeth in the mouths of children and teenagers. The dental bills for the added decay will total at least $9.8 billion in that time. Other costs, such as loss of work among parents, were not included, making the financial estimate conservative. But children will also be more miserable, with an estimated loss of 2.9 million quality-adjusted life years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/rfk-jr-s-fluoride-ban-would-ruin-25-million-kids-teeth-cost-9-8-billion/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Chevrolet provided flights from Los Angeles to Austin and accommodation so Ars could drive the ZR1. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas—By just my third lap in the top-spec 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, I glanced down at the speedometer toward the end of the Circuit of the Americas' long back straight and spied 181 mph (291 km/h) displayed for a split second. Not bad for Chevy’s newest flagship sports car, especially given that the $174,995 ZR1’s twin-turbocharged V8 pumps all 1,064 horsepower to the rear wheels only.</p>
<p>The US’s only purpose-built F1 track made for an excellent setting to taste Corvette’s latest; the ZR1 also commanded your attention while conquering the steep uphill toward the first corner, then winding through a series of challenging corners with plenty of elevation change. Luckily, the car itself is an engineering marvel, and Chevy brought along a team of engineers to explain exactly how the total package comes together to enable such a breathtaking pace, as well as how Chevy can responsibly sell such a powerful car to the general public at all.</p>
<p>The entire point of switching the Corvette’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/the-corvette-goes-mid-engined-supercar-performance-for-60000/">eighth generation to a mid-engine layout</a> was to improve weight distribution and allow the Corvette to compete against much more exotic competition from European OEMs like Ferrari. The front-engined car's engine bay also lacked the width to add a pair of turbos, due to the suspension and tire orientation, which dictated the use of a supercharger that kept peak power to “just” 755 hp (563 kW) in the last Corvette to wear the ZR1 badge.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-first-drive-engineered-for-insane-speed/">Read full article</a></p>
