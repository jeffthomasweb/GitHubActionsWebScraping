                            <![CDATA[<p>Cards Against Humanity (CAH) this week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/to-avoid-tariffs-cards-against-humanity-becomes-information-material-not-a-game/">announced its newest stunt</a>: a "Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke" edition that ditches the game's rules and adds explanatory notes to each card in the box. This makes the project "informational material" rather than a "game," and therefore CAH can avoid import tariffs. All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship.</p>
<p>While a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week's news did raise a question I've heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn't it print the game in the US? I mean, it's just a box of cards! How hard can it be?</p>
<p>In the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it's often not possible. Complex board games today may feature cardboard creations like constructible dice towers, custom-shaped and painted wooden markers, multicolored jewel pieces, plastic bits of nearly every possible variety, custom-printed component bags, molded miniatures, cards in multiple sizes, metallic coins, dry-erase boards, fancy box inserts, massive dual-sided playing boards, and long manuals. The only manufacturers capable of doing all this work are generally in China or central Europe (Germany still has good manufacturing, and there are also sites in Poland and the Czech Republic).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/why-doesnt-cards-against-humanity-print-its-game-in-the-us-its-complicated/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since launching its bug bounty program nearly a decade ago, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a> has always touted notable maximum payouts—<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/apples-finally-offering-bug-bounties-highest-rewards-ever/">$200,000</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-hacker-iphone-bug-bounty-macos/">$1 million</a> in 2019. Now the company is upping the stakes again. At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-spyware-investment/">spyware</a>.</p>
<p>The move reflects how valuable exploitable vulnerabilities can be within Apple's highly protected mobile environment—and the lengths the company will go to to keep such discoveries from falling into the wrong hands. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-lockdown-mode-hands-on/">extra secure Lockdown Mode </a>as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. Taken together, the maximum award for what would otherwise be a potentially catastrophic exploit chain will now be $5 million. The changes take effect next month.</p>
<p>“We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there’s a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. “We want to make sure that for the hardest categories, the hardest problems, the things that most closely mirror the kinds of attacks that we see with mercenary spyware—that the researchers who have those skills and abilities and put in that effort and time can get a tremendous reward."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/apple-ups-the-reward-for-finding-major-exploits-to-2-million/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every few weeks, it seems, yet another lab proclaims yet another breakthrough in the race to perfect solid-state batteries: next-generation power packs that promise to give us electric vehicles (EVs) so problem-free that we’ll have no reason left to buy gas-guzzlers.</p>
<p>These new solid-state cells are designed to be lighter and more compact than the lithium-ion batteries used in today’s EVs. They should also be much safer, with nothing inside that can burn like those rare but hard-to-extinguish lithium-ion fires. They should hold a lot more energy, turning range anxiety into a distant memory with consumer EVs able to go four, five, six hundred miles on a single charge.</p>
<p>And forget about those “fast” recharges lasting half an hour or more: Solid-state batteries promise EV fill-ups in minutes—almost as fast as any standard car gets with gasoline.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/how-close-are-we-to-solid-state-batteries-for-electric-vehicles/">Read full article</a></p>

<media:credit>Mercedes-Benz Group</media:credit><media:text>In early 2025, Mercedes-Benz ran its first road tests of an electric passenger car powered by a prototype solid-state battery pack. The carmaker predicts the next-gen battery will increase the electric vehicle’s driving range to over 620 miles (1,000 kilometers).

                            <![CDATA[<p>An unknown number of federal health employees received termination notifications Friday afternoon as part of a mass reduction in force by the Trump administration that senior officials and federal employment lawyers say is almost certainly illegal.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services has taken <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-bloodbath-at-hhs-blowback-grows-as-losses-become-clearer/">heavy hits</a> since Trump came to office. Early in the year, the Trump administration pushed out 10,000 employees through early retirements, deferred resignations, and other efforts while laying off 10,000 more, slashing the HHS workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 in all. In the current government shutdown—which hinges on a dispute over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/most-americans-want-aca-tax-credits-extended-even-57-of-maga-supporters/">Affordable Care Act tax credits that 80 percent of Americans support</a>—more than 32,000 HHS employees are furloughed.</p>

In the last few years, Russia has cut back on the number of Soyuz crew missions it is sending to the International Space Station, and a replacement for the nearly 60-year-old Soyuz spacecraft remains elusive.</p>
<p>While the United States and China are launching more space missions than ever before, Russia's once-dominant launch cadence is on a downhill slide.</p>

<p>Marvel Studios has dropped the first teaser for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Man_(miniseries)"><em>Wonder Man</em></a>, an eight-episode miniseries slated for a January release, ahead of its panel at New York Comic Con this weekend.</p>
<p>Part of the MCU's Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton (<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings</em>) and Andrew Guest (<em>Hawkeye</em>), with Guest serving as showrunner. It has been in development since 2022.</p>
<p>The comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries. Baron Zemo (<em>Falcon</em> <em>and the</em><em> Winter Soldier)</em> then recruits him to infiltrate and betray the Avengers, giving him super powers ("ionic energy") via a special serum. He eventually becomes a superhero and Avengers ally, helping them take on Doctor Doom, among other exploits. Since we know Doctor Doom is the Big Bad of the upcoming two new Avengers movies, a <em>Wonder Man</em> miniseries makes sense.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/marvel-gets-meta-with-wonder-man-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump threatened China with a "massive increase" on tariffs and may cancel his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping after China spent the past two days making "very hostile" trade moves—including aggressive <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tightens-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-10-09/">rare-earths export restrictions</a> and an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/china-goes-all-in-on-u-s-trade-battle-with-qualcomm-in-the-crosshairs-9b6a2bc7">attack on a key US semiconductor company</a>.</p>
<p>In a Truth Social post, Trump accused China of trying to "clog" markets by restricting not just access to rare earths but also by placing export controls on "foreign companies that use Chinese rare earth equipment or material."</p>
<p>These rules are intended to take effect December 1, with many outlets reporting the rules will give China more leverage ahead of the Trump-Xi trade talks that are supposed to take place in South Korea in two weeks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/extremely-angry-trump-threatens-massive-tariff-on-all-chinese-exports/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is warning of an active scam that diverts employees' paycheck payments to attacker-controlled accounts after first taking over their profiles on Workday or other cloud-based HR services.</p>
<p>Payroll Pirate, as Microsoft says the campaign has been dubbed, gains access to victims’ HR portals by sending them phishing emails that trick the recipients into providing their credentials for logging in to the cloud account. The scammers are able to recover multi-factor authentication codes by using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/phishing-attacks-that-defeat-mfa-are-easier-than-ever-so-what-are-we-to-do/">adversary-in-the-middle</a> tactics, which work by sitting between the victims and the site they think they’re logging in to, which is, in fact, a fake site operated by the attackers.</p>
<h2>Not all MFA is created equal</h2>
<p>The attackers then enter the intercepted credentials, including the MFA code, into the real site. This tactic, which has grown increasingly common in recent years, underscores the importance of adopting FIDO-compliant forms of MFA, which are immune to such attacks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/payroll-pirate-phishing-scam-that-takes-over-workday-accounts-steals-paychecks/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p><em>Odontotermes obesus</em> is one of the termite species that grows fungi, called <em>Termitomyces,</em> in their mounds. Workers collect dead leaves, wood, and grass to stack them in underground fungus gardens called combs. There, the fungi break down the tough plant fibers, making them accessible for the termites in an elaborate form of symbiotic agriculture.</p>
<p>Like any other agriculturalist, however, the termites face a challenge: weeds. “There have been numerous studies suggesting the termites must have some kind of fixed response—that they always do the same exact thing when they detect weed infestation,” says Rhitoban Raychoudhury, a professor of biological sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education, “but that was not the case.” In a new Science study, Raychoudhury’s team discovered that termites have pretty advanced, surprisingly human-like gardening practices.</p>
<h2>Going blind</h2>
<p>Termites do not look like particularly good gardeners at first glance. They are effectively blind, which is not that surprising considering they spend most of their life in complete darkness working in endless corridors of their mounds. But termites make up for their lack of sight with other senses. "They can detect the environment based on advanced olfactory reception and touch, and I think this is what they use to identify the weeds in their gardens," Raychoudhury says. To learn how termites react once they detect a weed infestation, his team collected some <em>Odontotermes obesus</em> and challenged them with different gardening problems.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/termite-farmers-fine-tune-their-weed-control/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is facing multiple antitrust actions in the US, and European regulators have been similarly tightening the screws. You can now add the UK to the list of Google's governmental worries. The country's antitrust regulator, known as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has confirmed that Google has "strategic market status," paving the way to more limits on how Google does business in the UK. Naturally, Google objects to this course of action.</p>
<p>The designation is connected to the UK's new digital markets competition regime, which was enacted at the beginning of the year. Shortly after, the CMA announced it was conducting an investigation into whether Google should be designated with strategic market status. The outcome of that process is a resounding "yes."</p>
<p>This label does not mean Google has done anything illegal or that it is subject to immediate regulation. It simply means the company has "substantial and entrenched market power" in one or more areas under the purview of the CMA. Specifically, the agency has found that Google is dominant in search and search advertising, holding a greater than 90 percent share of Internet searches in the UK.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/uk-antitrust-regulator-takes-aim-at-googles-search-dominance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It feels like it was just yesterday that Sony hardware architect Mark Cerny was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">first teasing Sony's "PS4 successor"</a> and its "enhanced ray-tracing capabilities" powered by new AMD chips. Now that we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">nearly five full years into the PS5 era</a>, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls "a future console in a few years' time."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday</a>, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about "Project Amethyst," a co-engineering effort between both companies that was <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136">also teased back in July</a>. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the "results are quite promising" for a project that's still in the "early days."</p>
<h2>Mo’ ML, fewer problems?</h2>
<p>Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to "brute force that with raw power alone," Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">AMD's FSR upscaling technology</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">Sony's similar PSSR system</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/amd-and-sony-tease-new-chip-architecture-ahead-of-playstation-6/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nevada state regulators have accused Elon Musk’s Boring Co. of violating environmental regulations nearly 800 times in the last two years as it digs a sprawling tunnel network beneath Las Vegas for its Tesla-powered “people mover.” The company’s alleged violations include starting to dig without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling muck from its trucks, according to a new document obtained by City Cast Las Vegas and ProPublica.</p>
<p>The September 22 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26184164-tbc-state-letter/">cease-and-desist letter</a> from the state Bureau of Water Pollution Control alleged repeated violations of a settlement agreement that the company had entered into after being fined five years ago for discharging groundwater into storm drains without a permit. That agreement, signed by a Boring executive in 2022, was intended to compel the company to comply with state water pollution laws.</p>
<p>Instead, state inspectors documented nearly 100 alleged new violations of the agreement. The letter also accuses the company of failing to hire an independent environmental manager to regularly inspect its construction sites. State regulators counted 689 missed inspections.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/boring-company-cited-for-almost-800-environmental-violations-in-las-vegas/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Chevrolet Bolt was one of the earliest electric vehicles to offer well over 200 miles (321 km) of range at a competitive price. For Ars, it was love at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/02/its-a-really-good-car-our-first-100-miles-in-a-2017-chevrolet-bolt/">first drive</a>, and that remained true from model year 2017 through MY2023. On the right tires, it could show a VW Golf GTI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/turns-out-the-chevy-bolt-is-a-lot-of-fun-to-autocross/">a thing or two</a>, and while it might have been slow-charging, it could still be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/superchargers-are-the-reliable-fast-charging-backup-my-chevy-bolt-always-needed/">a decent road-tripper</a>.</p>
<p>All of this helped the Bolt become General Motors' best-selling EV, at least until its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/general-motors-is-ditching-ultium-branding-for-its-ev-batteries/">used-to-be-called</a> Ultium platform got up and running. And that's despite a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/gm-recalls-every-chevy-bolt-ever-made-blames-lg-for-faulty-batteries/">costly recall</a> that required replacing batteries in tens of thousands of Bolts because of some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/misaligned-factory-robot-may-have-sparked-chevy-bolt-battery-fires/">badly folded cells</a>. But GM had other plans for the Bolt's factory, and in 2023, it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/gm-confirms-chevy-bolt-will-die-this-year-making-way-for-electric-pickups/">announced its impending death</a>.</p>
<p>The reaction from EV enthusiasts, and Bolt owners in particular, was so overwhelmingly negative that just a few months later, GM CEO Mary Barra backtracked, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/gm-announces-a-new-ultium-based-chevrolet-bolt-during-q2-report/">promising to bring the Bolt back</a>, this time with a don't-call-it-Ultium-anymore battery.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/its-back-the-2027-chevy-bolt-gets-an-all-new-lfp-battery-but-what-else/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.14 of the Rocket Report! We're now more than a week into a federal government shutdown, but there's been little effect on the space industry. Military space operations are continuing unabated, and NASA continues preparations at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, for the launch of the Artemis II mission around the Moon early next year. The International Space Station is still flying with a crew of seven in low-Earth orbit, and NASA's fleet of spacecraft exploring the cosmos remain active. What's more, so much of what the nation does in space is now done by commercial companies largely (but not completely) immune from the pitfalls of politics. But the effect of the shutdown on troops and federal employees shouldn't be overlooked. They will soon miss their first paychecks unless political leaders reach an agreement to end the stalemate.</p>

<p><b>Danger from dead rockets. </b>A new listing of the 50 most concerning pieces of space debris in low-Earth orbit is dominated by relics more than a quarter-century old, primarily dead rockets left to hurtle through space at the end of their missions, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/everyone-but-china-has-pretty-much-stopped-littering-in-low-earth-orbit/">Ars reports</a>. "The things left before 2000 are still the majority of the problem," said Darren McKnight, lead author of a paper presented October 3 at the International Astronautical Congress in Sydney. "Seventy-six percent of the objects in the top 50 were deposited last century, and 88 percent of the objects are rocket bodies. That's important to note, especially with some disturbing trends right now."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/rocket-report-bezos-firm-will-package-satellites-for-launch-starship-on-deck/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On January 1, 2008, at 1:59 am in Calipatria, California, an earthquake happened. You haven’t heard of this earthquake; even if you had been living in Calipatria, you wouldn’t have felt anything. It was magnitude -0.53, about the same amount of shaking as a truck passing by. Still, this earthquake is notable, not because it was large but because it was small—and yet we know about it.</p>
<p>Over the past seven years, AI tools based on computer imaging have almost completely automated one of the fundamental tasks of seismology: detecting earthquakes. What used to be the task of human analysts—and later, simpler computer programs—can now be done automatically and quickly by machine-learning tools.</p>
<p>These machine-learning tools can detect smaller earthquakes than human analysts, especially in noisy environments like cities. Earthquakes give valuable information about the composition of the Earth and what hazards might occur in the future.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/like-putting-on-glasses-for-the-first-time-how-ai-improves-earthquake-detection/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An October meeting of a key federal vaccine advisory committee has been canceled without explanation, sparing the evidence-based childhood vaccination schedule from more erosion—at least for now.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning to meet on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251003112109/cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html">October 22 and 23</a>, which would have been the committee's fourth meeting this year. But the meeting schedule was updated in the past week to remove those dates and replace them with "2025 meeting, TBD."</p>
<p>Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services to ask why the meeting was canceled. HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard offered no explanation, only saying that the "official meeting dates and agenda items will be posted on the website once finalized."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/childhood-vaccines-safe-for-a-little-longer-as-cdc-cancels-advisory-meeting/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Scraping the open web for AI training data can have its drawbacks. On Thursday, researchers from Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">released</a> a preprint research paper suggesting that large language models like the ones that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude can develop backdoor vulnerabilities from as few as 250 corrupted documents inserted into their training data.</p>
<p>That means someone tucking certain documents away inside training data could potentially manipulate how the LLM responds to prompts, although the finding comes with significant caveats.</p>
<p>The research involved training AI language models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters on datasets scaled appropriately for their size. Despite larger models processing over 20 times more total training data, all models learned the same backdoor behavior after encountering roughly the same small number of malicious examples.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-models-can-acquire-backdoors-from-surprisingly-few-malicious-documents/">Read full article</a></p>
