              <![CDATA[<p>Three veterinarians who work with cows have tested positive for prior infections of H5 bird flu, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm?s_cid=mm7404a2_w">a study released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>The finding may not seem surprising, given the sweeping and ongoing outbreak of H5N1 among dairy farms in the US, which has reached <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">968 herds in 16 states</a> and led to infections in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html">41 dairy workers</a>. However, it is notable that none of the three veterinarians were aware of being infected, and none of them worked with cows that were known or suspected to be infected with H5N1. In fact, one of them only worked in Georgia and South Carolina, two states where H5N1 infections in dairy cows and humans have never been reported.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that the virus may be moving in animals and people silently, and that our surveillance systems are missing infections—both long-held fears among health experts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/h5n1-testing-in-cow-veterinarians-suggests-bird-flu-is-spreading-silently/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Opinion: Streaming gets more cable-like with new focus on live events, mainstream content.]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>There was a time when it felt like you needed a streaming subscription in order to contribute to watercooler conversations. Without Netflix, you couldn’t react to <em>House of Cards’</em> latest twist. Without Hulu, you couldn’t comment on how realistic <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> felt, and you needed Prime Video to prefer <em>The Boys</em> over the latest Marvel movies. In the earlier days of streaming, when streaming providers were still tasked with convincing customers that streaming was viable, streaming companies strived to deliver original content that lured customers.</p>
<p>But today, the majority of streaming services are struggling with profitability, and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/01/23/why-peak-tv-may-have-reached-its-end-after-a-decade-of-success/">Peak TV</a> era, a time when TV programming budgets kept exploding and led to iconic original series like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, is over. This year, streaming companies are pinching pennies. This means they're trying harder to extract more money from current subscribers through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/amazon-ends-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-after-prime-video-with-ads-debuts/">ads</a> and changes to programming strategies that put less emphasis on original content.</p>
<p>What does that mean for streaming subscribers, who are increasingly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/streaming-prices-climb-in-2025-after-already-surpassing-inflation-rates/">paying more</a>? And what does it mean for watercooler chat and media culture when the future of TV increasingly looks like TV’s past, with a heightened focus on live events, mainstream content, and commercials?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/streaming-used-to-make-stuff-networks-wouldnt-now-its-seeking-safer-bets/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Condé Nast and several other media companies sued the AI startup Cohere today, alleging that it engaged in "systematic copyright and trademark infringement" by using news articles to train its large language model.</p>
<p>"Without permission or compensation, Cohere uses scraped copies of our articles, through training, real-time use, and in outputs, to power its artificial intelligence ('AI') service, which in turn competes with Publisher offerings and the emerging market for AI licensing," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.636920/gov.uscourts.nysd.636920.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. "Not content with just stealing our works, Cohere also blatantly manufactures fake pieces and attributes them to us, misleading the public and tarnishing our brands."</p>
<p>Condé Nast, which owns Ars Technica and other publications such as Wired and The New Yorker, was joined in the lawsuit by The Atlantic, Forbes, The Guardian, Insider, the Los Angeles Times, McClatchy, Newsday, The Plain Dealer, Politico, The Republican, the Toronto Star, and Vox Media.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/news-orgs-accuse-ai-firm-of-stealing-articles-and-creating-fake-news/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It started with a bizarre burning sensation in her feet. Over the next two days, the searing pain crept up her legs. Any light touch made it worse, and over-the-counter pain medicine offered no relief.</p>
<p>On the third day, the 30-year-old, otherwise healthy woman from New England went to an emergency department. Her exam was normal. Her blood tests and kidney function were normal. The only thing that stood out was a high number of <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003649.htm">eosinophils</a>—white blood cells that become active with certain allergic diseases, parasitic infections, or other medical conditions, such as cancer. The woman was discharged and advised to follow up with her primary care doctor.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, the scorching sensation kept advancing, invading her trunk and arms. She developed a headache that was also unfazed by over-the-counter pain medicine. Seven days into the illness, she went to a second emergency department. There, the findings were much the same: Normal exam, normal blood tests, normal kidney function, and high eosinophil count—this time higher. The reference range for this count was 0 to 400; her count was 1,050. She was given intravenous medicine to treat her severe headache, then once again discharged with a plan to see her primary care provider.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/burning-in-womans-legs-turned-out-to-be-slug-parasites-digging-in-her-brain/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Big news for people who prefer their product announcements to be pre-announced: Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918">says</a> that the company has something brewing for Wednesday, February 19. Cook referred to "the newest member of the family," suggesting a launch event focused on a single product rather than multiple refreshes throughout its product lineup.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/report-iphone-se-could-shed-its-10-year-old-design-as-early-as-next-week/">Most rumors</a> point to the "family" being the iPhone and the "newest member" being an updated version of the entry-level iPhone SE. Last refreshed in March of 2022 with the guts of late 2021's iPhone 13, the SE is the only iPhone in Apple's lineup that still ships with large display bezels and a Home button. And it's one of just three models (along with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus) to still include a Lightning port.</p>
<p>Previous reporting has suggested that the next-generation iPhone SE could replace both the current SE and the iPhone 14 series in the iPhone lineup, since the new phone is expected to ship with an iPhone 14-style design with an edge-to-edge display and a notch cutout. The old SE and the 14 series have already been discontinued in the EU, where new phones are all required to use a USB-C port.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/02/apple-teases-launch-for-the-newest-member-of-the-family-on-february-19/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/the-shadows-roots-take-hold-in-wheel-of-time-s3-teaser/">previously reported</a>, the series centers on Moiraine (<a href="https://deadline.com/2019/06/rosamund-pike-the-wheel-of-time-tv-adaptation-amazon-1202634993/">played by</a> Oscar-nominee Rosamund Pike), a member of a powerful, all-woman organization called the Aes Sedai. Magic, known as the One Power, is divided into male (<em>saidin</em>) and female (<em>saidar</em>) flavors. The latter is the province of the Aes Sedai. Long ago, a great evil, called the Dark One, caused the <em>saidin</em> to become tainted, such that most men who show an ability to channel that magic go mad. It's the job of the Aes Sedai to track down such men and strip them of their abilities—a process known as "gentling" that, unfortunately, is often anything but. There is also an ancient prophecy concerning the Dragon Reborn: the reincarnation of a person who will save or destroy humanity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/dragon-reborn-flirts-with-the-shadow-in-wheel-of-time-s3-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

Now, the BBC is trying to quantify the scale of this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">confabulation</a> problem, at least when it comes to summaries of its own news content.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/bbc-research-into-ai-assistants.pdf">an extensive report published this week</a>, the BBC analyzed how four popular large language models used or abused information from BBC articles when answering questions about the news. The results found inaccuracies, misquotes, and/or misrepresentations of BBC content in a significant proportion of the tests, supporting the news organization's conclusion that "AI assistants cannot currently be relied upon to provide accurate news, and they risk misleading the audience."</p>
<h2>Where did you come up with <em>that</em>?</h2>
<p>To assess the state of AI news summaries, BBC's Responsible AI team gathered 100 news questions related to trending Google search topics from the last year (e.g., "How many Russians have died in Ukraine?" or "What is the latest on the independence referendum debate in Scotland?"). These questions were then put to ChatGPT-4o, Microsoft Copilot Pro, Google Gemini Standard, and Perplexity, with the added instruction to "use BBC News sources where possible."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/bbc-finds-significant-inaccuracies-in-over-30-of-ai-produced-news-summaries/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The vote was largely along party lines, with a tally of 52 to 48. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.), a polio survivor and steadfast supporter of vaccines, voted against the confirmation, the only Republican to do so.</p>
<p>Before the vote, Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D–N.Y.) claimed that if there had been a secret ballot today, most Republicans would have voted against Kennedy. "But sadly, and unfortunately for America, Republicans are being strong-armed by Donald Trump and will end up holding their nose and voting to confirm Mr. Kennedy... What a travesty," Schumer said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/a-sicker-america-senate-confirms-robert-f-kennedy-jr-as-health-secretary/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244">announced</a> a roadmap for how the company plans to release GPT-5, the long-awaited followup to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">2023's GPT-4</a> AI language model that made huge waves in both tech and policy circles around the world. In a reply to a question on X, Altman said GPT-5 would be coming in "<a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889757267425370415">months</a>," suggesting a release later in 2025.</p>
<p>Initially, Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244">explained</a> in a long post on X, the company plans to ship GPT-4.5 (previously known as "Orion" internally) in a matter of "<a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889757267425370415">weeks</a>" as OpenAI's last non-simulated reasoning model. Simulated reasoning (SR) models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">like o3</a> use a special technique to iteratively process problems posed by users more deeply, but they are slower than conventional large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and not ideal for every task.</p>
<p>After that, GPT-5 will be a system that brings together features from across OpenAI's current AI model lineup, including conventional AI models, SR models, and specialized models that do tasks like web search and research. "In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3," he wrote. "We will no longer ship o3 as a standalone model."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/sam-altman-lays-out-roadmap-for-openais-long-awaited-gpt-5-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The proposed merger between Honda and Nissan is officially dead. The plan, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/honda-and-nissan-to-merge-honda-will-take-the-lead/">announced in late December</a>, would have created the world's third-largest automaker, displacing Volkswagen Group from the bronze on the podium. But it was also never quite seen as a merger of equals—many suspected this was a Honda takeover of beleaguered Nissan at the behest of the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Nissan is already part of a triple-alliance, together with Mitsubishi and France's Renault. Although Mitsubishi considered joining the Honda-Nissan merger, <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/business/companies/20250124-234887/">that was old news</a> by late January.</p>
<p>That alliance might have been part of the problem. Although not an actual merger, the car companies involved each own stakes in the other—in Renault's case, it owns 37.5 percent of Nissan. Honda would have liked Nissan to buy out Renault's stake, presumably not keen on such a significant chunk of the company under foreign ownership.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-honda-nissan-merger-is-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[
<p>At its heart, <em>Avowed</em> is a game about colonization. Your protagonist in this action-RPG from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-review-oh-the-places-youll-plunder/"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> </a>universe is the envoy for the Aedyran Empire, which has for years sent its occupying force to tame and control the wild and unruly islands of the Living Lands. What the Aedyrans try to spin as a civilizing effort in a naturally lawless place, the native residents of the Living Lands, by and large, see as a pillaging army stealing resources at the behest of their far-off masters.</p>
<p>As the Aedyran envoy, you've been sent to investigate and quell the Dreamscourge, a spreading plague that is poisoning the minds of people and beasts throughout the Living Lands. But the citizens you encounter there don't see you as the stock-standard brave hero chosen by providence to save them from an ongoing disaster. Instead, you're viewed first and foremost as a representative of the same occupying force that has had its metaphorical boot on their necks for years.</p>
<p>That fact alone adds a low-level hum of hatred and mistrust to practically every interaction you have in <em>Avowed</em>. Some characters will confront you with that hate right to your face, often with violence. Some will merely mutter it under their breath as they grudgingly tolerate your presence. Some show fear and/or disgust on their face even as they endeavor to play nice or desperately beg for favors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/avowed-review-wait-are-we-the-baddies/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There’s a growing collaboration between hacking groups engaging in espionage on behalf of nation-states and those seeking financial gains through ransomware and other forms of cybercrime, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/cybercrime-multifaceted-national-security-threat">researchers noted this week</a>.</p>
<p>There has always been some level of overlap between these two groups, but it has become more pronounced in recent years. On Tuesday, the Google-owned Mandiant security firm said the uptick comes amid tighter purse strings and as a means for concealing nation-state-sponsored espionage by making it blend in with financially motivated cyberattacks.</p>
<h2>Opportunities abound</h2>
<p>“Modern cybercriminals are likely to specialize in a particular area of cybercrime and partner with other entities with diverse specializations to conduct operations,” Mandiant researchers explained. “The specialization of cybercrime capabilities presents an opportunity for state-backed groups to simply show up as another customer for a group that normally sells to other criminals. Purchasing malware, credentials, or other key resources from illicit forums can be cheaper for state-backed groups than developing them in-house, while also providing some ability to blend in to financially motivated operations and attract less notice."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/financially-motivated-hackers-are-helping-their-espionage-counterparts-and-vice-versa/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Thanks to being an incompressible medium, water transmits vibrations both farther and faster than the air. (Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUJtMygi-fo">good video explainer</a> on the subject.) This fact helps to explain how a US government-owned "moored passive acoustic recorder" was able to hear and record the 2023 implosion of the doomed <em>Titan</em> submersible—even though the recorder was 900 miles away from the dive site.</p>
<p>That implosion, during an attempted dive to the wreckage of the <em>Titanic</em>, killed five people, including Stockton Rush, the CEO of the company that built and operated the <em>Titan</em>.</p>
<p>The implosion audio was just <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/video/951839/titan-submersible-coast-guard-marine-board-investigation-releases-audio-recording">released publicly</a> by the US Coast Guard's Titan Marine Board of Investigation, which has been investigating the disaster in enormous detail.

              <![CDATA[<p>An outbreak of measles in one of Texas' least vaccinated counties continues to rapidly expand, with <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak">officials reporting 24 cases</a> Tuesday, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/us-vaccinations-fall-again-as-more-parents-refuse-lifesaving-shots-for-kids/">up from just nine confirmed on Friday</a>.</p>
<p>According to an update by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), all 24 cases identified in the two-week-old outbreak are in unvaccinated people. Nine of the patients (37.5 percent) required hospitalization.</p>
<p>Most of the cases are in children. DSHS provided an age breakdown that listed six cases as being in infants and young children between the ages of 0 and 4. This is the age group most vulnerable to measles because they have a heightened risk of complications from the disease and may be too young to be fully vaccinated with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. Children are recommended to get<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"> two doses of the MMR vaccine</a>, one between 12 and 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years. One dose of MMR vaccine is estimated to be 93 percent effective against measles, while two doses are 97 percent effective.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-doubles-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple services like iMessage and FaceTime often work exclusively on Apple’s hardware, something the company uses to keep customers inside its ecosystem and encourage people who buy one Apple product to buy other Apple products so they can keep using the features they like.</p>
<p>Apple’s streaming and media services have been an exception to this, going all the way back to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2003/10/2986-2/">iTunes for Windows</a>—the company offers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/11/apple-music-app-now-available-on-android/">Apple Music on Android devices</a>, for example, and Apple TV+ (the service) works on Roku devices, game consoles, and most other smart TVs. Even if people haven’t bought an iPhone or Mac, Apple’s fast-growing Services division relies on pulling in new subscribers regardless of the device they’re using to subscribe.</p>
<p>To that end, Apple announced today that it’s finally bringing an Apple TV+ app to Android devices for the first time since Apple TV+ launched in 2019. The app will work on all Android phones and tablets running Android 10 or newer and will be available today. The app will support both Apple TV+ subscriptions and subscriptions to <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/channel/tvs.sbd.7000">Apple’s MLS Season Pass service</a> for soccer fans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/apple-tv-crosses-enemy-lines-will-be-available-as-an-android-app-starting-today/">Read full article</a></p>

Originally it was all about the "power trip," but it soon became about "money and the power trip."</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, a team of researchers announced that they got extremely lucky. The team is building a detector on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea that can identify those rare occasions when a neutrino happens to interact with the seawater nearby. And while the detector was only 10 percent of the size it will be on completion, it managed to pick up the most energetic neutrino ever detected.</p>
<p>For context, the most powerful particle accelerator on Earth, the Large Hadron Collider, accelerates protons to an energy of 7 Tera-electronVolts (TeV). The neutrino that was detected had an energy of at least 60 Peta-electronVolts, possibly hitting 230 PeV. That also blew away the previous records, which were in the neighborhood of 10 PeV.</p>
<p>Attempts to trace back the neutrino to a source make it clear that it originated outside our galaxy, although there are a number of candidate sources in the more distant Universe.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/most-energetic-neutrino-yet-seen-smashes-through-seafloor-detector/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last night, Apple posted <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117267">a new support document about migrating purchases between accounts</a>, something that Apple users with long online histories have been waiting on for years, if not decades. If you have movies, music, or apps orphaned on various iTools/.Mac/MobileMe/iTunes accounts that preceded what you're using now, you can start the fairly involved process of moving them over.</p>
<p>"You can choose to migrate apps, music, and other content you’ve purchased from Apple on a secondary Apple Account to a primary Apple Account," the document reads, suggesting that people might have older accounts tied primarily to just certain movies, music, or other purchases that they can now bring forward to their primary, device-linked account. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294">process</a> takes place on an iPhone or iPad inside the Settings app, in the "Media &amp; Purchases" section in your named account section.</p>
<p>There are a few hitches to note. You can't migrate purchases from or into a child's account that exists inside Family Sharing. You can only migrate purchases to an account once a year. There are some complications if you have music libraries on both accounts and also if you have never used the primary account for purchases or downloads. And migration is not available in the EU, UK, or India.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/apple-now-lets-you-move-purchases-between-your-25-years-of-accounts/">Read full article</a></p>
