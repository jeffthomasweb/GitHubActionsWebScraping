<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Growing up, if I wanted to experiment with something technical, my dad made it happen. We shared dozens of tech <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/204">adventures</a> together, but those adventures were cut short when he died of cancer in 2013. Thanks to a new AI image generator, it turns out that my dad and I still have one more adventure to go.</p>

<p>Recently, an anonymous AI hobbyist discovered that an image synthesis model called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/">Flux</a> can reproduce someone's handwriting very accurately if specially trained to do so. I decided to experiment with the technique using written journals my dad left behind. The results astounded me and raised deep questions about ethics, the authenticity of media artifacts, and the personal meaning behind handwriting itself.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm also happy that I get to see my dad's handwriting again. Captured by a neural network, part of him will live on in a dynamic way that was impossible a decade ago. It's been a while since he died, and I am no longer grieving. From my perspective, this is a celebration of something great about my dad—reviving the distinct way he wrote and what that conveys about who he was.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045545#p3">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045545&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft has updated a key cryptographic library with two new encryption algorithms designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers.</p>
<p>The updates were made last week to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/SymCrypt">SymCrypt</a>, a core cryptographic code library for handing cryptographic functions in Windows and Linux. The library, started in 2006, provides operations and algorithms developers can use to safely implement secure encryption, decryption, signing, verification, hashing, and key exchange in the apps they create. The library supports federal certification requirements for cryptographic modules used in some governmental environments.</p>
<h2>Massive overhaul underway</h2>
<p>Despite the name, SymCrypt supports both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms. It’s the main cryptographic library Microsoft uses in products and services including Azure, Microsoft 365, all supported versions of Windows, Azure Stack HCI, and Azure Linux. The library provides cryptographic security used in email security, cloud storage, web browsing, remote access, and device management. Microsoft documented the update in a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-s-quantum-resistant-cryptography-is-here/ba-p/4238780">post</a> on Monday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049244#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049244&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

A disorganized app you tossed together by sideloading? A face that's frowning because it's rolling down a bar held up by app icons? It's weird, but not quite evocative.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>You might sideload an Android app, or manually install its APK package, if you're using a custom version of Android that doesn't include Google's Play Store. Alternately, the app might be experimental, under development, or perhaps no longer maintained and offered by its developer. Until now, the existence of sideload-ready APKs on the web was something that seemed to be tolerated, if warned against, by Google.</p>
<p>This quiet standstill is being shaken up by a new feature in Google's Play Integrity API. As <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/play-integrity-sideloading-detection-3480639/">reported by Android Authority</a>, developer tools to push "remediation" dialogs during sideloading <a href="https://io.google/2024/explore/f757438a-844f-4c59-8dd4-9a5580a5e23d/">debuted</a> at Google's I/O conference in May, have begun showing up on users' phones. Sideloaders of apps from the British shop <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/cannot-install-the-new-tesco-clubcard-app-fp4/93824/10">Tesco</a>, fandom app <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Beyblade/comments/16bi9hh/getting_this_message_when_i_open_the_bbx_app/">BeyBlade X</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1833700730349515062?t=BYKpcVNNC-8z7Jems7j37Q&amp;s=19">ChatGPT</a> have reported "Get this app from Play" prompts, which cannot be worked around. An Android gaming handheld user encountered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retroid/comments/1dihb9d/how_to_bypass_get_this_app_from_play_on_rp2s/">a similarly worded prompt from <em>Diablo Immortal</em></a> on their device three months ago.</p>
<p>Google's Play Integrity API is how apps have previously blocked access when loaded onto phones that are in some way modified from a stock OS with all Google Play integrations intact. Recently, a popular two-factor authentication app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/loss-of-popular-2fa-tool-puts-security-minded-grapheneos-in-a-paradox/">blocked access on rooted phones</a>, including the security-minded GrapheneOS. Apps can call the Play Integrity API and get back an "integrity verdict," relaying if the phone has a "trustworthy" software environment, has Google Play Protect enabled, and passes other software checks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049138#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049138&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday night, Taylor Swift <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/?hl=en">endorsed</a> Vice President Kamala Harris for US President on Instagram, citing concerns over AI-generated deepfakes as a key motivator. The artist's warning aligns with current trends in technology, especially in an era where AI synthesis models can easily <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/thanks-to-ai-its-probably-time-to-take-your-photos-off-the-internet/">create convincing fake images</a> and videos.</p>
<p>"Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site," she wrote in her Instagram post. "It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth."</p>
<p>In August 2024, former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/donald-trump-taylor-swift-ai/index.html">posted AI-generated images</a> on Truth Social falsely suggesting Swift endorsed him, including a manipulated photo depicting Swift as Uncle Sam with text promoting Trump. The incident sparked Swift's fears about the spread of misinformation through AI.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049045#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049045&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The more abortion access is jeopardized, the more women turn to sterilization, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2823625">a new report in JAMA</a> that drew on health insurance claims of nearly 4.8 million women in the US.</p>
<p>In states that enacted total or near-total abortion bans following the US Supreme Court's <em>Dobbs</em> decision in June 2022, the rate of sterilizations among reproductive-age women that July spiked 19 percent. A similar initial spike was seen across the nation, with states that either limited or protected access to abortions seeing a 17 percent increase.</p>
<p>But, after that, states with bans saw a divergent trend. The states that limited or protected abortion access saw sterilization procedures largely level off after July 2022. In contrast, states with bans continued to see increases. From July 2022 to December 2022, use of sterilization procedures increased by 3 percent each month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049152#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049152&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">On a Friday evening last November, police chased a silver sedan across the San Francisco Bay Bridge. The fleeing vehicle entered San Francisco and went careening through the city’s crowded streets. At the intersection of 11th and Folsom streets, it sideswiped the fronts of two other vehicles, veered onto a sidewalk, and hit two pedestrians.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://abc7news.com/police-chase-san-francisco-waymo-pursuit-crash/14011545/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">local news story</a>, both pedestrians were taken to the hospital with one suffering major injuries. The driver of the silver sedan was injured, as was a passenger in one of the other vehicles.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the third car, a driverless Waymo robotaxi. Still, Waymo was required to report the crash to government agencies. It was one of 20 crashes with injuries that Waymo has reported through June.  And it’s the only crash Waymo has classified as causing a serious injury.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049121#p3">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049121&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here at Ars, we've been publicly musing about whether the world was ready for a disc-free game console <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/is-the-world-ready-for-a-disc-free-game-console/">since as far back as 2015</a>. Now, though, the better question might be whether the world ever needs a new game console with a built-in disc drive at all.</p>
<p>Yesterday's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">announcement of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> seemed to treat the existence of disc-based games as an afterthought. You had to be watching pretty closely during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdEBSx--XSc">Mark Cerny's "technical presentation" video</a> to notice that the coming PS5 Pro is only available in a single disc-drive-free model. And you'd have to read pretty deep into <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">the official PlayStation blog post</a> on the subject to discover that "PS5 Pro is available as a disc-less console, with the option to purchase the currently available Disc Drive for PS5 separately."</p>
<p>That <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/disc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles">$80 disc drive accessory</a> was introduced as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/ps5-slims-new-external-disc-drive-requires-online-pairing-before-use/">an optional upgrade</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">the Digital Edition of the PS5 Slim</a> last year, alongside a Slim model that <em>does</em> have a pre-installed disc drive. But now, just one year later, Sony has decided that it only needs a single "disc-less" model of the PS5 Pro as the default.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049096#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049096&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rapa Nui, often referred to as Easter Island, is one of the most remote populated islands in the world. It's so distant that Europeans didn't stumble onto it until centuries after they had started exploring the Pacific. When they arrived, though, they found that the relatively small island supported a population of thousands, one that had built imposing monumental statues called moai. Arguments over how this population got there and what happened once it did have gone on ever since.</p>
<p>Some of these arguments, such as the idea that the island's indigenous people had traveled there from South America, have since been put to rest. Genomes from people native to the island show that its original population was part of the Polynesian expansion across the Pacific. But others, such as the role of ecological collapse in limiting the island's population and altering its culture, continue to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/we-now-have-even-more-evidence-against-the-ecocide-theory-of-easter-island/">debated</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers have now obtained genome sequence from the remains of 15 Rapa Nui natives who predate European contact. And they indicate that the population of the island appears to have grown slowly and steadily, without any sign of a bottleneck that could be associated with an ecological collapse. And roughly 10 percent of the genomes appear to have a Native American source that likely dates from roughly the same time that the island was settled.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049119#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049119&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Just a couple of days into the Google ad tech antitrust trial, it seems clear that the heart of the US Department of Justice's case is proving that Google Ad Manager is the key to the tech giant's alleged monopoly.</p>
<p>Google Ad Manager is the buy-and-sell side ad tech platform launched following Google's acquisition of DoubleClick and AdX in 2008 for $3 billion. It is currently used to connect Google's publisher ad servers with its ad exchanges, tying the two together in a way that allegedly locks the majority of publishers into paying higher fees on the publisher side because they can't afford to drop Google's ad exchange.</p>
<p>The DOJ has argued that Google Ad Manager "serves 90 percent of publishers that use the ad tech tools to sell their online ad inventory," AdAge <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/google-ad-tech-could-be-worth-95b-antitrust-case/2579761">reported,</a> and through it, Google clearly wields monopoly powers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049078#p3">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049078&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>"They won't make them like this much longer" is a pretty hackneyed aphorism, but it certainly applies to the Volkswagen Golf GTI. The Mk 8 Golf is due for a mid-life refresh next year, and when that happens, VW will be simplifying things by dropping the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/the-final-shift-which-manual-transmission-will-be-the-last/">manual transmission</a> option. That means model year 2024 is the final chance anyone will have to buy a GTI with three pedals. Yes, it has some flaws, but it's also small and nimble, both attributes lacking in so much of what the automotive industry has to offer these days.</p>
<p>We've been a bit deficient in not reviewing the Mk 8 Golf GTI until now. I reviewed the more expensive, more powerful Golf R <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/volkswagen-has-given-the-2022-golf-r-an-extreme-personality-change/">in 2022</a>, but the last GTI we drove was the outgoing Mk 7 car <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/the-2020-vw-golf-gti-proves-you-shouldnt-overcomplicate-an-icon/">in mid-2020</a>. That time, we were only able to source a GTI with the two-pedal, dual-clutch gearbox, a transmission I felt didn't quite suit the engine it was mated to. On the other hand, I was effusive about the old GTI's infotainment, calling it "one of the best systems on the market." Well, it was 2020, remember.</p>
<p>Under the hood, you'll find yet another version of VW Group's venerable EA888 four-cylinder engine, here with a turbocharger and direct injection. It generates 241 hp (180 kW) and 273 lb-ft (370 Nm), with that peak torque arriving at just 1,750 rpm. This sends its power to the front wheels via a seven-speed DSG or the soon-to-be-retired six-speed manual.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049026#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049026&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nearly a decade ago to the day, I stood in the international terminal of Houston's main airport checking my phone. As I waited to board a flight for Moscow, an announcement from NASA was imminent, with the agency due to make its selections for private companies that would transport astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Then, just before boarding the direct flight to Moscow, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-chooses-american-companies-to-transport-u-s-astronauts-to-international-space-station/">a news release</a> from NASA popped into my inbox about its Commercial Crew Program. The space agency, under a fixed price agreement, agreed to pay Boeing $4.2 billion to develop the Starliner spacecraft; SpaceX would receive $2.6 billion for the development of its Crew Dragon vehicle.</p>
<p>At the time, the Space Shuttle had been retired for three years, and NASA's astronauts had to fly to the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz spacecraft. "Today, we are one step closer to launching our astronauts from US soil on American spacecraft and ending the nation’s sole reliance on Russia by 2017," NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in the release.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048972#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048972&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Data centers powering the generative AI boom are gulping water and exhausting electricity at what <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/">some researchers</a> view as an unsustainable pace. Two entrepreneurs who met in high school a few years ago want to overcome that crunch with a fresh experiment: sinking the cloud into the sea.</p>
<p>Sam Mendel and Eric Kim launched their company, NetworkOcean, out of startup accelerator Y Combinator on August 15 <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/LcE-networkocean-underwater-data-centers">by announcing plans</a> to dunk a small capsule filled with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-chatgpt-hunger-energy-gpu-revolution/">GPU servers</a> into San Francisco Bay within a month. “There's this vital opportunity to build more efficient computer infrastructure that we're gonna rely on for decades to come,” Mendel says.</p>
<p>The founders contend that moving data centers off land would slow ocean temperature rise by drawing less power and letting seawater cool the capsule’s shell, supplementing its internal cooling system. NetworkOcean’s founders have said a location in the bay would deliver fast processing speeds for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/open-source-ai-y-combinator/">the region’s buzzing AI economy</a>.  </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048979#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048979&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s not every day that a security researcher acquires the ability to generate counterfeit HTTPS certificates, track email activity, and the position to execute code of his choice on thousands of servers—all in a single blow that cost only $20 and a few minutes to land. But that’s exactly what happened recently to Benjamin Harris.</p>
<p>Harris, the CEO and founder of security firm watchTowr, did all of this by registering the domain dotmobiregistry.net. The domain was once the official home of the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/registry-agreements/org/org-registry-agreement--whois-specifications-8-12-2006-en">authoritative WHOIS</a> server for .mobi, a top-level domain used to indicate that a website is optimized for mobile devices. At some point—it’s not clear precisely when—this WHOIS server, which acts as the official directory for every domain ending in .mobi, was relocated, from whois.dotmobiregistry.net to whois.nic.mobi. While retreating to his Las Vegas hotel room during last month’s Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, Harris noticed that the previous dotmobiregistry.net owners had allowed the domain to expire. He then scooped it up and set up his own .mobi WHOIS server there.</p>
<h2>Misplaced trust</h2>
<p>To Harris’s surprise, his server received queries from slightly more than 76,000 unique IP addresses within a few hours of setting it up. Over five days, it received roughly 2.5 million queries from about 135,000 unique systems. The entities behind the systems querying his deprecated domain included a who’s who of Internet heavyweights comprising domain registrars, providers of online security tools, governments from the US and around the world, universities, and certificate authorities, the entities that issue browser-trusted TLS certificates that make HTTPS work.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048683#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048683&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration has signaled to SpaceX that it won't approve a launch license for the next test flight of the Starship rocket until at least late November, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This is more than two months later than the mid-September timeframe the FAA previously targeted for determining whether to approve a launch license for the next Starship flight. SpaceX says the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage for the next launch—the fifth full-scale test flight of the Starship program—have been ready to launch since the first week of August.</p>
<p>"The flight test will include our most ambitious objective yet: attempt to return the Super Heavy booster to the launch site and catch it in mid-air," <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates/#starships-fly">SpaceX said in a statement</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048838#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048838&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nevada will soon become the first state to use AI to help speed up the decision-making process when ruling on appeals that impact people's unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>The state's Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation (DETR) agreed to pay Google $1,383,838 for the AI technology, a 2024 <a href="https://budget.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/budgetnvgov/content/Meetings/Board_of_Examiners/2024/8-13-2024_BOE_Packet.pdf">budget document</a> shows, and it will be launched within the "next several months," Nevada officials <a href="https://gizmodo.com/googles-ai-will-help-decide-whether-unemployed-workers-get-benefits-2000496215">told Gizmodo</a>.</p>
<p>Nevada's first-of-its-kind AI will rely on a Google cloud service called Vertex AI Studio. Connecting to Google's servers, the state will fine-tune the AI system to only reference information from DETR's database, which officials think will ensure its decisions are "more tailored" and the system provides "more accurate results," Gizmodo reported.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048889#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048889&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US government recently announced multiple charges against the alleged leaders of the "Terrorgram Collective," which does just what it sounds like—it promotes terrorism on the Telegram messaging platform. In this case, the terrorism was white racial terror, complete with a "hit list" of US officials and activists, a homemade "White Terror" video glorifying "saints" who had killed others, and instructions for taking down US infrastructure such as electrical substation transformers. (Read <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1366641/dl?inline">the indictment</a>.)</p>

<p>Chaos was the point. Terrorgram promoted "white supremacist accelerationism," which believes that society must be incited into a civil war or apocalyptic confrontation in order to bring down the existing system of government and establish a white nationalist state.</p>
<p>The group's manifestos and chat rooms sometimes felt suffused with the habits of the extremely online: hand-clap emojis between every important word, instructional videos on how to make bombs, the language of trolling, catchphrases so over the top they sound ironic ("HAIL HOLY TERROR" in all caps).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048921#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048921&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The human body is full of marvels, some even bordering on miraculous. That includes the limited ability for nerves to regenerate after injuries, allowing people to regain some function and feeling. But that wonder can turn, well, unnerving when those regenerated wires end up in a jumble.</p>
<p>Such is the case for a rare neurological condition called gustatory hyperhidrosis, also known as Frey's syndrome. In this disorder, nerves regenerate after damage to either of the large saliva glands that sit on either side of the face, just in front of the ears, called the parotid glands. But that nerve regrowth goes awry due to a quirk of anatomy that allows the nerves that control saliva production for eating to get tangled with those that control sweating for temperature control.</p>
<p>In this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2404232?logout=true">doctors in Taiwan report an unusual presentation of the disorder</a> in a 76-year-old woman. She told doctors that, for two years, every time she ate, her face would begin profusely sweating. In the clinic, the doctors observed the phenomenon themselves. They watched as she took a bite of pork jerky and began chewing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048913#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048913&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/mate-xt-ultimate-design/">Huawei's Mate XT Ultimate</a> is a phone that does not flip or fold, at least in the way of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-the-future-is-an-ugly-disappointment/">Samsung</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/">Google</a> contemporaries. You could say it collapses, really, across two hinges, from a full 10.2-inch diagonal rectangle (about a half-inch short of a standard iPad) down to a traditional 6.4-inch rectangle phone slab. There's also an in-between single-fold configuration at 7.9 inches. And there's an optional folding keyboard.</p>
<p>This phone, which Huawei calls a "trifold," would cost you the USD equivalent of $2,800 (19,999 yuan) if you could buy it in the US. Most notably, the phone launched just hours after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/iphone-16-gets-two-new-buttons-and-a-new-camera-look/">Apple's iPhone 16 event</a>. As noted by The New York Times, Huawei's product launches are often timed for maximum pushback against the US, which has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/huaweis-phone-sales-plummet-42-percent-in-q4-2020-its-now-in-sixth-place/">sanctioned</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/how-huawei-made-a-cutting-edge-chip-in-china-and-surprised-the-us/">attempted to stymie Huawei's chip tech</a>.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Imagine you're a Japanese eel, swimming around just minding your own business when—bam! A predatory fish swallows you whole and you only have a few minutes to make your escape before certain death. What's an eel to do? According to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)00926-6">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, Japanese eels opt to back their way out of the digestive tract, tail first, through the esophagus, emerging from the predatory fish's gills.</p>
<p>Per the authors, this is the first such study to observe the behavioral patterns and escape processes of prey within the digestive tract of predators. “At this point, the Japanese eel is the only species of fish confirmed to be able to escape from the digestive tract of the predatory fish after being captured,” co-author Yuha Hasegawa at Nagasaki University in Japan <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2447128-watch-eels-escape-from-the-stomachs-of-fish-after-being-swallowed/?utm_campaign=RSS%7CNSNS&amp;utm_source=NSNS&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_content=news">told New Scientist</a>.</p>
<p>There are various strategies in nature for escaping predators after being swallowed. For instance, a parasitic worm called <em>Paragordius tricuspidatus</em> can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/440756a#:~:text=If%20a%20worm%20did%20not,surviving%20predation%20in%20this%20way.">force its way out</a> of a predator’s system when its host organism is eaten. There was also a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220308423">fascinating study</a> in 2020 by Japanese scientists on the unusual survival strategy of the aquatic beetle <em>Regimbartia attenuata</em>. They fed a bunch of the beetles to a pond frog (<em>Pelophylax nigromaculatus</em>) under laboratory conditions, expecting the frog to spit the beetle out. That's what happened with <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2017.0647">prior experiments</a> on bombardier beetles (<em>Pheropsophus jessoensis</em>), which spray toxic chemicals (described as an audible "chemical explosion") when they find themselves inside a toad's gut, inducing the toad to invert its own stomach and vomit them back out.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048599#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048599&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/review-mnt-reform-laptop-has-fully-open-hardware-and-software-for-better-or-worse/">original MNT Reform laptop</a> was an interesting experiment, an earnest stab at the idea of a laptop that used entirely open source, moddable hardware as well as open source software. But as a modern Internet-connected laptop, its chunky design and (especially) its super-slow processor let it down.</p>

<p>MNT Research has been upgrading the Reform laptop and its smaller counterpart, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/all-open-source-7-inch-mnt-reform-laptop-starts-at-899-ships-in-october/">Pocket Reform</a>, continuously since we took a look at it two-and-a-half years ago. The most significant upgrade is probably <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform-rcore-rk3588-processor-module">the Rockchip RK3588 processor upgrade</a>, which offers four ARM Cortex-A76 CPU cores (the same ones used in the Raspberry Pi 5's Broadcom SoC) and four ARM Cortex-A55 cores, plus either 16GB or 32GB of RAM. While still not a high-end speed demon, these specs are enough to make it a competent workhorse laptop for browsing and productivity apps.</p>
<p>Now, MNT is revisiting the Reform with a more significant design update. The <a href="https://mntre.com/media/reform_md/2024-09-09-introducing-mnt-reform-next.html">MNT Reform Next</a> is smaller and thinner, defaults to a more traditional glass trackpad instead of a trackball, and is starting with the Rockchip RK3588 instead of the poky NXP/Freescale processor that the original laptop was saddled with.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048810#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048810&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
