                            <![CDATA[<p>James Dewey Watson, who helped reveal DNA’s double-helix structure, kicked off the Human Genome Project, and became infamous for his racist, sexist, and otherwise offensive statements, has died. He was 97.</p>
<p>His death was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/science/james-watson-dead.html">confirmed to The New York Times</a> by his son Duncan, who said Watson died on Thursday in a hospice in East Northport, New York, on Long Island. He had previously been hospitalized with an infection. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/in-remembrance-of-dr-james-d-watson/">also confirmed his passing</a>.</p>
<p>Watson was born in Chicago in 1928 and attained scientific fame in 1953 at 25 years old for solving the molecular structure of DNA—the genetic blueprints for life—with his colleague Francis Crick at England’s Cavendish laboratory. Their discovery heavily relied on the work of chemist and crystallographer Rosalind Franklin at King’s College in London, whose X-ray images of DNA provided critical clues to the molecule’s twisted-ladderlike architecture. One image in particular from Franklin’s lab, Photo 51, made Watson and Crick’s discovery possible. But, she was not fully credited for her contribution. The image was given to Watson and Crick without Franklin’s knowledge or consent by Maurice Wilkins, a biophysicist and colleague of Franklin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/james-watson-who-helped-unravel-dnas-double-helix-has-died/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The next time you encounter an unusually polite reply on social media, you might want to check twice. It could be an AI model trying (and failing) to blend in with the crowd.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, researchers from the University of Zurich, University of Amsterdam, Duke University, and New York University <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04195">released</a> a study revealing that AI models remain easily distinguishable from humans in social media conversations, with overly friendly emotional tone serving as the most persistent giveaway. The research, which tested nine open-weight models across Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Reddit, found that classifiers developed by the researchers detected AI-generated replies with 70 to 80 percent accuracy.</p>
<p>The study introduces what the authors call a “computational Turing test” to assess how closely AI models approximate human language. Instead of relying on subjective human judgment about whether text sounds authentic, the framework uses automated classifiers and linguistic analysis to identify specific features that distinguish machine-generated from human-authored content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/11/being-too-nice-online-is-a-dead-giveaway-for-ai-bots-study-suggests/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Another day, another malware attack on smartphones. Researchers at Unit 42, the threat intelligence arm of Palo Alto Networks, have revealed a sophisticated spyware known as “Landfall” targeting Samsung Galaxy phones. The researchers say this campaign leveraged a zero-day exploit in Samsung Android software to steal a raft of personal data, and it was active for almost a year. Thankfully, the underlying vulnerability has now been patched, and the attacks were most likely targeted at specific groups.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/landfall-is-new-commercial-grade-android-spyware/">Unit 42 says</a> that Landfall first appeared in July 2024, relying on a software flaw now catalogued as CVE-2025-21042. Samsung issued a patch for its phones in April 2025, but details of the attack have only been revealed now.</p>
<p>Even if you were out there poking around the darker corners of the Internet in 2024 and early 2025 with a Samsung Galaxy device, it’s unlikely you’d be infected. The team believes Landfall was used in the Middle East to target individuals for surveillance. It is currently unclear who was behind the attacks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/commercial-spyware-landfall-ran-rampant-on-samsung-phones-for-almost-a-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The federal government shutdown, now in its 38th day, prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary emergency order Thursday prohibiting commercial rocket launches from occurring during “peak hours” of air traffic.</p>
<p>The FAA also directed commercial airlines to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/list-40-airports-faa-flight-cancellations-capacity-cuts-government-shutdown-proposed/">reduce domestic flights</a> from 40 “high impact airports” across the country in a phased approach beginning Friday. The agency said the order from the FAA’s administrator, Bryan Bedford, is aimed at addressing “safety risks and delays presented by air traffic controller staffing constraints caused by the continued lapse in appropriations.”</p>
<p>The government considers air traffic controllers essential workers, so they remain on the job without pay until Congress passes a federal budget and President Donald Trump signs it into law. The shutdown’s effects, which affected federal workers most severely at first, are now rippling across the broader economy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/faa-says-commercial-rockets-must-launch-at-night-citing-government-shutdown/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has a ‘for sale’ sign up. And that could mean big changes for subscribers to the company’s most popular streaming service, HBO Max.</p>
<p>After receiving unsolicited acquisition offers, WBD recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/warner-bros-discovery-raises-hbo-max-prices-as-it-puts-itself-up-for-sale/">declared itself open</a> to “strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.” WBD <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/comcast-warner-bros-discovery-bankers-bid-1236571997/">drew new attention</a> by being open to selling its streaming business (WBD is also still open to moving forward with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-split-two-companies-streaming-tv-1236423250/">previously shared plans</a> to split into a cable company and a streaming and movie studios company next year).</p>

<p>The subpoena is supposed to be secret, but the Archive.today X account <a href="https://x.com/archiveis/status/1984093883056422993">posted the document</a> on October 30, the same day the subpoena was issued.

                            <![CDATA[<p>At a White House event Thursday, President Trump announced deals with drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to offer their popular GLP-1 obesity and diabetes drugs at lower prices for some Americans, namely some on Medicare and Medicaid plans. But questions linger about the significance of the deal.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-major-developments-in-bringing-most-favored-nation-pricing-to-american-patients/">the announcement</a>, Medicare and state Medicaid programs will be able to purchase a month’s supply of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound at $245 each for eligible patients. Eligible people on Medicare will have a $50 co-pay.</p>
<p>The negotiated price is a significant cut from the drugs’ list prices: The list price for Ozempic is $997, Wegovy is $1,350, Mounjaro is $1,080, and Zepbound is $1,086. But, of course, purchasers rarely pay drug list prices. It’s unclear how much Medicare and Medicaid would have paid for the drugs without this deal and what the savings will be.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/questions-swirl-after-trumps-glp-1-pricing-deal-announcement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For months, extremely personal and sensitive ChatGPT conversations have been leaking into an unexpected destination: Google Search Console (GSC), a tool that developers typically use to monitor search traffic, not lurk private chats.</p>
<p>Normally, when site managers access GSC performance reports, they see queries based on keywords or short phrases that Internet users type into Google to find relevant content. But starting this September, odd queries, sometimes more than 300 characters long, could also be found in GSC. Showing only user inputs, the chats appeared to be from unwitting people prompting a chatbot to help solve relationship or business problems, who likely expected those conversations would remain private.</p>
<p>Jason Packer, owner of an analytics consulting firm called Quantable, was among the first to flag the issue in a detailed <a href="https://www.quantable.com/ai/the-old-rules-are-dead/">blog</a> last month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/oddest-chatgpt-leaks-yet-cringey-chat-logs-found-in-google-analytics-tool/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>If you’ve played any number of RPGs, you probably know the <a href="https://gdkeys.com/keys-to-meaningful-skill-trees/">skill tree</a> as a break from the game’s core action. It’s a place to pause, take a breather, and scroll through a massive visual menu of upgrade options, considering which path of stat and ability tweaks best fits your character and your play style.</p>
<p>With <em>Skigill</em>, indie developer Achromi has taken that break-time menu and transformed it into the playing field for an intriguing <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style roguelike. And while the Early Access game currently lacks the kind of deep content that will keep players coming back for a long time, it’s still a clever and engaging take on the genre that I haven’t been able to put down for long.</p>
<h2>Clear the way, I need +5 armor!</h2>
<p>Like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and its many imitators, <em>Skigill</em> is all about navigating through waves of enemies that converge somewhat mindlessly on your position. The game automatically aims and deploys weapons to carve some safe space through what can be screens full of hazardous enemies, which leave behind coins as they explode in puffs of yellow smoke.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/with-skigill-the-classic-rpg-skill-tree-becomes-a-crowded-battlefield/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Ford electrified its bestselling pickup truck, it pulled out all the stops. The F-150 Lightning may look virtually identical to other versions of the pickup, but it’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/a-week-with-a-ford-f-150-lightning-this-truck-is-too-big-for-city-life/">smoother, faster, and obviously far, far more efficient</a> than the ones that run on gas, diesel, or hybrid power. But the future of the country’s bestselling electric truck may be in doubt.</p>
<p>That’s according to a report in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-150-lightning-ev-decision-89dc0d84">The Wall Street Journal</a>, which claims that Ford’s management is “in active discussions about scrapping” the Lightning. Production had already been suspended a few weeks ago due to an aluminum shortage following <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a69074672/fire-aluminum-supplier-ford-f150-production-idle/">a destructive fire</a> at a supplier’s factory in New York, which Ford estimates may result in as much as <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-stock-shakes-off-15-billion-hit-from-novelis-fire-on-news-plant-will-reopen-this-year-135408887.html">$2 billion in losses</a> to the company.</p>
<p>While Ford told Ars it doesn’t comment on speculation on its future product plans, the automaker said that “F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the US—despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian—and delivered record sales in Q3.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/ford-says-no-exact-date-to-restart-f-150-lightning-production/">Read full article</a></p>

The oldest tools at the site date back to 2.75 million years ago. According to a recent study, the finds suggest that for hundreds of millennia, ancient hominins relied on the same stone tool technology as an anchor while the world changed around them.</p>

<h2>“<b>An extraordinary story of cultural continuity”</b></h2>
<p>George Washington University archaeologist David Braun and his colleagues recently unearthed stone tools from a 2.75 million-year-old layer of Kenyan sediment at a site called Nomorotukunan. They’re classic examples of a type of tools archaeologists call Oldowan: the earliest types of sharp-edged stone tools made by hominins. The tools unearthed at Nomorotukunan are some of the oldest Olduwan tools ever found; only three other Oldowan sites in Africa date back any further than 2.6 million years ago.</p>
<p>These hand-sized chunks of river rock, with flakes chipped off one or two sides to make sharp edges, were cutting-edge technology (not sorry) from 2.9 million years ago until about 1.7 million years ago. In technical terms, that’s what’s called <i>a long flipping time, </i>enough to span several hominin species and more than one genus. The last hominins to use Oldowan tools looked very different, and probably lived and behaved very differently, from the first; over this huge span of time, the stone tool technology itself changed less than the beings using it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/10000-generations-of-hominins-used-the-same-stone-tools-to-weather-a-changing-world/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto, California, has some of the best real estate in the country, with a charming hodgepodge of homes ranging in style from Tudor revival to modern farmhouse and contemporary Mediterranean. It also has a gigantic compound that is home to Mark Zuckerberg, his wife Priscilla Chan, and their daughters Maxima, August, and Aurelia. Their land has expanded to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/us/mark-zuckerberg-palo-alto.html">include 11</a> previously separate properties, five of which are connected by at least one property line.</p>
<p>The Zuckerberg compound’s expansion first became a concern for Crescent Park neighbors <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/11/zuckerburg-snatches-up-pao-alto-homes-in-privacy-bid.html">as early</a> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/Zuckerberg-to-raze-4-houses-surrounding-Palo-Alto-7940437.php">as 2016</a>, due to fears that his purchases were driving up the market. Then, about five years later, neighbors noticed that a school appeared to be operating out of the Zuckerberg compound. This would be illegal under the area’s residential zoning code without a permit. They began a crusade to shut it down that did not end until summer 2025.</p>
<p>WIRED obtained 1,665 pages of documents about the neighborhood dispute—including 311 records, legal filings, construction plans, and emails—through a public record request filed to the Palo Alto Department of Planning and Development Services. (Mentions of “Zuckerberg” or “the Zuckerbergs” appear to have been redacted. However, neighbors and separate public records confirm that the property in question belongs to the family. The names of the neighbors who were in touch with the city were also redacted.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/mark-zuckerbergs-illegal-school-drove-his-neighbors-crazy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.18 of the Rocket Report! NASA is getting a heck of a deal from Blue Origin for launching the agency’s ESCAPADE mission to Mars. Blue Origin is charging NASA about $20 million for the launch on the company’s heavy-lift New Glenn rocket. A dedicated ride on any other rocket capable of the job would undoubtedly cost more.</p>
<p>But there are trade-offs. First, there’s the question of risk. The New Glenn rocket is only making its second flight, and it hasn’t been certified by NASA or the US Space Force. Second, the schedule for ESCAPADE’s launch has been at the whim of Blue Origin, which has delayed the mission several times due to issues developing New Glenn. NASA’s interplanetary missions typically have a fixed launch period, and the agency pays providers like SpaceX and United Launch Alliance a premium to ensure the launch happens when it needs to happen.</p>
<p>New Glenn is ready, the satellites are ready, and Blue Origin has set a launch date for Sunday, November 9. The mission will depart Earth outside of the usual interplanetary launch window, so orbital dynamics wizards came up with a unique trajectory that will get the satellites to Mars in 2027.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/rocket-report-canada-invests-in-sovereign-launch-india-flexes-rocket-muscles/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>And there’s always a temptation built into this kind of work.

Since then, it has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/event-horizon-telescope-captures-stunning-new-image-of-milky-ways-black-hole/">boosting the resolution</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/event-horizon-telescope-captures-birth-of-black-hole-jet-in-centaurus-a/">filling in the details</a> of an environment dominated by the most extreme gravity in the Universe.</p>
<p>But which gravity are we talking about? Because of its incompatibility with quantum mechanics and our current inability to explain dark matter, people have proposed all sorts of variants of gravity that go beyond general relativity and clean up some of the physics’ awkwardness. It’s possible that the extreme environment near a black hole amplifies the differences among at least some of these hypotheses. So, a group of physicists decided to see whether any of those differences might be large enough that the next generation of telescopes might be able to rule out some potential replacements for relativity.</p>
<h2>Searching for subtlety</h2>
<p>Any replacement for general relativity faces an awkward challenge: General relativity does pretty well at explaining everything from the large-scale structure of the Universe to phenomena we can measure right here on Earth. So, any alternative theories would have to differ from relativity in very subtle ways that might be extremely difficult to detect.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/imaging-black-holes-may-help-us-rule-out-some-models-of-gravity/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the world’s most ruthless and advanced hacking groups, the Russian state-controlled Sandworm, launched a series of destructive cyberattacks in the country’s ongoing war against neighboring Ukraine, researchers reported Thursday.</p>
<p>In April, the group targeted a Ukrainian university with two wipers, a form of malware that aims to permanently destroy sensitive data and often the infrastructure storing it. One wiper, tracked under the name Sting, targeted fleets of Windows computers by scheduling a task named DavaniGulyashaSdeshka, a phrase derived from Russian slang that loosely translates to “eat some goulash,” researchers from ESET <a href="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/en/papers/threat-reports/eset-apt-activity-report-q2-2025-q3-2025.pdf">said</a>. The other wiper is tracked as Zerlot.</p>
<h2>A not-so-common target</h2>
<p>Then, in June and September, Sandworm unleashed multiple wiper variants against a host of Ukrainian critical infrastructure targets, including organizations active in government, energy, and logistics. The targets have long been in the crosshairs of Russian hackers. There was, however, a fourth, less common target—organizations in Ukraine’s grain industry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/wipers-from-russias-most-cut-throat-hackers-rain-destruction-on-ukraine/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla shareholders today voted to approve a compensation plan that would pay Elon Musk more than $1 trillion over the next decade if he hits all of the plan’s goals. Musk won over 75 percent of the vote, according to the announcement at today’s shareholder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGPlvmMjPtE">meeting</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465925087598/tm252289-4_pre14a.htm">pay plan</a> would give Musk 423,743,904 shares, awarded in 12 tranches of 35,311,992 shares each if Tesla achieves various operational goals and market value milestones. Goals include delivering 20 million vehicles, obtaining 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, delivering 1 million “AI robots,” putting 1 million robotaxis in operation, and achieving a $400 billion adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).</p>
<p>Musk has threatened to leave if he doesn’t get a larger share of Tesla. He <a href="https://youtu.be/GQ9S7xbkGAY?t=2057">told investors</a> last month, “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money. It’s just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army? Not control, but a strong influence. That’s what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/elon-musk-wins-tesla-pay-vote-that-could-make-him-a-1-trillion-man/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has announced new features in the popular Google Finance platform, and it leans heavily on Google’s tried-and-true strategy of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/at-i-o-2025-google-leaves-no-doubt-that-ai-mode-is-the-future-of-search/">more AI in more places</a>. This builds on Google’s last Finance update, which added a Gemini-based chatbot. Now, Google is adding Gemini Deep Research to the site, which will allow users to ask much more complex questions. You can also ask questions about the future, backed by new betting market data sources.</p>
<p>The update, which is rolling out over the next several weeks, will add a Deep Research option to the Finance chatbot. The company claims that with the more powerful AI, users will be able to generate “fully cited” research reports on a given topic in just a few minutes. So you can expect an experience similar to Deep Research in the Gemini app—you give it a prompt, and then you come back later to see the result.</p>
<p>You probably won’t want to bother with Deep Research on simple queries—there are faster, easier ways to get that done. Google suggests using Deep Research on more complex things, like the doozy below.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/gemini-deep-research-comes-to-google-finance-backed-by-prediction-market-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T has been told to stop running ads that falsely promise all customers a free iPhone. The rebuke came from the advertising industry’s official watchdog just a week after AT&amp;T sued the organization over a different advertising dispute.</p>
<p>BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Review Board (NARB) “has recommended that AT&amp;T Services, Inc. modify its advertising to avoid conveying a false message regarding eligibility for an iPhone device offer,” the group, which runs the ad industry’s self-regulatory system, <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media/newsroom/decisions/appeal-att-iphone">said today</a>.</p>
<p>Verizon initiated the case by challenging AT&amp;T’s “Learn how everyone gets iPhone 16 Pro on us” claim. BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD) ruled in favor of Verizon in September 2025. AT&amp;T <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media/newsroom/decisions/att-free-iphone">appealed</a> but lost the challenge in the NARB decision announced today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/att-falsely-promised-everyone-a-free-iphone-ad-industry-board-rules/">Read full article</a></p>
