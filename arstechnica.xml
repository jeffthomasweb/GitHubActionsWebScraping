              <![CDATA[<p>For many, there's a feeling of dread associated with software updates to your favorite gadget. Updates to a beloved gadget can frequently result in outrage, from obligatory <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/sonos-ousts-executive-blamed-for-rushing-botched-app-update/">complaints around bugs</a> to selective aversions to change from Luddites and tech enthusiasts.</p>
<p>In addition to those frustrations, there are times when gadget makers use software updates to manipulate product functionality and seriously upend owners' abilities to use their property as expected. We’ve all seen software updates render gadgets absolutely horrible: Printers have nearly become a four-letter word as the industry infamously issues updates that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/hp-ceo-blocking-third-party-ink-from-printers-fights-viruses/">brick third-party ink</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/">scanning capabilities</a>. We've also seen companies update products that caused features to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/1700-smart-bassinet-adds-20-month-sub-but-only-if-you-buy-it-used/">be behind a paywall</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/oral-b-bricks-ability-to-set-up-alexa-on-230-smart-toothbrush/">removed entirely</a>. This type of behavior has contributed to some users feeling wary of software updates in fear of them diminishing the value of already-purchased hardware.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are times when software updates <i>enrich </i>the capabilities of smart gadgets. These updates are the types of things that can help devices retain or improve their value, last longer, and become less likely to turn into e-waste.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/when-software-updates-actually-improve-instead-of-ruin-our-favorite-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[A CEO speaking out against a Trump administration policy seems refreshing.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The re-election of President Trump has had a noticeable effect on the way many CEOs are running their businesses. Programs to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion are being canceled, and seven-figure checks were sent to his inauguration fund by CEOs like Apple's Tim Cook. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/trumps-new-head-of-dot-rips-up-us-fuel-efficiency-regulations/">behavior</a> from the Oval Office is mirrored by the rest of the administration, which is why it was a little surprising to see the CEO of a major company speak out against <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-day-one-orders-saving-tiktok-creating-doge-and-ending-censorship/">current US government policies</a>. But that's exactly what Ford President and CEO Jim Farley has done.</p>
<p>Speaking at a conference, Farley said that "President Trump has talked a lot about making our US auto industry stronger," but that "so far what we're seeing is a lot of cost and chaos," <a href="https://www.autonews.com/ford/an-farley-trump-cost-chaos/">reported Automotive News</a>.</p>
<p>During the election, Trump promised to enact heavy tariffs on a wide range of imports from countries across the globe. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-targets-mexico-and-canada-with-tariffs-plus-an-extra-10-for-china/">Among those particularly targeted were Canada and Mexico</a>. The two countries share borders with the US and, for many years, were joined in a free-trade association that encouraged US companies to set up factories in Canada and Mexico to take advantage of lower wages.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/ford-boss-says-tariffs-will-create-cost-and-chaos/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[There's yet another way to inject malicious prompts into chatbots.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In the nascent field of AI hacking, indirect prompt injection has become a basic building block for inducing chatbots to exfiltrate sensitive data or perform other malicious actions. Developers of platforms such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT are generally good at plugging these security holes, but hackers keep finding new ways to poke through them again and again.</p>
<p>On Monday, researcher Johann Rehberger demonstrated a new way to override prompt injection defenses Google developers have built into Gemini—specifically, defenses that restrict the invocation of Google Workspace or other sensitive tools when processing untrusted data, such as incoming emails or shared documents. The result of Rehberger’s attack is the permanent planting of long-term memories that will be present in all future sessions, opening the potential for the chatbot to act on false information or instructions in perpetuity.</p>
<h2>Incurable gullibility</h2>
<p>More about the attack later. For now, here is a brief review of indirect prompt injections: Prompts in the context of large language models (LLMs) are instructions, provided either by the chatbot developers or by the person using the chatbot, to perform tasks, such as summarizing an email or drafting a reply. But what if this content contains a malicious instruction? It turns out that chatbots are so eager to follow instructions that they often take their orders from such content, even though there was never an intention for it to act as a prompt.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/new-hack-uses-prompt-injection-to-corrupt-geminis-long-term-memory/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge today, February 11, gave the Trump administration until 11:59 pm tonight to restore public documents and datasets that were abruptly removed or altered from federal health websites to comply with an executive order on gender ideology.</p>
<p>Information was taken down from websites for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration following a January 29 memo from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The memo ordered all agencies to remove any public-facing media that "inculcate or promote gender ideology" that would violate <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">an executive order President Trump signed on January 20</a>. OPM gave agencies until just January 31 to comply.</p>
<p>The webpages that were subsequently removed include <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277069/gov.uscourts.dcd.277069.6.1.pdf">key guidance and data</a> on health risks in youth, school health policies, social vulnerability, environmental justice, HIV testing and prevention, assisted reproductive technologies, contraceptives, and recommendations for improving clinical studies, among other essential information.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/cdc-and-fda-have-until-tonight-to-restore-webpages-court-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google's Chrome browser might soon get a useful security upgrade: detecting passwords used in data breaches and then generating and storing a better replacement. Google's preliminary copy suggests it's an "AI innovation," though exactly how is unclear.</p>
<p>Noted software digger Leopeva64 on X found <a href="https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1887877987288097139">a new offering in the AI settings</a> of a very early build of Chrome. The option, "Automated password Change" (so, early stages—as to not yet get a copyedit), is described as, "When Chrome finds one of your passwords in a data breach, it can offer to change your password for you when you sign in."</p>
<p>Chrome already has a feature that warns users if the passwords they enter have been identified in a breach and will prompt them to change it. As <a href="https://windowsreport.com/chrome-to-use-ai-to-automatically-change-passwords-for-you/">noted by Windows Report</a>, the change is that now Google will offer to change it for you on the spot rather than simply prompting you to handle that elsewhere.

              <![CDATA[<p>A dairy worker in Nevada has been infected with a strain of H5N1 bird flu—genotype D1.1—that has newly spilled over to cows, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed.</p>
<p>The worker experienced conjunctivitis (pink eye) as the only symptom and is recovering, according to <a href="https://www.centralnevadahd.org/press-release/">a separate press release by the Central Nevada Health District</a> Monday.</p>
<p>The bird flu strain H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.1 is the predominant strain currently circulating in wild birds in North America and was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/strain-of-h5n1-bird-flu-that-killed-louisiana-resident-found-in-nevada-dairies/">confirmed for the first time in cows in Nevada last week</a>. According to the US Department of Agriculture, the new spillover was initially detected on January 31 via bulk milk testing. Until this point, the outbreak of H5N1 in dairy cows—which was declared in March 2024—was entirely caused by H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. The outbreak was thought to have been caused by a single spillover event from wild birds to cows in Texas in late 2023 or early 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/h5n1-bird-flu-nevada-dairy-worker-infected-with-newly-spilled-over-strain/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Acura provided accommodation for Ars for the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>DAYTONA BEACH, Florida—The North American road racing season kicked off in fine form a couple of weekends ago with the annual Rolex 24 at Daytona. This year, Honda Racing Corporation President Koji Watanabe was invited as the Grand Marshal, and his attendance at the race gave Ars a chance to talk racing with him, including an update on the company's F1 endeavors, which next year see it team up with Aston Martin. As we found out, it's going to be hard work.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, Honda rearranged the corporate structure around its motorsport activities. Honda Performance Development, which was responsible for developing Honda and Acura racing cars in IndyCar and IMSA, rebranded itself as Honda Racing Corporation US, a move that has meant closer collaboration between the teams in California and Japan, aligning everything under one overall boss—Watanabe.</p>
<h2>The ARX-06 at Le Mans—with Takuma Sato?</h2>
<p>Given that our roundtable with Watanabe and Vice President of HRC US Kelvin Fu took place during an endurance race, I asked whether the new corporate structure for racing would make a Le Mans program for the ARX-06 more feasible. Until now, the fact that the ARX-06 is branded as an Acura has been a stumbling block—Acura is a US-only brand, so it makes sense to race it in IMSA, but Le Mans and the World Endurance Championship are global events, and such a car would probably need to be labeled as—and therefore paid for by—Honda.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/perfecting-hondas-2026-f1-powertrain-is-not-so-easy-says-racing-boss/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly rejected an unsolicited Elon Musk-led attempt to purchase OpenAI for $97.4 billion.

              <![CDATA[<p>Utility terrain vehicles, also known as side-by-sides, are multi-seat off-road vehicles used for work or play, and their use is exploding around the globe. The market was once entirely composed of glorified golf carts, but we're now seeing plenty of wild-looking off-road monsters with the kind of extreme performance that puts many full-size off-roaders to shame.</p>
<p>Whatever it's used for, the average UTV lined up outside your local powersports dealer today is a serious machine—and it's usually sold with a serious sticker price to match. That's certainly the case with the one we're looking at today, the Polaris Ranger XP Kinetic Ultimate.</p>
<p>As that lengthy nomenclature suggests, this is a powerful, capable, well-rounded UTV. It also happens to be electric, offering 80 miles (129 km) of range from a 29.8-kWh battery, which powers an electric motor sourced from Zero Motorcycles, with 110 hp (82 kW) and a healthy 140 lb-ft (190 Nm) of torque.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/02/the-ranger-xp-kinetic-is-the-ultimate-electric-utv-at-a-high-price/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[The first Trump administration tried this, and Congress passed a rule to block it. ]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/new-nih-policy-will-slash-support-money-to-research-universities/">announced a sudden change</a> to how it handles the indirect costs of research—the money that pays for things like support services and facilities maintenance. These costs help pay universities and research centers to provide the environment and resources all their researchers need to get research done. Previously, these had been set through negotiations with the university and audits of the spending. These averaged roughly 30 percent of the value of the grant itself and would frequently exceed 50 percent.</p>
<p>The NIH announcement set the rate at 15 percent for every campus. The new rate would start today and apply retroactively to existing grants, meaning most research universities are currently finding themselves facing catastrophic budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>Today, a coalition of 22 states <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.280590/gov.uscourts.mad.280590.1.0.pdf">filed a suit</a> that seeks to block the new policy, alleging it violated both a long-standing law and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_(legislation)">budget rider</a> that Congress had passed in response to a 2017 attempt by Trump to drastically cut indirect costs. The suit seeks to prevent the new policy or its equivalent from being applied—something that Judge Angel Kelley of the District of Massachusetts <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25517849-nihtro021025/#document/p2">granted later in the day</a>. While that injunction only applies to research centers located in the states that have joined the suit, a separate suit was filed in the same district by a group of medical organizations, some of them (such as the Association of American Medical Colleges), have members throughout the country. As a result, Judge Kelley issued a separate ruling that <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/11/judge-orders-nationwide-halt-trump-nih-research-indirect-costs/">extended the injunction to the remaining states</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/twenty-two-states-sue-to-block-new-nih-funding-policy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is entering the final stages of designing its long-rumored AI processor with the aim of decreasing the company's dependence on Nvidia hardware, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-set-finalize-first-custom-chip-design-this-year-2025-02-10/">Reuters report</a> released Monday. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> creator plans to send its chip designs to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) for fabrication within the next few months, but the chip has not yet been formally announced.</p>
<p>The OpenAI chip's full capabilities, technical details, and exact timeline are still unknown, but the company reportedly intends to iterate on the design and improve it over time, giving it leverage in negotiations with chip suppliers—and potentially granting the company future independence with a chip design it controls outright.</p>
<p>In the past, we've seen other tech companies, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/microsoft-launches-custom-chips-to-accelerate-its-plans-for-ai-domination/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/amazon-ready-to-use-its-own-ai-chips-reduce-its-dependence-on-nvidia/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/09/google-building-ai-chips-axion-amin-vahdat-nvidia-h100-intel-gaudi-3/">Google</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-debuts-new-generation-ai-chip-2024-04-10/">Meta</a>, create their own AI acceleration chips for reasons that range from cost reduction to relieving shortages of AI chips supplied by Nvidia, which enjoys a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/nvidias-dominance-puts-ai-industry-in-dire-danger-groups-warn-doj/">near-market monopoly</a> on high-powered GPUs (such as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Blackwell series</a>) for data center use.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/openais-secret-weapon-against-nvidia-dependence-takes-shape/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first-ever National Nature Assessment—which was based on significant public feedback and strove to reveal how nature loss influences climate change and impacts humanity—may still see the light of day after the Trump administration abruptly ended the ambitious project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers involved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/climate/nature-assessment-trump.html">told The New York Times</a> that the nature report was "too important to die" and that an "amazingly broad consensus" remains among its mostly volunteer authors, so the expansive report must be completed and released to the public.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first draft of the report was due on Tuesday, so the bulk of the initial work appears mostly done. Although the webpage for the project has been deleted, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250124141504/https:/www.globalchange.gov/our-work/national-nature-assessment">archived</a> version shows that researchers had expected to spend the rest of 2025 seeking external review and edits before releasing the final report in late 2026.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/after-trump-killed-a-report-on-nature-researchers-push-ahead-with-release/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile yesterday <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-starlink-beta-open-for-all-carriers">announced</a> more details of its new service powered by Starlink and said Verizon and AT&amp;T customers can use the satellite offering, too. The standard price will be $15 a month as an add-on for T-Mobile customers, and $20 a month for people who don't have T-Mobile as their primary carrier.</p>
<p>While we've written numerous articles about the Starlink/T-Mobile collaboration over the past two and a half years, the service's beta test and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLw6ZovMpLI">Super Bowl commercial</a> are raising awareness that it exists. In this article we'll answer some questions you might have about T-Mobile Starlink (yes, T-Mobile Starlink is the official name of the service).</p>
<h3>What is this thing anyway?</h3>
<p>Over the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/spacex-launches-first-starlink-satellites-that-will-work-with-t-mobile-phones/">past 13 months</a>, SpaceX's Starlink division has launched about 450 Direct to Cell satellites that can provide service to mobile phones in areas where there are no cell towers.

This recalls a similar situation from early in the RTX 4090's life cycle, when power connectors were melting and even catching fire, damaging the GPUs and power supplies.</p>
<p>After much investigation and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/testing-suggests-faulty-cable-may-be-to-blame-for-melting-rtx-4090-connectors/">many guesses</a> from Nvidia and other testers, the 4090's power connector issues ended up being blamed on what was essentially user error; the 12VHPWR connectors were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/new-test-shows-loose-rtx-4090-power-connectors-cause-overheating-and-melting/">not being inserted all the way into the socket on the GPU</a> or were being bent in a way that created stress on the connection, which caused the connectors to run hot and eventually burst into flames.</p>
<p>The PCI-SIG, the standards body responsible for the design of the new connector, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/pci-standards-group-deflects-assigns-blame-for-melting-gpu-power-connectors/">claimed</a> that the design of the 12VHPWR connector itself was sound and that any problems with it should be attributed to the manufacturers implementing the standard. Partly in response to the 4090 issues, the 12VHPWR connector was replaced by an updated standard <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/diy-builder/power-supply-units/evolving-standards-12vhpwr-and-12v-2x6/?srsltid=AfmBOorP8rameX-x07huylv7or9W6p_d1KvzTOyN4FaR7OPDdptRqxV_">called 12V-2x6</a>, which uses the same cables and is pin-compatible with 12VHPWR, but which tweaked the connector to ensure that power is only actually delivered if the connectors are firmly seated. The RTX 50-series cards use the 12V-2x6 connector.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/handful-of-users-claim-new-nvidia-gpus-are-melting-power-cables-again/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[The state is much more permissive than California for driverless vehicles.]]>
          </description>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you live or drive in Austin, Texas, you might start seeing some new-looking Teslas on your roads later this summer. Tesla says it wants to start <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-robotaxis-by-june-musk-turns-texas-hands-off-regulation-2025-02-10/">offering rides for money</a> in the two-seater "Cybercab" that the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/">revealed last year at a Hollywood backlot</a>. California might be the place with enough glitz to unleash that particular stock-bumping news to the world, but the Golden State is evidently far too restrictive for a company like Tesla to truck with. Instead, the easygoing authorities in Texas provide a far more attractive environment when it comes to putting driverless rubber on the road.</p>
<p>During the early days of its autonomous vehicle (AV) ambitions, Tesla did its testing in California, like most of the rest of the industry. California was early to lay down laws and regulations for the nascent AV industry, a move that some criticized as premature and unnecessarily restrictive. Among the requirements has been the need to report <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/01/self-diving-car-companies-hand-over-data-on-glitches-and-failures-to-the-dmv/">test mileage and disengagements</a>, reports that revealed that Tesla's testing has in fact been <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/02/27/tesla-reports-fully-autonomous-miles-first-time-years/">extremely limited</a> within that state's borders <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-full-500-mile-single-charge-test-timelapse/">since 2016</a>.</p>
<p>Other states, mostly ones blessed with good weather, have become a refuge for AV testing away from California's strictures, especially car-centric cities like Phoenix, Arizona, and Austin, Texas. Texas amended its transportation code in 2017 to allow autonomous vehicles to operate on its roads, and it took away any ability for local governments to restrict testing or deployment. By contrast, companies like Waymo and the now-shuttered Cruise were given <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/robotaxis-get-ok-to-charge-for-rides-in-san-francisco/">much more narrow permission</a> to deploy only in limited parts of California.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/tesla-turns-to-texas-to-test-its-autonomous-cybercab/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>While writing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">a wide-ranging history of Windows <em>Minesweeper</em></a> for Boss Fight Books in 2023, I ended up playing many variations of Microsoft's beloved original game. Those include <a href="https://illarn.itch.io/hexasweeper">versions with hexagonal tiles</a>, <a href="https://stingby12.itch.io/my-very-epic-custom-minesweeper-variants">versions with weird board shapes</a>, and versions that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787980/4D_Minesweeper/">extend <em>Minesweeper</em> into four dimensions</a> or <a href="http://gravitation3d.com/xezlec/">more</a>, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Almost all these variants messed a little too much with the careful balance of simplicity, readability, reasoning, and luck that made the original <em>Minesweeper</em> so addictive. None of them became games I return to day after day.</p>
<p>But then I stumbled onto <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper"><em>Dragonsweeper</em></a>, a free browser-based game that <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/">indie developer Daniel Benmergui</a> released unceremoniously on itch.io last month. In the weeks since I discovered it, the game has become my latest puzzle obsession, filling in a worrying proportion of my spare moments with its addictive, simple RPG-tinged take on the <em>Minesweeper</em> formula.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/dragonsweeper-is-my-favorite-game-of-2025-so-far/">Read full article</a></p>
