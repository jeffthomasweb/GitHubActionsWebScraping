              <![CDATA[<p>The people overseeing the security of Google’s Chrome browser <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/spam-and-abuse">explicitly forbid</a> third-party extension developers from trying to manipulate how the browser extensions they submit are presented in the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions">Chrome Web Store</a>. The policy specifically calls out search-manipulating techniques such as listing multiple extensions that provide the same experience or plastering extension descriptions with loosely related or unrelated keywords.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, security and privacy researcher Wladimir Palant revealed that developers are flagrantly violating those terms in hundreds of extensions currently available for download from Google. As a result, searches for a particular term or terms can return extensions that are unrelated, inferior knockoffs, or carry out abusive tasks such as surreptitiously monetizing web searches, something Google expressly forbids.</p>
<h2>Not looking? Don’t care? Both?</h2>
<p>A search Wednesday morning in California for Norton Password Manager, for example, returned not only the official extension but three others, all of which are unrelated at best and potentially abusive at worst. The results may look different for searches at other times or from different locations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/googles-chrome-web-store-has-a-serious-spam-problem-promoting-shady-extensions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Italian government is considering the purchase of satellite Internet services from SpaceX's Starlink constellation, and the potential deal has triggered controversy along political, economic, and spaceflight lines in Europe.</p>
<p>The story was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-05/italy-plans-1-5-billion-spacex-telecom-security-services-deal?embedded-checkout=true">initially broken by Bloomberg</a> on Sunday, which reported that Italy is in "advanced talks" with SpaceX to purchase $1.6 billion worth of secure telecommunication services from SpaceX. The publication said an agreement, for which talks began in mid-2023, had been stalled until Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited President-elect Donald Trump in Florida recently.</p>
<p>This report set off a firestorm of responses that highlight the increasing sensitivity of European countries to partnering with SpaceX—the success of which has put serious pressure on Europe's launch industry—as well as the Trump administration and SpaceX founder Elon Musk.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/italian-interest-in-starlink-strikes-at-the-heart-of-european-space-solidarity/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's pretty easy to see the problem here: The Internet is brimming with misinformation, and most large language models are trained on a massive body of text obtained from the Internet.</p>
<p>Ideally, having substantially higher volumes of accurate information might overwhelm the lies. But is that really the case? A new study by researchers at New York University examines how much medical information can be included in a large language model (LLM) training set before it spits out inaccurate answers. While the study doesn't identify a lower bound, it does show that by the time misinformation accounts for 0.001 percent of the training data, the resulting LLM is compromised.</p>
<p>While the paper is focused on the intentional "poisoning" of an LLM during training, it also has implications for the body of misinformation that's already online and part of the training set for existing LLMs, as well as the persistence of out-of-date information in validated medical databases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/its-remarkably-easy-to-inject-new-medical-misinformation-into-llms/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Just when you thought you had seen every possible <em>Doom</em> mod, two game developers <a href="https://bobatealee.itch.io/doom-the-gallery-experience">released a free browser game</a> that reimagines the first level of 1993's <em>Doom</em> as an art gallery, replacing demons with paintings and shotguns with wine glasses.</p>
<p><em>Doom: The Gallery Experience</em>, created by Filippo Meozzi and Liam Stone, transforms the iconic E1M1 level into a virtual museum space where players guide a glasses-wearing Doomguy through halls of fine art as classical music plays in the background. The game links each displayed artwork to its corresponding page on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's website.</p>
<p>"In this experience, you will be able to walk around and appreciate some fine art while sipping some wine and enjoying the complimentary hors d’oeuvres," write the developers on the game's itch.io page, "in the beautifully renovated and re-imagined E1M1 of id Software's <em>DOOM</em> (1993)."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/doom-marine-crashes-art-gallery-politely-sips-wine/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's a good chance you've seen headlines about HMPV recently, with some touting "what you need to know" about the virus, aka <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/human-metapneumovirus/about/index.html">human metapneumovirus</a>. The answer is: not much.</p>
<p>It's a common, usually mild respiratory virus that circulates every year, blending into the throng of other seasonal respiratory illnesses that are often indistinguishable from one another. (The pack includes influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, common human coronaviruses, bocavirus, rhinovirus, enteroviruses, and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae, </em>among others.) HMPV is in the same family of viruses as RSV.</p>
<p>As one viral disease epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control summarized in 2016, it's usually "<a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/867267?src=par_cdc_stm_mscpedt&amp;faf=1">clinically indistinguishable</a>" from other bog-standard respiratory illnesses, like seasonal flu, that cause cough, fever, and nasal congestion. For most, the infection is crummy but not worth a visit to a doctor. As such, testing for it is limited. But, like other common respiratory infections, it can be dangerous for children under age 5, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems. It was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11385510/">first identified in 2001</a>, but it has likely been circulating since at least 1958.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/chinas-illness-spike-is-mostly-just-seasonal-flu-and-other-usual-bugs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T, following last year's embarrassing botched update that kicked every device off its wireless network and blocked over 92 million phone calls, is now promising full-day bill credits to mobile customers for future outages that last at least 60 minutes and meet certain other criteria. A similar promise is being made to fiber customers for unplanned outages lasting at least 20 minutes, but only if the customer uses an AT&amp;T-provided gateway.</p>
<p>The "AT&amp;T Guarantee" <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/guarantee.html">announced today</a> has caveats that can make it possible for a disruption to not be covered. AT&amp;T says the promised mobile bill credits are "for wireless downtime lasting 60 minutes or more caused by a single incident impacting 10 or more towers."</p>
<p>The full-day bill credits do not include a prorated amount for the taxes and fees imposed on a monthly bill. The "bill credit will be calculated using the daily rate customer is charged for wireless service only (excludes taxes, fees, device payments, and any add-on services," <a href="https://www.att.com/why-att/guarantee/?source=EPcc000000000000U">AT&amp;T said</a>. If an outage lasts more than 24 hours, a customer will receive another full-day bill credit for each additional day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/att-promises-bill-credits-for-outages-see-fine-print-many-exceptions-apply/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Generative models can be powerfully useful—if you're willing to adapt your approach.]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>This article is a summary of my personal experiences with using generative models while programming over the past year. It has not been a passive process. I have intentionally sought ways to use LLMs while programming to learn about them. The result has been that I now regularly use LLMs while working, and I consider their benefits to be net-positive on my productivity. (My attempts to go back to programming without them are unpleasant.)</p>
<p>Along the way, I have found oft-repeated steps that can be automated, and a few of us are working on building those into a tool specifically for Go programming: <a href="https://sketch.dev">sketch.dev</a>. It’s very early, but so far, the experience has been positive.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I am typically curious about new technology. It took very little experimentation with LLMs for me to want to see if I could extract practical value. There is an allure to a technology that can (at least some of the time) craft sophisticated responses to challenging questions. It is even more exciting to watch a computer attempt to write a piece of a program as requested and make solid progress.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-i-program-with-llms/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For nearly four years, NASA's Perseverance rover has journeyed across an unexplored patch of land on Mars—once home to an ancient river delta—and collected a slew of rock samples sealed inside cigar-sized titanium tubes.</p>
<p>These tubes might contain tantalizing clues about past life on Mars, but NASA's ever-changing plans to bring them back to Earth are still unclear.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NASA officials presented two options for retrieving and returning the samples gathered by the Perseverance rover. One alternative involves a conventional architecture reminiscent of past NASA Mars missions, relying on the "sky crane" landing system demonstrated on the agency's two most recent Mars rovers. The other option would be to outsource the lander to the space industry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/fund-or-cancel-robots-or-humans-nasa-punts-on-mars-sample-return-decision/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo still isn't ready to officially reveal any details about the Switch 2 (beyond <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">a brief mention of backward compatibility in November</a>). But that hasn't stopped <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/">gaming accessory maker Genki</a> from giving us one of the best looks yet at the size and shape of Nintendo's upcoming hardware, as well as a video glimpse of how the console's new Joy-Cons will attach to the base tablet.</p>
<p>Genki is reportedly using a scale 3D model of the Switch 2 to show off its console cases behind closed doors at the Consumer Electronics Show. A <a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">video from French tech site Numerama</a> shows that 3D model dwarfing an original Switch model in both length and width.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In just 20 minutes this morning, an automated license-plate-recognition (ALPR) system in Nashville, Tennessee, captured photographs and detailed information from nearly 1,000 vehicles as they passed by. Among them: eight black Jeep Wranglers, six Honda Accords, an ambulance, and a yellow Ford Fiesta with a vanity plate.</p>
<p>This trove of real-time vehicle data, collected by one of Motorola’s ALPR systems, is meant to be accessible by law enforcement. However, a flaw discovered by a security researcher has exposed live video feeds and detailed records of passing vehicles, revealing the staggering scale of surveillance enabled by this widespread technology.</p>
<p>More than 150 Motorola ALPR cameras have exposed their video feeds and leaking data in recent months, according to security researcher Matt Brown, who first publicized the issues in a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dUnY1641WM">YouTube videos</a> after buying an ALPR camera on eBay and reverse engineering it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/misconfigured-license-plate-readers-are-leaking-data-and-video-in-real-time/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>LAS VEGAS—If you've always dreamed of a world where your vehicle is a "partner" around whom you can "always be yourself," Honda has the vehicles for you—at least that's what the Japanese automaker is promising with its new "near production" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/these-are-hondas-concepts-for-its-new-family-of-evs-due-in-2026/">Honda 0 prototypes that debuted at CES in Las Vegas on Tuesday.</a></p>
<p>In a somewhat dystopian but highly sentimental video shown at the presentation, a woman drives along a desolate road in search of a sunrise, describing her favorite colors and laughing along with the Saloon concept. A calm voiceover intones, "Saloon is my partner—always by my side, opening me up to new experiences and expanding my world," as the passenger is zipped along the flat purple and pink landscape, sharing moments of joy and tears. The car even "comforts" her when she is sad.</p>
<p>This is Honda's vision for what Katsushi Inoue, chief officer of electrification business development operations at Honda, called the "ultra personal optimization" of a "new level of intelligent car."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/after-partnerships-with-gm-and-sony-here-are-hondas-next-homegrown-evs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The H5N1 bird flu situation in the US seems more fraught than ever this week as the virus continues to spread swiftly in dairy cattle and birds while sporadically jumping to humans.</p>
<p>On Monday, officials in Louisiana announced that the person who had developed the country's first severe H5N1 infection had died of the infection, marking the country's first H5N1 death. Meanwhile, with no signs of H5N1 slowing, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2024-week-52.html">seasonal flu is skyrocketing</a>, raising anxiety that the different flu viruses could mingle, swap genetic elements, and generate a yet more dangerous virus strain.</p>
<p>But, despite the seemingly fever-pitch of viral activity and fears, a representative for the World Health Organization today noted that risk to the general population remains low—as long as one critical factor remains absent: person-to-person spread.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/as-us-marks-first-h5n1-bird-flu-death-who-and-cdc-say-risk-remains-low/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For several years, an innovative, California-based launch company named Relativity Space has been the darling of investors and media.</p>
<p>Relativity promised to disrupt launch by taking a somewhat niche technology in the space industry at the time, 3D printing, and using it as the foundation for manufacturing rockets. The pitch worked. Relativity's chief executive Tim Ellis liked to brag that his first investor call was to Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who cut the company's first check. Cuban invested half a million dollars.</p>
<p>That was just the beginning of the torrent of fundraising by Ellis, who, by November 2023, turned the privately held Relativity into a $4.5 billion company following its latest, Series F funding. This was an impressive start for the company founded by Ellis and Jordan Noone, both engineers, in 2016.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/nearly-two-years-after-its-radical-pivot-fidelity-slashes-relativitys-valuation/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Justice Department today <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-six-large-landlords-algorithmic-pricing-scheme-harms-millions">announced</a> it filed an antitrust lawsuit against "six of the nation's largest landlords for participating in algorithmic pricing schemes that harmed renters."</p>
<p>One of the landlords, Cortland Management, agreed to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1383311/dl?inline">settlement</a> "that requires it to cooperate with the government, stop using its competitors' sensitive data to set rents and stop using the same algorithm as its competitors without a corporate monitor," the DOJ said. The pending settlement requires Cortland to "cooperate fully and truthfully... in any civil investigation or civil litigation the United States brings or has brought" on this subject matter.</p>
<p>The US <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/us-sues-realpage-claims-rental-pricing-algorithm-used-by-landlords-is-illegal/">previously sued RealPage</a>, a software maker accused of helping landlords collectively set prices by giving them access to competitors' nonpublic pricing and occupancy information.

              <![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly a year ago, we were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">publicly yearning</a> for the day when more portable gaming PC makers could ditch Windows in favor of SteamOS (without having to resort to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/">touchy unofficial workarounds</a>). Now, that day has finally come, with Lenovo <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/">announcing</a> the upcoming Legion Go S as the first non-Valve handheld to come with an officially licensed copy of SteamOS preinstalled. And Valve promises that it will soon ship a beta version of SteamOS for users to "download and test themselves."</p>
<p>As Lenovo's slightly downsized followup to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">2023's massive Legion Go</a>, the Legion Go S won't feature the detachable controllers of its predecessor. But the new PC gaming handheld will come in two distinct versions, one with the now-standard Windows 11 installation and another edition that's the first to sport the (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">recently leaked</a>) "Powered by SteamOS" branding.</p>
<p>The lack of a Windows license seems to contribute to a lower starting cost for the "Powered by SteamOS" edition of the Legion Go S, which will start at $500 when it's made available in May. Lenovo says the Windows edition of the device—available starting this month—will start at $730, with "additional configurations" available in May starting as low as $600.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When suspicion began to mount that the young prosecutor, Yujin Choi, might have faked her sexual misconduct allegations against a Denver District Attorney's Office colleague, investigators asked to examine Choi's laptop and cell phone. But just before Choi was to have turned them in, her devices suffered a series of unlikely accidents.</p>
<p>First, she said, she managed to drop her phone into a filled bathtub. When she pulled the phone out of the water and found it was not working, Choi went to her laptop in order to make a video call. When the call ended, Choi then knocked over a bottle of water—whoops!—directly onto the computer, which was also taken out of commission. So, when the day came to hand in her devices, neither was working.</p>
<p>"I’m devastated that I may have tanked the investigation on my own, but that I also lost all of my personal data that were very important to me," Choi wrote to investigators. She had even, she added, gone to the local Apple Store in an attempt to retrieve the data on the devices. No luck.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/dirty-deeds-in-denver-ex-prosecutor-faked-texts-destroyed-devices-to-frame-colleague/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia has good news and bad news for people building or buying gaming PCs.</p>
<p>The good news is that three of its four new RTX 50-series GPUs are the same price or slightly cheaper than the RTX 40-series GPUs they're replacing. The RTX 5080 is $999, the same price as the RTX 4080 Super; the 5070 Ti and 5070 are launching for $749 and $549, each $50 less than the 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super.</p>
<p>The bad news for people looking for the absolute fastest card they can get is that the company is charging $1,999 for its flagship RTX 5090 GPU, significantly more than the $1,599 MSRP of the RTX 4090. If you want Nvidia's biggest and best, it will cost at least as much as four high-end game consoles or a pair of decently specced midrange gaming PCs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Most scientific literature is published in for-profit journals that rely on subscriptions and paywalls to turn a profit. But that trend has been shifting as various governments and funding agencies are requiring that the science they fund <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/us-government-to-make-all-research-it-funds-open-access-on-publication/">be published in open-access journals</a>. The transition is happening gradually, though, and a lot of the historical literature remains locked behind paywalls.</p>
<p>These paywalls can pose a problem for researchers who aren't at well-funded universities, including many in the Global South, which may not be able to access the research they need to understand in order to pursue their own studies. One solution has been Sci-Hub, a site where people can upload PDFs of published papers so they can be shared with anyone who can access the site. Despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/scientific-research-piracy-site-hit-with-15-million-fine/">losses in publishing industry lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/05/piracy-site-for-academic-journals-playing-game-of-domain-name-whac-a-mole/">attempts to block access</a>, Sci-Hub continues to serve up research papers that would otherwise be protected by paywalls.</p>
<p>But what it's serving up may not always be the latest and greatest. Generally, when a paper is retracted for being invalid, publishers issue an updated version of its PDF with clear indications that the research it contains should no longer be considered valid. Unfortunately, it appears that once Sci-Hub has a copy of a paper, it doesn't necessarily have the ability to ensure it's kept up to date. Based on a scan of its content done by researchers from India, about 85 percent of the invalid papers they checked had no indication that the paper had been retracted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-paper-piracy-site-sci-hub-shares-lots-of-retracted-papers/">Read full article</a></p>

      Who is better at maneuvering a large load through a maze, ants or humans?

<p>The piano-mover puzzle involves trying to transport an oddly shaped load across a constricted environment with various obstructions. It's one of several variations on classic computational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning">motion-planning</a> problems, a key element in numerous robotics applications. But what would happen if you pitted human beings against ants in a competition to solve the piano-mover puzzle?</p>
<p>According to a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, humans have superior cognitive abilities and, hence, would be expected to outperform the ants. However, depriving people of verbal or nonverbal communication can level the playing field, with ants performing better in some trials. And while ants improved their cognitive performance when acting collectively as a group, the same did not hold true for humans.</p>
<p>Co-author Ofer Feinerman of the Weizmann Institute of Science and colleagues saw an opportunity to use the piano-mover puzzle to shed light on group decision-making, as well as the question of whether it is better to cooperate as a group or maintain individuality. "It allows us to compare problem-solving skills and performances across group sizes and down to a single individual and also enables a comparison of collective problem-solving across species," the authors wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/ants-vs-humans-solving-the-piano-mover-puzzle/">Read full article</a></p>
