<p>Welcome to Edition 6.49 of the Rocket Report! I want to open this week's report with a hearty congratulations to Rocket Lab for the company's 50th launch since Electron's debut in 2017. This is a fine achievement for a company founded in New Zealand, a country with virtually no space program.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets and a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smalll.png"></div>
<p><strong>Electron celebrates its 50th</strong>. On Thursday, <a href="https://x.com/RocketLab/status/1803870728753942737">Rocket Lab launched its 50th Electron mission</a>, "No Time Toulouse."  The mission successfully deployed five Internet-of-Things satellites for the French company Kinéis. This is a nice milestone for the company founded by Peter Beck in New Zealand. With this mission, Rocket Lab becomes the fastest company to go from one launch to 50 launches of a privately developed rocket, surpassing even SpaceX. The company's first Electron mission came about seven years ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032510#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032510&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On a Wednesday morning in late January 1896 at a small light bulb factory in Chicago, a middle-aged woman named Rose Lee found herself at the heart of a groundbreaking medical endeavor. With an X-ray tube positioned above the tumor in her left breast, Lee was treated with a torrent of high-energy particles that penetrated into the malignant mass.</p>
<p>“And so,” as her treating clinician later <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/21.2.156">wrote</a>, “without the blaring of trumpets or the beating of drums, X-ray therapy was born.”</p>
<p>Radiation therapy has come a long way since those <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/69/2/383/550073/Advances-in-Radiotherapy-and-Implications-for-the">early beginnings</a>. The discovery of radium and other radioactive metals opened the doors to administering higher doses of radiation to target cancers located deeper within <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/reports/special-report-building-bodies">the body</a>. The introduction of proton therapy later made it possible to precisely guide radiation beams to tumors, thus reducing damage to surrounding healthy tissues—a degree of accuracy that was further refined through improvements in medical physics, computer technologies and state-of-the-art imaging techniques.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032646#p3">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032646&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Biden administration will ban all sales of Kaspersky antivirus software in the US starting in July, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-ban-us-sales-kaspersky-software-over-ties-russia-source-says-2024-06-20/">reporting from Reuters</a> and a filing from the US Department of Commerce (<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-13695.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>The US believes that security software made by Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab represents a national security risk, and that the Russian government could use Kaspersky's software to install malware, block other security updates, and "collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans," said US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.</p>
<p>“When you think about national security, you may think about guns and tanks and missiles,” said Raimondo during a press briefing, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-bans-kaspersky-software/">as reported by Wired</a>. “But the truth is, increasingly, it's about technology, and it's about dual-use technology, and it's about data.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032766#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032766&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, Anthropic announced <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>, its latest AI language model and the first in a new series of "3.5" models that build upon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">Claude 3</a>, launched in March. Claude 3.5 can compose text, analyze data, and write code. It features a 200,000 token context window and is available now on the <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude website</a> and through an API. Anthropic also introduced Artifacts, a new feature in the Claude interface that shows related work documents in a dedicated window.</p>

<p>So far, people outside of Anthropic seem impressed. "This model is really, really good," <a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1803819993416466573">wrote</a> independent AI researcher Simon Willison on X. "I think this is the new best overall model (and both faster and half the price of Opus, similar to the GPT-4 Turbo to GPT-4o jump)."</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">written before</a>, benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are troublesome because they can be cherry-picked and often do not capture the feel and nuance of using a machine to generate outputs on almost any conceivable topic. But according to Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Sonnet matches or outperforms competitor models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on certain benchmarks like <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-task-language-understanding-on-mmlu">MMLU</a> (undergraduate level knowledge), <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/gsm8k">GSM8K</a> (grade school math), and <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/humaneval">HumanEval</a> (coding).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032543#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032543&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pornhub will soon be blocked in five more states as the adult site continues to fight what it considers privacy-infringing age-verification laws that require Internet users to provide an ID to access pornography.</p>
<p>On July 1, according to a <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/age-verification-in-the-news">blog</a> post on the adult site announcing the impending block, Pornhub visitors in Indiana, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, and Nebraska will be "greeted by a video featuring" adult entertainer Cherie Deville, "who explains why we had to make the difficult decision to block them from accessing Pornhub."</p>
<p>Pornhub explained that—similar to blocks in Texas, Utah, Arkansas, Virginia, Montana, North Carolina, and Mississippi—the site refuses to comply with soon-to-be-enforceable age-verification laws in this new batch of states that allegedly put users at "substantial risk" of identity theft, phishing, and other harms.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032654#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032654&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since the launch of the hypercar-defining Veyron back in 2005, modern Bugattis have served as benchmarks for straight-line performance and no-expense-spared automotive engineering. At a time when a 300 horsepower Mustang GT was something to crow about, the quad-turbocharged, W16-powered Veyron offered more than a thousand, metric (987 hp/736 kW).</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, and in contrast to most other world-beating performance cars, the Veyron wasn't presented as some skunkworks project that had been pushed to the ragged edge. Instead, it was a wholly realized ultra-luxury-performance machine, replete with the sort of grand touring appointments you'd expect to find in a Bentley rather than a top speed record holder.</p>
<p>Still, it was the numbers that instantly captivated enthusiasts and casual onlookers alike, and Bugatti would go on to reset the bar with the introduction of the 1,479 hp (1,102 kW) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/this-is-what-its-like-driving-a-bugatti-chiron-at-305mph/">Chiron</a> in 2016.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032077#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032077&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Big tech companies are still trying to rally workers back into physical offices, and many workers are still not having it. Based on a recent report, computer-maker Dell has stumbled even more than most.</p>
<p>Dell announced a new return-to-office initiative <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/dell-tells-remote-workers-that-they-wont-be-eligible-for-promotion/">earlier this year</a>. In the new plan, workers had to classify themselves as remote or hybrid.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's one of the world's worst-kept secrets that large language models give blatantly false answers to queries and do so with a confidence that's indistinguishable from when they get things right. There are a number of reasons for this. The AI could have been trained on misinformation; the answer could require some extrapolation from facts that the LLM isn't capable of; or some aspect of the LLM's training might have incentivized a falsehood.</p>
<p>But perhaps the simplest explanation is that an LLM doesn't recognize what constitutes a correct answer but is compelled to provide one. So it simply makes something up, a habit that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">been termed confabulation</a>.</p>
<p>Figuring out when an LLM is making something up would obviously have tremendous value, given how quickly people have started relying on them for everything from college essays to job applications. Now, researchers from the University of Oxford say they've found a relatively simple way to determine when LLMs appear to be confabulating that works with all popular models and across a broad range of subjects. And, in doing so, they develop evidence that most of the alternative facts LLMs provide are a product of confabulation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032628#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032628&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cases of illnesses linked to microdosing candies have more than doubled, with reports of seizures and the need for intubation, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care stays. But, there remains no recall of the products—microdosing chocolates, gummies, and candy cones by Diamond Shruumz—linked to the severe and life-threatening illnesses. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">In the latest update from the Food and Drug Administration</a> late Tuesday, the agency said that it "has been in contact with the firm about a possible voluntary recall, but these discussions are still ongoing."</p>
<p>In the update, the FDA reported 26 cases across 16 states, up from 12 cases in eight states last week. Of the 26 reported cases, 25 sought medical care and 16 were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00509.asp">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a health alert</a> about the candies. The agency noted that as of June 11, the people sickened after eating Diamond Shruumz candies presented to health care providers with a host of severe symptoms. Those include: central nervous system depression with sedation, seizures, muscle rigidity, clonus (abnormal reflex responses), tremor, abnormal heart rate (bradycardia or tachycardia), abnormal blood pressure (hypotension or hypertension), gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain), skin flushing, diaphoresis (excessive sweating), and metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap (an acid-based disorder linked to poisonings).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032595#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032595&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PC gamers of a certain vintage will remember tales of <a href="https://projectvanburen.com/">Project Van Buren</a>, a title that early '00s Interplay intended as the sequel to 1998's hit <em>Fallout 2</em>. Now, original <em>Fallout</em> producer Timothy Cain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag">is sharing some behind-the-scenes details</a> about how he contributed to the project's cancellation during a particularly difficult time for publisher Interplay.</p>
<p>Cain famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGfaCXEu0tE&amp;t=0s">left Interplay during <em>Fallout 2</em>'s development</a> in the late '90s to help form <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2005/02/games-20050219/">short-lived</a> RPG house <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/01q3/arcanum/arcanum.html">Troika Games</a>. After his departure, though, he was still in touch with some people from his former employer, including an unnamed Interplay vice president looking for some outside opinions on the troubled Van Buren project.</p>
<p>"Would you mind coming over and playing one of my game prototypes?" Cain recalls this vice president asking him sometime in mid-2003. "We're making a <em>Fallout</em> game and I'm going to have to cancel it. I don't think they can get it done... but if you could come over and look at it and give me an estimate, there's a chance I wouldn't cancel it."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032559#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032559&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the urgent quest for a more sustainable global food system, livestock are a mixed blessing. On the one hand, by converting fibrous plants that people can’t eat into protein-rich meat and milk, grazing animals like cows and sheep are an important source of human food. And for many of the world’s poorest, raising a cow or two—or a few sheep or goats—can be a key source of wealth.</p>
<p>But those benefits come with an immense environmental cost. A study in 2013 showed that globally, <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/reports/fcrn_gnc_report.pdf">livestock account for about 14.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions</a>, more than all the world’s cars and trucks combined. And about 40 percent of livestock’s global warming potential comes in the form of methane, a potent greenhouse gas formed as they <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/how-much-meat-can-we-eat-sustainably">digest their fibrous diet</a>.</p>
<p>That dilemma is driving an intense research effort to reduce methane emissions from grazers. Existing approaches, including improved animal husbandry practices and recently developed feed additives, can help, but not at the scale needed to make a significant global impact. So scientists are investigating other potential solutions, such as breeding low-methane livestock and tinkering with the microbes that produce the methane in grazing animals’ stomachs. While much more research is needed before those approaches come to fruition, they could be relatively easy to implement widely and could eventually have a considerable impact.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032527#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032527&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CDK Global <a href="https://www.cdkglobal.com/">touts itself</a> as an all-in-one software-as-a-service solution that is "trusted by nearly 15,000 dealer locations." One connection, over an always-on VPN to CDK's data centers, gives a dealership customer relationship management (CRM) software, financing, inventory, and more back-office tools.</p>
<p>That all-in-one nature explains why people trying to buy cars, and especially those trying to sell them, have had a rough couple of days. CDK's services have been down, due to what the firm describes as a "cyber incident." CDK <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cdk-global-cyberattack-impacts-thousands-of-us-car-dealerships/">shut down most of its systems Wednesday</a>, June 19, then told dealerships that afternoon that it restored some services. <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/cdk-global-hit-second-cyberattack-shuts-down-dms">CDK told dealers today</a>, June 20, that it had "experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on June 19," and shut down systems again.</p>

<p>A 911 vendor's malfunctioning firewall caused a statewide outage in the emergency calling system in Massachusetts on Tuesday afternoon, the state government said. A Massachusetts government <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/massachusetts-state-911-department-determined-firewall-caused-statewide-911-disruption">press release</a> issued yesterday said the state's 911 vendor, Comtech, "has advised State 911 that they have applied a technical solution to ensure that this does not happen again."</p>
<p>"A preliminary investigation conducted by the State 911 Department and Comtech determined that the outage was the result of a firewall, a safety feature that provides protection against cyberattacks and hacking," the announcement said. "The firewall prevented calls from getting to the 911 dispatch centers, also known as Public Safety Answer Points (PSAPs)."</p>
<p>Comtech's initial review "confirmed that the interruption was not the result of a cyberattack or hack," but "the exact reason the firewall stopped calls from reaching dispatch centers remains under review," the state said. A full review is continuing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032521#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032521&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever announced he is forming a new company called <a href="https://ssi.inc/">Safe Superintelligence, Inc.</a> (SSI) with the goal of safely building "superintelligence," which is a hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence, possibly in the extreme.</p>

<p>"<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">We will pursue safe superintelligence in a straight shot, with one focus, one goal, and one product," <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1803472979873128498">wrote</a> Sutskever on X. "We will do it through revolutionary breakthroughs produced by a small cracked team.</span>"</p>
<p>Sutskever was a founding member of OpenAI and formerly served as the company's chief scientist. Two others are joining Sutskever at SSI initially: <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~danilevy/">Daniel Levy</a>, who formerly headed the Optimization Team at OpenAI, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gross_(entrepreneur)">Daniel Gross</a>, an AI investor who worked on machine learning projects at Apple between 2013 and 2017.

<p>The humble hagfish is an ugly, gray, eel-like creature best known for its ability to unleash a cloud of sticky slime onto unsuspecting predators, clogging the gills and suffocating said predators. That's why it's affectionately known as a "<a href="https://www.altaonline.com/dispatches/a3271/snot-snakes/">snot snake</a>." Hagfish also love to burrow into the deep-sea sediment, but scientists have been unable to observe precisely how they do so because the murky sediment obscures the view. Researchers at Chapman University built a special tank with transparent gelatin to overcome this challenge and get a complete picture of the burrowing behavior, according to a <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-abstract/227/12/jeb247544/357803/Biphasic-burrowing-in-Atlantic-hagfish-Myxine?redirectedFrom=fulltext">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.</p>
<p>“For a long time we’ve known that hagfish can burrow into soft sediments, but we had no idea how they do it," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1048567">said co-author Douglas Fudge</a>, a marine biologist who <a href="https://sites.chapman.edu/fudge/hagfishes-and-slime/">heads a lab</a> at Chapman devoted to the study of hagfish. "By figuring out how to get hagfish to voluntarily burrow into transparent gelatin, we were able to get the first ever look at this process.”</p>
<p>As<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/unlocking-more-secrets-of-hagfish-slime/"> previously reported</a>, scientists have been <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ooey-gooey-hagfish-slime-is-an-amazingly-versatile-mate-1784713798">studying hagfish slime</a> for years because it's such an unusual material. It's not like mucus, which dries out and hardens over time. Hagfish slime stays slimy, giving it the consistency of half-solidified gelatin. That's due to long, thread-like fibers in the slime, in addition to the proteins and sugars that make up mucin, the other major component. Those fibers coil up into "skeins" that resemble balls of yarn. When the hagfish lets loose with a shot of slime, the skeins uncoil and combine with the salt water, blowing up more than 10,000 times its original size.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032252#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032252&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.</em></p>
<p>That simple sentence first appeared on a PDP-10 mainframe in the 1970s, and the words marked the beginning of what we now know as interactive fiction.</p>
<p>From the bare-bones text adventures of the 1980s to the heartfelt hypertext works of Twine creators, interactive fiction is an art form that continues to inspire a loyal audience. The community for interactive fiction, or IF, attracts readers and players alongside developers and creators. It champions an open source ethos and a punk-like individuality.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028156#p3">Read 63 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028156&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Clint and Rachel Wells had reasons to consider buying an electric vehicle when it came to replacing one of their cars. But they had even more reasons to stick with petrol.</p>
<p>The couple live in Normal, Illinois, which has enjoyed an economic boost from the electric vehicle assembly plant opened there by upstart electric-car maker Rivian. EVs are a step forward from “using dead dinosaurs” to power cars, Clint Wells says, and he wants to support that.</p>
<p>But the couple decided to “get what was affordable”—in their case, a petrol-engined Honda Accord costing $19,000 after trade-in.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032468#p3">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032468&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In April 1944, a pilot with the Tuskegee Airmen, Second Lieutenant Frank Moody, was on a routine training mission when his plane malfunctioned. Moody lost control of the aircraft and plunged to his death in the chilly waters of Lake Huron. His body was recovered two months later, but the airplane was left at the bottom of the lake—until now. Over the last few years, a team of divers working with the <a href="https://tuskegeemuseum.org">Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum</a> in Detroit has been diligently recovering the various parts of Moody's plane to determine what caused the pilot's fatal crash.</p>
<p>That painstaking process is the centerpiece of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32421358/"><em>The Real Red Tails</em></a>, a new documentary from National Geographic narrated by Sheryl Lee Ralph (<em>Abbot Elementary</em>). The documentary features interviews with the underwater archaeologists working to recover the plane, as well as firsthand accounts from Moody's fellow airmen and stunning underwater footage from the wreck itself.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen">Tuskegee Airmen</a> were the first Black military pilots in the US Armed Forces and helped pave the way for the desegregation of the military. The men painted the tails of their P-47 planes red, earning them the nickname the Red Tails. (They initially flew Bell P-39 Airacobras like Moody's downed plane, and later flew P-51 Mustangs.) It was then-First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt who helped tip popular opinion in favor of the fledgling unit when she flew with the Airmen's chief instructor, C. Alfred Anderson, in March 1941. The Airmen earned praise for their skill and bravery in combat during World War II, with members being awarded three Distinguished Unit Citations, 96 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 14 Bronze Stars, 60 Purple Hearts, and at least one Silver Star.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031234#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031234&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A key aspect of humans' evolutionary success is the fact that we don't have to learn how to do things from scratch. Our societies have developed various ways—from formal education to YouTube videos—to convey what others have learned. This makes learning how to do things far easier than learning by doing, and it gives us more space to experiment; we can learn to build new things or handle tasks more efficiently, then pass information on how to do so on to others.</p>
<p>Some of our closer relatives, like chimps and bonobos, learn from their fellow species-members. They don't seem to engage in this iterative process of improvement—they don't, in technical terms, have a cumulative culture where new technologies are built on past knowledge. So, when did humans develop this ability?</p>
<p>Based on a new analysis of stone toolmaking, two researchers are arguing that the ability is relatively recent, dating to just 600,000 years ago. That's roughly the same time our ancestors and the Neanderthals went their separate ways.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032454#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032454&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Meta got hit Tuesday with a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smith-v-Meta-Complaint-6-18-2024.pdf">lawsuit</a> alleging that the company knowingly overlooks sexist treatment of female employees. That includes an apparent practice of hiring and promoting less qualified men to roles over more qualified female applicants.</p>
<p>The complaint was filed in a US district court in New York by Jeffrey Smith, an engineer who joined Meta in 2018. Smith alleged that Meta was on the brink of promoting him when suddenly his "upward trajectory stopped" after he started speaking up about allegedly misogynistic management practices at Meta.</p>
<p>Smith claimed that instead of a promotion, his Meta manager, Sacha Arnaud, suggested that he resign shortly after delivering Smith's first-ever negative performance review, which reduced his bonus payout and impacted his company stock. Smith has alleged he suffered emotional distress and economic injury due to this alleged retaliation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032420#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032420&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
