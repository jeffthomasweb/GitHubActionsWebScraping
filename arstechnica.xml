                            <![CDATA[<p>While COVID-19 transmission remains low in the US, health experts are anxious about the potential for a big summer wave as two factors seem set for a collision course: a lull in infection activity that suggests protective responses have likely waned in the population, and a new SARS-CoV-2 variant with an infectious advantage over other variants.</p>
<p>The new variant is dubbed NB.1.8.1. Like all the other currently circulating variants, it's a descendant of omicron. Specifically, NB.1.8.1 is derived from the recombinant variant XDV.1.5.1. Compared to the reigning omicron variants JN.1 and LP.8.1, the new variant has a few mutations that could help it bind to human cells more easily and evade some protective immune responses.</p>
<p>On May 23, the World Health Organization <a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf">designated NB.1.8.1</a> a "variant under monitoring," <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-working-definitions-and-primary-actions-for--sars-cov-2-variants">meaning</a> that early signals indicate it has an advantage over other variants, but its impact on populations is not yet clear. In recent weeks, parts of Asia, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, have experienced increases in infections and hospitalizations linked to NB.1.8.1's spread. Fortunately, the variant does not appear to cause more severe disease, and current vaccines are expected to remain effective against it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/new-covid-variant-swiftly-gains-ground-in-us-concern-looms-for-summer-wave/">Read full article</a></p>

      Liam Neeson stars as Lt. Frank Drebin Jr. in <em>The Naked Gun</em>.

</div>
<p>Thirty years after the last film in <em>The Naked Gun</em> crime-spoof comedy franchise, we're finally getting a new installment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_Gun_(2025_film)"><em>The Naked Gun</em></a>, described as a "legacy sequel." And it's Liam Neeson stepping into Leslie Nielsen's fumbling shoes, playing that character's son. Judging by the official trailer, Neeson is up to the task, showcasing his screwball comedy chops.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the first three films in the franchise below.)</strong></p>
<p>The original <em>Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!</em> debuted in 1988, with Leslie Nielsen starring as Detective Frank Drebin, trying to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to the US. It proved successful enough to launch two sequels. <em>Naked Gun 2-1/2: The Smell of Fear</em> (1991) found Drebin battling an evil plan to kidnap a prominent nuclear scientist. <em>Naked Gun 33-1/3: The Final Insult</em> (1994) found Drebin coming out of retirement and going undercover to take down a crime syndicate planning to blow up the Academy Awards.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/liam-neeson-is-justices-new-daddy-in-naked-gun-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last Friday, a Michigan man named David Bartels was sentenced to five years in federal prison for "Possession of Child Pornography by a Person Employed by the Armed Forces Outside of the United States." The unusual nature of the charge stems from the fact that Bartels bought and viewed the illegal material while working as a military contractor for Maytag Fuels at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>Bartels had made some cursory efforts to cover his tracks, such as using the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">TOR browser</a>. (This may sound simple enough, but according to the US government, only 12.3 percent of people charged with similar offenses used "the Dark Web" at all.) Bartels knew enough about tech to use Discord, Telegram, VLC, and Megasync to further his searches. And he had at least eight external USB hard drives or SSDs, plus laptops, an Apple iPad Mini, and a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.</p>
<p>But for all his baseline technical knowledge, Bartels simultaneously showed little security awareness. He bought collections of child sex abuse material (CSAM) using PayPal, for instance. He received CSAM from other people who possessed his actual contact information. And he stored his contraband on a Western Digital 5TB hard drive under the astonishingly guilty-sounding folder hierarchy "/NSFW/Nope/Don't open/You were Warned/Deeper/."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/man-hid-child-abuse-in-nsfw-nope-dont-open-you-were-warned/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Subscribers in Southern California of Spectrum’s Internet service experienced outages over the weekend following what company officials said was an attempted theft of copper lines located in Van Nuys, a suburb located 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The people behind the incident thought they were targeting copper lines, the officials wrote in a statement Sunday. Instead, they cut into fiber optic cables. The cuts caused service disruptions for subscribers in Van Nuys and surrounding areas. Spectrum has since restored service and is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of the people responsible. Spectrum will also credit affected customers one day of service on their next bill.</p>
<h2>An industry-wide problem</h2>
<p>“Criminal acts of network vandalism have become an issue affecting the entire telecommunications industry, not just Spectrum, largely due to the increase in the price of precious metals,” the officials wrote in a statement issued Sunday. “These acts of vandalism are not only a crime, but also affect our customers, local businesses and potentially emergency services. Spectrum’s fiber lines do not include any copper.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/vandals-cut-fiber-optic-lines-causing-outage-for-spectrum-internet-subscribers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Recently, a Reddit user discovered a rare RCA Spectra 70/35 computer control panel from 1966 in their family's old collapsed garage, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/1lakfq2/rca_spectra_7035_premoonlanding_super_computer/">posting photos</a> of the pre-moon landing mainframe component to the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/">retrobattlestations</a>" subreddit that celebrates vintage computers. After cleaning the panel and fixing most keyswitches, the original poster noted that actually running it would require "1,500lbs of mainframe"—the rest of the computer system that's missing.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the panel had been sitting in the garage for decades without the poster's knowledge. "In short my house is a two-family, my dad used to rent out the other half before I was born," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/1lakfq2/comment/mxlgf8p/">explained</a> SonOfADeadMeme in the thread on Friday. "One of the people who rented out the apartment worked at IBM (apparently the RCA Spectra 70's were compatible with IBM sets from the time) and shortly before he left he shown up with a forklift and left something in the garage."</p>

<p>The equipment remained hidden for decades due to the deteriorating condition of the structure. "The garage was very dilapidated and has since collapsed so no one bothered going in. Fast forward a few decades and I found the RCA terminal and a crate labeled 'Return to IBM San Jose,'" SonOfADeadMeme wrote. They speculated the unidentified IBM component in the crate was "something power supply related" but noted they hadn't examined it closely due to their basement being "jam-packed with stuff."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/reddit-user-surprised-when-1960s-computer-panel-emerged-from-collapsed-family-garage/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Critics warn that the United States may soon be taking on more nuclear safety risks after Donald Trump fired one of five members of an independent commission that monitors the country's nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gbrumfiel.bsky.social/post/3lrq6hdkjl22a">statement</a> Monday, Christopher Hanson confirmed that Trump fired him from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on Friday. He alleged that the firing was "without cause" and "contrary to existing law and longstanding precedent regarding removal of independent agency appointees." According <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/16/nx-s1-5435285/trump-fires-nuclear-regulatory-commission-member-nrc">to NPR</a>, he received an email that simply said his firing was "effective immediately."</p>
<p>Hanson had enjoyed bipartisan support for his work for years. Trump initially appointed Hanson to the NRC in 2020, then he was renominated by Joe Biden in 2024. In his statement, he said it was an "honor" to serve, citing accomplishments over his long stint as chair, which ended in January 2025.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trump-fires-commissioner-of-preeminent-nuclear-safety-institution/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the first time since launching in 2009, WhatsApp will now show users advertisements. The ads are “rolling out gradually,” the company <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/337473702666585/">said</a>.</p>
<p>For now, the ads will only appear on WhatsApp's Updates tab, where users can update their status and access channels or groups targeting specific interests they may want to follow. In its announcement of the ads, parent company Meta claimed that placing ads under Updates means that the ads won’t “interrupt personal chats.”</p>
<p>Meta said that 1.5 billion people use the Updates tab daily. However, if you exclusively use WhatsApp for direct messages and personal group chats, you could avoid ever seeing ads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/ads-are-rolling-out-gradually-to-whatsapp/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>According to the press release, Trump Mobile's "flagship" wireless plan will be "The 47 Plan," which references Trump's current term as the United States' 47th president.</p>
<p>The Trump Organization says the plan offers an "unbeatable value"—costing $47.45 per month—and "transformational" cellular service. But the price seems to be on par with other major carriers' "best phone plans," according to a recent <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-phone-plans/">CNET roundup</a>, and the service simply plugs into the 5G network through "all three major carriers," the press release noted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trump-org-launches-47-month-wireless-service-teases-odd-499-phone/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on the Île Notre-Dame in Montreal has long been home to the Canadian Grand Prix. The artificial island was originally built for Expo 67 but was later remodeled for the 1976 Olympics; a race track was then constructed out of the roads on the island in 1978. F1 has come and gone in the US and Mexico in that time, but Canada has been a near-constant, missing just 2009.</p>
<p>Many of those races have been classics. 2007 saw Lewis Hamilton's first win, when he was a rookie with McLaren. (Takuma Sato's sixth place in the Super Aguri made that day even better.) 2010 had such extreme tire degradation that then-F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone had Pirelli build that into its tires from 2011 as a feature, one that at times had a highly deleterious effect on racing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's race in Montreal will not be remembered as one of the all-time great Canadian F1 races. Well, perhaps it will by the Mercedes team, which scored its first win of the year with George Russell, and rookie Kimi Antonelli finished third, claiming his first podium. Montreal lacks the long-duration corners that overheat the Mercedes' tires past their best. Instead, it rewards good traction and good braking, both attributes that the silver arrows' car possesses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/f1-in-canada-well-that-crash-was-bound-to-happen/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Kia provided flights from Washington, DC, to Seoul and accommodation so Ars could drive the EV4. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea—Drive enough electric vehicles from enough different manufacturers and something becomes clear: the Korean automakers know what they're doing. From small cars like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/the-2023-kia-niro-ev-is-incredibly-efficient-and-a-great-all-around-car/">Niro</a> all the way to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/2024-kia-ev9-first-drive-a-flawed-but-fine-family-flagship/">three-row SUVs</a>, the EVs coming out of Kia (and its sibling Hyundai) are as efficient as anything out there, usually with a distinctive style. It's fair to say they're at the front of the pack, at least as far as EVs offered to North America.</p>
<p>And soon, there will be a new one to consider. It's the Kia EV4, a small electric sedan that uses a new version of the E-GMP platform that has so impressed us in cars like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/kias-new-ev6-electric-crossover-goes-straight-to-the-head-of-the-pack/">EV6</a>. Originally designed for midsize and larger vehicles and operating at 800 V, the E-GMP powertrain is very capable but also relatively expensive to make. Now Kia has taken what it learned with the 800 V experience and applied it to the new 400 V version that's suitable for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/kias-ev-strategy-smaller-cheaper-cars-like-ev3-hatch-and-ev4-sedan/">smaller and cheaper EVs</a>.</p>
<h2>One motor, two packs</h2>
<p>Kia told Ars that while the development know-how carried over to the new lower-voltage components, the battery, motors, and power electronics are all new. The car arrives in the US in Q4 of this year and will feature a native NACS charging port. There's only one motor being offered for now, which generates 201 hp (150 kW) and 209 lb-ft (283 Nm) and drives the front wheels. But there are two choices of battery: the standard 58.3 kWh, which Kia reckons should achieve an EPA range of 235 miles (378 km); and an 81.4 kWh long-range pack, that should be sufficient for 330 miles (531 km) on North American roads. In time, expect a twin-motor, all-wheel drive option, as well as a more powerful EV4 GT.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/kia-hasnt-forgotten-the-small-electric-sedan-we-try-the-2026-ev4/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>When Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/">launched the Switch in 2017</a>, the sheer novelty of the new hardware brought the company a lot of renewed attention. After the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/the-wii-u-death-spiral-and-how-nintendo-can-reverse-it/">market disaster</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/11/wii-u-hardware-review-gamepads-tilt-sensitivity-rocks-two-screen-gaming/">the Wii U's homebound "second screen" tablet</a>, Nintendo exploited <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/nintendo-switch-nvidia-tegra-x1-specs-speed/">advances in system-on-a-chip miniaturization</a> to create something of a minimum viable HD-capable system that could work as both a lightweight handheld and a slightly underpowered TV-based console. That unique combination, and Nintendo's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/refreshing-new-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-is-an-instant-classic/">usual selection of first-party system sellers</a>, set the console apart from what the rest of the gaming market was offering at the time.</p>
<p>Eight years later, the Switch 2 launched into a transformed gaming hardware market that the original Switch played a large role in shaping, one full of portable gaming consoles that can optionally be connected to a TV. That includes full-featured handheld gaming PCs like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">the Steam Deck</a> and its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">many</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/">imitators</a>, but also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/are-android-based-game-streaming-handhelds-a-fad-or-are-they-the-future/">streaming-focused Android-based gaming handhelds</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/flurry-of-firmware-updates-makes-analogue-pocket-an-even-better-retro-handheld/">retro-focused emulation machines</a> on the cheaper end. Even Microsoft is preparing to get in on the act, streamlining the Windows gaming experience for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">an Asus-powered handheld gaming PC that hides the Windows desktop</a>.</p>

<p>Those market changes make the Switch 2 a lot less of a novelty than its predecessor. As its name implies, it is essentially a direct sequel to the original Switch hardware, with improvements to the physical hardware and internal architecture. Rather than shaking things up with a new concept, Nintendo seems to be saying, "Hey, you liked the Switch? Here's the same thing, but moreso."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-the-ars-technica-review/">Read full article</a></p>

      Narrator Ryan Reynolds celebrates nature's outcasts in the new NatGeo docuseries <em>Underdogs</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Most of us have seen a nature documentary or two (or three) at some point in our lives, so it's a familiar format: sweeping, majestic footage of impressively regal animals accompanied by reverently high-toned narration (preferably with a tony British accent). <em>Underdogs</em>, a new docuseries from National Geographic, takes a decidedly different approach. Narrated with hilarious irreverence by Ryan Reynolds, the five-part series highlights nature's less cool and majestic creatures: the outcasts and benchwarmers, more noteworthy for their "unconventional hygiene choices" and "unsavory courtship rituals." It's like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/review-james-gunns-the-suicide-squad-is-like-the-boys-on-steroids/"><em>The Suicide Squad</em></a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/review-thunderbolts-is-a-refreshing-return-to-peak-marvel-form/"><em>Thunderbolts*</em></a>, except these creatures actually exist.</p>
<p>Per the official premise, "<em>Underdogs</em> features a range of never-before-filmed scenes, including the first time a film crew has ever entered a special cave in New Zealand—a huge cavern that glows brighter than a bachelor pad under a black light thanks to the glowing butts of millions of mucus-coated grubs. All over the world, overlooked superstars like this are out there 24/7, giving it maximum effort and keeping the natural world in working order for all those showboating polar bears, sharks and gorillas." It's rated PG-13 due to the odd bit of scatalogical humor and shots of Nature Sexy Time.</p>
<p>Each of the five episodes is built around a specific genre. "Superheroes" highlights the surprising superpowers of the honey badger, pistol shrimp, and the invisible glass frog, among others, augmented with comic book graphics; "Sexy Beasts" focuses on bizarre mating habits and follows the format of a romantic advice column; "Terrible Parents" highlights nature's worst practices, following the outline of a parenting guide; "Total Grossout" is exactly what it sounds like; and "The Unusual Suspects" is a heist tale, documenting the supposed efforts of a macaque to put together the ultimate team of masters of deception and disguise (an inside man, a decoy, a fall guy, etc.). Green Day even wrote and recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6GHGvLFBKg">a special theme song</a> for the opening credits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/delightfully-irreverent-underdogs-isnt-your-parents-nature-docuseries/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Aviation Administration may soon levy fees on companies seeking launch and reentry licenses, a new tack in the push to give the agency the resources it needs to keep up with the rapidly growing commercial space industry.</p>
<p>The text of a budget <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/AD3D04CF-52B4-411F-854B-44C55ABBADDA">reconciliation bill</a> released by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last week calls for the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, known as AST, to begin charging licensing fees to space companies next year. The fees would phase in over eight years, after which the FAA would adjust them to keep pace with inflation. The money would go into a trust fund to help pay for the operating costs of the FAA's commercial space office.</p>
<p>The bill released by Cruz's office last week covers federal agencies under the oversight of the Senate Commerce Committee, which he chairs. These agencies include the FAA and NASA. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/senate-response-to-white-house-budget-for-nasa-keep-sls-nix-science/">Ars recently covered</a> Cruz's proposals for NASA to keep the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Gateway lunar space station alive, while the Trump administration aims to cancel Gateway and end the SLS and Orion programs after two crew missions to the Moon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/companies-may-soon-pay-a-fee-for-their-rockets-to-share-the-skies-with-airplanes/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The American Midwest is home to some of the richest, most productive farmland in the world, enabling its transformation into a vast corn- and soy-producing machine—a conversion spurred largely by decadeslong policies that support the production of biofuels.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.wri.org/research/rethinking-biofuels-us-midwest">new report</a> takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/biofuels-policy-has-been-a-failure-for-the-climate-new-report-claims/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Once they do meet other like-minded souls, communication takes place through chat apps like Telegram and Signal, often using encryption.</p>
<p>Money is pooled through various phone apps, then sent to videographers in countries where wages are low and monkeys are plentiful.

<p>Arid coastal regions that are also prone to fog are prime locations for fog-harvesting devices as a water source, especially during prolonged droughts. But the standard technology is prone to clogging. Scientists at Virginia Tech have created an improved version of their earlier "fog harp" alternative design to address that issue, according to a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/ta/d5ta02686e">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.</p>
<p>Fog harvesting (or dew catching) is an ancient practice dating as far back as the Incas, who placed buckets under trees to collect condensation. It's also practiced by certain insects, notably Namib desert beetles, which survive on the water that condenses onto their wings. The wings have alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions to enhance the condensation. Today's fog harvesters are usually mesh nets mounted onto frames with a trough or basin underneath. Like the beetle's wings, the mesh filaments are chemically coated to be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic.</p>
<p>The efficiency of these water harvesters depends on decreasing the size of the filaments and the mesh holes. "If the holes were too big, the microscopic droplets would pass through it, and it wouldn't harvest much water," co-author James Kaindu, a student in researcher Jonathan Boreyko's lab at Virginia Tech, told Ars. The trade-off is that smaller filaments and holes are more prone to clogging. "If it was too small, the droplets would coalesce and create a water film on it," said Kaindu. "It would impede the flow and act as a barrier that would dramatically affect its capture efficiency."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/these-va-tech-scientists-are-building-a-better-fog-harp/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NotebookLM is undoubtedly one of Google's best implementations of generative AI technology, giving you the ability to explore documents and notes with a Gemini AI model. Last year, Google added the ability to generate so-called "audio overviews" of your source material in NotebookLM. Now, Google has brought those <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/">fake AI podcasts</a> to search results as a test. Instead of clicking links or reading the AI Overview, you can have two nonexistent people <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/audio-overviews-search-labs/">tell you what the results say</a>.</p>
<p>This feature is not currently rolling out widely—it's available in search labs, which means you have to <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/30">manually enable it</a>. Anyone can opt in to the new Audio Overview search experience, though. If you join the test, you'll quickly see the embedded player in Google search results. However, it's not at the top with the usual block of AI-generated text. Instead, you'll see it after the first few search results, below the "People also ask" knowledge graph section.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly pitching a merger condition that would forbid advertising agencies from boycotting platforms based on political content, in a move that could benefit Elon Musk's X social network and President Trump's own Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>As the FTC reviews a proposed merger between Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group, two large ad agencies, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/business/ftc-omnicom-interpublic-merger.html">reported</a> yesterday that a "proposed consent decree would prevent the merged company from boycotting platforms because of their political content by refusing to place their clients' advertisements on them, according to two people briefed on the matter."</p>
<p>This is one of several moves the FTC has reportedly made to discourage ad boycotts that have riled conservatives. The FTC currently has only Republican commissioners because President Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-fires-both-ftc-democrats-in-challenge-to-supreme-court-precedent/">fired both Democrats</a>, who allege in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/ftc-democrats-sue-trump-say-firings-break-law-and-supreme-court-precedent/">lawsuit</a> that the firings were illegal. Trump also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/trump-declares-sweeping-power-over-independent-agencies-such-as-fcc-and-sec/">declared sweeping executive power</a> over the FTC and other agencies that were created to operate independently from the White House.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trumps-ftc-targets-advertising-boycotts-in-potential-boost-for-elon-musks-x/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There's another leak on the International Space Station, and NASA has already delayed one crew launch to the orbiting laboratory as a result.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the space agency is not offering much information about the unfolding situation in orbit. However, multiple sources have confirmed to Ars that the leak is a serious concern for the space agency as it deals with hardware that is approaching three decades in orbit.</p>
<p>To understand the current situation, it is important to review past leaks on the station, which has an aluminum structure. The station has had a slow <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/on-the-space-station-band-aid-fixes-for-systemic-problems/">but increasing leak since 2019</a>. The air leaks are located in the transfer tunnel of the space station's Russian Zvezda service module, one of the oldest elements of the complex, the first elements of which were launched in 1998. The transfer tunnel, known by the Russian acronym PrK, connects the Zvezda module with a docking port where Soyuz crew and Progress resupply spacecraft attach to the station.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/theres-another-leak-on-the-iss-but-nasa-is-not-saying-much-about-it/">Read full article</a></p>
