<p>Researchers around the world are growing more uneasy with the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in US dairy cows as the virus continues to make its way into new herds and states. Several experts say the US is not sharing enough information from the federal investigation into the unexpected and growing outbreak, including genetic information from isolated viruses.</p>
<p>To date, the US Department of Agriculture has tallied <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock">32 affected herds in eight states</a>: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas. In some cases, the movement of cattle between herds can explain the spread of the virus. But the USDA has not publicly clarified if all the herds are linked in a single outbreak chain or if there is evidence that the virus has spilled over to cows multiple times. Early infections in Texas were linked to dead wild birds (pigeons, blackbirds, and grackles) found on dairy farms. But the USDA reportedly indicated to Stat News that the infections <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/18/h5n1-bird-flu-scientists-want-usda-genetic-data-faster/">do not appear to be all linked to the Texas cases</a>.</p>
<p>Spread of the virus via cattle movements indicates that there is cow-to-cow transmission occurring, the USDA said. But it's unclear how the virus is spreading between cows. Given that even the most symptomatic cows show few respiratory symptoms, the USDA speculates that the most likely way it is spreading is via contaminated milking equipment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019245#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019245&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>What was previously simply called Quest software will be called Horizon OS, and the goal will be to move beyond the general-use Quest devices to more purpose-specific devices, according to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6EalqUrLa3/">an Instagram video</a> from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>There will be headsets focused purely on watching TV and movies on virtual screens, with the emphasis on high-end OLED displays. There will also be headsets that are designed to be as light as possible at the expense of performance for productivity and exercise uses. And there will be gaming-oriented ones.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019154#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019154&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kremlin-backed hackers have been exploiting a critical Microsoft vulnerability for four years in attacks that targeted a vast array of organizations with a previously undocumented tool, the software maker disclosed Monday.</p>
<p>When Microsoft patched the vulnerability in October 2022—at least two years after it came under attack by the Russian hackers—the company made no mention that it was under active exploitation. As of publication, the company’s <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-38028">advisory</a> still made no mention of the in-the-wild targeting. Windows users frequently prioritize the installation of patches based on whether a vulnerability is likely to be exploited in real-world attacks.</p>
<p>Exploiting CVE-2022-38028, as the vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to gain system privileges, the highest available in Windows, when combined with a separate exploit. Exploiting the flaw, which carries a 7.8 severity rating out of a possible 10, requires low existing privileges and little complexity. It resides in the Windows print spooler, a printer-management component that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/microsofts-emergency-patch-fails-to-fix-critical-printnightmare-vulnerability/">harbored previous critical zero-days</a>. Microsoft said at the time that it learned of the vulnerability from the US National Security Agency.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019186#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019186&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>About 350 million years ago, our planet witnessed the evolution of the first flying creatures. They are still around, and some of them continue to annoy us with their buzzing. While scientists have classified these creatures as pterygotes, the rest of the world simply calls them winged insects.</p>
<p>There are many aspects of insect biology, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/10/scientists-combine-evolution-physics-and-robotics-to-decode-insect-flight/">especially their flight</a>, that remain a mystery for scientists. One is simply how they move their wings. The insect wing hinge is a specialized joint that connects an insect’s wings with its body. It’s composed of five interconnected plate-like structures called sclerites. When these plates are shifted by the underlying muscles, it makes the insect wings flap.</p>
<p>Until now, it has been tricky for scientists to understand the biomechanics that govern the motion of the sclerites even using advanced imaging technologies. “The sclerites within the wing hinge are so small and move so rapidly that their mechanical operation during flight has not been accurately captured despite efforts using stroboscopic photography, high-speed videography, and X-ray tomography,” Michael Dickinson, Zarem professor of biology and bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), told Ars Technica.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019187#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019187&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA has formally approved the robotic Dragonfly mission for full development, committing to a revolutionary project to explore Saturn's largest moon with a quadcopter drone.</p>
<p>Agency officials announced the outcome of Dragonfly's confirmation review last week. This review is a checkpoint in the lifetime of most NASA projects and marks the moment when the agency formally commits to the final design, construction, and launch of a space mission. The outcome of each mission's confirmation review typically establishes a budgetary and schedule commitment.</p>
<p>“Dragonfly is a spectacular science mission with broad community interest, and we are excited to take the next steps on this mission," said Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA's science mission directorate. "Exploring Titan will push the boundaries of what we can do with rotorcraft outside of Earth.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018959#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018959&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Congress passed and President Biden signed a reauthorization of Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), approving a bill that opponents say includes a "major expansion of warrantless surveillance" under Section 702 of FISA.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7888">Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act</a> was approved by the Senate in a 60-34 <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00150.htm">vote</a>. The yes votes included 30 Republicans, 28 Democrats, and two independents who caucus with Democrats. The bill, which was previously passed by the House and reauthorizes Section 702 of FISA for two years, was <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/04/20/bill-signed-h-r-7888/">signed</a> by President Biden on Saturday.</p>
<p>"Thousands and thousands of Americans could be forced into spying for the government by this new bill and with no warrant or direct court oversight whatsoever," Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-and-lummis-introduce-amendment-to-roll-back-unprecedented-expansion-of-warrantless-fisa-surveillance">said on Friday</a>.

<p>The usual timeline would put the Google Pixel 9 at something like five months away from launching, but that doesn't mean it's too early to leak! Real-life pictures of the "Pixel 9 Pro" model have landed over at <a href="https://rozetked.me/news/33143-eksklyuziv-zhivye-foto-google-pixel-9-pro-ot-rozetked">Rozetked</a>.</p>
<p>This prototype looks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/googles-pixel-9-gets-its-first-leaked-render-looks-a-lot-like-an-iphone/">just like</a> the renders from OnLeaks that first came out back in January. The biggest change is a new pill-shaped camera bump instead of the edge-to-edge design of old models. It looks rather stylish in real-life photos, with the rounded corners of the pill and camera glass matching the body shape. The matte back looks like it still uses the excellent "soft-touch glass" material from last year. The front and back of the phone are totally flat, with a metal band around the side. The top edge still has a signal window cut out of it, which is usually for mmWave. The Pixel 8 Pro's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2024/01/pixel-8-pro-finally-gets-forehead-scanning-body-temperature-feature/">near-useless</a> temperature sensor appears to still be on the back of this prototype. At least, the spot for the temperature sensor—the silver disk right below the LED camera flash—looks identical to the Pixel 8 Pro. As a prototype any of this could change before the final release, but this is what it looks like right now.</p>
<p>The phone was helpfully photographed next to an iPhone 14 Pro Max, and you might notice that the Pixel 9 Pro looks a little small! That's because this <em>is</em> one of the small models, with only a 6.1-inch display. Previously for Pixels, "Pro" meant "the big model," but this year Google is supposedly shipping three models, adding in a top-tier small phone. There's the usual big Pixel 9, with a 6.7-inch display, which will reportedly be called the "Pixel 9 Pro XL." The new model is the "Pixel 9 Pro"—no XL—which is a small model but still with all the "Pro" trimmings, like three rear cameras. There's also the Pixel 9 base model, which is the usual smaller phone (6.03-inch) with cut-down specs like only two rear cameras.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019066#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019066&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, until recently, has been a wide-ranging and hard-to-define project.</p>
<p>The open smart home platform is an open source OS you can run anywhere that aims to connect all your devices together. But it's also bespoke Raspberry Pi hardware, in <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow/">Yellow</a> and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/green/">Green</a>. It's entirely free, but it also receives funding through a private cloud services company, <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Nabu Casa</a>. It <a href="https://esphome.io/">contains tiny board project ESPHome</a> and other inter-connected bits. It has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/can-you-manage-your-house-with-a-local-no-cloud-voice-assistant-mostly-yes/">wide-ranging voice assistant ambitions</a>, but it doesn't want to be Alexa or Google Assistant. Home Assistant is a lot.</p>
<p>After an announcement this weekend, however, Home Assistant's shape is a bit easier to draw out. All of the project's ambitions now fall under the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization that now contains Home Assistant and more than 240 related bits. Its mission statement is refreshing, and refreshingly honest about the state of modern open source projects.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019041#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019041&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman thinks that Apple's M4 chips for Macs are coming sooner rather than later—possibly as early as "late this year," per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/apple-aapl-readies-m4-chip-mac-line-including-new-macbook-air-and-mac-pro">a report from earlier this month</a>. Now Gurman says Apple could completely skip the M3 generation for some Macs, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-likely-planning-to-skip-m3-mac-mini/">most notably the Mac mini</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, Gurman doesn't have specific insider information confirming that Apple is planning to skip the M3 mini. But based on Apple's alleged late-2024-into-early-2025 timeline for the M4 mini, he believes that it's "probably safe to say" that there's not enough space on the calendar for an M3 mini to be released between now and then.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be the first time an Apple Silicon Mac had skipped a chip generation—the 24-inch iMac was never updated with the M2, instead jumping directly from the M1 to the M3. The Mac Pro also skipped the M1 series, leapfrogging from Intel chips to the M2.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019034#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019034&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last week, chip manufacturer Zilog <a href="https://www.mouser.com/PCN/Littelfuse_PCN_Z84C00.pdf">announced</a> that after 48 years on the market, its line of standalone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package">DIP</a> (dual inline package) Z80 CPUs is coming to an end, ceasing sales on June 14, 2024. The 8-bit Z80 architecture debuted in 1976 and powered a small-business-PC revolution in conjunction with <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/718124/what-was-cpm-and-why-did-it-lose-to-ms-dos/">CP/M</a>, also serving as the heart of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/game-boy-20th-anniversary/">Nintendo Game Boy</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/egad-7-key-british-pcs-of-the-1980s-americans-might-have-missed/">Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a>, the Radio Shack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80</a>, the <em>Pac-Man</em> arcade game, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series">TI-83</a> graphing calculator in various forms.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.mouser.com/PCN/Littelfuse_PCN_Z84C00.pdf">letter</a> to customers dated April 15, 2024, Zilog wrote, "Please be advised that our Wafer Foundry Manufacturer will be discontinuing support for the Z80 product and other product lines. Refer to the attached list of the Z84C00 Z80 products affected."</p>
<p>Designers typically use the Z84C00 chips because of familiarity with the Z80 architecture or to allow legacy system upgrades without needing significant system redesigns. And while many other embedded chip architectures have superseded these Z80 chips in speed, processing power, and capability, they remained go-to solutions for decades in products that didn't need any extra horsepower.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018763#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018763&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last week's release of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/a-touchscreen-of-nostalgia-delta-brings-classic-nintendo-consoles-to-ios/">the Delta emulation suite</a> finally gave iOS users easy, no-sideloading-required access to classic Nintendo game emulation up through the Nintendo 64 era. When it comes to emulating Nintendo's subsequent home consoles on iOS, though, some technical restrictions imposed by Apple are making it difficult to get a functional emulator on the App Store.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://oatmealdome.me/blog/why-dolphin-isnt-coming-to-the-app-store/">a recent blog post</a>, DolphiniOS developer (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/hackers-discover-buried-vrmode-support-in-switch-firmware/">longtime</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/datamining-suggests-emulated-super-nes-games-could-be-coming-to-switch/">Switch</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/leaked-game-boy-emulators-for-switch-were-made-by-nintendo-experts-suggest/2/">hacker</a>) OatmealDome explains how a Dolphin <a href="https://github.com/OatmealDome/dolphin-ios">code fork</a>—which ports the popular GameCube and Wii emulator to Apple's smartphone OS—uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to translate the PowerPC instructions from those retro consoles into ARM-compatible iOS code. But Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/">App Store regulations</a> against apps that "install executable code" (Section 3.3.1B) generally <a href="https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/1072">prevent JIT recompilation on iOS</a>, with very limited exceptions such as web browsers. That restriction <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/429081/can-just-in-time-compilation-be-considered-a-secure-feature">may have some valid security reasoning behind it</a>, but it can also get in the way for developers of tools like third-party browser engines (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines/">except recently in the EU</a>).</p>
<p>While MacOS developers can make use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_allow-jit">an explicit entitlement to allow JIT recompilation</a> in an app, that exception doesn't apply to iOS developers. And while alternative App Stores and sideloaded apps (including DolphiniOS) have <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/06/ios-14-2-brings-jit-compilation-support-which-enables-emulation-apps-at-full-performance/">discovered</a> various <a href="https://dolphinios.oatmealdome.me/beta">ways</a> to enable JIT compilation on both jailbroken and stock iOS devices, these workarounds can get quite arcane and <a href="https://twitter.com/altstoreio/status/1354096048650809349">occasionally break with new iOS releases</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019070#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019070&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Tesla has dropped the price of its controversial "Full Self Driving" partially automated driver assist. Last week, getting access to FSD would cost you $12,000—today, it's a third cheaper at $8,000. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to the feature for $99 a month.</p>
<p>Tesla has bet heavily on FSD for the future of the company. It's one of two partially automated driving systems offered by Tesla—Autopilot is the older and less-capable system. FSD includes features such as auto lane changes, auto parking, the ability to summon the car from its parking space, and lane keeping (Autosteer in Tesla-speak) on surface streets.</p>
<p>Tesla claims that "[y]our car will be able to drive itself almost anywhere with minimal driver intervention and will continuously improve," but then also notes that "[t]he currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019030#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019030&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We were already looking forward to the summer release of <em>Deadpool and Wolverine,</em> which will bring together Ryan Reynolds' R-rated antihero with Hugh Jackman's iconic X-Man. We're even more eager to see the film after Marvel dropped the official trailer, which is chock-full of off-color witticisms, meta-references, slo-mo action, and a generous sprinkling of F-bombs. (But no cocaine! Wade promised Feige! "They know all the slang terms. They have a list.")</p>
<p>"You’re talking about two massive movie stars in their most iconic roles,” Director Shawn Levy (<em>Free Guy</em>) told<a href="https://screenrant.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-not-deadpool-3-shawn-levy-explained/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> Screen Rant</a> earlier this month. “It also gave me an opportunity. It’s the third <em>Deadpool</em> movie, but it’s not <em>Deadpool 3</em>. It’s a different thing that’s very much <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em>. And it’s not trying to copycat anything from the first two movies. They were awesome, but this is a two-hander character adventure.”</p>

<p>TikTok is gearing up for a long legal battle to fight legislation in the US that threatens to ban the app in its largest market if its Chinese owner, ByteDance, refuses to sell the viral video platform.</p>
<p>The US House of Representatives on Saturday passed a package of national security bills that included legislation that would result in TikTok being banned in the country if Chinese parent company ByteDance does not divest the app.</p>
<p>Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s public policy head in the US, told staff in response that if the bill became law, the company would “move to the courts for a legal challenge.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019003#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019003&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>What comes after OLED?</p>
<p>With OLED-equipped TVs, monitors, and other gadgets slowly becoming more readily available at lower prices, attention is turning to what the next landmark consumer display tech will be.</p>
<p>Micro LED often features in such discussions, but the tech is not expected to start hitting consumer devices <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/MicroLED-smartphones-will-not-arrive-until-the-2030s-notebooks-and-monitors-a-little-earlier.785333.0.html">until the 2030s</a>. Display makers are also playing with other futuristic ideas, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/who-would-want-this-the-4-most-outlandish-displays-at-ces-2024/">transparent</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/portable-monitors-could-make-foldable-screen-gadgets-finally-make-sense/">foldable</a> screens. But when it comes to technology that could seriously address top user concerns—like image quality<strong>, </strong>price<strong>,</strong> and longevity—quantum dots seem the most pertinent at the moment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000924#p3">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000924&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In June 1924, a British mountaineer named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory">George Leigh Mallory</a> and a young engineering student named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Irvine_(mountaineer)">Andrew "Sandy" Irvine</a> set off for the summit of Mount Everest and disappeared—just two casualties of a peak that has claimed over 300 lives to date. Mallory was an alumnus of Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge, which maintains a collection of his personal correspondence, much of it between Mallory and his wife, Ruth. The college has now digitized the entire collection for public access. The letters can be accessed and downloaded <a href="https://magdalene.maxarchiveservices.co.uk/index.php/mallory-george-herbert-leigh">here</a>.</p>
<p>“It has been a real pleasure to work with these letters," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1041766?">said Magdalene College archivist Katy Green</a>. "Whether it’s George’s wife Ruth writing about how she was posting him plum cakes and a grapefruit to the trenches (he said the grapefruit wasn’t ripe enough), or whether it’s his poignant last letter where he says the chances of scaling Everest are '50 to 1 against us,' they offer a fascinating insight into the life of this famous Magdalene alumnus.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/natgeo-expedition-hunts-for-1924-climbers-body-in-lost-on-everest-documentary/">previously reported</a>, Mallory is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1923/03/18/archives/climbing-mount-everest-is-work-for-supermen-a-member-of-former.html">the man credited</a> with uttering the famous line "because it's there" in response to a question about why he would risk his life repeatedly to summit Everest. An avid mountaineer, Mallory had already been to the mountain twice before the 1924 expedition: once in 1921 as part of a reconnaissance expedition to produce the first accurate maps of the region and again in 1922—his first serious attempt to summit, although he was forced to turn back on all three attempts. A sudden avalanche killed seven Sherpas on his third try, sparking accusations of poor judgement on Mallory's part.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018634#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018634&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>With Earth Day fast approaching once again, it's time for another new documentary from National Geographic and Disney+: <em>Secrets of the Octopus</em>. It's the third in what has become a series, starting with the remarkable 2021 documentary <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/secrets-of-the-whales-explores-language-social-structure-of-giants-of-the-deep/"><em>Secrets of the Whales</em></a> (narrated by Sigourney Weaver) and 2023's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/elephants-must-adapt-to-a-rapidly-changing-world-in-secrets-of-the-elephants/"><em>Secrets of the Elephants</em></a> (Natalie Portman as narrator). James Cameron served as producer on all three.</p>
<p><em>Secrets of the Octopus</em> is narrated by Paul Rudd. Per the official synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Octopuses are like aliens on Earth: three hearts, blue blood and the ability to squeeze through a space the size of their eyeballs. But there is so much more to these weird and wonderful animals. Intelligent enough to use tools or transform their bodies to mimic other animals and even communicate with different species, the secrets of the octopus are more extraordinary than we ever imagined.</p></blockquote>
<p>Each of the three episodes focuses on a specific unique feature of these fascinating creatures: "Shapeshifters," "Masterminds," and "Social Networks." The animals were filmed in their natural habitats over 200 days, and all that stunning footage is accompanied by thoughtful commentary by featured scientists. One of those scientists is <a href="https://www.alex-schnell.com">Dr. Alex Schnell</a>, a native Australian and self-described storyteller who has worked at Macquarie University, the University of Cambridge, and the Marine Biological Laboratory, among other institutions. Her research focuses on the intelligence of marine animals, particularly cuttlefish and octopuses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017625#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017625&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Fungi are an indispensable part of your <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/microbiome/">microbiome</a>, keeping the body’s host of microorganisms healthy as part of a system of checks and balances. But when you’re hit by an <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/infectious-disease/">infection</a>, fungi can be thrown out of equilibrium with other organisms inside you, leading to a more severe infection and other symptoms of illness.</p>
<p>For this reason, the pandemic immediately set off alarms for Iliyan Iliev, an immunologist at Weill Cornell Medical School. “We were thinking, the first thing that’s going to happen is people will start getting fungal co-infections,” he says. With the microbiome unbalanced, fungi might start running riot inside <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/covid-19/">COVID </a>patients, Iliev reasoned. His fears were soon realized.</p>
<p>In research published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01637-4"><i>Nature Immunology</i></a>, he and his team discovered that in patients with severe COVID, certain strains of gut fungi—knocked off-kilter by the virus—set off a prolonged immune response that could last long after the initial infection. This response potentially led to some of the respiratory symptoms experienced by these patients. These results, Iliev says, point to the critical role of the gut microbiome in the human immune response and could lead to better disease treatments down the line.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018856#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018856&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been just over a week since the Fallout TV series premiered on Amazon Prime, and one thing's for sure: It's a huge hit. You can hardly open a social media app without seeing content about it, the reviews are positive, and the active players for the Fallout games have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">doubled over the past week</a>.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I shared some spoiler-free impressions of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/three-episodes-in-the-fallout-tv-series-absolutely-nails-it/">the first three episodes</a>. I loved what I'd seen up to that point—the show seemed faithful to the games, but it was also a great TV show. A specific cocktail of tongue-in-cheek humor, sci-fi campiness, strong themes, great characters, and visceral violence really came together into a fantastic show.</p>
<p>Still, I had some questions at that point: Would the franchise's penchant for satire and its distinct political and social viewpoint come through? Where was all this headed?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018371#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018371&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Across the country, teams of students at 15 different universities are in the middle of a four-year project, dissecting an electric vehicle and figuring out ways to make it even better. The program, called the EcoCar EV Challenge, was founded more than three decades ago by the US Department of Energy and is run by the DOE's Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Over the last 35 years, more than 30,000 students from 95 universities have participated in the EcoCar Challenge, part of the DOE's Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition. Each segment spans four years, with the most recent cycle beginning in 2023 with a new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/">Cadillac Lyriq</a> donated by the General Motors automaker.</p>
<p>The students take this competition very seriously, as participation alone brings a lot of benefits, including the potential for a lifelong career path.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013389#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013389&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
