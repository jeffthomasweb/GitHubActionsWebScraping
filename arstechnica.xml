<p>John Romero remembers the moment he realized what the future of gaming would look like.</p>
<p>In late 1991, Romero and his colleagues at id Software had just released <em>Catacomb 3-D</em>, a crude-looking, <a href="https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/EGA_Palette">EGA-colored</a> first-person shooter that was nonetheless revolutionary compared to other first-person games of the time. "When we started making our 3D games, the only 3D games out there were nothing like ours," Romero told Ars in a recent interview. "They were lockstep, going through a maze, do a 90-degree turn, that kind of thing."</p>
<p>Despite <em>Catacomb 3-D</em>'s technological advances in first-person perspective, though, Romero remembers the team at id followed its release by going to work on the next entry in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/bethesda-revives-80s-pc-series-commander-keen-as-a-free-to-play-mobile-game/">the long-running <em>Commander Keen</em> series</a> of 2D platform games. But as that process moved forward, Romero told Ars that something didn't feel right.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032808#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032808&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an update released late Friday evening, NASA said it was "adjusting" the date of the Starliner spacecraft's return to Earth from June 26 to an unspecified time in July.</p>
<p>The announcement followed two days of long meetings to review the readiness of the spacecraft, developed by Boeing, to fly NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to Earth. According to sources, these meetings included high-level participation from senior leaders at the agency, including Associate Administrator Jim Free.</p>
<p>This "Crew Flight Test," which launched on June 5 atop an Atlas V rocket, was originally due to undock and return to Earth on June 14. However, as engineers from NASA and Boeing studied data from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-drama-filled-day-boeings-starliner-finally-finds-its-way/">vehicle's problematic flight</a> to the International Space Station, they have waved off several return opportunities.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032970#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032970&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a result <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/publishers-beat-internet-archive-as-judge-rules-e-book-lending-violates-copyright/">of book publishers successfully suing the Internet Archive</a> (IA) last year, the free online library that strives to keep growing online access to books recently shrank by about 500,000 titles.</p>
<p>IA <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/06/17/let-readers-read/">reported</a> in a blog post this month that publishers abruptly forcing these takedowns triggered a "devastating loss" for readers who depend on IA to access books that are otherwise impossible or difficult to access.</p>
<p>To restore access, IA is now appealing, hoping to reverse the prior court's decision by convincing the US Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit that IA's <a href="https://archive.org/details/controlled-digital-lending-explained">controlled digital lending</a> of its physical books should be considered fair use under copyright law. An April <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.60988/gov.uscourts.ca2.60988.259.0.pdf">court filing</a> shows that IA intends to argue that the publishers have no evidence that the e-book market has been harmed by the open library's lending, and copyright law is better served by allowing IA's lending than by preventing it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032890#p3">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032890&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday announced <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-expands-approval-gene-therapy-patients-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy">expanded approval for a gene therapy to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a> (DMD)—despite the fact that it failed a Phase III clinical trial last year and that the approval came over the objections of three of FDA's own expert review teams and two of its directors.</p>
<p>In fact, the decision to expand the approval of the therapy—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delandistrogene_moxeparvovec">called Elevidys</a> (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl)—appears to have been decided almost entirely by Peter Marks, Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p>
<p>Elevidys initially gained an FDA approval last year, also over objections from staff. The therapy intravenously delivers a transgene that codes for select portions of a protein called dystrophin in healthy muscle cells; the protein is mutated in patients with DMD. Last year's initial approval occurred under an accelerated approval process and was only for use in DMD patients ages 4 and 5 who are able to walk. In the actions Thursday, the FDA granted a traditional approval for the therapy and opened access to DMD patients of all ages, regardless of ambulatory status.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032919#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032919&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Of the many oddities you can buy from Aliexpress, some of the weirdest are the recreations of retro computer systems in semi-modern designs. We're most intimately familiar with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/going-deep-with-the-book-8088-the-brand-new-laptop-that-runs-like-its-1981/">the Book 8088</a>, a recreation of the original 1981 IBM PC inside a chunky clamshell laptop. The people behind the Book 8088 are also responsible for the Hand386, which is a bit like a late-80s PC stuck inside an old Palm Pilot or Blackberry, and a second revision of the Book 8088 with more built-in ports and a VGA-capable graphics adapter installed instead of a basic CGA adapter.</p>

<p>Whoever is selling these systems is now <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805356267711.html">back with the Pocket 386</a>, which combines Hand386-style internals with a clamshell design similar to the Book 8088. The result is the kind of IBM-compatible system that would have been common during the Windows 3.1 era, when MS-DOS still dominated (especially for games) but Windows was on the upswing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032811#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032811&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Biden administration will ban all sales of Kaspersky antivirus software in the US starting in July, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-ban-us-sales-kaspersky-software-over-ties-russia-source-says-2024-06-20/">reporting from Reuters</a> and a filing from the US Department of Commerce (<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-13695.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>The US believes that security software made by Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab represents a national security risk and that the Russian government could use Kaspersky's software to install malware, block other security updates, and "collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans," said US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.</p>
<p>“When you think about national security, you may think about guns and tanks and missiles,” said Raimondo during a press briefing, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-bans-kaspersky-software/">as reported by Wired</a>. “But the truth is, increasingly, it's about technology, and it's about dual-use technology, and it's about data.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032766#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032766&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this week, the US Senate passed what's being called <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1111/text">the ADVANCE Act</a>, for Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy. Among a number of other changes, the bill would attempt to streamline permitting for newer reactor technology and offer cash incentives for the first companies that build new plants that rely on one of a handful of different technologies. It enjoyed broad bipartisan support both in the House and Senate and now heads to President Biden for his signature.</p>
<p>Given Biden's penchant for promoting his bipartisan credentials, it's likely to be signed into law. But the biggest hurdles nuclear power faces are all economic, rather than regulatory, and the bill provides very little in the way of direct funding that could help overcome those barriers.</p>
<h2>Incentives</h2>

<p>Often times, when I am researching something about computers or coding that has been around a very long while, I will come across a document on a university website that tells me more about that thing than any Wikipedia page or archive ever could.</p>
<p>It's usually a PDF, though sometimes a plaintext file, on a .edu subdirectory that starts with a username preceded by a tilde (~) character. This is typically a document that a professor, faced with the same questions semester after semester, has put together to save the most time possible and get back to their work. I recently found such a document inside Princeton University's astrophysics department: "<a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~strauss/AST303/Xintro.pdf">An Introduction to the X Window System</a>," written by <a href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/robert-lupton">Robert Lupton</a>.</p>
<p>X Window System, which <a href="https://www.talisman.org/x-debut.shtml">turned 40 years old earlier this week</a>, was something you had to know how to use to work with space-facing instruments back in the early 1980s, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100s</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX-11">VAX-11/750s</a>, and Sun Microsystems boxes would share space at college computer labs. As the member of the AstroPhysical Sciences Department at Princeton who knew the most about computers back then, it fell to Lupton to fix things and take questions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032813#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032813&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Three major features in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will not be available to European users this fall, Apple says. They include iPhone screen mirroring on the Mac, SharePlay screen sharing, and the entire Apple Intelligence suite of generative AI features.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/360751cb-7a22-48e0-9b00-6a30ff41dcfe">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183251/apple-eu-delay-ai-screen-mirroring-shareplay-dma">The Verge</a>, and others, Apple says this decision is related to the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA). Here's the full statement, which was attributed to Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two weeks ago, Apple unveiled hundreds of new features that we are excited to bring to our users around the world. We are highly motivated to make these technologies accessible to all users. However, due to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these features — iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence — to our EU users this year.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security. We are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is unclear from Apple's statement precisely which aspects of the DMA may have led to this decision. It could be that Apple is concerned that it would be required to give competitors like Microsoft or Google access to user data collected for Apple Intelligence features and beyond, but we're not sure.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032820#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032820&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft is all-in on its Copilot+ PC push right now, but the fact is that they'll be an extremely small minority among the PC install base for the foreseeable future. The program's stringent hardware requirements—16GB of RAM, at least 256GB of storage, and a fast neural processing unit (NPU)—disqualify all but new PCs, keeping features like Recall from running on all current Windows 11 PCs.</p>

<p>But the Copilot chatbot remains supported on all Windows 11 PCs (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/microsoft-is-revisiting-windows-10-by-backporting-the-copilot-ai-assistant/">most Windows 10 PCs</a>), and a change Microsoft has made to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/06/14/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-3785-beta-channel/">recent Windows 11 Insider Preview builds</a> is actually making the feature less useful and accessible than it is in the current publicly available versions of Windows. Copilot is being changed from a persistent sidebar into an app window that can be resized, minimized, and pinned and unpinned from the taskbar, just like any other app. But at least as of this writing, this version of Copilot can no longer adjust Windows' settings, and it's no longer possible to call it up with the Windows+C keyboard shortcut. Only newer keyboards with the dedicated Copilot key will have an easy built-in keyboard shortcut for summoning Copilot.</p>
<p>If Microsoft keeps these changes intact, they'll hit Windows 11 PCs when the 24H2 update is released to the general public later this year; the changes are already present on Copilot+ PCs, which are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/">running a version of Window 11 24H2 out of the box</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032806#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032806&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For centuries, Western scholars have touted the fate of the native population on Easter Island (Rapa Nui) as a case study in the devastating cost of environmentally unsustainable living. The story goes that the people on the remote island chopped down all the trees to build massive stone statues, triggering a population collapse. Their numbers were further depleted when Europeans discovered the island and brought foreign diseases, among other factors. But an alternative narrative began to emerge in the 21st century that the earliest inhabitants actually lived quite sustainably until that point. A <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado1459">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances offers another key piece of evidence in support of that alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/new-study-challenges-popular-collapse-hypothesis-for-easter-island/">previously reported</a>, Easter Island is famous for its giant monumental statues, called <em>moai</em>, built some 800 years ago and typically mounted on platforms called <em>ahu</em>. Scholars have puzzled over the <em>moai</em> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island">Easter Island</a> for decades, pondering their cultural significance, as well as how a Stone Age culture managed to carve <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/06/120622-easter-island-statues-moved-hunt-lipo-science-rocked/">and transport statues </a>weighing as much as 92 tons. The first Europeans arrived in the 17th century and found only a few thousand inhabitants on a tiny island (just 14 by 7 miles across) thousands of miles away from any other land. Since then, in order to explain the presence of so many <em>moai</em>, the assumption has been that the island was once home to tens of thousands of people<em>.</em></p>
<p>But perhaps they didn't need tens of thousands of people to accomplish that feat. Back in 2012, Carl Lipo of Binghamton University and Terry Hunt of the University of Arizona <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/06/120622-easter-island-statues-moved-hunt-lipo-science-rocked/">showed that</a> you <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312004311?via%3Dihub">could transport</a> a 10-foot, 5-ton <em>moai</em> a few hundred yards with <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/easter-island-statues-walked-out-of-quarry-1.11613" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.nature.com/news/easter-island-statues-walked-out-of-quarry-1.11613" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1718631478214ghg" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1718631478214ghg">just 18 people</a> and three strong ropes by employing a rocking motion. In 2018, Lipo proposed <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ingenious-technique-explains-how-easter-island-statues-1826568241">an intriguing hypothesis</a> for how the islanders placed red hats on top of some <em>moai</em>; those can weigh up to 13 tons. He suggested the inhabitants <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030544031830195X">used ropes to roll</a> the hats up a ramp. Lipo and his team later concluded (based on quantitative spatial modeling) that the islanders likely chose the statues' locations based on the availability of fresh water sources, per a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210409">2019 paper</a> in PLOS One.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031900#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031900&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) yesterday rejected AT&amp;T's request to end its landline phone obligations. The state agency also urged AT&amp;T to upgrade copper facilities to fiber instead of trying to shut down the outdated portions of its network.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T asked the state to eliminate its Carrier of Last Resort (COLR) obligation, which requires it to provide landline telephone service to any potential customer in its service territory. A CPUC administrative law judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/california-rebuffs-att-says-it-must-keep-offering-landline-phone-service/">recommended rejection</a> of the application last month, and the commission voted to dismiss AT&amp;T's application <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M533/K846/533846154.PDF">with prejudice</a> on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Our vote to dismiss AT&amp;T's application made clear that we will protect customer access to basic telephone service... Our rules were designed to provide that assurance, and AT&amp;T's application did not follow our rules," Commissioner John Reynolds said in a <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M534/K132/534132863.PDF">CPUC announcement</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032816#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032816&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The owner of a home in southwestern Florida has formally submitted a claim to NASA for damages caused by a chunk of space debris that fell through his roof in March.</p>
<p>The legal case is unprecedented—no one has evidently made such a claim against NASA before. How the space agency responds will set a precedent, and that may be important in a world where there is ever more activity in orbit, with space debris and vehicles increasingly making uncontrolled reentries through Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>Alejandro Otero, owner of the Naples, Florida, home struck by the debris, was not home when part of a battery pack from the International Space Station crashed through his home on March 8. His son Daniel, 19, was home but escaped injury. NASA has confirmed the 1.6-pound object, made of the metal alloy Inconel, was part of a battery pack jettisoned from the space station in 2021.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032777#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032777&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.49 of the Rocket Report! I want to open this week's report with a hearty congratulations to Rocket Lab for the company's 50th launch since Electron's debut in 2017. This is a fine achievement for a company founded in New Zealand, a country with virtually no space program.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets and a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smalll.png"></div>
<p><strong>Electron celebrates its 50th</strong>. On Thursday, <a href="https://x.com/RocketLab/status/1803870728753942737">Rocket Lab launched its 50th Electron mission</a>, "No Time Toulouse."  The mission successfully deployed five Internet-of-Things satellites for the French company Kinéis. This is a nice milestone for the company founded by Peter Beck in New Zealand. With this mission, Rocket Lab becomes the fastest company to go from one launch to 50 launches of a privately developed rocket, surpassing even SpaceX. The company's first Electron mission came about seven years ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032510#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032510&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On a Wednesday morning in late January 1896 at a small light bulb factory in Chicago, a middle-aged woman named Rose Lee found herself at the heart of a groundbreaking medical endeavor. With an X-ray tube positioned above the tumor in her left breast, Lee was treated with a torrent of high-energy particles that penetrated into the malignant mass.</p>
<p>“And so,” as her treating clinician later <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/21.2.156">wrote</a>, “without the blaring of trumpets or the beating of drums, X-ray therapy was born.”</p>
<p>Radiation therapy has come a long way since those <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/69/2/383/550073/Advances-in-Radiotherapy-and-Implications-for-the">early beginnings</a>. The discovery of radium and other radioactive metals opened the doors to administering higher doses of radiation to target cancers located deeper within <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/reports/special-report-building-bodies">the body</a>. The introduction of proton therapy later made it possible to precisely guide radiation beams to tumors, thus reducing damage to surrounding healthy tissues—a degree of accuracy that was further refined through improvements in medical physics, computer technologies and state-of-the-art imaging techniques.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032646#p3">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032646&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, Anthropic announced <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>, its latest AI language model and the first in a new series of "3.5" models that build upon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">Claude 3</a>, launched in March. Claude 3.5 can compose text, analyze data, and write code. It features a 200,000 token context window and is available now on the <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude website</a> and through an API. Anthropic also introduced Artifacts, a new feature in the Claude interface that shows related work documents in a dedicated window.</p>

<p>So far, people outside of Anthropic seem impressed. "This model is really, really good," <a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1803819993416466573">wrote</a> independent AI researcher Simon Willison on X. "I think this is the new best overall model (and both faster and half the price of Opus, similar to the GPT-4 Turbo to GPT-4o jump)."</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">written before</a>, benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are troublesome because they can be cherry-picked and often do not capture the feel and nuance of using a machine to generate outputs on almost any conceivable topic. But according to Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Sonnet matches or outperforms competitor models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on certain benchmarks like <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/sota/multi-task-language-understanding-on-mmlu">MMLU</a> (undergraduate level knowledge), <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/gsm8k">GSM8K</a> (grade school math), and <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/humaneval">HumanEval</a> (coding).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032543#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032543&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pornhub will soon be blocked in five more states as the adult site continues to fight what it considers privacy-infringing age-verification laws that require Internet users to provide an ID to access pornography.</p>
<p>On July 1, according to a <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/age-verification-in-the-news">blog</a> post on the adult site announcing the impending block, Pornhub visitors in Indiana, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, and Nebraska will be "greeted by a video featuring" adult entertainer Cherie Deville, "who explains why we had to make the difficult decision to block them from accessing Pornhub."</p>
<p>Pornhub explained that—similar to blocks in Texas, Utah, Arkansas, Virginia, Montana, North Carolina, and Mississippi—the site refuses to comply with soon-to-be-enforceable age-verification laws in this new batch of states that allegedly put users at "substantial risk" of identity theft, phishing, and other harms.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032654#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032654&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since the launch of the hypercar-defining Veyron back in 2005, modern Bugattis have served as benchmarks for straight-line performance and no-expense-spared automotive engineering. At a time when a 300 horsepower Mustang GT was something to crow about, the quad-turbocharged, W16-powered Veyron offered more than a thousand, metric (987 hp/736 kW).</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, and in contrast to most other world-beating performance cars, the Veyron wasn't presented as some skunkworks project that had been pushed to the ragged edge. Instead, it was a wholly realized ultra-luxury performance machine, replete with the sort of grand touring appointments you'd expect to find in a Bentley rather than a top-speed record holder.</p>
<p>Still, it was the numbers that instantly captivated enthusiasts and casual onlookers alike, and Bugatti would go on to reset the bar with the introduction of the 1,479 hp (1,102 kW) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/this-is-what-its-like-driving-a-bugatti-chiron-at-305mph/">Chiron</a> in 2016.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032077#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032077&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Big tech companies are still trying to rally workers back into physical offices, and many workers are still not having it. Based on a recent report, computer-maker Dell has stumbled even more than most.</p>
<p>Dell announced a new return-to-office initiative <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/dell-tells-remote-workers-that-they-wont-be-eligible-for-promotion/">earlier this year</a>. In the new plan, workers had to classify themselves as remote or hybrid.</p>
<p>Those who classified themselves as hybrid are subject to a tracking system that ensures they are in a physical office 39 days a quarter, which works out to close to three days per work week.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032555#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032555&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's one of the world's worst-kept secrets that large language models give blatantly false answers to queries and do so with a confidence that's indistinguishable from when they get things right. There are a number of reasons for this. The AI could have been trained on misinformation; the answer could require some extrapolation from facts that the LLM isn't capable of; or some aspect of the LLM's training might have incentivized a falsehood.</p>
<p>But perhaps the simplest explanation is that an LLM doesn't recognize what constitutes a correct answer but is compelled to provide one. So it simply makes something up, a habit that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">been termed confabulation</a>.</p>
<p>Figuring out when an LLM is making something up would obviously have tremendous value, given how quickly people have started relying on them for everything from college essays to job applications. Now, researchers from the University of Oxford say they've found a relatively simple way to determine when LLMs appear to be confabulating that works with all popular models and across a broad range of subjects. And, in doing so, they develop evidence that most of the alternative facts LLMs provide are a product of confabulation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032628#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032628&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
