              <![CDATA[<p>The arrival of OpenAI's DALL-E 2 in the spring of 2022 marked a turning point in AI when text-to-image generation suddenly became accessible to a select group of users, creating a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/when-ai-images-were-mind-blowing-early-users-recall-the-first-days-of-dall-e-2/">community of digital explorers</a> who experienced wonder and controversy as the technology automated the act of visual creation.</p>
<p>But like many early AI systems, DALL-E 2 struggled with consistent text rendering, often producing garbled words and phrases within images. It also had limitations in following complex prompts with multiple elements, sometimes missing key details or misinterpreting instructions. These shortcomings left room for improvement that OpenAI would address in subsequent iterations, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">DALL-E 3</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">announced</a> new multimodal image generation capabilities that are directly integrated into its GPT-4o AI language model, making it the default image generator within the ChatGPT interface. The integration, called "4o Image Generation" (which we'll call "4o IG" for short), allows the model to follow prompts more accurately (with better text rendering than DALL-E 3) and respond to chat context for image modification instructions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openais-new-ai-image-generator-is-potent-and-bound-to-provoke/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The first ever fatal crash involving a fully driverless vehicle occurred in San Francisco on January 19. The driverless vehicle belonged to Waymo, but the crash was not Waymo’s fault.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened: A Waymo with no driver or passengers stopped for a red light. Another car stopped behind the Waymo. Then, according to Waymo, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCQqu_ZBzic" rel="">a human-driven SUV rear-ended the other vehicles</a> at high speed, causing a six-car pileup that killed one person and injured five others. Someone’s dog also died in the crash.</p>
<p>Another major Waymo crash occurred in October in San Francisco. Once again, a driverless Waymo was stopped for a red light. According to Waymo, a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction crossed the double yellow line and crashed into an SUV that was stopped to the Waymo’s left. The force of the impact shoved the SUV into the Waymo. One person was seriously injured.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/after-50-million-miles-waymos-crash-a-lot-less-than-human-drivers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Built by Northrop Grumman, Cygnus is one of two Western spacecraft currently capable of delivering food, water, experiments, and other supplies to the International Space Station. This particular Cygnus mission, NG-22, had been scheduled for June. As part of its statement in early March, the space agency said it was evaluating the NG-22 Cygnus cargo supply mission along with Northrop.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, after a query from Ars Technica, the space agency acknowledged that the Cygnus spacecraft designated for NG-22 is too damaged to fly, at least in the nearterm.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/nasa-sidelines-cygnus-spacecraft-after-damage-in-transit-to-launch-site/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon discontinued <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/review-amazons-kindle-oasis-is-a-pricey-look-at-the-future-of-e-readers/">2016's Kindle Oasis</a> in early 2024, and since then, the company hasn't offered a new e-reader with physical page turn buttons or any other alternative to touchscreen input. There still isn't a Kindle with buttons, and the feature seems unlikely to return, but buyers of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/review-amazons-2024-kindle-paperwhite-makes-the-best-e-reader-a-little-better/">the latest Kindle Paperwhite</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazons-first-color-kindle-e-reader-the-kindle-colorsoft-will-run-you-280/">the Kindle Colorsoft</a> are getting a possible consolation prize in the new 5.18.1 software update: a "double tap to page turn" feature that will turn the page or move to the next screen when you double-tap on the back or side of the device.</p>
<p>The 5.18.1 software update is available on all Kindle readers going back to 2018's "10th generation" models, but the double-tap feature only works on the newest 12th-generation Paperwhite and the Colorsoft, not on any older Kindles or either Kindle Scribe model. We verified this firsthand by installing 5.18.1 on a 10th-generation Paperwhite, but we also checked the release notes for each individual Kindle on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW">Amazon's software update page</a>.</p>
<p>All Kindles that get the 5.18.1 update also gain access to new book summaries for "thousands of bestselling English language Kindle books," aiming to make it easier to pick up a new book in an ongoing series.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/newer-kindles-get-a-work-around-for-touchscreen-page-turning-in-new-software-update/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An eruption of measles is spreading quickly in Kansas, with cases doubling in a week and spreading to three new counties, some with vaccination coverage among kindergartners at pitiful levels as low as 41 percent. Coverage of 95 percent or greater is thought to protect communities from onward spread of the extremely contagious virus.</p>
<p>In an update Wednesday, March 26, Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) reported <a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y">23 measles cases across six counties</a>—up from 10 cases across three counties on March 21. The 23 people ill with the dangerous virus are mostly children, including six who are 0 to 4 years old, nine who are 5 to 10, three who are 11 to 13, three who are 14 to 17, and two adults between the ages of 25 and 44. Fortunately, none of the cases have been hospitalized so far, and there have been no deaths.</p>
<p>Twenty of the 23 cases were <a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Data">unvaccinated</a>. One case was "not age appropriately vaccinated," one was "age appropriately vaccinated," and the remaining case's vaccination status is pending.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/measles-quickly-spreading-in-kansas-counties-with-alarmingly-low-vaccination/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google is planning a major change to the way it develops new versions of the Android operating system. Since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/10/google-liberates-android-source-code-so-start-developing/">the beginning</a>, large swaths of the software have been developed in public-facing channels, but that will no longer be the case. This does not mean Android is shedding its open source roots, but the process won't be as transparent.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">has confirmed</a> to Android Authority that all Android development work going forward will take place in Google's internal branch. This is a shift from the way Google has worked on Android in the past, which featured frequent updates to the public AOSP branch. Anyone can access AOSP, but the internal branches are only available to Google and companies with a Google Mobile Services (GMS) license, like Samsung, Motorola, and others.</p>
<p>According to the company, it is making this change to simplify things, building on a recent change to trunk-based development. As Google works on both public and private branches of Android, the two fall out of sync with respect to features and API support. This forces Google to tediously merge the branches for every release. By focusing on the internal branch, Google claims it can streamline releases and make life easier for everyone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Trump and administration officials claimed this week that no classified information about war plans was shared with a journalist, despite <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">The Atlantic report</a> that specific plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen were included in a Signal chat the reporter was inexplicably invited to.</p>
<p>The Atlantic initially declined to publish the exact text of the most specific message sent in advance of the bombings but changed course after the Trump administration's denials. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth <a href="https://apnews.com/article/war-plans-trump-hegseth-atlantic-230718a984911dd8663d59edbcb86f2a">told reporters</a> that "nobody was texting war plans and that’s all I have to say about that." At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that "there was no classified material that was shared in that Signal group."</p>
<p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe said at the same hearing that "my communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information." Trump himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/us/politics/trump-signal-leak-war-plans.html">said</a> the information shared was not classified.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/texts-disprove-trump-admin-claim-that-no-bombing-plans-were-sent-to-reporter/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's a new "exciting, small EV" on the way, to be launched early next year by Also, a spinoff of the electric vehicle maker Rivian. Details are light on exactly what that product will be, but don't go expecting a $20,000 electric hatchback or the like—think more like an e-bike. Also will be into micromobility, not competing with Mini or Smart.</p>
<p>Also started out as an internal project to see if Rivian could use its knowledge of electric powertrains, vehicle electronics, and software to build other "small vehicle form factors." In fact, in 2023, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/rivian-ceo-tells-staff-ev-maker-is-developing-an-electric-bike">news broke</a> of a Rivian e-bike in the works at Rivian, although it was unclear if it would be something with pedals or more like an electric motorcycle.</p>
<p>Things are still rather vague. Also's announcement says its "flagship product" will launch in early 2026 and that the company will focus on the US and Europe at first. It will build "an exciting range of electric vehicles that are efficient, sustainable, and delightful to use," using in-house technology.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/also-a-rivian-ev-spinoff-wants-us-to-move-beyond-cars/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Google's new "thinking" model is ready to think for you. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Just a few months after releasing its first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Gemini 2.0 AI models</a>, Google is upgrading again. <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/">The company says</a> the new Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is its "most intelligent" model yet, offering a massive context window, multimodality, and reasoning capabilities. Google points to a raft of benchmarks that show the new Gemini clobbering other large language models (LLMs), and our testing seems to back that up—Gemini 2.5 Pro is one of the most impressive generative AI models we've seen.</p>
<p>Gemini 2.5, like all Google's models going forward, has reasoning built in. The AI essentially fact-checks itself along the way to generating an output. We like to call this "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">simulated reasoning</a>," as there's no evidence that this process is akin to human reasoning. However, it can go a long way to improving LLM outputs. Google specifically cites the model's "agentic" coding capabilities as a beneficiary of this process. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental can, for example, generate a full working video game from a single prompt. We've tested this, and it works with the publicly available version of the model.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLCBSpgos6s?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div><div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300">
    <div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"></div>
    <div class="caption-content">
      Gemini 2.5 Pro builds a game in one step.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Google says a lot of things about Gemini 2.5 Pro; it's smarter, it's context-aware, it <em>thinks</em>—but it's hard to quantify what constitutes improvement in generative AI bots. There are some clear technical upsides, though. Gemini 2.5 Pro comes with a 1 million token context window, which is common for the big Gemini models but massive compared to competing models like OpenAI GPT or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">Anthropic Claude</a>. You could feed multiple very long books to Gemini 2.5 Pro in a single prompt, and the output maxes out at 64,000 tokens. That's the same as Flash 2.0, but it's still objectively a lot of tokens compared to other LLMs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Being Red Bull Racing 1 teammates with Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen is a hard ask. The Dutch driver took his fourth consecutive world championship last year, dominating the sport to such an extent that he led the points table across a 63-race, 1,029-day streak that only ended with McLaren and Lando Norris' victory in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/a-tough-race-for-the-rookies-as-f1-starts-2025-in-australia/">Australia</a> earlier this month. Now we believe he's going to have his second teammate of the year, after just two races, as Red Bull gets ready to drop Liam Lawson for Yuki Tsunoda.</p>
<p>For three of its championship years, Red Bull built the fastest car in F1, and Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez scored race wins and plenty of points to help the team secure the constructors championships in 2021, 2022, and 2023. But Red Bulls' designers have been evolving a concept that even its former design boss <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/newey-considers-if-lack-of-experience-at-red-bull-contributed-to-recent-car.63B4wB6BZK35hqwjiIZcCN">Adrian Newey</a> thinks <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/newey-considers-if-lack-of-experience-at-red-bull-contributed-to-recent-car.63B4wB6BZK35hqwjiIZcCN">is flawed</a>, and in 2024, we saw Perez' form evaporate after the first handful of races that year.</p>
<p>Verstappen was able to fight for the title thanks to his considerable skill in the car. But the team lost out to both McLaren <em>and</em> Ferrari in the constructors' standings, something that will have had a very considerable impact upon the end-of-year bonuses for Red Bull's hundreds of employees.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/red-bull-makes-up-its-mind-liams-out-yukis-in-for-japan/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A discredited anti-vaccine advocate who has no medical background and who has been disciplined for practicing medicine without a license will reportedly lead a questionable federal study on vaccines and autism—despite a large volume of existing research that has found no link between the two and despite a thorough debunking of claims that vaccines cause autism.</p>
<p>Late Tuesday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/">The Washington Post reported that David Geier</a> has been hired as a "data analyst" by the Department of Health and Human Services, which is now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent and fervent anti-vaccine advocate. Kennedy and Geier have both long touted the false claim that vaccines cause autism, despite the extensive evidence showing that they do not. In March, HHS directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reexamine the nonexistent link between vaccines and autism, using funds from taxpayers that could have been directed at other research.</p>
<p>David Geier earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in 2002. Since then, he has largely worked with his father, Mark Geier, also an anti-vaccine advocate who falsely blames vaccines for autism. In 2011, <a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/bpqapp/Orders/D2425004.271.PDF">Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license</a> by the Maryland State Board of Physicians for misrepresenting his credentials, failing to meet state and federal regulations on safety oversight, and allegedly putting the safety and welfare of autistic children at risk.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/rfk-jr-hires-anti-vaccine-advocate-to-study-debunked-vaccine-autism-link/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>VMware is suing the US arm of industrial giant AG Siemens. The Broadcom company claims that Siemens outed itself by revealing to VMware that it downloaded and distributed multiple copies of VMware products without buying a license.</p>
<p>VMware filed the lawsuit (<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Vmware_vs_siemens.pdf">PDF</a>) on March 21 in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/26/vmware_sues_siemens_for_using/">The Register</a>.</p>
<p>In the complaint, VMware says that it has had a Master Software License and Service Agreement with Siemens since November 28, 2012. The virtualization company claims that in September, Siemens sent VMware a purchase order for maintenance and support services. Siemens was reportedly looking to exercise a previously agreed-upon option for a one-year renewal of support services. However, the list of VMware technology that Siemens was seeking support for "included a large number of products for which [VMware] had no record of Siemens AG purchasing a license," the complaint says.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/03/broadcoms-vmware-says-siemens-pirated-thousands-of-copies-of-its-software/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On March 5, Do No Harm, an organization that advocates against diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in medicine, among other issues, sued the American Chemical Society for its <a href="https://www.acs.org/education/acs-scholars.html">Scholars Program</a>, which provides financial support to chemistry students from underrepresented backgrounds. The <a href="https://donoharmmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025.03.05-Doc-1-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> argues the program is illegal because it is not open to white and Asian students. Around two weeks later, Do No Harm also <a href="https://donoharmmedicine.org/case/do-no-harm-v-university-of-pennsylvania-et-al/">sued the University of Pennsylvania</a> for its partnership with a database called the <a href="https://phillyblackdoctors.com/">Black Doctors Directory</a>, which allows patients to find Black physicians.</p>
<p>The lawsuits join a recent uptick in legal action against universities, departments, and professional societies that host programs intended to increase diversity across academia, including in the sciences. In May 2024, for example, White students at the University of Oklahoma <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/university-oklahoma-anti-white-discrimination-lawsuit-rcna152644">sued their school</a>, alleging the university discriminated against them by factoring in race when determining financial aid. In August, a conservative activist group <a href="https://www.highereddive.com/news/education-department-sued-mcnair-grants-race/725810/">sued the Department of Education</a> over the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program, which provides mentoring and research support to underrepresented students pursuing doctoral degrees. Those cases followed the Supreme Court’s 2023 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf">decision</a> against factoring in race when considering college admissions, effectively striking down affirmative action.</p>
<p>“What's happened here is the organizations bringing these lawsuits, they're capitalizing on the fact that the US Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions,” said Vinay Harpalani, a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Law and an expert on affirmative action policies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/anti-diversity-lawsuits-likely-to-hurt-the-scientific-community-say-scholars/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>It was around 1950. UFO mania had recently ramped up across the world, with dozens of reported sightings of strange flying machines fueling rampant speculation regarding their origins.</p>
<p>The eminent physicist Enrico Fermi was visiting his colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico that summer, and the mealtime conversation turned to the subject of UFOs. Very quickly, the assembled physicists realized that if UFOs were alien machines, that meant it was possible to travel faster than the speed of light. Otherwise, those alien craft would have never made it here.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/all-by-ourselves-the-great-filter-and-our-attempts-to-find-life/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In recent years, the US military has made much of a concept known as tactically responsive launch. This essentially means that if there is some rapidly developing threat in space—say an adversary takes out a key national defense satellite—the military would like the capability to rapidly fuel a satellite on Earth, mate it to a rocket, and launch it into space.</p>
<p>The US Space Force <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/firefly-and-space-force-demonstrate-ability-to-rapidly-launch-a-satellite/">first demonstrated</a> this tactically responsive capability with a launch on Firefly's Alpha rocket in 2023. As part of this "Victus Nox" test flight, a satellite was encapsulated into a payload fairing and mated to the rocket and completed all final launch preparations within 27 hours.</p>
<p>But what if there were an even faster way to respond? That's the vision behind a new, $60 million federal award to a new space company named Gravitics for a concept called an orbital carrier.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/firm-wins-space-force-funding-to-provide-an-aircraft-carrier-in-orbit/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The European Space Agency is inviting proposals to inject competition into the European launch market, an important step toward fostering a dynamic multiplayer industry officials hope, one day, will mimic that of the United States.</p>
<p>The near-term plan for the European Launcher Challenge is for ESA to select companies for service contracts to transport ESA and other European government payloads to orbit from 2026 through 2030. A second component of the challenge is for companies to perform at least one demonstration of an upgraded launch vehicle by 2028. The competition is open to any European company working in the launch business.</p>
<p class="p1">"What we expect is that these companies will make a step in improving and upgrading their capacity with respect to what they’re presently working on," said Toni Tolker-Nielsen, ESA's acting director of space transportation. "In terms of economics and physics, it’s better to have a bigger launcher than a smaller launcher in terms of price per kilogram to orbit."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/esa-finally-has-a-commercial-launch-strategy-but-will-member-states-pay/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>More heavy blows are landing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to reports Tuesday that reveal a wave of high-level departures from the country's beleaguered health agency. The agency is also losing $11.4 billion in funding for responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was largely doled out to chronically underfunded state health departments.</p>
<p>This afternoon, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-public-health-susan-monarez-3f0d76219a02163b0c46ded0f3901d73">the Associated Press reported</a> that five high-level leaders are departing the agency, which was announced today during a senior staff meeting. The departures, which were described as retirements, follow three other high-level departures in recent weeks. Given that the CDC has two dozen centers and offices, the recent departures reflect a loss of about a third of the agency's top management.</p>
<p>The departures announced today include: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infrastructure/leadership/leslie-ann-dauphin.html">Leslie Ann Dauphin</a>, who oversees the Public Health Infrastructure Center, "which serves as the connection point between the agency and state, local, and territorial jurisdictions, tribes. and CDC's public health partners," according to the CDC. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/leadership/director.html">Karen Remley</a>, who heads the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, is also departing, as is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/os.html">Sam Posner</a>, who heads the Office of Science, which provides scientific expertise across the agency and publishes the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debra-lubar-55b2548/">Debra Lubar</a>, who is the CDC's Chief Operating Officer and runs the Office of Policy, Performance and Evaluation, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/ohe.html">Leandris Liburd</a>, head of the Office of Health Equity, are also leaving.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/cdc-rocked-by-top-level-departures-loss-of-11-4b-in-covid-funding/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Software developer Xe Iaso <a href="https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/amazon-crawler/">reached a breaking point</a> earlier this year when aggressive AI crawler traffic from Amazon overwhelmed their Git repository service, repeatedly causing instability and downtime. Despite configuring standard defensive measures—adjusting robots.txt, blocking known crawler user-agents, and filtering suspicious traffic—Iaso found that AI crawlers continued evading all attempts to stop them, spoofing user-agents and cycling through residential IP addresses as proxies.</p>
<p>Desperate for a solution, Iaso eventually resorted to moving their server behind a VPN and creating "Anubis," a custom-built proof-of-work challenge system that forces web browsers to solve computational puzzles before accessing the site. "It's futile to block AI crawler bots because they lie, change their user agent, use residential IP addresses as proxies, and more," Iaso wrote in a <a href="https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/amazon-crawler/">blog post</a> titled "a desperate cry for help." "I don't want to have to close off my Gitea server to the public, but I will if I have to."</p>
<p>Iaso's story highlights a broader crisis rapidly spreading across the open source community, as what appear to be aggressive AI crawlers increasingly overload community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on vital public resources. According to a <a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">comprehensive recent report</a> from LibreNews, some open source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI companies' bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>Severance</em> has just wrapped up its second season. I sat down with fellow Ars staffers Aaron Zimmerman and Lee Hutchinson to talk through what we had just seen, covering everything from those goats to the show's pacing. Warning: Huge spoilers for seasons 1 and 2 follow!</p>
<p><strong>Nate:</strong> <em>Severance</em> season 1 was a smaller-scale, almost claustrophobic show about a crazy office, its "waffle parties," and the personal life of Mark Scout, mourning his dead wife and "severing" his consciousness to avoid that pain. It followed a compact group of characters, centered around the four "refiners" who worked on Lumon's severed floor. But season 2 blew up that cozy/creepy world and started following more characters—including far more "outies"—to far more places. Did the show manage to maintain its unique vibe while making significant changes to pacing, character count, and location?</p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> I think so, but as you say, things were different this time around. One element that I’m glad carried through was the show’s consistent use of a very specific visual language. (I am an absolute sucker for visual storytelling. My favorite Kubrick film is <em>Barry Lyndon</em>. I’ll forgive a lot of plot holes if they’re beautifully shot.) Season 2, especially in the back half, treats us to an absolute smorgasbord of incredible visuals—bifurcated shots symbolizing severance and duality, stark whites and long hallways, and my personal favorite: Chris Walken in a black turtleneck seated in front of a fireplace, like Satan holding court in Hell. The storytelling might be a bit less focused, but it looks great.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/praise-kier-for-severance-season-2-lets-discuss/">Read full article</a></p>
