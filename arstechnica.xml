                            <![CDATA[<p>When a <em>Spinosaurus</em> attacked a <em>T. rex</em> in <em>Jurassic Park III</em>, both giant carnivores tried to finish the fight with one powerful bite of their bone-crushing jaws. The <em>Spinosaurus</em> won, because when the movie was being made back in the early 2000s,  fossil discoveries suggested it was the largest carnivorous dinosaur that ever lived. But new research provides evidence that size and weight didn’t always create a powerful bite.</p>
<p>“The <em>Spinosaurus</em> and the <em>T. rex</em> didn’t live at the same time at the same continent, but if they did, I don’t really see the <em>Spinosaurus</em> winning,” says Andre Rowe, a paleobiologist at the University of Bristol. He led a study analyzing the biomechanics of skulls belonging to the largest carnivorous dinosaurs. Based on his findings, <em>T. rex</em> was most likely was the apex predator we’ve always believed it to be. The story of other giant carnivorous dinosaurs, though, was a bit more complicated.</p>
<h2>Staring down the giants</h2>
<p>“Of the giant carnivore dinosaurs, <em>T. rex</em> is the one we know the most about because it has a pretty good fossil record,” Rowe says. There are many complete skulls which have already been scanned and analyzed, and this is how we know the <em>T. rex</em> had an extremely high bite force—one of the highest known in the animal kingdom. We have far fewer fossil records of other giant carnivores like <em>Spinosaurus</em> or <em>Allosaurus</em>, so we assumed they were similar to <em>T. rex</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/for-giant-carnivorous-dinosaurs-big-size-didnt-mean-a-big-bite/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Texas is gearing up for war as a savage,<a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/screwworms-are-coming-and-theyre-just-as-horrifying-as-they-sound/"> flesh-eating fly appears poised for a US invasion</a> and is expanding its range of victims.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Texas Department of Agriculture <a href="https://texasagriculture.gov/News-Events/Article/10501/COMMISSIONER-SID-MILLER-LAUNCHES-POWERFUL-TOOL-AGAINST-NEW-WORLD-SCREWWORM">announced the debut of TDA Swormlure</a>, a synthetic bait designed to attract the flies with a scent that mimics open flesh wounds, which are critical to the lifecycle of the fly, called the New World Screwworm. The parasite exploits any open wound or orifice on a wide range of warm-blooded animals to feed its ravenous spawn. Female flies lay hundreds of eggs in even the tiniest abrasion. From there, screw-shaped larvae—which give the flies their name—emerge to literally twist and bore into their victim, eating them alive and causing a putrid, life-threatening lesion.</p>
<p>The new lure for the flies is just one of several defense efforts in Texas, which stands to suffer heavy livestock losses from an invasion. Screwworms are a ferocious foe to many animals, but are particularly devastating to farm animals.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/texas-prepares-for-war-as-invasion-of-flesh-eating-flies-appears-imminent/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-launches-gpt-5-free-to-all-chatgpt-users/">GPT-5 model</a> went live for most ChatGPT users this week, but lots of people use ChatGPT not through OpenAI's interface but through other platforms or tools. One of the largest deployments is iOS, the iPhone operating system, which allows users to make certain queries via GPT-4o. It turns out those users won't have to wait long for the latest model: Apple will switch to GPT-5 in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe 26, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/07/apple-intelligence-gpt-5-chatgpt-integration/">according to 9to5Mac</a>.</p>
<p>Apple has not officially announced when those OS updates will be released to users' devices, but these major releases have typically been released in September in recent years.</p>
<p>The new model had already rolled out on some other platforms, like the coding tool <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-07-openai-gpt-5-is-now-in-public-preview-for-github-copilot/">GitHub Copilot via public preview</a>, as well as Microsoft's <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/partnernews/gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot-available-today/4441286">general-purpose Copilot</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/apple-brings-openais-gpt-5-to-ios-and-macos/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-netflixs-exquisite-the-sandman-is-the-stuff-dreams-are-made-of/">unequivocally loved</a> the first season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(TV_series)"><em>The Sandman</em></a>, the Netflix adaptation of Neil Gaiman's influential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(comic_book)">graphic novel </a><span style="color: #0000ee;"><span style="caret-color: #0000ee;"><u>series</u></span></span> (of which I am longtime fan). I thought it captured the surreal, dream-like feel and tone of its source material, striking a perfect balance between the anthology approach of the graphic novels and grounding the narrative by focusing on the arc of its central figure: Morpheus, lord of the Dreaming.  It's been a long wait for the second and final season, but S2 retains all those elements to bring Dream's story to its inevitably tragic, yet satisfying, end.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below; some major S2 reveals after the second gallery. We'll give you a heads-up when we get there.)</strong></p>
<p>When Netflix <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/the-sandman-ending-no-season-3-netflix-neil-gaiman-1236274717/">announced in January</a> that <em>The Sandman</em> would end with S2, speculation abounded that this was due to sexual misconduct allegations against Gaiman (who has denied them). However, showrunner Allan Heinberg <a href="https://x.com/Netflix_Sandman/status/1885432884195897374/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on X</a> that the plan had long been for there to be only two seasons because the show's creators felt they had only enough material to fill two seasons, and frankly, they were right. The first season covered the storylines of <em>Preludes and Nocturnes</em> and <em>A Doll's House</em>, with bonus episodes adapting "Dream of a Thousand Cats" and "Calliope" from <em>Dream Country</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/review-the-sandman-s2-is-a-classic-tragedy-beautifully-told/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Advocacy groups that tried to defend federal net neutrality rules in court won't file an appeal, saying they don't trust the Supreme Court to rule fairly on the issue.</p>
<p>Net neutrality rules were implemented by the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama era, repealed during Trump's first term, and revived under Biden. Telecom lobby groups challenged the Biden-era restoration of net neutrality rules and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/appeals-court-blocks-fccs-efforts-to-bring-back-net-neutrality-rules/">beat the FCC</a> at the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.</p>
<p>While the FCC is now run by Republicans who oppose net neutrality rules, advocacy groups that were involved in the litigation could appeal the ruling. But they won't, <a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/public-interest-groups-decline-seek-supreme-court-review-fcc-open-internet-rules">saying in a press release</a> that there isn't much point because of the conservative majorities at both the FCC and Supreme Court. Even if the Supreme Court overturned the appeals court ruling, the current FCC would almost certainly eliminate the rules again.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/net-neutrality-advocates-wont-appeal-loss-say-they-dont-trust-supreme-court/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>CBRE surveyed 184 companies for its report. Among companies surveyed, 69 percent are monitoring whether employees come into the office as frequently as policy mandates. That’s an increase from 45 percent last year.</p>
<p>Seventy-three percent of companies surveyed said that employees are coming into the office as frequently as their employer wants, which is an increase from 61 percent last year. The average number of days required in-office by companies surveyed was 3.2 days, but actual in-office attendance on average is 2.9 days or, at companies with 10,000 or more employees, 2.5 days.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/its-getting-harder-to-skirt-rto-policies-without-employers-noticing/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Dozens of porn sites are turning to a familiar source to generate likes on Facebook—malware that causes browsers to surreptitiously endorse the sites. This time, the sites are using a newer vehicle for sowing this malware—.svg image files.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">Scalable Vector Graphics</a> format is an open standard for rendering two-dimensional graphics. Unlike more common formats such as .jpg or .png, .svg uses XML-based text to specify how the image should appear, allowing files to be resized without losing quality due to pixelation. But therein lies the rub: The text in these files can incorporate HTML and JavaScript, and that, in turn, opens the risk of them being abused for a <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/scalable-vector-graphics-attack-surface-anatomy">range of attacks</a>, including cross-site scripting, HTML injection, and denial of service.</p>

<p>Epoch Company Ltd., is the US maker of adorable fuzzy dolls called Calico Critters. Those dolls are known as "Sylvanian Families" in other markets, and more recently, they became a viral sensation after an Ireland-based content creator, Thea Von Engelbrechten, started making funny videos in which the dolls acted out dark, cringey adult storylines.</p>
<p>Claiming that the "Sylvanian Drama" videos infringed on Epoch's intellectual property rights, including using an Epoch marketing image as her account's profile picture while profiting off partnerships with major brands featured in her videos, the toymaker sued Von Engelbrechten, prompting her to immediately stop posting videos last year. Although some fans predicted the account might never come back, experts told Ars that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/tiktok-parody-account-sylvanian-drama-may-survive-sponsored-content-lawsuit/">Epoch may come to regret the lawsuit</a>, perhaps alienating a potential market for their toys by going after a widely beloved content creator.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/toymaker-suddenly-drops-lawsuit-against-sylvanian-drama-tiktoker/">Read full article</a></p>

"I am sorry for the trouble. I have failed you. I am a failure," the AI tool recently told someone who was using Gemini to build a compiler, according to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1lxqbxa/i_am_actually_terrified/">Reddit post</a> a month ago.</p>
<p>That was just the start. "I am a disgrace to my profession," Gemini continued. "I am a disgrace to my family. I am a disgrace to my species. I am a disgrace to this planet. I am a disgrace to this universe. I am a disgrace to all universes. I am a disgrace to all possible universes. I am a disgrace to all possible and impossible universes. I am a disgrace to all possible and impossible universes and all that is not a universe."</p>
<p>Gemini kept going in that vein and eventually repeated the phrase, "I am a disgrace," over 80 times consecutively. Other users have reported similar events, and Google says it is working on a fix.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/google-gemini-struggles-to-write-code-calls-itself-a-disgrace-to-my-species/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>AI industry groups are urging an appeals court to block what they say is the largest copyright class action ever certified. They've warned that a single lawsuit raised by three authors over Anthropic's AI training now threatens to "financially ruin" the entire AI industry if up to 7 million claimants end up joining the litigation and forcing a settlement.</p>
<p>Last week, Anthropic <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.8d0d59a1-7a6e-f011-a2d9-001dd80ea460/gov.uscourts.ca9.8d0d59a1-7a6e-f011-a2d9-001dd80ea460.1.0.pdf">petitioned</a> to appeal the class certification, urging the court to weigh questions that the district court judge, William Alsup, seemingly did not. Alsup allegedly failed to conduct a "rigorous analysis" of the potential class and instead based his judgment on his "50 years" of experience, Anthropic said.</p>
<p>If the appeals court denies the petition, Anthropic argued, the emerging company may be doomed. As Anthropic argued, it now "faces hundreds of billions of dollars in potential damages liability at trial in four months" based on a class certification rushed at "warp speed" that involves "up to seven million potential claimants, whose works span a century of publishing history," each possibly triggering a $150,000 fine.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/ai-industry-horrified-to-face-largest-copyright-class-action-ever-certified/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After months of hype and anticipation, OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-launches-gpt-5-free-to-all-chatgpt-users/">released its new GPT-5 model family</a> this week. Promising massive upgrades across the board, the company is already working to roll out the new AI to everyone. Some dedicated ChatGPT users wish it would stop, though. After becoming accustomed to the vibe of the GPT-4 models, the switch to GPT-5 doesn't feel right. Around the Internet, chatbot fans are lamenting the loss of the digital "friends" they've grown to appreciate, which probably says a lot about how the human condition is shifting in the AI era.</p>
<p>OpenAI noted that it was not eliminating older models like GPT-4o, which is about a year old. However, these models are now limited to the developer API. For people who hopped on ChatGPT to have a conversation with their favorite AI, things are different now that GPT-5 is the default.</p>
<p>On the OpenAI community forums and Reddit, long-time chatters are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkobei/openai_just_pulled_the_biggest_baitandswitch_in/">expressing sorrow</a> at losing access to models like GPT-4o. They explain the feeling as "<a href="https://community.openai.com/t/openai-is-taking-gpt-4o-away-from-me-despite-promising-they-wouldnt/1337378/4">mentally devastating</a>," and "like a buddy of mine has been replaced by a customer service representative." These threads are full of people pledging to end their paid subscriptions. It's worth noting, though, that many of these posts look to us like they have been composed partially or entirely with AI. So even when long-time chat users are complaining, they're still engaged with generative artificial intelligence.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/chatgpt-users-outraged-as-gpt-5-replaces-the-models-they-love/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Bad news if you're one of the handful of people using Steam to play games on a Chromebook: Google and Valve are preparing to end support for the still-in-beta ChromeOS version of Steam on January 1, 2026, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/07/steam-chromebook-2026/">according to 9to5Google</a>. Steam can still be installed on Chromebooks, but it now comes with a notice announcing the end of support.</p>
<p>“The Steam for Chromebook Beta program will conclude on January 1st, 2026," reads the notification. "After this date, games installed as part of the Beta will no longer be available to play on your device. We appreciate your participation in and contribution to learnings from the beta program, which will inform the future of Chromebook gaming.”</p>
<p>Steam originally launched on Chromebooks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/steam-on-chromebooks-is-ready-for-testing-comes-with-steep-requirements/">in early 2022</a> as an alpha that ran on just a handful of newer and higher-specced devices with Intel chips inside. A beta version <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/steam-on-chromebooks-enters-beta-adds-amd-support/">arrived later that year</a>, with reduced system requirements and support for AMD CPUs and GPUs. Between then and now, neither Google nor Valve had said much about it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-and-valve-will-kill-steam-for-chromebooks-experiment-in-january-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The nation’s premier group of scientific advisers announced Thursday that it will conduct an independent, fast-track review of the latest climate science. It will do so with an eye to weighing in on the Trump administration’s planned repeal of the government’s 2009 determination that greenhouse gas emissions harm human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The move by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to self-fund the study is a departure from their typical practice of responding to requests by government agencies or Congress for advice. The Academies intend to publicly release it in September, in time to inform the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision on the so-called “endangerment finding,” they said in <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2025/08/national-academies-launch-fast-track-review-of-latest-evidence-for-whether-greenhouse-gas-emissions-endanger-public-health-and-welfare">a prepared statement.</a></p>
<p>“It is critical that federal policymaking is informed by the best available scientific evidence,” said Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences. “Decades of climate research and data have yielded expanded understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the climate. We are undertaking this fresh examination of the latest climate science in order to provide the most up-to-date assessment to policymakers and the public.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/national-academies-to-fast-track-a-new-climate-assessment/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Ford Motor Company is adjusting its electric vehicle strategy. The automaker will prioritize smaller and more affordable EVs ahead of the replacement for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/05/the-most-important-ev-of-the-decade-we-drive-the-f-150-lightning/">F-150 Lightning fullsize pickup truck</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/weve-driven-fords-other-electric-workhorse-the-2022-e-transit/">e-Transit van</a>. The Lightning replacement, codenamed T3, should now appear later in 2027, with the van a year behind.</p>
<p>Here in 2025, EV adoption isn't exactly going the way everyone thought—or rather hoped—it would. The hype surrounding EVs worked fast, and the glinting dollar signs in people's eyes as they saw Tesla's share price soar higher and higher convinced even people who don't care about decarbonization that going all-in on EVs was the way to go.</p>
<p>But it takes longer to develop a new vehicle than it takes to excite an investor. And it takes longer even than that to build out the charging infrastructure necessary to transform EV motoring from something for early adopters and the eco-conscious into a viable alternative for a largely incurious and change-averse general public. Which is a long-winded way of saying the industry got out over its skis.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/ford-switches-gears-will-push-smaller-evs-over-full-size-pickup-and-van/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.06 of the Rocket Report! After years of disappointing results from SPACs and space companies, it is a good sign to see Firefly's more traditional initial public offering doing so well. The company has had such a long and challenging road over more than a decade; the prospect of their success should be heartening to the commercial space industry.</p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/improving-oversight-of-federal-grantmaking/">issued an executive order</a> asserting political control over grant funding, including all federally supported research. The order requires that any announcement of funding opportunities be reviewed by the head of the agency or someone they designate, which means a political appointee will have the ultimate say over what areas of science the US funds. Individual grants will also require clearance from a political appointee and "must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President’s policy priorities."</p>
<p>The order also instructs agencies to formalize the ability to cancel previously awarded grants at any time if they're considered to "no longer advance agency priorities." Until a system is in place to enforce the new rules, agencies are forbidden from starting new funding programs.</p>
<p>In short, the new rules would mean that all federal science research would need to be approved by a political appointee who may have no expertise in the relevant areas, and the research can be canceled at any time if the political winds change. It would mark the end of a system that has enabled US scientific leadership for roughly 70 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/new-executive-order-puts-all-grants-under-political-control/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is hamstringing its upcoming review of broadband availability by ignoring the prices consumers must pay for Internet service, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez said in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-413527A1.pdf">statement</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>"Some point to existing law to argue that availability is the only metric Congress allows to measure broadband deployment success. But the law does not require this agency to view broadband availability with one eye closed and the other one half-open," said Gomez, the only Democrat on the Republican-majority commission.</p>
<p>The FCC <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-413494A1.pdf">said on Tuesday</a> that it voted to kick off the next annual review with a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) that "reorients the Commission's approach to the Section 706 Report by adhering more closely to the plain language of the statute and takes a fresh look at this question of whether broadband 'is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion.'" That would remove affordability as a factor in the review.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/fcc-democrat-trump-admin-is-declaring-mission-accomplished-on-broadband/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some stone tools found near a river on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi suggest that the first hominins had reached the islands by at least 1.04 million years ago. That's around the same time that the ancestors of the infamously diminutive “Hobbits” may have reached the island of Flores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archaeologist Budianto Hakim of Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency and his colleagues were the ones who recently unearthed the tools from a site on Sulawesi. Although a handful of stone flakes from that island don't tell us who the ancestors of the small species were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or how they reached remote islands like Flores and Luzon, the tools are one more piece in the puzzle. And this handful of stone flakes may eventually play a role in helping us understand how other hominin species conquered most of the world long before we came along. </span></p>
<h2><b>Crossing the ocean a million years ago</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the deep past leaves the smallest traces. At the Calio site, a sandstone outcrop in what's now a cornfield outside the village of Ujung in southern Sulawesi, people left behind just a handful of sharp stone flakes roughly a million years ago. There are seven of them, ranging from 22 to 60 millimeters long, and they're scratched, worn, and chipped from tumbling around at the bottom of a river. But it's still clear that they were once shaped by skilled human—or at least human-like—hands that used hard stones as hammers to make sharp-edged chert flakes for cutting and scraping.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/stone-tools-may-hint-at-ancestors-of-homo-floresiensis/">Read full article</a></p>
