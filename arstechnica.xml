                            <![CDATA[<p>With their quick-change camouflage and high level of intelligence, it’s not surprising that the public and scientific experts alike <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/10/us-government-considers-protecting-octopuses-used-in-research/">are fascinated</a> by octopuses. Their abilities to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20563906/">recognize faces</a>, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4803207/">solve puzzles,</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16801504/">learn behaviors</a> from other octopuses make these animals a captivating study.</p>
<p>To perform these processes and others, like crawling or exploring, octopuses rely on their complex nervous system, one that has become a focus for neuroscientists. With about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16801504/">500 million neurons</a>—around the same number <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8988249/#:~:text=The%20three%20main%20parts%20of,fifths%20of%20the%20octopus's%20neurons.">as dogs</a>—octopuses’ nervous systems are the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8988249/#:~:text=The%20three%20main%20parts%20of,fifths%20of%20the%20octopus's%20neurons.">most complex</a> of any invertebrate. But, unlike vertebrate organisms, the octopus’s nervous system is also decentralized, with around <a href="http://octopus.huji.ac.il/site/articles/Hochner-2004.pdf">350 million neurons</a>, or 66 percent of it, located in its eight arms.</p>
<p>“This means each arm is capable of independently processing sensory input, initiating movement, and even executing complex behaviors—<em>without direct instructions from the brain</em>,” explains <a href="https://engineering.msu.edu/faculty/Galit-Pelled">Galit Pelled</a>, a professor of Mechanical Engineering, Radiology, and Neuroscience at Michigan State University who studies octopus neuroscience. “In essence, the arms have their own ‘mini-brains.’”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/the-nine-armed-octopus-and-the-oddities-of-the-cephalopod-nervous-system/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The daughter of a woman who was killed by extreme heat during the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome has filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against major oil companies claiming they should be held responsible for her death.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/case-documents/2025/20250529_docket-25-2-15986-8-SEA_complaint.pdf">civil lawsuit</a>, filed on May 29 in King County Superior Court in Seattle, is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/oil-industry-wrongful-death-lawsuit">first wrongful death case</a> brought against Big Oil in the US in the context of climate change. It attempts to hold some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies liable for the death of Juliana Leon, who perished from overheating during the heat dome event, which scientists have determined would have been <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/">virtually impossible</a> absent human-caused climate change.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/estate-of-woman-who-died-in-2021-heat-dome-sues-big-oil-for-wrongful-death/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/rfk-jr-hires-anti-vaccine-advocate-to-study-debunked-vaccine-autism-link/">Notorious anti-vaccine advocate David Geier</a> has begun working at the US Department of Health and Human Services and is seeking access to sensitive vaccine safety data that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had previously barred him from accessing—at least twice—<a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/vaccine-opponent-hired-by-rfk-jr-scours-official-records-for-link-to-autism-a1091eb4">according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>Geier and his father, Mark Geier, who died in March, are known for peddling the thoroughly debunked falsehood that vaccines cause autism, publishing a long list of dubious articles in low-quality journals that push the idea. In particular, the two have blamed the mercury-containing vaccine preservative, thimerosal, despite <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15342856/">numerous</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11331700/">studies</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14595043/">finding no link</a>. Thimerosal was largely abandoned from vaccine formulations in 2001 out of an abundance of caution.</p>
<p>In 2011, an investigation by the Maryland State Board of Physicians found that the Geiers were misdiagnosing autistic children and treating them with potent hormone therapies in a treatment they dubbed the "Lupron Protocol." Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license. David Geier, who has no medical or scientific background and holds only a bachelor's degree, was disciplined for practicing medicine without a license.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/anti-vaccine-quack-hired-by-rfk-jr-has-started-work-at-the-health-department/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-gov-models-for-u-s-national-security-customers">unveiled</a> specialized AI models designed for US national security customers. The company released "Claude Gov" models that were built in response to direct feedback from government clients to handle operations such as strategic planning, intelligence analysis, and operational support. The custom models reportedly already serve US national security agencies, with access restricted to those working in classified environments.</p>
<p>The Claude Gov models differ from Anthropic's consumer and enterprise offerings, also called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Claude</a>, in several ways. They reportedly handle classified material, "refuse less" when engaging with classified information, and are customized to handle intelligence and defense documents. The models also feature what Anthropic calls "enhanced proficiency" in languages and dialects critical to national security operations.</p>
<p>Anthropic says the new models underwent the same "safety testing" as all Claude models. The company has been pursuing government contracts as it seeks reliable revenue sources, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/safe-ai-champ-anthropic-teams-up-with-defense-giant-palantir-in-new-deal/">partnering with Palantir</a> and Amazon Web Services in November to sell AI tools to defense customers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-releases-custom-ai-chatbot-for-classified-spy-work/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is launching with a handful of new games, but for many of the people getting one this week, the main thing to play on it is software made for the original Switch.</p>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">known for months</a> that the Switch 2 would maintain backward compatibility with the vast majority of Switch games, but one major question was whether the Switch 2’s improved hardware would benefit older Switch games in some way. Especially in recent years, first- and third-party Switch games have struggled with the original system’s aging Nvidia chipset, which was already a bit dated when the system came out in 2017.</p>
<p>After a day or so of testing various Switch games on the Switch 2, we can report firsthand that Switch games <em>can</em> look dramatically better on the new system. For games that Nintendo has taken the trouble to update—those with Switch 2 upgrade packs and those with free updates—players can expect higher resolutions, better frame rates, less texture and character pop-in, and smoother animations all around. Even games that haven’t been updated for the Switch 2 can run a bit more consistently on the new systems, though games without Switch 2-specific updates don’t improve as much as games with updates.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-can-make-your-old-switch-games-feel-brand-new-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wants to enforce a 10-year moratorium on AI regulation by making states ineligible for broadband funding if they try to impose any limits on development of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The House previously <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text">approved a budget bill</a> that contained a fairly straightforward provision to ban <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">state AI regulation</a> for 10 years. Cruz, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, yesterday released <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/6/chairman-cruz-releases-budget-reconciliation-text">budget reconciliation text</a> that takes a different approach to preventing states from regulating AI.</p>
<p>Cruz's approach may be an attempt to get around the Senate's <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RL30862">Byrd Rule</a>, which limits the inclusion of "extraneous matter" in budget reconciliation legislation. He wants to make it impossible for states to receive money from the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program if they try to regulate AI. Cruz released a <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/0511804E-F578-4B22-B2FF-49A0478C1958">summary</a> that says his bill "forbids states collecting BEAD money from strangling AI deployment with EU-style regulation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/ted-cruz-bill-states-that-regulate-ai-will-be-cut-out-of-42b-broadband-fund/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Millions of low-cost devices for media streaming, in-vehicle entertainment, and video projection are infected with malware that turns consumer networks into platforms for distributing malware, concealing nefarious communications, and performing other illicit activities, the FBI has warned.</p>
<p>The malware infecting these devices, known as BadBox, is based on Triada, a malware strain <a href="https://securelist.com/everyone-sees-not-what-they-want-to-see/74997/">discovered</a> in 2016 by Kaspersky Lab, which called it "one of the most advanced mobile Trojans" the security firm's analysts had ever encountered. It employed an impressive kit of tools, including rooting exploits that bypassed security protections built into Android and functions for modifying the Android OS's all-powerful Zygote process. Google eventually updated Android to block the methods Triada used to infect devices.</p>
<h2>The threat remains</h2>
<p>A year later, Triada returned, only this time, devices came pre-infected before they reached consumers’ hands. In 2019, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/google-confirms-2017-supply-chain-attack-that-sneaked-backdoor-on-android-devices/">confirmed</a> that the supply-chain attack affected thousands of devices and that the company had once again taken measures to thwart it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/millions-of-low-cost-android-devices-turn-home-networks-into-crime-platforms/">Read full article</a></p>

As we do, we thought we'd share some initial impressions after having Nintendo's new console in hand for 48 hours or so. Consider these first thoughts an extended version of our notes from a review in progress and a starting point for discussion of the first completely new Nintendo platform in over eight years.</p>
<h2>The Switch 2 Joy-Cons feel great</h2>
<p>There's something incredibly satisfying about the magnetic "snap" when you plug the new Joy-Cons into the Switch 2 horizontally, and the handy release lever makes it much easier to disconnect the controllers from the tablet with one hand. Even without a physical rail holding the Joy-Cons to the system (as on the Switch), the magnetic connection feels remarkably sturdy in portable mode.</p>

      The Switch 2 Joy-Con (left) and a right-side original Switch Joy-Con.
    
<p>Though the Switch 2's expanded Joy-Cons generally feel more comfortable for adult hands, I have noticed that the analog stick encroaches a little more on the space for the face buttons on the right Joy-Con. I've found myself accidentally nudging that analog stick with the bottom of my thumb when pressing the lower "B" button on the Joy-Con, a problem I never recall encountering on the original Switch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/our-first-impressions-after-48-hours-with-the-switch-2/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Galaxies are far more than the sum of their stars. Long before stars even formed, dark matter clumped up and drew regular matter together with its gravity, providing the invisible scaffolding upon which stars and galaxies eventually grew.</p>
<p>Today, nearly all galaxies are still embedded in giant “halos” of dark matter that extend far beyond their visible borders and hold them together, anchoring stars that move so quickly they would otherwise break out of their galaxy’s gravitational grip and spend their lives adrift in intergalactic space.</p>
<p>The way dark matter and stars interact influences how galaxies change over time. But until recently, scientists had mainly only examined one side of that relationship, exploring the way dark matter pulls on normal matter.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/simulations-find-ghostly-whirls-of-dark-matter-trailing-galaxy-arms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday with the company's standard keynote presentation—a combination of PR about how great Apple and its existing products are and a first look at the next-generation versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and the company's other operating systems.</p>
<p>Reporting before the keynote rarely captures everything that Apple has planned at its presentations, but the reliable information we've seen so far is that Apple will keep the focus on its software this year rather than using the keynote to demo splashy new hardware like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/hands-on-with-apple-vision-pro-this-is-not-a-vr-headset/">Vision Pro</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/this-is-the-new-apple-silicon-mac-pro/">Apple Silicon Mac Pro</a>, which the company introduced at WWDC a couple years back.</p>
<p>If you haven't been keeping track, here are a few of the things that are most likely to happen when the pre-recorded announcement videos start rolling next week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/what-to-expect-from-apples-worldwide-developers-conference-next-week/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/addictive-interactive-murder-map-lets-you-explore-medieval-london-crime/">In 2019</a>, we told you about <a href="https://www.vrc.crim.cam.ac.uk/vrcresearch/london-medieval-murder-map">a new interactive digital "murder map"</a> of London compiled by University of Cambridge criminologist Manuel Eisner. Drawing on data catalogued in the city coroners' rolls, the map showed the approximate location of 142 homicide cases in late medieval London. The Medieval Murder Maps project has since expanded to include maps of York and Oxford homicides, as well as podcast episodes focusing on individual cases.</p>
<p>It's easy to lose oneself down the rabbit hole of medieval murder for hours, filtering the killings by year, choice of weapon, and location. Think of it as a kind of 14th-century version of <em>Clue</em>: It was the noblewoman's hired assassins armed with daggers in the streets of Cheapside near St. Paul's Cathedral. And that's just the juiciest of the various cases described in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10609-025-09512-7">a new paper</a> published in the journal Criminal Law Forum.</p>
<p>The noblewoman was Ela Fitzpayne, wife of a knight named Sir Robert Fitzpayne, lord of Stogursey. The victim was a priest and her erstwhile lover, John Forde, who was stabbed to death in the streets of Cheapside on May 3, 1337. “We are looking at a murder commissioned by a leading figure of the English aristocracy," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1085953?">said University of Cambridge criminologist Manuel Eisner</a>, who heads the Medieval Murder Maps project. "It is planned and cold-blooded, with a family member and close associates carrying it out, all of which suggests a revenge motive."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/cold-case-files-the-medieval-murder-of-a-troublesome-priest/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Everyone in quantum computing agrees that error correction will be the key to doing a broad range of useful calculations. But early every company in the field seems to have a different vision of how best to get there. Almost all of their plans share a key feature: some variation on logical qubits built by linking together multiple hardware qubits.</p>
<p>A key exception is <a href="https://nordquantique.ca/en">Nord Quantique</a>, which aims to dramatically cut the amount of hardware needed to support an error-corrected quantum computer. It does this by putting enough quantum states into a single piece of hardware, allowing each of those pieces to hold an error-corrected qubit. Last week, the company shared results showing that it could make hardware that used photons at two different frequencies to successfully identify every case where a logical qubit lost its state.</p>
<p>That still doesn't provide error correction, and they didn't use the logical qubit to perform operations. But it's an important validation of the company's approach.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/startup-puts-a-logical-qubit-in-a-single-piece-of-hardware/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, Republicans in Congress and the executive branch stepped up their efforts to roll back clean vehicle legislation and regulations. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/heres-the-trump-admins-pathetic-new-fuel-efficiency-rule-for-2026/">Antipathy toward environmental protections</a> was a hallmark of the first Trump administration, but in his second term, the president and his congressional allies are redoubling their efforts to allow cars to pollute more and limit the adoption of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Congressional republicans have been working on a budget bill that would radically transform many aspects of American life. Among the environmental protections being stripped away in the "<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1">One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a>" (yes, that's what it's called) is a repeal of the US Environmental Protection Agency's rules on "greenhouse gas and multi-pollutant emissions standards."</p>
<p>These regulations are meant to limit the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the US vehicle fleet, a major driver of climate change, as well as the noxious pollutants containing sulfur and nitrogen compounds that have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/05/excess-diesel-vehicle-emissions-killed-38000-people-in-2015-study-estimates/">more immediate and deleterious effects</a> on human health. And if the budget bill is sent to Trump to sign, the existing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, implemented in 2022, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/new-epa-doe-fuel-regs-give-automakers-longer-to-reduce-co2-emissions/">the future rules meant to take effect next year</a> will be no more.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/gop-intensifies-war-against-evs-and-efficient-cars/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/">statement</a>, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap explained that the court order came in a lawsuit with The New York Times and other news organizations, which alleged that deleted chats may contain evidence of users prompting ChatGPT to generate copyrighted news articles.</p>
<p>To comply with the order, OpenAI must "retain all user content indefinitely going forward, based on speculation" that the news plaintiffs "might find something that supports their case," OpenAI's statement alleged.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-confronts-user-panic-over-court-ordered-retention-of-chatgpt-logs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As the Trump administration prepared to cancel contracts at the Department of Veterans Affairs this year, officials turned to a software engineer with no health care or government experience to guide them.</p>
<p>The engineer, working for the Department of Government Efficiency, quickly built an artificial intelligence tool to identify which services from private companies were not essential. He labeled those contracts “MUNCHABLE.”</p>
<p>The code, using outdated and inexpensive AI models, produced results with glaring mistakes. For instance, it hallucinated the size of contracts, frequently misreading them and inflating their value. It concluded more than a thousand were each worth $34 million, when in fact some were for as little as $35,000.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/doge-used-flawed-ai-tool-to-munch-veterans-affairs-contracts/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As you might imagine, a steady stream of cars to review comes and goes from my parking spot. Some weeks, they stand out, like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-aston-martin-vantage-great-but-frustrating/">bright green Aston Martin</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-bentley-continental-gt-the-highs-and-lows-of-borrowed-bits/">murdered-out Bentley</a>, or the VW ID. Buzz you can read about soon; these cars usually spark conversations with neighbors, particularly those who don't know why there's a different vehicle in that spot each week.</p>
<p>At other times, the vehicles are more anonymous, and I'm not sure this ADX sparked any community discussions. Compact crossovers are a popular breed and blend into the background—particularly when they're painted an unobtrusive shade.</p>
<p>Which is not to say the ADX is not handsome; the Urban Gray Pearl paint looked good even in the near-constant rain (which explains the Acura-supplied images rather than my own) that coincided with our time with the tester. And from the driver's seat, the view down the hood, along those creases, is a lot more interesting than most comparable crossovers, considering the ADX's $35,000 starting price.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/2025-acura-adx-review-a-crossover-that-balances-budget-with-vigor/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.47 of the Rocket Report! Let's hope not, but the quarrel between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk may be remembered as "Black Thursday" for the US space program. A simmering disagreement over Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill" coursing its way through Congress erupted into public view, with two of the most powerful Americans trading insults and threats on social media. Trump suggested the government should terminate "Elon's governmental contracts and subsidies." Musk responded with a post saying SpaceX will begin decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft used to transport crew and cargo to the International Space Station. This could go a number of ways, but it's hard to think anything good will come of it.</p>

<p><b>Blue Origin aces suborbital space shot. </b>Blue Origin, the space company founded and owned by Jeff Bezos, launched six people to the edge of space Saturday, May 31, from Bezos' ranch in West Texas, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blue-origin-launches-six-passengers-on-sub-orbital-trip-to-the-edge-of-space/">CBS News reports</a>. A hydrogen-fueled New Shepard booster propelled a crew capsule, equipped with the largest windows of any operational spaceship, to an altitude of nearly 65 miles (105 kilometers), just above the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space, before beginning the descent to landing. The passengers included three Americans—Aymette Medina Jorge, Gretchen Green, and Paul Jeris—along with Canadian Jesse Williams, New Zealand's Mark Rocket, and Panamanian Jaime Alemán, who served as his country's ambassador to the United States.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/rocket-report-spacexs-500th-falcon-launch-why-did-uks-reaction-engines-fail/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google wasn't around for the advent of the World Wide Web, but it successfully remade the web on its own terms. Today, any website that wants to be findable has to play by Google's rules, and after years of search dominance, the company has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">lost a major antitrust case</a> that could reshape both it and the web.</p>
<p>The closing arguments in the case <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-and-doj-tussle-over-how-ai-will-remake-the-web-in-antitrust-closing-arguments/">just wrapped up last week</a>, and Google could be facing serious consequences when the ruling comes down in August. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">Losing Chrome</a> would certainly change things for Google, but the Department of Justice is pursuing other remedies that could have even more lasting impacts. During his testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai seemed genuinely alarmed at the prospect of being forced to license Google's search index and algorithm, the so-called data remedies in the case. He claimed this would be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/sundar-pichai-says-doj-demands-are-a-de-facto-spin-off-of-google-search/">no better than a spinoff of Google Search</a>.
