                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[
<p>If you've ever fallen down <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/fokmsp/stuck_in_quarantine_heres_a_list_of_wikipedia/">a Wikipedia rabbit hole</a> or spent a pleasant evening digging through college library stacks, you know the joy of a good research puzzle. Every new source and cross-reference you find unlocks an incremental understanding of a previously unknown world, forming a piecemeal tapestry of knowledge that you can eventually look back at as a cohesive and well-known whole.</p>
<p><em>TR-49</em> takes this research process and operationalizes it into an engrossing and novel piece of heavily non-linear interactive fiction. Researching the myriad sources contained in the game's mysterious computer slowly reveals a tale that's part mystery, part sci-fi allegory, part family drama, and all-compelling alternate academic history.</p>
<h2>Steampunk Wikipedia</h2>
<p>The entirety of <em>TR-49</em> takes place from a first-person perspective as you sit in front of a kind of Steampunk-infused computer terminal. An unseen narrator asks you to operate the machine but is initially cagey about how or why or what you're even looking for. There's a creepy vibe to the under-explained circumstances that brought you to this situation, but the game never descends into the jump scares or horror tropes of so many other modern titles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/tr-49-is-interactive-fiction-for-fans-of-deep-research-rabbit-holes/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Intel reported <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1759/intel-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial">its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2025 yesterday</a>, and the news both for the quarter and for the year was mixed: year-over-year revenue was down nearly imperceptibly, from $53.1 billion to $52.9 billion, while revenue for the quarter was down about four percent, from $14.3 billion last year to $13.7 billion this year. (That number was, nevertheless, on the high end of Intel's guidance for the quarter, which ranged from $12.8 to $13.8 billion.)</p>
<p>Diving deeper into the numbers makes it clear exactly where money is being made and lost: Intel's data center and AI products were up 9 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the year, while its client computing group (which sells Core processors, Arc GPUs, and other consumer products) was down 7 percent for the quarter and 3 percent for the year.</p>
<p>That knowledge makes it slightly easier to understand the bind that company executives talked about on Intel's earnings call (<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-intel-beats-q4-2025-eps-forecast-stock-steady-93CH-4461706">as transcribed by Investing.com</a>). In short, Intel is having trouble making (and buying) enough chips to meet demand, and it makes more sense to allocate the chips it <em>can</em> make to the divisions that are actually making money—which means that we could see shortages of or higher prices for consumer processors, just as Intel is gearing up to launch the promising Core Ultra Series 3 processors (codenamed Panther Lake).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/core-ultra-series-3-launch-may-be-hampered-by-chip-shortages-says-intel/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has backed down from a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-user-fights-dhs-for-the-right-to-post-ice-sightings-anonymously/">fight to unmask the owners of Instagram and Facebook accounts</a> monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>One of the anonymous account holders, John Doe, sued to block ICE from identifying him and other critics online through summonses to Meta that he claimed infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity.</p>
<p>DHS initially fought Doe's motion to quash the summonses, arguing that the community watch groups endangered ICE agents by posting "pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things." This was akin to "threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties," DHS alleged. DHS's arguments echoed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has claimed that identifying ICE agents is a crime, even though <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agents-are-doxing-themselves/">Wired noted</a> that ICE employees often post easily discoverable LinkedIn profiles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-ice-critic-wins-fight-to-stay-anonymous-as-dhs-backs-down/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/double-screen-free-tv-will-show-you-ads-even-when-not-in-use/">Telly</a>, a company that accepts advertising data instead of cash for its TVs, has reportedly had a hard time getting its “free” TVs into people’s homes.</p>
<p>Telly debuted in May 2023. Its dual-screen design can show ads, even when people aren't watching. Although the smaller, secondary screen can be used for more helpful applications, like showing the weather or sports scores, its primary purpose is to serve as a billboard south of the 55-inch primary display. Owners cannot disable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/double-screen-free-tv-will-show-you-ads-even-when-not-in-use/">tracking</a> or cover up the secondary screen (or they have to pay for the TV, which Telly claims is worth $1,000), and they must fill out a lengthy, detailed survey to get one.</p>
<p>When it debuted its TV, Telly said it expected to ship 500,000 devices that summer. In June 2023, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/telly-free-smart-tv-250000-sign-ups/">said</a> 250,000 people signed up to get a Telly. In a 2024 <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230713586665/en/Tellys-Free-55-4K-Dual-Screen-TVs-Begin-Shipping-to-Consumers">press release</a>, Telly said that it planned to ship “millions more in 2024.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/tellys-free-ad-based-tvs-make-notable-revenue-when-theyre-actually-delivered/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/announcement-from-the-new-tiktok-usds-joint-venture-llc">press release</a> Thursday, TikTok announced the "TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC," an entity established to keep TikTok operating in the US.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Love it or hate it, Tesla has been responsible for helping to shape the tastes of automotive consumers over the past decade-plus. Over-the-air updates that add more features, an all-touchscreen human-machine interface, large castings, and hands-free driver assists were all introduced or popularized by Tesla's electric vehicles, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/ford-rethinks-ev-strategy-is-working-on-a-smaller-cheaper-ev-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompting other automakers to copy them</a>, mostly in the hopes of seeing the same stratospheric gains in their stock prices. But starting on Valentine's Day, if you want your Tesla to steer itself, you'll have to pay a $99 monthly subscription fee.</p>
<p>Tesla currently offers a pair of so-called "level 2" partially automated driver assist systems. Autopilot is the older of these, combining Tesla's adaptive cruise control (Tesla calls this TACC) and lane-keeping assist (Tesla calls this Autosteer). <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/feds-give-tesla-another-five-weeks-to-respond-to-fsd-probe/">FSD is the newer system</a>, meant to be more capable and for use on surface streets and divided-lane highways. Although the company and Tesla CEO Elon Musk regularly tout these systems' capabilities, both still require the human driver to provide situational awareness.</p>
<p>But Autopilot has been under fire from regulators and the courts. Multiple wrongful death lawsuits are in the works, and after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/tesla-loses-autopilot-wrongful-death-case-in-329-million-verdict/">a high-profile loss resulting in a $329 million judgment</a> against Tesla, expect many of these suits to be settled. Both the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/teslas-autopilot-is-the-subject-of-a-federal-criminal-investigation/">federal government</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/tesla-fights-autopilot-false-advertising-claim-with-free-speech-argument/">California</a> have investigated whether Tesla misled customers, and in December, an administrative law judge <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/16/california-judge-says-tesla-engaged-in-deceptive-autopilot-marketing-.html">ruled that Tesla indeed engaged in deceptive marketing</a> by implying that its cars could drive themselves. The judge suspended Tesla's license to sell cars in California, a decision that the California Department of Motor Vehicles stayed for 60 days.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/tesla-wants-recurring-revenue-discontinues-autopilot-in-favor-of-fsd/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.26 of the Rocket Report! The past week has been one of advancements and setbacks in the rocket business. NASA rolled the massive rocket for the Artemis II mission to its launch pad in Florida, while Chinese launchers suffered back-to-back failures within a span of approximately 12 hours. Rocket Lab's march toward a debut of its new Neutron launch vehicle in the coming months may have stalled after a failure during a key qualification test. We cover all this and more in this week's Rocket Report.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every spring, raptors return to nesting sites across northern Michigan. The smallest of these birds of prey, a falcon called the American kestrel (<em>Falco sparverius</em>), flies through the region’s many cherry orchards and spends its days hunting for even tinier creatures to eat. This quest keeps the kestrels fed, but it also benefits the region’s cherry farmers.</p>
<p>Fruit farmers have been working symbiotically with kestrels for decades, adding nesting boxes and reaping the benefits of the birds eliminating the mice, voles, songbirds, and other pests that wreak havoc by feeding on not-yet-harvested crops. In addition to limiting the crop damage caused by hungry critters, new research suggests kestrels also lower the risk of food-borne illnesses.</p>
<p>The study, published in November in the <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.70209">Journal of Applied Ecology</a>, suggests the kestrels help keep harmful pathogens off of fruit headed to consumers by eating and scaring off small birds that carry those pathogens. Orchards housing the birds in nest boxes saw fewer cherry-eating birds than orchards without kestrels on site. This translated to an 81 percent reduction in crop damage—such as bite marks or missing fruit—and a 66 percent decrease in branches contaminated with bird feces.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/tiny-falcons-are-helping-keep-the-food-supply-safe-on-cherry-farms/">Read full article</a></p>

A lack of funding paused everything until late 2018, when Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/lucid-motors-raises-1-billion-to-build-all-electric-cars-in-arizona/">bought itself a stake</a>. A billion dollars meant Lucid could build a factory—at the cost of alienating some former fans because of the source.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic happened, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/please-dont-describe-us-as-a-tesla-killer-ars-talks-to-lucid-motors/">further pushing back timelines</a> as supply shortages took hold. But the Air did go on sale, and it has more recently been joined by the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2024/12/the-2025-lucid-gravity-impresses-us-with-slick-handling-magic-ride/">Gravity SUV</a>. There's even a much more affordable midsize SUV in the works called the Earth. Sales more than doubled in 2025, and after spending a week with a model year 2026 Lucid Air Touring, I can understand why.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/01/2026-lucid-air-touring-review-this-feels-like-a-complete-car-now/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On a tiny island just off the coast of Sulawesi (a much larger island in Indonesia), a cave wall bears the stenciled outline of a person’s hand—and it’s at least 67,800 years old, according to a recent study. The hand stencil is now the world’s oldest work of art (at least until archaeologists find something even older), as well as the oldest evidence of our species on any of the islands that stretch between continental Asia and Australia.</p>

<h2>Hands reaching out from the past</h2>
<p>Archaeologist Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency, and his colleagues have spent the last six years surveying 44 rock art sites, mostly caves, on Sulawesi’s southeastern peninsula and the handful of tiny “satellite islands” off its coast. They found 14 previously undocumented sites and used rock formations to date 11 individual pieces of rock art in eight caves—including the oldest human artwork discovered so far.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/this-67800-year-old-hand-stencil-is-the-worlds-oldest-human-made-art/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As of today, the US is no longer a member of the World Health Organization—and it leaves the United Nations health agency with hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/21/trump-withdrawal-world-health-organization-leaves-unpaid-bills-behind/">reporting by Stat News</a>.</p>
<p>A year ago today, the US <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-orders-us-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/">informed the WHO</a> of its intent to exit, setting the clock for a one-year withdrawal period mandated in a 1948 joint resolution of Congress. But, in practice, the withdrawal was immediate, with the Trump administration cutting all ties with WHO upon the announcement. In explaining his reasoning for leaving the WHO, Trump referenced his long-standing complaints about the agency’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, dues payments, and alleged protection of China. Trump had attempted to extract the US from WHO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/trump-officially-takes-us-out-of-who-but-withdrawal-is-a-year-long-process/">during his first term</a>, but the Biden administration rescinded the withdrawal on the first day in office, well before the one-year notice period was reached.</p>
<p>The joint resolution also stipulated that the US would have to pay its financial obligations in full before departing. But, that too has not been honored by the Trump administration. According to Stat, the US owed the WHO $278 million in dues, which are a percentage of each member state’s gross domestic product. That dues payment covered the country's 2024–2025 membership, as WHO runs on a two-year budget cycle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/us-stiffs-who-hundreds-of-millions-as-it-officially-withdrawals/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“We are just a small single open source project with a small number of active maintainers,” Daniel Stenberg, the founder and lead developer of the open source app cURL, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/20312">said Thursday</a>. “It is not in our power to change how all these people and their slop machines work. We need to make moves to ensure our survival and intact mental health.”</p>
<h2>Manufacturing bogus bugs</h2>
<p>His comments came as cURL users complained that the move was treating the symptoms caused by AI slop without addressing the cause. The users said they were concerned the move would eliminate a key means for ensuring and maintaining the security of the tool. Stenberg largely agreed, but indicated his team had little choice.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/overrun-with-ai-slop-curl-scraps-bug-bounties-to-ensure-intact-mental-health/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin">with tech publication The Information.</a></p>
<p>The product is said to be "the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker," and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple's solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.</p>
<p>The Information's sources don't specify whether that's the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/01/report-apple-plans-to-launch-ai-powered-wearable-pin-device-as-soon-as-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that students worldwide use AI chatbots to do their homework and avoid learning things. On the flip side, students can also use AI as a tool to beef up their knowledge and plan for the future with flashcards or study guides. Google hopes its latest Gemini feature will help with the latter. The company has <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/education/practice-sat-gemini/">announced</a> that Gemini can now create free SAT practice tests and coach students to help them get higher scores.</p>
<p>As a standardized test, the content of the SAT follows a predictable pattern. So there's no need to use a lengthy, personalized prompt to get Gemini going. Just say something like, "I want to take a practice SAT test," and the chatbot will generate one complete with clickable buttons, graphs, and score analysis.</p>
<p>Of course, generative AI can go off the rails and provide incorrect information, which is a problem when you're trying to learn things. However, Google says it has worked with education firms like The Princeton Review to ensure the AI-generated tests resemble what students will see in the real deal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-begins-offering-free-sat-practice-tests-powered-by-gemini/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmEx7wQI6RY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Ars readers of a certain age no doubt remember the 1980s <em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</em> series (and its spinoff, <em>She-Ra: Princess of Powers</em>) and the many, many offshoots of this hugely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe">popular Mattel franchise</a>, including an extensive line of action figures. Amazon MGM Studios no doubt hopes to cash in on any lingering nostalgia with its forthcoming film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe_(2026_film)"><em>Masters of the Universe.</em></a> Judging by the extended teaser trailer, we're getting an origin story for He-Man.</p>
<p>It's not the first time someone has turned He-Man into a feature film: Dolph Lundgren starred in 1987's <em>Masters of the Universe</em>, a critical and box office bomb that also featured Frank Langella as arch-villain Skeletor. Its poor reception might have stemmed from the 1987 film deviating significantly from the original cartoon, angering fans. But frankly, it was just a bad, cheesy movie, though it still has its share of cult fans today.</p>
<p>This latest big-screen live-action adaptation has been languishing in development hell for nearly two decades. There were rumors in 2007 that John Woo would direct a He-Man feature for Warner Bros., but the project never got the green light. Sony Pictures gained the rights in 2009, and there were multiple script rewrites and much shuffling of possible directors (with John Chu, McG, and David S. Goyer among the candidates).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/check-out-the-first-trailer-for-masters-of-the-universe/">Read full article</a></p>

After adding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/gemini-can-now-scan-your-photos-email-and-more-to-provide-better-answers/">account-level personalization</a> to Gemini earlier this month, it's now updating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/">AI Mode</a> with so-called "Personal Intelligence." According to Google, this makes the bot's answers more useful because they are tailored to your personal context.</p>
<p>Starting today, the feature is rolling out to all users who subscribe to Google AI Pro or AI Ultra. However, it will be a <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/22">Labs feature</a> that needs to be explicitly enabled (subscribers will be prompted to do this). Google tends to expand access to new AI features to free accounts later on, so free users will most likely get access to Personal Intelligence in the future. Whenever this option does land on your account, it's entirely optional and can be disabled at any time.</p>
<p>If you decide to integrate your data with AI Mode, the search bot will be able to scan your Gmail and Google Photos. That's less extensive than the Gemini app version, which supports Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history. Gmail will probably be the biggest contributor to AI Mode—a great many life events involve confirmation emails. Traditional search results when you are logged in are adjusted based on your usage history, but this goes a step further.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-ai-mode-can-now-customize-responses-with-your-email-and-photos/">Read full article</a></p>
