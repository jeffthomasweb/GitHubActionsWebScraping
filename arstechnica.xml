                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://westinghousenuclear.com/">Westinghouse</a> announced that it had reached an agreement with the Trump administration that would purportedly see $80 billion of new nuclear reactors built in the US. And the government indicated that it had finalized plans for a collaboration of GE Vernova and Hitachi to build additional reactors. Unfortunately, there are roughly zero details about the deal at the moment.</p>
<p>The agreements were apparently negotiated during President Trump’s trip to Japan. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/28195/">An announcement</a> of those agreements indicates that “Japan and various Japanese companies” would invest “up to” $332 billion for energy infrastructure. This specifically mentioned Westinghouse, GE Vernova, and Hitachi. This promises the construction of both large AP1000 reactors and small modular nuclear reactors. The announcement then goes on to indicate that many other companies would also get a slice of that “up to $332 billion,” many for basic grid infrastructure.</p>
<p>So the total amount devoted to nuclear reactors is not specified in the announcement or anywhere else. As of the publication time, the Department of Energy has no information on the deal; Hitachi, GE Vernova, and the Hitachi/GE Vernova collaboration websites are also silent on it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/westinghouse-is-claiming-a-nuclear-deal-would-see-80b-of-new-reactors/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While the underlying cause or causes of autism spectrum disorder remain elusive and appear likely to be a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, President Trump and his anti-vaccine health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—neither of whom have any scientific or medical background whatsoever—have decided to pin the blame on Tylenol, a common pain reliever and fever reducer that has no proven link to autism.</p>
<p>And now, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-paxton-sues-big-pharma-manufacturers-deceptively-marketing-tylenol-pregnant-mothers">is suing the maker of Tylenol</a>, Kenvue and Johnson &amp; Johnson, who previously sold Tylenol, claiming that they have been “deceptively marketing Tylenol” knowing that it “leads to a significantly increased risk of autism and other disorders.”</p>
<p>To back that claim, Paxton relies on the “considerable body of evidence… recently highlighted by the Trump Administration.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/if-things-in-america-werent-stupid-enough-texas-is-suing-tylenol-maker/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to be a CEO in 2025 and not catch a case of AI fever? The latest company to catch this particular cold is Lucid, the Saudi-backed electric vehicle startup. Today, it announced a new collaboration with Nvidia to use the latter’s hardware and software, with the aim of creating an autonomous vehicle for consumers. Oh, and the AI will apparently design Lucid’s production lines.</p>
<p>Formed by refugees from Tesla who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/please-dont-describe-us-as-a-tesla-killer-ars-talks-to-lucid-motors/">saw a chance to improve</a> on their past work, Lucid has already built <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-2025-lucid-air-is-now-the-most-efficient-ev-on-sale/">the most efficient EV</a> on sale in North America. But until recently, it also just had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-lucid-air-pure-review-lower-weight-better-steering-amazing-efficiency/">variants</a> of the same <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/the-lucid-air-grand-touring-is-a-startups-take-on-a-great-luxury-ev/">Air sedan</a> to offer consumers, before the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2024/12/the-2025-lucid-gravity-impresses-us-with-slick-handling-magic-ride/">Gravity SUV</a> joined the range this year.</p>
<p>The company will need to start selling tens of thousands of EVs a year before too long, especially if it’s ever to become profitable. And that will involve some smaller, cheaper models, starting with a midsize crossover sometime in 2027. A major goal for the first of those EVs is <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/lucid-believes-2027-lucid-earth-will-be-smarter-cheaper-than-rivals">a starting price of less than $50,000</a>, so I hope they’re getting a good deal on the Nvidia GPUs that Lucid now says will enable a “true eyes-off, hands-off, and mind-off” autonomous driving system for consumer-owned vehicles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/an-autonomous-car-for-consumers-lucid-says-its-happening/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US will weigh a ban on children’s access to companion bots, as two senators announced bipartisan legislation Tuesday that would criminalize making chatbots that encourage harms like suicidal ideation or engage kids in sexually explicit chats.</p>
<p>At a press conference, Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the GUARD Act, joined by grieving parents holding up photos of their children lost after engaging with chatbots.</p>
<p>If passed, the law would require chatbot makers to check IDs or use “any other commercially reasonable method” to accurately assess if a user is a minor who must be blocked. Companion bots would also have to repeatedly remind users of all ages that they aren’t real humans or trusted professionals.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/senators-move-to-keep-big-techs-creepy-companion-bots-away-from-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An AI language model like the kind that powers ChatGPT is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-personhood-trap-how-ai-fakes-human-personality/">gigantic statistical web</a> of data relationships. You give it a prompt (such as a question), and it provides a response that is statistically related and hopefully helpful. At first, ChatGPT was a tech amusement, but now hundreds of millions of people are relying on this statistical process to guide them through life’s challenges. It’s the first time in history that large numbers of people have begun to confide their feelings to a talking machine, and mitigating the potential harm the systems can cause has been an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/strengthening-chatgpt-responses-in-sensitive-conversations/">released data</a> estimating that 0.15 percent of ChatGPT’s active users in a given week have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent. It’s a tiny fraction of the overall user base, but with more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to over a million people each week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/28/openai-says-over-a-million-people-talk-to-chatgpt-about-suicide-weekly/">reports TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI also estimates that a similar percentage of users show heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT, and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the chatbot.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-data-suggests-1-million-users-discuss-suicide-with-chatgpt-weekly/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After kicking off an unpopular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/samsung-forces-ads-onto-fridges-is-a-bad-sign-for-other-appliances/">pilot test last month,</a> Samsung made the practice of having its expensive smart fridges display ads official this week.</p>
<p>The ads will be shown on Samsung’s 2024 Family Hub smart fridges. As of this writing, Samsung’s Family Hub fridges have MSRPs ranging from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/all-refrigerators/?shop=Buy+Online&amp;key_category_features=Family+Hub%C3%A2%C2%84%C2%A2&amp;CID=afl-ecomm-rkt-cha-040122-url_Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_source=url_Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=1&amp;utm_content=2116208&amp;rktevent=Skimlinks.com_TnL5HPStwNw-XmUXqH629_Fatbxjry_5NQ&amp;ranMID=47773&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-XmUXqH629_Fatbxjry_5NQ">$1,899 to $3,499</a>. The ads will arrive through a software update that Samsung will start issuing this month and display on the fridge’s integrated 21.5- or 32-inch (depending on the model) screen. The ads will show when the fridges are idle and display what Samsung calls Cover Screens.</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of the Family Hub software update, we are piloting a new widget for select Cover Screens themes of Family Hub refrigerators. The widget will display useful day-to-day information such as news, calendar and weather forecasts, along with curated advertisements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samsung also said that its fridges will only show contextualized ads, instead of personalized ads, which rely on collecting data on users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/samsung-makes-ads-on-3499-smart-fridges-official-with-upcoming-software-update/">Read full article</a></p>

The grant would have been the largest in the organization’s history.</p>
<p>Hoping to “address structural vulnerabilities in Python and PyPI,” the foundation submitted a grant proposal in January 2025 to the National Science Foundation’s Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open Source Ecosystems <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems">program</a>. After a “multi-round proposal writing process” and a “months-long vetting process,” it appeared the foundation was close to obtaining a two-year grant worth $1.5 million.</p>
<p>But what at first seemed like good news quickly turned sour due to rules against Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs, the foundation said:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/python-foundation-rejects-1-5-million-grant-over-trump-admins-anti-dei-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, Slate Auto emerged from stealth mode and stunned industry watchers with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/amazon-backed-startup-wants-to-sell-a-bare-bones-ev-truck-for-20000/">the Slate Truck</a>, a compact electric pickup it plans to sell for less than $30,000. Achieving that price won’t be easy, but Slate really does look to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/slate-autos-sub-30000-ev-pickup-is-due-next-year-heres-the-factory/">doing things differently from the rest of the industry</a>—even Tesla. For example, the truck will be made from just 600 parts, with no paint or even an infotainment system, to keep costs down.</p>
<p>An unanswered question until now has been “where do I take it to be fixed if it breaks?” Today, we have an answer. Slate is partnering with RepairPal to use the latter’s network of more than 4,000 locations across the US.</p>
<p>“Slate’s OEM partnership with RepairPal’s nationwide network of service centers will give Slate customers peace of mind while empowering independent service shops to provide accessorization and service,” said Slate chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/slate-auto-announces-repair-network-access-to-superchargers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As newer, more efficient silicon manufacturing processes have gotten more expensive and difficult to develop, chipmakers like Intel and AMD have repeatedly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/intel-accuses-amd-of-selling-old-cpus-with-new-model-numbers-which-intel-also-does/">rebranded some of their older processors</a> with new model numbers. This has allowed both companies to release “new” products that aren’t actually new at all, muddying the waters for people trying to buy lower-end and midrange laptops.</p>
<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-rebrands-ryzen-7035-7020-series-mobile-processors-zen-2-and-zen-3-chips-receive-new-identities">by Tom’s Hardware</a>, AMD has quietly rebranded a swath of its Ryzen laptop chips with new model numbers without changing the silicon. The rebranded processors use either Rembrandt-R silicon with Zen 3+ CPU cores and RDNA 2 graphics cores or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/amds-first-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpu-is-a-mix-of-old-and-new-for-midrange-laptops/">Mendocino silicon</a> with Zen 2 CPU cores and RDNA 2 graphics cores. Both of these architectures first launched in 2022, but Mendocino’s Zen 2 CPU architecture dates all the way back to 2019. During the company’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/amd-is-making-laptop-cpu-model-numbers-simultaneously-less-and-more-confusing/">model number decoder ring era</a>, these designs had been sold as Ryzen 7035- and Ryzen 7020-series chips, respectively.</p>
<p>This is actually AMD’s second rebranding for the Rembrandt-R silicon, which was launched as the Ryzen 6000 series in 2022. These chips will compete most directly with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/236798/intel-core-processors-series-1.html">Intel’s non-Ultra Core 100 series processors</a>, most of which use 2022-vintage Raptor Lake silicon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/amd-shores-up-its-budget-laptop-cpus-by-renaming-more-years-old-silicon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Microsoft and OpenAI <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/">announced</a> a revised partnership agreement that introduces an independent expert panel to verify when OpenAI achieves so-called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI), a determination that will trigger major shifts in how the companies share technology and revenue. The deal values Microsoft’s stake in OpenAI at approximately $135 billion and extends the exclusive partnership through 2032 while giving both companies more freedom to pursue AGI independently.</p>
<p>The partnership began in 2019 when Microsoft <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-investing-1b-in-openai-artificial-general-intelligence-rd/">invested</a> $1 billion in OpenAI. Since then, Microsoft has provided billions in cloud computing resources through Azure and used OpenAI’s models as the basis of products like Copilot. The new agreement maintains Microsoft as OpenAI’s frontier model partner and preserves Microsoft’s exclusive rights to OpenAI’s IP and Azure API exclusivity until the threshold of AGI is reached.</p>
<p>Under a previous arrangement, OpenAI alone would determine when it achieved AGI, which is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">nebulous concept</a> that is difficult to define. The revised deal requires an independent expert panel to verify that claim, a change that adds oversight to a determination with billions of dollars at stake. When the panel confirms that AGI has been reached, Microsoft’s intellectual property rights to OpenAI’s research methods will expire, and the revenue-sharing arrangement between the companies will end, though payments will continue over a longer period.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/10/expert-panel-will-determine-agi-arrival-in-new-microsoft-openai-agreement/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the California Supreme Court ordered the University of California system to release the details of a proposed deal from the federal government that would restore research grants that were suspended by the Trump administration. The proposed deal, first issued in August, had remained confidential as a suit filed by faculty at UCLA made its way through appeals. With California’s top court now weighing in, the university administrators have <a href="https://ucop.edu/communications/_files/confidential-rule-408-communication-ucla-08-08-25.pdf?fbclid=IwY2xjawNo-j9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHsaKQockany3Kq3H1NcDcqBDPkU6FwxMnD_PKI7wuMOPuCQbUne4QdX0obD8_aem_jRIpWWmFPzU8Plci6V9YMg">released the document</a>, still marked “draft” and “confidential attorney work product.”</p>
<p>Most of the demands will seem unsurprising to those familiar with the Trump administration’s interest: an end to all diversity programs and those supporting transgender individuals, plus a sharp crackdown on campus protests. The eye-opening portion comes at the price tag of nearly $1.2 billion paid out, with UCLA covering all the costs of compliance. And, as written, the deal wouldn’t stop the Trump administration from cutting the grants for other reasons or imposing more intrusive regulations, such as those mentioned in its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">university compact</a>.</p>
<h2>Familiar concerns</h2>
<p>In many ways, the proposed deal is much more focused than the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/harvard-says-feds-research-funding-demands-amount-to-a-takeover/">odd list of demands</a> the administration sent Harvard University earlier this year, in that it targets issues that the administration has focused on repeatedly. These include an end to all diversity programs at both the faculty and student levels. It demands that UCLA agree to “remove explicit or implicit goals for compositional diversity based on race, sex, or ethnicity, including eliminating any secretive or proxy-based ‘diversity’ hiring processes.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trumps-ucla-deal-pay-us-1b-and-we-can-still-cut-your-grants-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Porsche provided flights from Albany, New York, to Malaga, Spain, and accommodation so Ars could drive the 911 Turbo S. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Turbochargers have been injecting more power into engines for over 100 years, but never before have they been so prevalent in our cars. A little boost can add a lot of power and efficiency, too, making a turbocharger a great solution to eke maximum performance out of today’s engines. Usually, though, that comes with the penalty of throttle lag: You put your foot to the floor, and nothing much happens for a beat or two.</p>
<p>As we’ve recently seen in our review of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/porsches-best-daily-driver-911-the-2025-carrera-gts-t-hybrid-review/">new 911 GTS</a>, Porsche’s engineers have worked some magic to create a turbocharger that provides all the power and fun of forced induction but with none of the throttle response penalty. If adding one high-tech, high-voltage turbocharger is good, surely two would be better, right? Indeed, it is, if you can afford the cost of entry. Meet the 701 hp (523 kW) 2026 911 Turbo S, Porsche’s new most powerful 911 ever.</p>
<h2>Twinning the T-Hybrid</h2>
<p>For Porsche’s first hybrid 911, the GTS, the company didn’t simply add an electric motor and bigger battery into the mix and call it a day. It also inserted another high-speed motor into the turbocharger, enabling it to spin up to maximum speed in less than a second, nearly eliminating turbo lag.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/porsches-2026-911-turbo-s-is-a-ballistic-twin-turbo-701-horsepower-monster/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since last year’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">disastrous rollout of Google’s AI Overviews</a>, the world at large has been aware of how AI-powered search results can differ wildly from the traditional list of links search engines have generated for decades. Now, new research helps quantify that difference, showing that AI search engines tend to cite less popular websites and ones that wouldn’t even appear in the Top 100 links listed in an “organic” Google search.</p>
<p>In the pre-print paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2510.11560v1">Characterizing Web Search in The Age of Generative AI</a>,” researchers from Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, and the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems compared traditional link results from Google’s search engine to its AI Overviews and <a href="https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/">Gemini-2.5-Flash</a>. The researchers also looked at GPT-4o’s web search mode and the separate “GPT-4o with Search Tool,” which resorts to searching the web only when the LLM decides it needs information found outside its own pre-trained data.</p>
<p>The researchers drew test queries from a number of sources, including specific questions submitted to ChatGPT in <a href="https://wildchat.allen.ai/">the WildChat dataset</a>, general political topics <a href="https://www.allsides.com/topics-issues">listed on AllSides</a>, and products included in the 100 most-searched Amazon products list.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-powered-search-engines-rely-on-less-popular-sources-researchers-find/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media/newsroom/press/att-violates-procedures">said</a> Friday that AT&amp;T “violated Section 2.1(I) of the National Advertising Division (NAD)/National Advertising Review Board (NARB) Procedures for the US advertising industry’s process of self-regulation by issuing a video advertisement and press release that use the NAD process and its findings for promotional purposes. NAD has demanded that AT&amp;T immediately remove such violative promotional materials and cease all future dissemination.”</p>
<p>The NAD said that AT&amp;T’s action threatens the “integrity and success of the self-regulatory forum,” and “undermines NAD’s mission to promote truth and accuracy of advertising claims and foster consumer trust in the marketplace.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/att-ad-congratulating-itself-for-its-ethics-violated-an-ad-industry-rule/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>With the milestone just days away, you are likely to hear this week that there has now been a continuous human presence on the International Space Station (ISS) for the past 25 years. But what does that quarter of a century actually encompass?</p>
<p>If only there was a way to see, hear, and experience <a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-102725a-iss-in-real-time-25-years-continuous-human-occupancy-space-station.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">each of those 9,131 days</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the astronauts and cosmonauts on the space station have devoted some of their work time and a lot of their free time to taking photos, filming videos, and calling down to Earth. Much of that data has been made available to the public, but in separate repositories, with no real way to correlate or connect it with the timeline on which it was all created.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/25-years-one-website-iss-in-real-time-captures-quarter-century-on-space-station/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Mexico City is one of the more unusual places that Formula 1 races, and it’s all thanks to altitude. The city sits at than 7,350 feet (2,240 m) above sea level, which makes the air noticeably thin compared to the average Grand Prix held at sea level. Like humans, F1 cars need air.</p>
<p>Oxygen is necessary if you want any internal combustion to happen inside the turbocharged 1.6 L V6 engine. A good flow of air across the various radiators and heat exchangers in the car is vital if you want to make it to the end of the race. And the downforce-generating wings and underbody only generate downforce by creating differences in air pressure above and below the car.</p>
<p>At over a mile above sea level, there’s about 20 percent less air, and therefore less power created by combustion, less efficient cooling of the cars, and less downforce able to be generated.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/f1-in-mexico-city-we-have-a-new-championship-leader/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>A zebra’s distinctive black-and-white stripes, or a leopard’s spots, are both examples of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern">Turing patterns</a>,” after mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, who proposed an intriguing hypothetical mechanism for how such complex, irregular patterns might emerge in nature. But Turing’s original proposal proved too simplified to fully re-create those natural patterns. Scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) have devised a new modeling approach that achieves much more accurate final patterns by introducing deliberate imperfections, according to a new paper published in the journal Matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/01/clustering-pattern-of-azteca-ant-colonies-may-be-due-to-a-turing-mechanism/">Turing focused on chemicals</a> known as morphogens in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis">seminal 1952 paper</a>. He devised <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/turing-patterns/4991.article">a mechanism</a> involving the interaction between an activator chemical that expresses a unique characteristic (like a tiger’s stripe) and an inhibitor chemical that periodically kicks in to shut down the activator’s expression. Both activator and inhibitor diffuse throughout a system, much like gas atoms will do in an enclosed box. It’s a bit like injecting a drop of black ink into a beaker of water. Normally, this would stabilize a system, and the water would gradually turn a uniform gray. But if the inhibitor diffuses at a faster rate than the activator, the process is destabilized. That mechanism will produce spots or stripes.</p>
<p>Scientists have tried to <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/biologists-home-in-on-turing-patterns-20130325/">apply this basic concept</a> to many different kinds of systems. For instance, neurons in the brain could serve as activators and inhibitors, depending on whether they amplify or dampen the firing of other nearby neurons—possibly the reason why we see <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-math-theory-for-why-people-hallucinate-20180730/">certain patterns when we hallucinate</a>. There is evidence for Turing mechanisms at work in zebra-fish stripes, the spacing between hair follicles in mice, feather buds on a bird’s skin, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3303118/">ridges on a mouse’s palate</a>, and the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1476">digits on a mouse’s paw</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/why-imperfection-could-be-key-to-turing-patterns-in-nature/">Read full article</a></p>
