                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Recently, a woman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fklein907.bsky.social/post/3luj64d4gfk25">slowed down</a> a line at the post office, waving her phone at the clerk. ChatGPT told her there's a "price match promise" on the USPS website. No such promise exists. But she trusted what the AI "knows" more than the postal worker—as if she'd consulted an oracle rather than a statistical text generator accommodating her wishes.</p>
<p>This scene reveals a fundamental misunderstanding about AI chatbots. There is nothing inherently special, authoritative, or accurate about AI-generated outputs. Given a reasonably trained AI model, the accuracy of any large language model (LLM) response depends on how you guide the conversation. They are prediction machines that will produce whatever pattern best fits your question, regardless of whether that output corresponds to reality.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, millions of daily users engage with AI chatbots as if they were talking to a consistent person—confiding secrets, seeking advice, and attributing fixed beliefs to what is actually a fluid idea-connection machine with no persistent self. This personhood illusion isn't just philosophically troublesome—it can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/after-using-chatgpt-man-swaps-his-salt-for-sodium-bromide-and-suffers-psychosis/">actively harm</a> vulnerable individuals while obscuring a sense of accountability when a company's chatbot "<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/grok-4-heavy-x-advertisers-silent-goes-musk-ceo-resigns-elon-linda-rcna217987">goes off the rails</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-personhood-trap-how-ai-fakes-human-personality/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Just weeks after being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/cdc-finally-gets-a-director-fdas-top-vaccine-regulator-exits-under-pressure/">confirmed by the Senate</a>, Susan Monarez has been ousted from the now thoroughly battered public health agency.</p>
<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/27/susan-monarez-cdc-director-ousted/">The Washington Post</a>, which cited multiple officials within the Trump administration. After Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services for confirmation of the ouster, HHS responded with a link to a post on the department's X account. The post states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.</p></blockquote>
<p>The department did not address the circumstances surrounding Monarez's ouster. But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/27/susan-monarez-cdc-director-ousted/">The Washington Post reported this evening</a> that US Health Secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had pressed Monarez on her willingness to rescind approvals for COVID-19 vaccines for days. Monarez reportedly met with Kennedy and other officials Monday and declined to agree to changes without consulting vaccine advisors. Kennedy then urged her to resign for "not supporting President Trump’s agenda."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/report-cdc-director-being-ousted-just-weeks-after-senate-confirmation/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet)—a network of surveillance sites that spans 10 states and covers about 54 million Americans (16 percent of the US population)—previously included active monitoring for eight infections from pathogens.

<p>"The situation is critical: multi-million dollar debts, interest on loans that 'eat up' the budget, many processes that are ineffective, and a significant part of the team has lost motivation and a sense of shared responsibility," said Igor Maltsev, chief of RSC Energia, which is located near Moscow.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A judge yesterday chided the Federal Communications Commission for its "vague and uninformative" response to a DOGE-related lawsuit and ordered the commission to produce documents sought under the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA).</p>
<p>The FCC was sued by journalist Nina Burleigh and <a href="https://frequencyfwd.com/">Frequency Forward</a>, a group that says it is investigating how Elon Musk's influence in government "is creating unmanageable conflicts of interest within the FCC." Burleigh and Frequency Forward alleged in an <a href="https://frequencyfwd.com/files/frequency-forward-district-court-foia-complaint-4242025.pdf">April 24 complaint</a> that the FCC violated the Freedom of Information Act by wrongfully withholding records on DOGE's activities within the agency.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs filed a <a href="https://frequencyfwd.com/files/motion-for-a-preliminary-injunction-08252025.pdf">motion for preliminary injunction</a> this week and received a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.279865/gov.uscourts.dcd.279865.13.0.pdf">quick ruling</a> from US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in the District of Columbia. Jackson denied the preliminary injunction request but ordered the FCC to "make ongoing productions of responsive documents on September 15, 2025 and October 6, 2025," and to "file a status report proposing a schedule for the completion of its production of documents to plaintiff by October 13, 2025."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/judge-unhappy-with-fccs-vague-and-uninformative-response-to-doge-lawsuit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As AI assistants become capable of controlling web browsers, a new security challenge has emerged: users must now trust that every website they visit won't try to hijack their AI agent with hidden malicious instructions. Experts voiced concerns about this emerging threat this week after testing from a leading AI chatbot vendor revealed that AI browser agents can be successfully tricked into harmful actions nearly a quarter of the time.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-chrome">announced</a> the launch of Claude for Chrome, a web browser-based AI agent that can take actions on behalf of users. Due to security concerns, the extension is only rolling out as a research preview to 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/anthropic-launches-200-claude-max-ai-plan-with-20x-higher-usage-limits/">Max plan</a>, which costs between $100 and $200 per month, with a waitlist available for other users.</p>
<p>The Claude for Chrome extension allows users to chat with the Claude AI model in a sidebar window that maintains the context of everything happening in their browser. Users can grant Claude permission to perform tasks like managing calendars, scheduling meetings, drafting email responses, handling expense reports, and testing website features.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/new-ai-browser-agents-create-risks-if-sites-hijack-them-with-hidden-instructions/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The single-player <em>Star Citizen</em> spin-off <em>Squadron 42</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/originally-planned-for-2015-squadron-42s-latest-delay-pushes-it-to-2026/">is slated to finally be in players' hands in 2026</a>, 11 full years after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/star-citizen-production-schedule-release/">its initial 2015 release target</a>. And after all that time, Cloud Imperium Games CEO Chris Roberts says he's hopeful that the title will be received similarly to another 2026 release that happens to be possibly the most anticipated video game of all time: <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>.</p>
<p>A recent report from French Canadian outlet La Presse (<a href="https://www-lapresse-ca.translate.goog/affaires/entreprises/2025-08-22/jeu-video/le-studio-web-turbulent-devient-cloud-imperium-games-montreal.php?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">translated</a>) suggests that <em>Squadron 42</em>'s launch is being timed so that it "won't be overshadowed" by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/gta-vi-will-miss-2025-after-all-new-target-is-may-26-2026/">the planned May launch of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>. "We're hoping it'll be almost as big an event," Roberts said in comparing the two upcoming releases in an interview with the French paper. "Other than <em>GTA VI</em>, it's probably the biggest-budget AAA game [of the year]."</p>
<p>That's a pretty bold claim, considering <em>Squadron 42</em>'s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/clash-of-the-space-titans-star-citizen-delayed-elite-dangerous-on-track/">very</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/07/star-citizen-creator-calls-bullshit-on-feature-creep-and-over-ambition/">public</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/07/court-denies-star-citizen-backers-4500-refund-lawsuit/">tumultuous</a> path to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/star-citizens-squadron-42-campaign-is-feature-complete-after-11-years/">a purported "feature complete" status</a> in 2023. But it seems at least somewhat reasonable when you consider that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rockstar/comments/1kpbv9y/taketwo_rockstars_parent_company_had_their/"><em>GTA VI</em>'s development budget of nearly $1 billion</a> lines up closely with $859 million in crowdfunding <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals">currently being reported</a> for <em>Star Citizen</em> as a whole.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/chris-roberts-hopes-squadron-42-will-be-almost-as-big-as-gta-vi-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>STARBASE, Texas—SpaceX launched the 10th test flight of the company's Starship rocket Tuesday evening, sending the stainless steel spacecraft halfway around the world to an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The largely successful mission for the world's largest rocket was an important milestone for SpaceX's Starship program after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacex-reveals-why-the-last-two-starships-failed-as-another-launch-draws-near/">months of repeated setbacks</a>, including three disappointing test flights and a powerful explosion on the ground that destroyed the ship that engineers were originally readying for this launch.</p>
<p>For the first time, SpaceX engineers received data on the performance of the ship's upgraded heat shield and control flaps during reentry back into the atmosphere. The three failed Starship test flights to start the year ended before the ship reached reentry. Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, has described developing a durable, reliable heat shield as the most pressing challenge for making Starship a fully and rapidly reusable rocket.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacex-bounces-back-with-a-starship-test-flight-that-ended-on-a-buoyant-note/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For decades, astronomers have wondered what the very first stars in the universe were like. These stars formed new chemical elements, which enriched the universe and allowed the next generations of stars to form the first planets.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-astro-071221-053453">The first stars</a> were initially composed of pure hydrogen and helium, and they were massive—hundreds to thousands of times the mass of the Sun and millions of times more luminous. Their short lives ended in <a href="https://www.space.com/6638-supernova.html">enormous explosions called supernovae</a>, so they had neither the time nor the raw materials to form planets, and they should no longer exist for astronomers to observe.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Finding a cheap secondary PC monitor is pretty easy. But if you want one that looks good, is built well, and is easily customizable, you won't find those qualities in a budget screen from a no-name brand on Amazon. Instead, <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/monitors/cc-9011306-ww/xeneon-edge-14-5-lcd-touchscreen-cc-9011306-ww?srsltid=AfmBOoqUB-hxeV9KWPmXUWHdYWeWU1brK6Qjy3m4xfb-cTmuu28t3bKM">Corsair's Xeneon Edge</a> is a premium alternative that almost justifies its $250 price tag.<br>
</p>
<p>Corsair first announced the Xeneon Edge at the<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/the-8-most-interesting-pc-monitors-from-ces-2025/"> CES trade show</a> in January. It's a 5-point capacitive touchscreen that can live on your desk and serve as a secondary computer monitor. If you're feeling fun, you can download Corsair's iCUE software to use customizable widgets for displaying things like CPU temperature and usage, the time and date, and media playing. More adventurous users can attach the screen onto their desktop PC's fan mounts or side panel.</p>
<p>I used Corsair's monitor for a couple of weeks. From its build to its image quality and software, the monitor is exemplary for a screen of this kind. The flagship widgets feature needs some work, but I couldn't ask for much more from a secondary, PC-mountable display.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/corsairs-pc-dockable-screen-helped-me-monitor-my-pc-components-and-news-feeds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Manual transmissions have gone the way of the dodo, but you can still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/2025-mazda-mx-5-rf-review-why-this-folding-hardtop-isnt-the-one-to-get/">find a few</a> out there. Bless Volkswagen for keeping the helical gears turning, both literally and figuratively. The 2025 Jetta GLI, Volkswagen's sporty sedan, still offers a gear lever with actual gears attached at the other end, and a third pedal hanging down from under the dash. Meanwhile, Golf GTI fans are still sobbing in their beer because <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/the-2024-vw-golf-gti-is-the-last-of-its-kind-with-a-manual-transmission/">2024 was the last model year</a> you could row your own in the hot hatch—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-vw-golf-gti-buttons-are-back-on-the-menu-smiles-never-went-away/">now it's paddles only</a>.</p>
<p>Volkswagen updated the 2025 Jetta GLI with a new grille, LED headlights, and light bars that connect across both the front grille and rear taillights. There's a red accent stripe that runs across the lower front fascia and turns up at the front corners, somewhat like The Joker's lipstick, but way less menacing. It's less distinctive than the Golf GTI, though, and the design even reminds me of the 2017-era Honda Accord a bit. So, yes, in a face-off, the Golf GTI wins.</p>
<p>The test GLI's wheels get black paint with the Black Package (blackened wheels and side mirror caps). The Monument Gray color option pairs with a black roof, which must seem like a good idea to people who don't live in the Southwest, where cars overheat before they're even started.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/2025-vw-jetta-gli-its-got-power-but-driving-poetry-takes-a-back-seat/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Marine biologist and conservationist <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-shark-scientist-reflects-on-jaws-at-50/">David Shiffman</a> was an early power user and evangelist for science engagement on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Over the years, he trained more than 2,000 early career scientists on how to best use the platform for professional goals: networking with colleagues, sharing new scientific papers, and communicating with interested members of the public.</p>
<p>But when Elon Musk<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/elon-musk-completes-twitter-purchase-immediately-fires-ceo-and-other-execs/"> bought Twitter</a> in 2022, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/musk-rushes-out-new-twitter-logo-its-just-an-x-that-someone-tweeted-at-him/">renaming it X</a>, changes to both the platform's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-turned-x-trump-echo-chamber-rcna174321">algorithm</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/twitter-ditches-trust-and-safety-council-as-musk-tweets-fuel-harassment/">moderation</a> policy <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/macroscope/what-we-lose-if-we-lose-science-twitter">soured Shiffman</a> on the social media site. He started looking for a viable alternative among the fledgling platforms that had begun to pop up: most notably Threads, Post, Mastodon, and Bluesky. He was among the first wave of scientists to join Bluesky and found that, even in its infancy, it had many of the features he had valued in "golden age" Twitter.</p>
<p>Shiffman also noticed that he wasn't the only one in the scientific community having issues with Twitter. This impression was further bolstered by news stories in outlets like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01399-x">Nature</a>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/musk-reshapes-twitter-academics-ponder-taking-flight">Science</a>, and the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/is-academictwitter-over">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> noting growing complaints about Twitter and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03784-6">increased migration</a> over to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39856207/">Bluesky</a> by science professionals. (Full disclosure: I joined Bluesky around the same time as Shiffman, for similar reasons: Twitter had ceased to be professionally useful, and many of the science types I'd been following were moving to Bluesky. I nuked my Twitter account in November 2024.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/more-scientists-choose-bluesky-over-twitter/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/the-outer-worlds-review-fall-deeply-into-the-best-fallout-like-game-in-years/">nearly six years now</a> since <em>The Outer Worlds</em> threw players into the deep end, forcing them to acclimate to the game's far-future, ultra-corporate intergalactic dystopia amid lots of <em>Fallout</em>-style shooting and questing. The prologue for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>—which I got to play as part of a preview build ahead of the game's planned October 29 launch—throws players into a different kind of deep end, asking them to fill the shoes of an agent in the storied semi-militarized police force of the Earth Directorate.</p>
<p>The over-the-top propaganda that leads the game off suggests the Earth Directorate is here to protect colonists from out-of-control corporations and tyrannical governments. But your first mission goes in a different direction, sending you on a secret mission to the "out of jurisdiction" Arcadian system, a secretive dictatorship where all the skip drives that power interstellar travel are supposedly manufactured. You've been asked to help expropriate a rare, "unsealed" skip drive core, which can then be opened up, studied, and maybe even copied without the risk of catastrophic explosion (the "right to repair" folks in the audience might be nodding their heads sagely at this point).</p>
<h2>Choose your choice</h2>
<p>I won't spoil things by discussing just how the mission goes off the rails or talking about the somewhat vague twist that closes out the playable prologue. But I will gush a bit about how the first game's mix of retro-futuristic set-dressing and sardonic, cynical writing style immediately shine through, even with the change in perspective. A mix of strong voice acting and motion capture immediately drew me back into the <em>Outer Worlds</em> universe, even when the characters were delivering ridiculous lines like "You’re not just a cog in the machine. You’re THE cog!"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/the-outer-worlds-2-wants-you-to-join-the-space-police/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat in his 11th year on Capitol Hill, had some things to say when the House Armed Services Committee met last month to write President Trump's Golden Dome missile defense shield into law.</p>
<p>The Republican-led committee debated and voted on an annual defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a sprawling piece of catch-all legislation that does everything from setting pay raises for service members to determining how many airplanes and ships the Pentagon should buy.</p>
<p>Moulton is the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, a panel that oversees the military's nuclear and space programs. In this role, the congressman representing Massachusetts' North Shore is using his voice to counter the Trump administration's signature initiative in the military space arena. Ars recently spoke with Moulton, and we present the interview in its entirety below.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/lawmaker-trumps-golden-dome-will-end-the-madness-and-thats-not-a-good-thing/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, US District Judge William Alsup confirmed that Anthropic and the authors "believe they have a settlement in principle" and will file a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by September 5.</p>
<p>The settlement announcement comes after Alsup certified what <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/ai-industry-horrified-to-face-largest-copyright-class-action-ever-certified/">AI industry advocates criticized</a> as the largest copyright class action of all time.

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/">published</a> a blog post on Tuesday titled "Helping people when they need it most" that addresses how its ChatGPT AI assistant handles mental health crises, following what the company calls "recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises."</p>
<p>The post arrives after The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html">reported</a> on a lawsuit filed by Matt and Maria Raine, whose 16-year-old son Adam died by suicide in April after extensive interactions with ChatGPT, which Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">covered extensively</a> in a previous post. According to the lawsuit, ChatGPT provided detailed instructions, romanticized suicide methods, and discouraged the teen from seeking help from his family while OpenAI's system tracked 377 messages flagged for self-harm content without intervening.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is a system of multiple models interacting as an application. In addition to a main AI model like GPT-4o or GPT-5 providing the bulk of the outputs, the application includes components that are typically invisible to the user, including a <a href="https://openai.com/index/using-gpt-4-for-content-moderation/">moderation layer</a> (another AI model) or classifier that reads the text of the ongoing chat sessions. That layer detects potentially harmful outputs and can cut off the conversation if it veers into unhelpful territory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/after-teen-suicide-openai-claims-it-is-helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the US Energy Information Administration <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/">released its latest data</a> on how the US generated electricity during the first six months of 2025. The data suggests the notable surge in power use is flattening out a bit compared to earlier in the year, with the growth in coal use falling along with it. And despite the best efforts of the Trump Administration, the boom in solar power continues, with solar looking poised to pass hydroelectric before the year is out.</p>
<h2>Growing, but moderating</h2>
<p>For the last few decades, the US has largely seen its use of electricity remain flat. That's changed over the last year or so, with energy use ramping up, likely due in part to increased data center use. Earlier in the year, data indicated that demand for electricity was up roughly five percent year-over-year. But that seems to be tailing off over the course of the spring, leaving total electricity demand up by three percent for the January-through-June period.</p>
<p>The somewhat lower demand has had a positive effect on coal use. Earlier this year, coal was up by about 20 percent compared to the same period the year before. Now, it's only up by a bit under 17 percent. That's still terrible given coal's environmental and health impacts, not to mention its cost. But it's not as bad as it has been, and it could have been even better had the Trump Administration not forced a coal plant that was slated for closure <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-orders-dirty-expensive-140000886.html">to stay open</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/us-electricity-2025-solar-continues-growth-coal-still-up/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Chuck Borges, the SSA's Chief Data Officer (CDO), "has become aware through reports to him of serious data security lapses, evidently orchestrated by DOGE officials, currently employed as SSA employees, that risk the security of over 300 million Americans' Social Security data," the Government Accountability Project said in a <a href="https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08-26-2025-Borges-Disclosure-Sanitized.pdf">letter</a> sent today to members of Congress and the US Office of Special Counsel. The nonprofit Government Accountability Project is representing Borges.</p>
<p>Although it has been widely reported that DOGE sought and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/supreme-court-gives-doge-unfettered-access-to-sensitive-social-security-data/">obtained access</a> to Social Security records in its attempt to find evidence of fraud, the letter to lawmakers said the live copy of SSA's database hasn't previously been disclosed. DOGE's actions were taken "under the authority of SSA Chief Information Officer (CIO) Aram Moghaddassi" and violate SSA protocols and policies, the letter said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/doge-accused-of-copying-entire-social-security-database-to-insecure-cloud-system/">Read full article</a></p>
