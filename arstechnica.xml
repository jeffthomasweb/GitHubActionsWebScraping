<p>With the country experiencing a relatively large summer wave of COVID-19, the Food and Drug Administration is considering signing off on this year's strain-matched COVID-19 vaccines as soon as this week, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/health/fda-updated-covid-19-vaccines/index.html">according to a report by CNN</a> that cited unnamed officials familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Last year, the FDA gave the green light for the 2023–2024 COVID shots on September 11, close to the peak of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in that year's summer wave. This year, the summer wave began earlier and, by some metrics, is peaking at much higher levels than in previous years.</p>
<p>Currently, wastewater detection of SARS-CoV-2 shows "very high" virus levels in 32 states and the District of Colombia. An additional 11 states are listed as having "high" levels. Looking at trends, the southern and western regions of the country are currently reporting SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater that rival the 2022–2023 and 2023–2024 winter waves, which both peaked at the very end of December.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044101#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044101&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Windows zero-day vulnerability recently patched by Microsoft was exploited by hackers working on behalf of the North Korean government so they could install custom malware that’s exceptionally stealthy and advanced, researchers reported Monday.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38193">CVE-2024-38193</a>, was one of six zero-days—meaning vulnerabilities known or actively exploited before the vendor has a patch—fixed in Microsoft’s monthly update release last Tuesday. Microsoft said the vulnerability—in a class known as a "use after free"—was located in AFD.sys, the binary file for what’s known as the ancillary function driver and the kernel entry point for the Winsock API. Microsoft warned that the zero-day could be exploited to give attackers system privileges, the maximum system rights available in Windows and a required status for executing untrusted code.</p>
<h2>Lazarus gets access to the Windows kernel</h2>
<p>Microsoft warned at the time that the vulnerability was being actively exploited but provided no details about who was behind the attacks or what their ultimate objective was. On Monday, researchers with Gen—the security firm that discovered the attacks and reported them privately to Microsoft—said the threat actors were part of Lazarus, the name researchers use to track a hacking outfit backed by the North Korean government.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044100#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044100&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In April, the National Library of France <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/25/french-national-library-quarantines-books-believed-to-be-laced-with-arsenic">removed four 19th century books</a>, all published in Great Britain, from its shelves because the covers were likely laced with arsenic. The books have been placed in quarantine for further analysis to determine exactly how much arsenic is present. It's part of an ongoing global effort to test cloth-bound books from the 19th and early 20th centuries because of the common practice of using toxic dyes during that period.</p>
<p>Chemists from Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, have also been studying Victorian books from that university's library collection in order to identify and quantify levels of poisonous substances in the covers. They reported their initial findings this week at <a href="https://acs.digitellinc.com/live/32/page/1049">a meeting</a> of the American Chemical Society in Denver. Using a combination of spectroscopic techniques, they found that several books had lead concentrations more than twice the limit imposed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</p>
<p>The Lipscomb effort was inspired by the University of Delaware's <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/poisonbookproject/">Poison Book Project</a>, established in 2019 as an interdisciplinary crowdsourced collaboration between university scientists and the Winterthur Museum, Garden, and Library. The initial objective was to analyze all the Victorian-era books in the Winterthur circulating and rare books collection for the presence of an arsenic compound called cooper acetoarsenite, an emerald green pigment that was very popular at the time to dye wallpaper, clothing, and cloth book covers. Book covers dyed with chrome yellow—<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/SC/C5SC04362J#!divAbstract">favored by Vincent van Gogh</a>—aka lead chromate, were also examined, and the project's scope has since expanded worldwide.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043776#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043776&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AMD has agreed to buy artificial intelligence infrastructure group ZT Systems in a $4.9 billion cash and stock transaction, extending a run of AI investments by the chip company as it seeks to challenge market leader Nvidia.</p>
<p>The California-based group said the acquisition would help accelerate the adoption of its Instinct line of AI data center chips, which compete with Nvidia’s popular graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>
<p>ZT Systems, a private company founded three decades ago, builds custom computing infrastructure for the biggest AI “hyperscalers.” While the company does not disclose its customers, the hyperscalers include the likes of Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044066#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044066&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A federal judge who bought more than $15,000 worth of Tesla stock has rejected a motion that could have forced him to recuse himself from a lawsuit that Elon Musk's X Corp. filed against the nonprofit Media Matters for America.</p>
<p>US District Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas bought Tesla stock valued between $15,001 and $50,000 in 2022, a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25034203/o-39-connor-reed-annual-2022.pdf">financial disclosure report</a> shows. He was overseeing two lawsuits filed by X and recused himself from only one of the cases.</p>
<p>Media Matters <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MMFA-Reply-ISO-Motion-to-Compel-Corrected-Certificate-of-Interested-Persons.pdf">argued</a> in a July court filing that Tesla should be disclosed by X as an "interested party" in the case because of the public association between Musk and the Tesla brand. O'Connor rejected the Media Matters motion in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.383454/gov.uscourts.txnd.383454.81.0_1.pdf">ruling</a> issued Friday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044042#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044042&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two NASA spacecraft built by Rocket Lab are on the road from California to Florida this weekend to begin preparations for launch on Blue Origin's first New Glenn rocket.</p>
<p>These two science probes must launch between late September and mid-October to take advantage of a planetary alignment between Earth and Mars that only happens once every 26 months. NASA tapped Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company, to launch the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission with a $20 million contract.</p>
<p>Last November, the space agency confirmed the $79 million ESCAPADE mission will launch on the inaugural flight of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. With this piece of information, the opaque schedule for Blue Origin's long-delayed first New Glenn mission suddenly became more clear.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043958#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043958&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Companies are often caught between wanting to cut emissions but also grow profits. But for airlines, these two different imperatives actually align. Cutting carbon emissions means burning less fuel and spending less money buying fuel. This is why Lufthansa has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/how-the-great-white-shark-reduces-drag-while-swimming-at-different-speeds/">copying a trick from the animal kingdom</a>: applying a special film that mimics sharkskin to parts of its aircraft.</p>
<p>When it comes to decarbonization, reducing the emissions of air travel is both a high priority and something of a difficult task. Globally, air traffic accounts for about 2.5 percent of carbon emissions, but since those emissions are emitted at altitude, studies have found that the warming effect may be almost twice as large.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's extremely difficult to rival the volumetric energy density of jet fuel, which contains almost 50 times as many megajoules per liter than alternatives like hydrogen, ethanol, or lithium-ion batteries. That's less of a problem for ground or sea transportation, where weight and volume is less important, but it's a real stumbling block for switching jet airliners to a different fuel source.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044019#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044019&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google is denying a recent report that it is no longer making Fitbit smartwatches. A company spokesperson told Ars Technica today that Google has no current plans to discontinue the Fitbit Sense or Fitbit Versa product lines.</p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/rip-fitbit-smartwatches-an-end-we-could-see-coming-a-mile-away">TechRadar</a> published an article titled “RIP Fitbit smartwatches—an end we could see coming a mile away." The article noted last week's announcement of the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/googles-pixel-watch-3-has-a-bigger-screen-and-pixel-buds-pro-2-are-smaller/">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>. Notably, the watch from Google, which acquired Fitbit in 2019, gives users free access to the Daily Readiness Score, a feature that previously required a Fitbit Premium subscription (Pixel Watch 3 owners also get six free months of Fitbit Premium). The publication said that Fitbit has been "consigned to wearable history" and reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google quietly confirmed that there would never be another Fitbit Sense or Versa model produced. From now on, Fitbit-branded devices will be relegated to Google’s best fitness trackers: the Fitbit Inspire, Luxe, and Charge ranges. The smartwatch form factor would be exclusively reserved for the Pixel Watch line.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story followed a report from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wearables/waiting-for-a-new-fitbit-smartwatch-google-says-thats-the-pixel-watch-3-202314838.html">Engadget</a> last week, when the puiblication said that "moving forward everything from Fitbit would focus on the more minimalistic, long-lasting trackers the brand has become synonymous with," citing a conversation with the senior director of product management for Pixel Wearables, Sandeep Waraich. "Pixel Watches are our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit," he reportedly said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043998#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043998&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> came out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review-lets-spend-some-time-together/">nearly 10 years ago</a>, PC players could have invested $329 (~$435 in today's dollars) in a brand-new GTX 970 graphics card to make the game look as good as possible on their high-end gaming rig. Surprisingly enough, that very same 2014 graphics card will still be able to run follow-up <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/bioware-reveals-dreadwolf-as-the-next-dragon-age-title/">previously known as <em>Dreadwolf</em></a>) when it launches on October 31. If you're using AMD cards, an even older Radeon R9 that you purchased back in 2013 will be able to run the game.</p>
<p><em>Veilguard</em>'s minimum specs are just the latest to show the workmanlike endurance of the humble GTX 970, which is currently available used on Newegg for <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100007709%20600536049&amp;Order=1">as low as $140</a>. Relatively recent big-budget PC releases like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-early-impressions-youll-spend-whole-weeks-in-here-and-love-it/"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> both use the old card (or the less powerful follow-up variant, the GTX 960) as their "minimum requirement" benchmark.</p>
<p>Not every big-budget PC game these days is so forgiving with its minimum specs, though. When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/a-week-spent-in-cyberpunk-2077s-beautiful-messy-urban-future/"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/"><em>Doom: Eternal</em></a> launched in 2020, they both asked players to be sporting at least a GTX 1060, which had come out around four years prior.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043994#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043994&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We're many months past the worst of the Raspberry Pi shortages, and the board is finally widely available at its suggested retail price at most sites without wait times or quantity limitations. One sign that the Pi Foundation is feeling more confident about the stock situation: the launch of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/2gb-raspberry-pi-5-on-sale-now-at-50/">a new 2GB configuration of the Raspberry Pi 5</a>, available starting today for $50. That's $10 less than the 4GB configuration and $30 less than the 8GB version of the board.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton writes that the 2GB version of the board includes a revised version of the Broadcom BCM2712C1 SoC that is slightly cheaper to manufacture. Upton says that the D0 stepping of the BCM2712C1 strips out some "dark silicon" built-in functionality that the Pi wasn't using but was still taking up space on the silicon die and increasing the cost of the chip.</p>

<p>"From the perspective of a Raspberry Pi user, [the chip] is functionally identical to its predecessor: the same fast quad-core processor; the same multimedia capabilities; and the same PCI Express bus that has proven to be one of the most exciting features of the Raspberry Pi 5 platform," Upton writes. "However, it is cheaper to make, and so is available to us at somewhat lower cost. And this, combined with the savings from halving the memory capacity, has allowed us to take $10 out of the cost of the finished product."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043981#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043981&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The TV business isn't just about selling TVs anymore. Companies are increasingly seeing viewers, not TV sets, as their most lucrative asset.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, TV makers have seen rising financial success from TV operating systems that can show viewers ads and analyze their responses. Rather than selling as many TVs as possible, brands like LG, Samsung, Roku, and Vizio are increasingly, if not primarily, seeking recurring revenue from already-sold TVs via ad sales and tracking.</p>
<p>How did we get here? And what implications does an ad- and data-obsessed industry have for the future of TVs and the people watching them?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027078#p3">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027078&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Moon may not have much of an atmosphere, mostly because of its weak gravitational field (whether it had a substantial atmosphere billions of years ago is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X17304971?via%3Dihub">debatable</a>). But it is thought to presently be maintaining its tenuous atmosphere—also known as an exosphere—because of meteorite impacts.</p>
<p>Space rocks have been bombarding the Moon for its 4.5-billion-year existence. Researchers from MIT and the University of Chicago have now found that lunar soil samples collected by astronauts during the Apollo era show evidence that meteorites, from hulking meteors to micrometeoroids no bigger than specks of dust, have launched a steady flow of atoms into the exosphere.</p>
<p>Though some of these atoms escape into space and others fall back to the surface, those that do remain above the Moon create a thin atmosphere that keeps being replenished as more meteorites crash into the surface.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043696#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043696&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A US judge has temporarily blocked the launch of a sports streaming service formed by Disney’s ESPN, Warner Bros and Fox, finding that it was likely to “substantially lessen competition” in the market.</p>
<p>The service, dubbed Venu, was expected to launch later this year. But FuboTV, a sports-focused streaming platform, filed an antitrust suit in February to block it, arguing its business would “suffer irreparable harm” as a result.</p>
<p>On Friday, US District Judge Margaret Garnett in New York granted an injunction to halt the launch of the service while Fubo’s lawsuit against the entertainment giants works its way through the court.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043960#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043960&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's no secret that despite significant investment from companies like OpenAI and Runway, AI-generated videos still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/we-made-a-cat-drink-a-beer-with-runways-ai-video-generator-and-it-sprouted-hands/">struggle to achieve</a> convincing realism at times. Some of the <a href="https://x.com/CharaspowerAI/status/1819443246478610618">most amusing fails</a> end up on social media, which has led to a new response trend on Chinese social media platforms TikTok and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili">Bilibili</a> where users create videos that mock the imperfections of AI-generated content. The trend has since spread to X (formerly Twitter) in the US, where users have been sharing the humorous parodies.</p>

<p>In particular, the videos seem to parody image-synthesis videos where subjects <a href="https://x.com/CharaspowerAI/status/1819443246478610618">seamlessly morph</a> into other people or objects in unexpected and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SipsTea/comments/1ashf65/ai_videos_are_weird/">physically impossible</a> ways. Chinese social media users replicate these unusual visual non sequiturs without special effects by positioning their bodies in unusual ways as new and unexpected objects appear on-camera from out of frame.</p>
<p>This exaggerated mimicry has struck a chord with viewers on X, who find the parodies entertaining. User @theGioM <a href="https://x.com/theGioM/status/1824000938870292771">shared one video</a>, seen above. "<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">This is high-level performance arts," <a href="https://x.com/ArtsRayne/status/1824103991233712424">wrote</a> one X user.

<p>It's been four years since <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the world's most popular games, was pulled from the Apple App Store in a blaze of controversy and finger-pointing. Today, it's returning to the iPhone—but only in the European Union.</p>
<p>Today marks the launch of the Epic Games Store on Android and iOS—iOS just in Europe, Android worldwide. Right now, it just has three games: <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em>, and <em>Fall Guys</em>. And you'll have to be in Europe to access it on your iPhone.</p>
<p>The Epic Games Store is run by Epic Games, the same company that develops and publishes <em>Fortnite</em>. Most folks who have been paying attention to either Epic or Apple in recent years know the story at this point, but here's the quick summary and analysis.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043896#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043896&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A text parser? Typing in “Open drawer,” then “Look in drawer,” then “Take brochures,” in the year 2024, on a computer that can generate a 4K 3D model of the Acropolis if I ask it to? Is that really what <i><a href="https://www.thecrimsondiamond.com/">The Crimson Diamond</a></i> asks of us?</p>
<p>Yes, it is, and solo developer/writer/producer Julia Minamata is right to ask it. If you have text-prompt adventures from the likes of Sierra in your mental library (like, say, <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_colonels_bequest">The Colonel's Bequest)</a></em>, or if you’re willing to meet the parser halfway, it will work. <i>The Crimson Diamond</i>’s parser is fairly agile, accepting a range of nouns and verbs in most circumstances. You can still use arrow keys and a mouse to move and click a few useful shortcuts. And the parser has shortcuts, like typing “n” to look at your quest-tracking notebook or “o d” or “o c” for the very common actions of opening a door or cabinet.</p>
<p>There are a lot of cabinets and drawers in this game because it’s set in northern Ontario, Canada, in 1914. You are Nancy Maple, a junior geologist eager for some field work, sent by your museum to the mining town of Crimson to investigate a diamond that fell out of a river fish’s guts. Everything goes wrong with your trip, and you’re on your own to investigate this town, its odd inhabitants and visitors, and, eventually, a crime that may or may not have to do with potential diamonds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043870#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043870&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A plague of parasitic mites has descended upon Illinois in the wake of this year's historic crop of cicadas, leaving residents with raging rashes and incessant itching.</p>
<p>The mighty attack follows the overlapping emergence of the 17-year Brood XIII and the 13-year Brood XIX this past spring, <a href="https://cicadas.uconn.edu/">a specific co-emergence that only occurs every 221 years</a>. The cacophonous boom in cicadas sparked an explosion of mites, which can feast on various insects, including the developing eggs of periodical cicadas. But, when the mites' food source fizzles out, the mites bite any humans in their midst in hopes of finding their next meal. While the mites cannot live on humans, their biting leads to scratching. The mite, <em>Pyemotes herfsi</em>, is aptly dubbed the "itch mite."</p>
<p>"You can't see them, you can't feel them, they're always here," Jennifer Rydzewski, an ecologist for the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, told <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/20240815/news/its-going-to-happen-again-biting-mites-an-issue-for-some-following-cicada-emergence/">Chicago outlet The Daily Herald</a>.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As we wait for this fall's Windows 11 24H2 update to be released to the general public, work continues on other new features that could be part of other future Windows updates. A new Canary channel Windows Insider build <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/08/15/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27868-canary-channel/">released yesterday</a> fixes a decades-old and arbitrary limitation that restricted new FAT32 partitions to 32GB in size, even though the filesystem itself has a maximum supported size of 2TB (and Windows can read and recognize 2TB FAT32 partitions without an issue).</p>
<p>For now, this limit is only being lifted for the command-line formatting tools in Windows. The disk formatting UI, which looks more or less the same now as it did when it was introduced in Windows NT 4.0 almost 30 years ago, still has the arbitrary 32GB capacity restriction.</p>

<p>The 32GB limit can allegedly be pinned on former Microsoft programmer Dave Plummer, who occasionally shares stories about his time working on Windows in the 1990s and early 2000s. Plummer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/windows-current-disk-formatting-ui-is-a-30-year-old-placeholder-from-windows-nt/">says</a> that he wrote the file format dialog, intending it as a "temporary" solution, and arbitrarily chose 32GB as a size limit for disks, likely because it seemed big enough at the time (Windows NT 4.0 required a whopping 110MB of disk space).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043819#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043819&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A large Internet service provider wants the Supreme Court to rule that ISPs shouldn't have to disconnect broadband users who have been accused of piracy. Cable firm Cox Communications, which is trying to overturn a ruling in a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Sony, <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Cox-v-Sony-Cert-Petition-8.15-Final.pdf">petitioned</a> the Supreme Court to take up the case yesterday.</p>
<p>Cox <a href="https://newsroom.cox.com/Cox_Petitions_Supreme_Court">said in a press release</a> that a recent appeals court ruling "would force ISPs to terminate Internet service to households or businesses based on unproven allegations of infringing activity, and put them in a position of having to police their networks—contrary to customer expectations... Terminating Internet service would not just impact the individual accused of unlawfully downloading content, it would kick an entire household off the Internet."</p>
<p>The case began in 2018 when Sony and other music copyright holders sued Cox, claiming that it didn't adequately fight piracy on its network and failed to terminate repeat infringers. A US District Court jury in the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/12/cox-communications-hit-with-1-billion-verdict-over-music-piracy/">ruled in December 2019</a> that Cox must pay $1 billion in damages to the major record labels.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043862#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043862&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Those of us who collect classic game consoles and computers (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/gear-envy-my-collection-of-500-plus-pieces-of-computer-and-gaming-hardware">here's looking at you, AI reporter Benj Edwards</a>) know the difficulty of keeping all that hardware not just working but instantly accessible with a simple press of a power button. Too often, large hardware collections end up languishing, boxed up on shelves, or sitting loose and unconnected to a display for long periods.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Ibrahim Al-Nasser grew tired of having that problem with his massive gaming collection, so he decided to hook 444 different gaming devices up to a single TV, <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/8/gaming-is-serious-business-for-man-with-444-consoles-hooked-up-to-one-tv">earning a Guinness World Record in the process</a>.</p>
<p>"After a while, I noticed that I had a big stack of gaming consoles that I couldn’t play," Al-Nasser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLaTSb8k518">said in a video filmed by Guinness</a>. "The TV ports are limited, and if I want to play, I either unplug the existing consoles or I'll keep everything and add more switchers and of course more converters as well. By adding more switchers, the idea came to my mind to connect all of the gaming consoles I have to the TV, then contact Guinness World Records because this project is unique."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043824#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043824&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
