<p>To say "I’m not a morning person" would be an understatement. Not only is it hard for me to be useful in the first hour (or so) of being awake, but it’s hard for me to wake up. I mean, <em>really hard.</em></p>
<p>I’ve tried various recommendations and tricks: I've set multiple alarms and had coffee ready and waiting, and I've put my alarm clock far from my bed and kept my blinds open so that sunlight might wake me. But I’m still prone to sleeping through my alarm or hitting snooze until the last minute.</p>
<p>The Hatch Restore 2, a smart alarm clock with lighting that mimics sunrises and sunsets, seemed like a technologically savvy approach to realizing my dreams of becoming a morning person.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046183#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046183&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When Raspberry Pi introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/new-2gb-raspberry-pi-5-option-knocks-the-price-down-to-50/">a new 2GB version of the Raspberry Pi 5 board</a> earlier this month, CEO Eben Upton said that the board would come with a slightly updated version of the board's Broadcom BCM2712C1 SoC. By removing chip functionality that the Pi 5 didn't use, the new D0 stepping of the chip would use less silicon, reducing its cost.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi enthusiast and YouTuber Jeff Geerling has <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/new-2gb-pi-5-has-33-smaller-die-30-idle-power-savings">performed some firsthand testing</a> of the 2GB Pi 5. As Upton said, the new board is functionally identical to the older 4GB and 8GB boards, with identical performance (as long as whatever workload you're running doesn't benefit from extra RAM, anyway). The new silicon die is also <a href="https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1828177919765532758">about 33 percent smaller</a> than the old one, which Geerling verified by <a href="https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1828177615640739901">removing the SoC's heat spreader</a> to expose the silicon underneath and measuring by hand.</p>
<p>Geerling also demonstrated that the 2GB Pi 5 comes with a couple of unexpected benefits that Upton didn't mention in his announcement—that the 2GB Pi 5 runs a little cooler and uses a little less power than the 4GB and 8GB editions. The 2GB Pi used just 2.4 W or power at idle and 8.9 W during a CPU stress test, compared to 3.3 W and 9.8 W in the 4GB version. The SoC of the 2GB Pi measured 30° Celsius at idle and 59° under load, compared to 32° and 63° for the 2GB version. Those are all small but significant differences, given that nothing has changed other than the SoC.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046291#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046291&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The head of US Space Command said Wednesday he would like to see more transparency from the Chinese government on space debris, especially as one of China's newer rockets has shown a propensity for breaking apart and littering low-Earth orbit with hundreds of pieces of space junk.</p>
<p>Gen. Stephen Whiting, commander of US Space Command, said he's observed some improvement in the dialogue between US and Chinese military officials this year. But the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/us-military-tracks-more-than-300-pieces-of-debris-from-chinese-launch/">disintegration of the upper stage from a Long March 6A rocket</a> earlier this month showed China could do more to prevent the creation of space debris, and communicate openly about it when it happens.</p>
<p>The Chinese government acknowledged the breakup of the Long March 6A rocket's upper stage in a statement by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 14, more than a week after the rocket's launch August 6 with the first batch of 18 Internet satellites for a megaconstellation of thousands of spacecraft analogous to SpaceX's Starlink network.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046107#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046107&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're familiar with the name EmuDeck, you're likely a Steam Deck owner looking for <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/">an easy and user-friendly way to run emulators on your Steam Deck handheld</a>. Now, <a href="https://github.com/dragoonDorise">one of the coders</a> behind that software suite is dipping their toes into branded gaming hardware with <a href="https://x.com/EmuDeck/status/1829172047559397518">the EmuDeck Machines project</a>, now seeking <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/emudeck-machines-retro-emulation-console-pc#/">funding on IndieGogo</a>.</p>
<p>The EmuDeck Machines obviously come with EmuDeck software preinstalled to let users easily "play your retro games from your couch." But they also promise to let you run games from Steam and other popular PC launchers through the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Linux-based, gaming-focused Bazzite OS</a>. The vibe is definitely similar to that of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">Valve's own aborted Steam Machines effort</a> from years back, albeit in a less "official" capacity.</p>
<p>"I used to be a PC guy but in the last 20 years I switched to the Mac and in the Apple ecosystem choosing a computer is easy," project lead DragoonDorise told Ars in an email. "But then I found myself wanting a gaming rig so I started my search and boy oh boy I was lost. The PC industry seems to be trying to trick you every step of the way, gazillions of options, hard to understand what's good and what's not. If you are tech savvy it's not hard, you know what to get and what to avoid. Then it hit me, I made emulation easy with EmuDeck, why not make hardware easy too?"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046260#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046260&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The rise in child sexual abuse material (CSAM) has been one of the darkest Internet trends, but after years of covering CSAM cases, I've found that few of those arrested show deep technical sophistication. (Perhaps this is simply because the technically sophisticated are better at avoiding arrest.)</p>
<p>Most understand that what they are doing is illegal and that password protection is required, both for their devices and online communities. Some can also use tools like TOR (The Onion Router). And, increasingly, encrypted (or at least encrypted-capable) chat apps might be in play.</p>
<p>But I've never seen anyone who, when arrested, had <em>three</em> Samsung Galaxy phones filled with "tens of thousands of videos and images" depicting CSAM, all of it hidden behind a secrecy-focused, password-protected app called "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hld.anzenbokusucal&amp;hl=en_US">Calculator Photo Vault</a>." Nor have I seen anyone arrested for CSAM having used all of the following:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046303#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046303&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Critics of spyware and exploit sellers have long warned that the advanced hacking sold by commercial surveillance vendors (CSVs) represents a worldwide danger because they inevitably find their way into the hands of malicious parties, even when the CSVs promise they will be used only to target known criminals. On Thursday, Google analysts presented evidence bolstering the critique after finding that spies working on behalf of the Kremlin used exploits that are “identical or strikingly similar” to those sold by spyware makers Intellexa and NSO Group.</p>
<p>The hacking outfit, tracked under names including APT29, Cozy Bear, and Midnight Blizzard, is widely assessed to work on behalf of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or the SVR. Researchers with Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which tracks nation-state hacking, <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/state-backed-attackers-and-commercial-surveillance-vendors-repeatedly-use-the-same-exploits/">said Thursday</a> that they observed APT29 using exploits identical or closely identical to those first used by commercial exploit sellers NSO Group of Israel and Intellexa of Ireland. In both cases, the Commercial Surveillance Vendors’ exploits were first used as zero-days, meaning when the vulnerabilities weren’t publicly known and no patch was available.</p>
<h2>Identical or strikingly similar</h2>
<p>Once patches became available for the vulnerabilities, TAG said, APT29 used the exploits in watering hole attacks, which infect targets by surreptitiously planting exploits on sites they’re known to frequent. TAG said APT29 used the exploits as n-days, which target vulnerabilities that have recently been fixed but not yet widely installed by users.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046289#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046289&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a report in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-apple-funding-chatgpt-50754cd6">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Apple is in talks to invest in OpenAI, the generative AI company whose ChatGPT will feature in future versions of iOS.</p>
<p>If the talks are successful, Apple will join a multi-billion dollar funding round led by Thrive Capital that would value the startup at more than $100 billion.</p>
<p>The report doesn't say exactly how much Apple would invest, but it does note that it would not be the only participant in this round of funding. For example, Microsoft is expected to invest further, and Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-29/nvidia-has-held-discussions-about-joining-openai-s-funding-round">reports</a> that Nvidia is also considering participating.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046261#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046261&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI and Anthropic have each signed unprecedented deals granting the US government early access to conduct safety testing on the companies' flashiest new AI models before they're released to the public.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/us-ai-safety-institute-signs-agreements-regarding-ai-safety-research">press release</a> from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the deal creates a "formal collaboration on AI safety research, testing, and evaluation with both Anthropic and OpenAI" and the US Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute.</p>
<p>Through the deal, the US AI Safety Institute will "receive access to major new models from each company prior to and following their public release." This will ensure that public safety won't depend exclusively on how the companies "evaluate capabilities and safety risks, as well as methods to mitigate those risks," NIST said, but also on collaborative research with the US government.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046240#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046240&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A group representing major film studios said it collaborated with Vietnamese authorities to take down what it called "the largest pirate streaming operation in the world."</p>
<p>Fmovies, which the film industry group also called the "world's largest piracy ring," is said to have drawn more than 6.7 billion visits between January 2023 and June 2024. Launched in 2016, the Hanoi-based outfit included pirate sites bflixz, flixtorz, movies7, myflixer, and aniwave.</p>
<p>"The takedown of Fmovies is a stunning victory for casts, crews, writers, directors, studios, and the creative community across the globe," Motion Picture Association (MPA) CEO Charles Rivkin said today.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046230#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046230&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly earned praise this week with <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-releases-zepboundr-tirzepatide-single-dose-vials-expanding">an announcement</a> that it is now selling starter dosages of its popular weight-loss drug tirzepatide (Zepbound) at a price significantly lower than before. But the cheers were short-lived as critics quickly noticed that Lilly also quietly raised the price on current versions of the drug—a move that was notably missing from the company's press release this week.</p>
<p>In the past, Lilly sold Zepbound only in injectable pens with a list price of $1,060 for a month's supply. Several dosages are available—2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg—and patients progressively increase their dosage until they reach a maintenance dosage. The recommended maintenance dosages are 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg. The higher the dose, the more the weight loss. For instance, people using the 15 mg doses lost an average of <a href="https://zepbound.lilly.com/what-is-zepbound">21 percent of their weight</a> over 17 months in a clinical trial, while those on 5 mg doses only lost an average of 15 percent of their weight.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Lilly announced that it will now sell Zepbound in vials, too. And a month's supply of vials with the 2.5 mg doses will cost $399, while a month's supply of 5 mg doses is priced at $549—a welcome drop from the $1,060 price tag. These prices are for a self-pay option, meaning that patients with a valid, on-label prescription can buy them directly from Lilly if they have no insurance or have insurance that does not cover the drug.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046139#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046139&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The late Rear Admiral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> was a gifted mathematician and undisputed pioneer in computer programming, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/top-apollo-era-navy-computer-scientists-receive-presidential-medal-of-freedom/">honored posthumously</a> in 2016 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She was also very much in demand as a speaker in her later career. Hopper's famous 1982 lecture on "Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People," has long been publicly unavailable because of the obsolete media on which it was recorded. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) finally managed to retrieve the footage for the National Security Agency (NSA), which <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3884041/nsa-releases-copy-of-internal-lecture-delivered-by-computing-giant-rear-adm-gra/">posted the lecture</a> in two parts on YouTube (Part One embedded above, Part Two embedded below).</p>
<p>Hopper earned undergraduate degrees in math and physics from Vassar College and a PhD in math from Yale in 1930. She returned to Vassar as a professor, but when World War II broke out, she sought to enlist in the US Naval Reserve. She was initially denied on the basis of her age (34) and low weight-to-height ratio, and also because her expertise elsewhere made her particularly valuable to the war effort. Hopper got an exemption, and after graduating first in her class, she joined the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University, where she served on the Mark I computer programming staff under Howard H. Aiken.</p>
<p>She stayed with the lab until 1949 and was next hired as a senior mathematician by Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation to develop the Universal Automatic Computer, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/09/univac-the-troubled-life-of-americas-first-computer/">UNIVAC</a>, the first computer. Hopper championed the development of a new programming language based on English words. "It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols," she reasoned. "So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English and the computers would translate them into machine code."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046172#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046172&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Backpage founder Michael Lacey was sentenced yesterday to five years in prison and fined $3 million after being convicted on one count of money laundering. Lacey, 76, was also sentenced to three years of supervised release, the Department of Justice said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-owners-notorious-prostitution-website-backpagecom-sentenced">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Two other Backpage principals—Scott Spear and John "Jed" Brunst—were sentenced to 10 years in prison and three years of supervised release. "The Court also ordered that all defendants turn themselves in to the US Marshals Service by noon on Sept. 11," the Department of Justice said.</p>
<p>Authorities alleged that Backpage generated over $500 million in revenue from running a forum that facilitated prostitution. While Lacey argued that he wasn't involved in day-to-day operations, US District Judge Diane Humetewa "told Lacey during Wednesday's sentencing he was aware of the allegations against Backpage and did nothing," <a href="https://apnews.com/article/backpage-prostitution-sex-ads-michael-lacey-sentencing-fdc90e3293eec40a2f63d2e0d828ff5f">according to the Associated Press</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046155#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046155&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A controversial bill aimed at enforcing safety standards for large artificial intelligence models has now <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-landmark-ai-bill-passes-assembly">passed the California State Assembly</a> by a 45–11 vote. Following <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/bipartisan-vote-senate-passes-senator-wieners-landmark-ai-safety-and-innovation-bill">a 32–1 state Senate vote</a> in May, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/from-sci-fi-to-state-law-californias-plan-to-prevent-ai-catastrophe/">SB-1047</a> now faces just one more procedural state senate vote before heading to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/from-sci-fi-to-state-law-californias-plan-to-prevent-ai-catastrophe/">we've previously explored in depth</a>, SB-1047 asks AI model creators to implement <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/outcry-from-big-ai-firms-over-california-ai-kill-switch-bill/">a "kill switch"</a> that can be activated if that model starts introducing "novel threats to public safety and security," especially if it's acting "with limited human oversight, intervention, or supervision." Some have criticized the bill for focusing on outlandish risks from an imagined future AI rather than real, present-day harms of AI use cases like deep fakes or misinformation.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-landmark-ai-bill-passes-assembly">announcing</a> the legislative passage Wednesday, bill sponsor and state senator Scott Weiner cited support from AI industry luminaries such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/warning-of-ais-danger-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-quits-google-to-speak-freely/">Geoffrey Hinton</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/apple-hires-yet-another-ex-google-ai-leader/">Yoshua Bengio</a> (who both last year also signed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/openai-execs-warn-of-risk-of-extinction-from-artificial-intelligence-in-new-open-letter/">a statement warning of a "risk of extinction"</a> from fast-developing AI tech).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046140#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046140&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you were suspected of a crime, would you trust a chatbot to accurately explain what happened?</p>
<p>Some police departments think the tech is ready. And officers who have started using chatbots to quickly complete their most dreaded task of drafting police reports seemingly don't want to go back to spending hours each week doing their own paperwork.</p>
<p>In June, a police department in Frederick, Colorado, boasted that it was the "first law enforcement agency in the world to go live with Axon Draft One," a new kind of police tech that allows a chatbot to spit out AI-generated police reports almost immediately after a body camera stops recording a police interaction.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046081#p3">Read 70 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046081&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brussels is investigating whether Telegram breached EU digital rules by failing to provide accurate user numbers, as officials push to bring the controversial messaging app under stricter supervision.</p>
<p>EU legal and data experts suspect that the app has understated its presence in the EU to stay under a 45 million user threshold, above which large online platforms are subject to a swath of Brussels regulations designed to check their influence.</p>
<p>The EU probe comes alongside a wide-ranging French investigation into alleged criminal activity on Telegram that led to the arrest on Saturday of its founder, Russian-born billionaire Pavel Durov. On Wednesday evening, a magistrate was due to decide whether to charge or release him.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046110#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046110&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was indicted in France today and ordered to post bail of 5 million euros. The multi-billionaire was forbidden from leaving the country and must report to police twice a week while the case continues.</p>
<p>Charges were detailed in a statement issued today by Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau, which was <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-28-CP-TELEGRAM-mise-en-examen.pdf">provided to Ars</a>. They are nearly identical to the possible charges <a href="https://www.tribunal-de-paris.justice.fr/sites/default/files/2024-08/2024-08-26%20-%20CP%20TELEGRAM%20.pdf">released by Beccuau on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>The first charge listed is complicity in "web-mastering an online platform in order to enable an illegal transaction in organized group." Today's press release said this charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a 500,000-euro fine.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046072#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046072&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malicious hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in a widely used security camera to spread Mirai, a family of malware that wrangles infected Internet of Things devices into large networks for use in attacks that take down websites and other Internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>The attacks target the AVM1203, a surveillance device from Taiwan-based manufacturer AVTECH, network security provider Akamai <a href="https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/2024-corona-mirai-botnet-infects-zero-day-sirt">said Wednesday</a>. Unknown attackers have been exploiting a 5-year-old vulnerability since March. The zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-7029, is easy to exploit and allows attackers to execute malicious code. The AVM1203 is no longer sold or supported, so no update is available to fix the critical zero-day.</p>
<h2>That time a ragtag army shook the Internet</h2>
<p>Akamai said that the attackers are exploiting the vulnerability so they can install a variant of Mirai, which arrived in September 2016 when a botnet of infected devices <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/why-the-silencing-of-krebsonsecurity-opens-a-troubling-chapter-for-the-net/">took down</a> cybersecurity news site Krebs on Security. Mirai contained functionality that allowed a ragtag army of compromised webcams, routers, and other types of IoT devices to wage distributed denial-of-service attacks of record-setting sizes. In the weeks that followed, the Mirai botnet delivered similar attacks on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/botnet-of-145k-cameras-reportedly-deliver-internets-biggest-ddos-ever/">Internet service providers</a> and other targets. One such attack, against dynamic domain name provider Dyn <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/double-dip-internet-of-things-botnet-attack-felt-across-the-internet/">paralyzed</a> vast swaths of the Internet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046043#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046043&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Five more people have died in a nationwide outbreak of <em>Listeria </em>infections linked to contaminated Boar's Head brand meats, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24.html#cdc_outbreak_main_guide-what-you-should-do">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>To date, 57 people across 18 states have been sickened, all of whom required hospitalization. A total of eight have died. The latest tally makes this the largest listeriosis outbreak in the US since 2011, when cantaloupe processed in an unsanitary facility led to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1215837">147 <em>Listeria</em> infections</a> in 28 states, causing 33 deaths, the CDC notes.</p>
<p>The new cases and deaths come after a massive recall of more than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/">7 million pounds of Boar's Head meat products</a>, which encompassed 71 of the company's products. That recall was <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/boars-head-provisions-co--expands-recall-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due">announced on July 30</a>, which itself was an expansion of a July 26 recall of an additional 207,528 pounds of Boar's Head products. By August 8, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/another-death-in-nationwide-outbreak-that-spurred-massive-meat-recall/">the CDC last provided an update</a> on the outbreak, the number of cases had hit 43, with 43 hospitalizations and three deaths.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046040#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046040&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google's Gemini AI model is once again able to generate images of humans after that function was "paused" in February following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/googles-hidden-ai-diversity-prompts-lead-to-outcry-over-historically-inaccurate-images/">outcry over historically inaccurate racial depictions</a> in many results.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-update-august-2024/">a blog post</a>, Google said that its Imagen 3 model—which was first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/google-strikes-back-at-openai-with-project-astra-ai-agent-prototype/">announced</a> in May—will "start to roll out the generation of images of people" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users in the "coming days." But a version of that Imagen model—complete with human image-generation capabilities—was recently made available to the public <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/imagen-3/">via the Gemini Labs test environment</a> without a paid subscription (though a Google account is needed to log in).</p>
<p>That new model comes with some safeguards to try to avoid the creation of controversial images, of course. Google writes in its announcement that it doesn't support "the generation of photorealistic, identifiable individuals, depictions of minors or excessively gory, violent or sexual scenes." In <a href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/posts/faq">an FAQ</a>, Google clarifies that the prohibition on "identifiable individuals" includes "certain queries that could lead to outputs of prominent people." In Ars' testing, that meant a query like "President Biden playing basketball" would be refused, while a more generic request for "a US president playing basketball" would generate multiple options.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045999#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045999&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Midjourney, a company best known for its robust AI image-generation tool, has publicly announced that it's "getting into hardware" and has invited job-seekers to apply to join its new hardware division.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://x.com/midjourney/status/1828839444130214208?s=46">shared the announcement</a> on its official X account earlier today.</p>
<p>Midjourney founder David Holz previously worked at a hardware company; he was CTO of Leap Motion. A few months ago, he hired Ahmad Abbas,  whom he worked with at Leap Motion. Abbas also worked at Apple for five years as a hardware manager working on the Vision Pro headset. His <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-abbas-28460662/">LinkedIn profile</a> now lists his current title as "Head of Hardware, Midjourney."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046020#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046020&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
