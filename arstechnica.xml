                            <![CDATA[<p>Modern medicine's loss is social media's gain. Since the pandemic hit, public trust in science and evidence-based medicine, like lifesaving vaccines, has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/">declined</a>. Yet, trust in the anecdotal and often bonkers health advice that endlessly swirls on social media only seems to have risen—and that trust seems unshakeable.</p>
<p>A perfect example of this is ivermectin. In the early stages of the pandemic, some laboratory data suggested that ivermectin—a decades-old deworming drug—<em><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7129059/">might </a></em><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7129059/">be able to prevent or treat COVID-19</a>. The antiparasitic drug was initially used in the 1970s to treat worm infections in animals, but years later, it gained FDA approval as a prescription drug for treating parasitic infections in humans, including river blindness.</p>
<p>Before scientists could conduct clinical trials to know if ivermectin could also treat the new viral infection, COVID-19, the idea took off, mainly among conservatives. Anecdotes and misinformation ballooned.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/people-still-clamor-for-deworming-drug-falsely-claimed-to-be-cure-all/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It would have been exceptionally easy for Nintendo to stick with an established formula for <em>Mario Kart World</em>. While the series has added a few crucial new features here and there since its Super NES debut, it has settled into an extremely comfortable groove since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/mario-kart-8-review-one-step-forward-one-step-back/">the 2014 release of <em>Mario Kart 8</em></a> on the ill-fated Wii U. Since then, we've seen the franchise lean on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/mario-kart-8s-first-dlc-pack-is-a-love-letter-to-nostalgic-nintendo-fans/">nostalgia-rich DLC</a> as it introduced a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/mario-kart-8-is-still-great-in-its-deluxe-switch-edition/">barely differentiated Switch port</a> and a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/mario-kart-8-deluxes-new-expansion-is-good-so-far-but-is-it-worth-25/">series of course-packed expansions</a> rather than another distinct sequel. Save for the expert-level, ultra-fast 200cc racing mode, the broad strokes of a Mario Kart game have gone from staid to practically frozen in amber in recent years.</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World</em> doesn't completely abandon the basic structure of those previous Mario Kart games; there are still twisty, turny, shortcut-filled courses loaded with items and opportunities to power slide. But it builds on that skeleton more than any Mario Kart game ever has, adding new modes, new driving techniques, and a new focus on the vast swathes of land between the intricately designed race courses. The result can feel a little inconsistent but also like a necessary shot of new ideas into a series that has been growing stale.</p>
<h2>Too many karts</h2>
<p>The first thing you're liable to notice loading up a race in <em>Mario Kart World</em> is just how crowded things have gotten. The expansion to 24 racers on each track (from 12 in <em>Mario Kart 8</em> and eight in previous franchise titles) serves as a good way to show off the added processing power of the Switch 2. It also provides a good excuse to greatly expand the number of selectable characters and outfits available in the game, which dredge up options from some of the deeper depths of the Mario catalog (your day has finally arrived, <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Sidestepper">Sidestepper</a> fans).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/mario-kart-world-review-getting-there-is-half-the-game/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is facing widespread criticism after threatening to revoke EchoStar licenses for spectrum bands that rival firms, including SpaceX, want to take over. Opposition to license revocations came from conservatives, telecom consumer advocates, and some industry groups.</p>
<p>The Free State Foundation, a free-market group that has generally supported Republican priorities at the FCC, filed <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1060658425016/1">comments</a> saying that "arbitrary" decisions would create instability in the market for wireless broadband deployment. EchoStar is now facing regulatory uncertainty less than a year after obtaining deadline extensions for its wireless network buildout, the Free State Foundation said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is widespread agreement that constructing and operating wireless broadband networks depends on significant private market investment. Legal stability is a necessary ingredient for the operation of any marketplace conducive to competition and growth, including today's dynamic wireless market. Before risking their money in commercial ventures, private investors reasonably seek assurance that their interests and rights will be protected from changes in the rules or agency actions that are arbitrary or unforeseen... Rescission of deadline extension orders granted months earlier undoubtedly creates a type of regulatory uncertainty.</p></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/fcc-threatens-echostar-licenses-for-spectrum-that-spacex-wants-to-use/">previously reported</a>, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr directed agency staff to investigate EchoStar's compliance with obligations to provide nationwide 5G service under the terms of its spectrum licenses. EchoStar bought Dish Network in December 2023 and offers wireless service under the Boost Mobile brand.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/fcc-threat-to-revoke-echostar-spectrum-licenses-draws-widespread-backlash/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have unearthed two publicly available exploits that completely evade protections offered by Secure Boot, the industry-wide mechanism for ensuring devices load only secure operating system images during the boot-up process. Microsoft is taking action to block one exploit and allowing the other one to remain a viable threat.</p>
<p>As part of Tuesday's monthly security update routine, Microsoft <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-3052">patched</a> CVE-2025-3052, a Secure Boot bypass vulnerability affecting more than 50 device makers. More than a dozen modules that allow devices from these manufacturers to run on Linux allow an attacker with physical access to turn off Secure Boot and, from there, go on to install malware that runs before the operating system loads. Such “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack">evil maid</a>” attacks are precisely the threat Secure Boot is designed to prevent. The vulnerability can also be exploited remotely to make infections stealthier and more powerful if an attacker has already gained administrative control of a machine.</p>
<h2>A single point of failure</h2>
<p>The underlying cause of the vulnerability is a critical vulnerability in a tool used to flash firmware images on the motherboards of devices sold by DT Research, a manufacturer of rugged mobile devices. It has <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a11996aaf7f32aa09f78db608106e25a47970bfeeec76d49af743eee71b55f06/">been available</a> on VirusTotal since last year and was digitally signed in 2022, an indication it has been available through other channels since at least that earlier date.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/unearthed-in-the-wild-2-secure-boot-exploits-microsoft-patches-only-1-of-them/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has struck a deal to use Google's cloud computing infrastructure for AI despite the two companies' fierce competition in the space, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/">reports</a> Reuters. The agreement, finalized in May after months of negotiations, marks a shift in OpenAI's strategy to diversify its computing resources beyond Microsoft Azure, which had been its exclusive cloud provider until January.</p>
<p>Microsoft's long-standing partnership with OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/openai-and-microsoft-reaffirm-shared-quest-for-powerful-ai-with-new-investment/">dates back to 2019</a>, with significant expansions of investment from the computer giant in 2021 and 2023. In October, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-eases-away-from-microsoft-data-centers">reported</a> that the ChatGPT maker had begun to seek data center deals elsewhere, citing the need for more AI data center servers faster than Microsoft could supply them.</p>
<p>Under the new deal, Google Cloud will provide additional computing capacity to help OpenAI train and run its AI models. For OpenAI, the partnership addresses growing demands for computing power as the company's annual revenue <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openais-annualized-revenue-hits-10-billion-up-55-billion-december-2024-2025-06-09/">reached $10 billion</a> as of June, according to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/openai-signs-surprise-deal-with-google-cloud-despite-fierce-ai-rivalry/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After months of speculation and beta testing, Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-16">rolling out Android 16</a> starting today. The new software will arrive first on Pixel phones, but you can expect to see updates on other phones in the coming weeks—or more likely months.</p>
<p>For those with Pixel devices, the OTA should begin appearing soon. If you just can't wait, Google will have <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images">system images</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota">update files</a> on its developer pages. You probably don't need to get up in arms about potential delays, though. Like other recent Android updates, there aren't many changes bundled into this version. Many of the most interesting changes are coming later this year.</p>
<h2>Android 16 has landed</h2>
<p>Despite the light feature set at launch, there are a few things of note. Right at the top of the list is a cleaner notification shade. Google launched bundled notifications in Android 7.0 Nougat, which has helped to clean up phones ever since. With Android 16, Google is stepping up notification bundling by forcing it on apps. Now, multiple notifications from a single app will be merged together into a single expandable item. Neat.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-begins-rolling-out-today-to-pixel-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ana de Armas shone in the original <em>Knives Out</em> (2019) and as one of the best Bond girls in recent memory in <em>No Time to Die</em> (2021). She proves herself a fierce and lethal adversary against a cultish syndicate in the new film <em>Ballerina</em>—excuse me, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_World_of_John_Wick:_Ballerina">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</a>.</em> (Why, Lionsgate? Just... why?) I love them all, but this is probably my favorite John Wick film since the original in 2014 (which may never be surpassed).</p>
<p><strong>(Mostly mild spoilers, and a couple of significant reveals below the gallery. We'll give you a heads-up when we get there.)</strong></p>
<p>Chronologically, <em>Ballerina</em> takes place during the events of <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/high-octane-ballerina-trailer-has-plenty-of-action-and-a-john-wick-cameo/">previously reported</a>, <em>Parabellum</em> found Wick declared excommunicado from the High Table for killing crime lord Santino D'Antonio on the grounds of the Continental. On the run with a bounty on his head, he made his way to the headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston), where he was trained as an assassin. The Director also trains girls to be ballerina-assassins, one of whom is Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas). We see snippets of these events from Eve's perspective in <em>Ballerina</em>, just to establish the continuity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/review-the-john-wick-franchise-is-alive-and-kicking-with-ballerina/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Meta has developed plans to create a new artificial intelligence research lab dedicated to pursuing "superintelligence," according to reporting from The New York Times. The social media giant chose 28-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandr_Wang">Alexandr Wang</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_AI">Scale AI</a>, to join the new lab as part of a broader reorganization of Meta's AI efforts under CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Superintelligence refers to a hypothetical AI system that would exceed human cognitive abilities—a step beyond artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to match an intelligent human's capability for learning new tasks without intensive specialized training.</p>
<p>However, much like AGI, superintelligence remains a nebulous term in the field. Since scientists still poorly understand the mechanics of human intelligence, and because human intelligence resists simple quantification with no single definition, identifying superintelligence when it arrives will present significant challenges.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/after-ai-setbacks-meta-bets-billions-on-undefined-superintelligence/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Recently, during the first Ars Live event of this year, two noted space journalists joined Ars space editor Eric Berger for a discussion of NASA's future in the age of the second Trump administration.</p>
<p>During the hour-long discussion, Christian Davenport of The Washington Post and Joey Roulette of Reuters covered a range of issues, from uncertainty at the space agency to the likelihood of NASA sponsoring a humans-to-Mars mission any time soon.</p>
<p>This is an especially frenetic time in space policy. In the days since this video was recorded, President Trump canceled the longstanding nomination of private astronaut Jared Isaacman to become NASA administrator—at the time we recorded the video, Senate approval was assured, and a vote was imminent. Then Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk had a serious falling out, with the two trading nasty words on social media and culminating in Musk threatening to end Dragon spacecraft missions before pulling back.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/ars-live-recap-where-does-nasa-go-from-here/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>A study, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.70238">published Monday</a> in the journal Global Change Biology<i>,</i> found that ocean acidification—the process in which the world’s oceans absorb excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, becoming more acidic—crossed a “planetary boundary” five years ago.</p>
<p>“A lot of people think it’s not so bad,” said Nina Bednaršek, one of the study’s authors and a senior researcher at Oregon State University. “But what we’re showing is that all of the changes that were projected, and even more so, are already happening—in all corners of the world, from the most pristine to the little corner you care about. We have not changed just one bay, we have changed the whole ocean on a global level.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ocean-acidification-crosses-planetary-boundaries/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, IBM released its plans for building a system that should push quantum computing into entirely new territory: a system that can both perform useful calculations while catching and fixing errors and be utterly impossible to model using classical computing methods. The hardware, which will be called Starling, is expected to be able to perform 100 million operations without error on a collection of 200 logical qubits. And the company expects to have it available for use in 2029.</p>
<p>Perhaps just as significant, IBM is also committing to a detailed description of the intermediate steps to Starling. These include a number of processors that will be configured to host a collection of error-corrected qubits, essentially forming a functional compute unit. This marks a major transition for the company, as it involves moving away from talking about collections of individual hardware qubits and focusing instead on units of functional computational hardware. If all goes well, it should be possible to build Starling by chaining a sufficient number of these compute units together.</p>
<p>"We're updating [our roadmap] now with a series of deliverables that are very precise," IBM VP Jay Gambetta told Ars, "because we feel that we've now answered basically all the science questions associated with error correction and it's becoming more of a path towards an engineering problem."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ibm-is-now-detailing-what-its-first-quantum-compute-system-will-look-like/">Read full article</a></p>

He wrote: “Let me introduce the word ‘hypertext’ to mean a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.” The paper was part of a grand vision he called Xanadu, after the poem by Samuel Coleridge. </em></p>
<p><em>A decade later, in his book “Dream Machines/Computer Lib,” he described Xanadu thusly: “To give you a screen in your home from which you can see into the world’s hypertext libraries.” He admitted that the world didn’t have any hypertext libraries yet, but that wasn’t the point. One day, maybe soon, it would. And he was going to dedicate his life to making it happen.</em></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The support list for macOS Tahoe still includes Intel Macs, but it has been whittled down to just four models, all released in 2019 or 2020. We speculated that this meant that the end was near for Intel Macs, and now we can confirm just <em>how</em> near it is: macOS Tahoe will be the last new macOS release to support any Intel Macs. All new releases starting with macOS 27 will require an Apple Silicon Mac.</p>
<p>Apple will provide additional security updates for Tahoe until fall 2028, two years after it is replaced with macOS 27. That's a typical schedule for older macOS versions, which all get one year of major point updates that include security fixes and new features, followed by two years of security-only updates to keep them patched but without adding significant new features.</p>
<p>Apple is also planning changes to Rosetta 2, the Intel-to-Arm app translation technology created to ease the transition between the Intel and Apple Silicon eras. Rosetta will continue to work as a general-purpose app translation tool in both macOS 26 and macOS 27.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apple-details-the-end-of-intel-mac-support-and-a-phaseout-for-rosetta-2/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Mercedes-Benz provided flights from Detroit to Stuttgart and accommodation so Ars could drive the GLC prototype at its test track. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>IMMENDINGEN, Germany—The Mercedes-Benz Testing and Technology Center in Immendingen, Germany, isn't a top-secret facility because of its location. It's top secret because of what happens on the 520 hectares of land. Its 62-kilometer track is where Mercedes engineers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/we-test-an-electric-mercedes-that-can-can-go-747-miles-on-a-single-charge/">can develop and hone</a> every new vehicle in conditions experienced all around the world. Experiencing those conditions in a prototype is why I was there on an annoyingly rainy day.</p>
<p>After receiving the tour in a new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, I settled into the driving seat of the all-new Mercedes-Benz GLC with EQ Technology—that's the electric one. Being a prototype, it was still wearing camouflage, and the interior was covered in black fabric, so I couldn't see everything. But I was assured that the ride, handling, and performance are all sorted. The infotainment software and interior details are still being finalized.</p>
<p>The upcoming GLC is slightly longer than its gasoline-powered counterpart to accommodate the 94.5 kWh battery pack. Mercedes is estimating 650 kilometers of range on the optimistic WLTP testing cycle. Based on some rough math, 330 miles on the EPA cycle seems about right.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/mercedes-next-electric-glc-rides-great-weve-driven-the-prototype/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112">In an opinion piece published Monday in The Wall Street Journal</a>, Kennedy announced that he had cleared out the committee, accusing them of being "plagued with persistent conflicts of interest" and a group that has "become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine."</p>
<p>"Without removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028," Kennedy added.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-fires-entire-cdc-panel-of-vaccine-advisors/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, the chief executive of Blue Origin, Dave Limp, convened an all-hands meeting for the more than 12,000 employees at the company. Among the most critical items he discussed was the launch rate for the New Glenn rocket and how the company would fall significantly short of its goal for this year.</p>
<p>Before 2025 began, Limp had set expectations alongside Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos: New Glenn would launch eight times this year.</p>
<p>However, since the rocket's mostly successful debut in January, five months have passed. At one point the company targeted "late spring" for the second launch of the rocket. However, on Monday, Limp acknowledged on social media that the rocket's next flight will now no longer take place until at least August 15. Although he did not say so, this may well be the only other New Glenn launch this year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/second-new-glenn-launch-slips-toward-fall-as-program-leadership-departs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every year, Apple releases new versions of iOS and iPadOS, and most years those updates also end support for a handful of devices that are too old or too slow or otherwise incapable of running the new software.</p>
<p>Though this year's macOS 26 Tahoe release was unkind to Intel Macs, the iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 releases are more generous, dropping support for just two iPhone models and a single iPad. The iOS 26 update won't run on 2018's iPhone XR or XS, and iPadOS 26 won't run on 2019's 7th-generation iPad. Any other device that can currently run iOS or iPadOS 18 will be able to upgrade to the new versions and pick up the new Liquid Glass look, among other features.</p>

<p>Apple never provides explicit reasoning for why it drops the devices it drops, though they can usually be explained by some combination of age and technical capability. The 7th-gen iPad, for example, was still using a 2017-vintage Apple A10X chip despite being introduced a number of years later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/ios-and-ipados-26-will-run-on-most-things-that-support-ios-and-ipados-18/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>A <a href="https://spaceforcestarshipeis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Draft-SpaceX-Starship-Super-Heavy-CCSFS-Environmental-Impact-Statement.pdf">draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)</a> released this week by the Department of the Air Force, which includes the Space Force, found SpaceX's planned use of Space Launch Complex 37 (SLC-37) at Cape Canaveral would have no significant negative impacts on local environmental, historical, social, and cultural interests. The Air Force also found SpaceX's plans at SLC-37 will have no significant impact on the company's competitors in the launch industry.</p>
<p>The Defense Department is leading the environmental review and approval process for SpaceX to take over the launch site, which the Space Force previously leased to United Launch Alliance, one of SpaceX's chief rivals in the US launch industry.

The macOS 26 update will support just four Intel Macs, all released in 2019 or 2020, and it entirely drops support for all Intel versions of the MacBook Air and Mac mini.</p>
<p>Other models that run the current macOS 15 Sequoia release that <em>won't</em> support macOS Tahoe include all 15-inch MacBook Pros, all 13-inch MacBook Pros with two Thunderbolt ports, and the 4K and 5K versions of the 2019 iMac.</p>

<p>Apple has generally been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-case-for-and-against-macos-15-sequoia-being-the-final-release-for-intel-macs/">pulling support for new macOS releases</a> from Intel Macs more aggressively than it was in the mid-to-late 2010s, giving most systems six-ish years of new macOS releases followed by another two years of security updates. Some models fared better than others; for example, Intel MacBook Air models have been getting dropped more aggressively than MacBook Pros.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/macos-tahoe-signals-that-the-end-is-near-for-intel-macs-dumping-all-but-four-models/">Read full article</a></p>
