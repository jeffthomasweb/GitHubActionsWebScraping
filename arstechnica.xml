                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>History buffs are no doubt familiar with the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrack_Byfield">Shadrack Byfield</a>, a rank-and-file British redcoat who fought during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812">War of 1812</a> and lost his left arm to a musket ball for his trouble. Byfield has been featured in numerous popular histories—including a children's book and a 2011 PBS documentary—as a shining example of a disabled soldier's stoic perseverance. But a newly rediscovered memoir that Byfield published in his later years is complicating that idealized picture of his post-military life, according to a new paper published in the Journal of British Studies.</p>
<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Historian <a href="https://www.mun.ca/history/people/post-doc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eamonn O'Keeffe</a> of Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, Canada, has been a Byfield fan ever since he read the 1985 children's novel, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7906601-redcoat"><em>Redcoat</em></a>, by Gregory Sass. His interest grew when he was working at Fort York, a War of 1812-era fort and museum, in Toronto. "There are dozens of memoirs written by British rank-and-file veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, but only a handful from the War of 1812, which was much smaller in scale," O'Keeffe told Ars. "Byfield's autobiography seemed to offer an authentic, ground-level view of the fighting in North America, helping us look beyond the generals and politicians and grapple with the implications of this conflict for ordinary people.</span></p>
<p>Born in 1789 in Wiltshire's Bradford-on-Avon suburbs, Byfield's parents intended him to follow in his weaver father's footsteps. He enlisted in the county militia when he turned 18 instead, joining the regular army the following year. When the War of 1812 broke out, Byfield was stationed at Fort George along the Niagara River, participating in the successful siege of Fort Detroit. At the Battle of Frenchtown in January 1813, he was shot in the neck, but he recovered sufficiently to join the campaigns against Fort Meigs and Fort Stephenson in Ohio.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/a-british-redcoats-lost-memoir-resurfaces/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth touted their desire to “make <i>Star Trek</i> real”—while unconsciously reminding us of what the utopian science fiction franchise is fundamentally about.</p>
<p>Their Tuesday event was the latest in Hegseth’s ongoing “Arsenal of Freedom” tour, which was held at SpaceX headquarters in Starbase, Texas. (Itself a newly created town that takes its name from a term popularized by <i>Star Trek</i>.)</p>
<p>Neither Musk nor Hegseth seemed to recall that the “Arsenal of Freedom” phrase—at least in the context of <i>Star Trek</i>—is also the title of a 1988 episode of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation. </i>That episode depicts an AI-powered weapons system, and its automated salesman, which destroys an entire civilization and eventually threatens the crew of the <em>USS</em> <em>Enterprise</em>. (Some <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adam.holisky.com/post/3mcdvfudnks2c">Trekkies</a> made the connection, however.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/pentagons-arsenal-of-freedom-tour-borrows-name-from-star-trek-episode-about-killer-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October is now wildly accelerating, doubling in just the past week to a total of <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak">434 cases</a>, with 409 people currently in quarantine.</p>
<p>Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-124-new-measles-cases-upstate-new-public-exposures-and">124 more cases</a> since last Friday, which had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/measles-continues-raging-in-south-carolina-99-new-cases-since-tuesday/">99 new cases</a> since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to <a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-26-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-211">211 cases</a>.</p>
<p>With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/sc-measles-outbreak-has-gone-berserk-124-cases-since-friday-409-quarantined/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has fixed a vulnerability in its Copilot AI assistant that allowed hackers to pluck a host of sensitive user data with a single click on a URL.</p>
<p>The hackers in this case were white-hat researchers from <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/reprompt">security firm Varonis</a>. The net effect of their multistage attack was that they exfiltrated data, including the target’s name, location, and details of specific events from the user’s Copilot chat history. The attack continued to run even when the user closed the Copilot chat, with no further interaction needed once the user clicked the link in the email. The attack and resulting data theft bypassed enterprise endpoint security controls and detection by endpoint protection apps.</p>
<h2>It just works</h2>
<p>“Once we deliver this link with this malicious prompt, the user just has to click on the link and the malicious task is immediately executed,” Varonis security researcher Dolev Taler told Ars. “Even if the user just clicks on the link and immediately closes the tab of Copilot chat, the exploit still works.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/a-single-click-mounted-a-covert-multistage-attack-against-copilot/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>Since the days of <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> and <em>Doom</em>, the humble first-person shooter has flourished in myriad and complex directions.

<p>For those times, there is <em>Oddcore</em>, a new Early Access, roguelike boomer shooter that is a stark contrast to the more sprawling self-serious shooters out there. The game's combination of frenetic, quick-moving action, semi-randomized scenarios, and well-balanced risk/reward upgrade system makes for a pick-up-and-play shooter that I find myself struggling not to pick up and play for a few more quick-hit sessions even as I write this.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/i-cant-stop-shooting-oddcores-endless-waves-of-weird-little-guys/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The FBI searched a Washington Post reporter's home and seized her work and personal devices as part of an investigation into what Attorney General Pam Bondi called "illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor."</p>
<p>Executing a search warrant at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson on Wednesday morning, FBI "agents searched her home and her devices, seizing her phone, two laptops and a Garmin watch," The Washington Post <a href="https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/14/washington-post-reporter-search/">reported</a>. "One of the laptops was her personal computer, the other a Washington Post-issued laptop. Investigators told Natanson that she is not the focus of the probe."</p>
<p>Natanson regularly uses encrypted Signal chats to communicate with people who work or used to work in government, and has said her list of contacts exceeds 1,100 current and former government employees. The Post itself "received a subpoena Wednesday morning seeking information related to the same government contractor," the report said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fbi-fights-leaks-by-seizing-washington-post-reporters-phone-laptops-and-watch/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Like most (non-sexual) House scandals, the allegations here involve personal enrichment. Unlike most (non-sexual) House scandals, though, this one involved hundreds of government cell phones being sold on eBay—and some rando member of We the People calling the US House IT help desk, which blew the lid on the whole scheme.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Bandcamp <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/BandCamp/comments/1qbw8ba/ai_generated_music_on_bandcamp/">announced</a> on Reddit that it will no longer permit AI-generated music on its platform. "Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted on Bandcamp," the company wrote in a post to the r/bandcamp subreddit. The new policy also prohibits "any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles."</p>
<p>The policy draws a line that some in the music community have debated: Where does tool use end and full automation begin? AI models are not artists in themselves, since they lack personhood and creative intent. But people do use AI tools to make music, and the spectrum runs from using AI for minor assistance (cleaning up audio, suggesting chord progressions) to typing a prompt and letting a model generate an entire track. Bandcamp's policy targets the latter end of that spectrum while leaving room for human artists who incorporate AI tools into a larger creative process.</p>
<p>The announcement emphasized the platform's desire to protect its community of human artists. "The fact that Bandcamp is home to such a vibrant community of real people making incredible music is something we want to protect and maintain," the company wrote. Bandcamp asked users to flag suspected AI-generated content through its reporting tools, and the company said it reserves "the right to remove any music on suspicion of being AI generated."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/bandcamp-bans-purely-ai-generated-music-from-its-platform/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A New York man is suing Prenuvo, a celebrity-endorsed whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provider, claiming that the company missed clear signs of trouble in his $2,500 whole-body scan—and if it hadn't, he could have acted to avert the catastrophic stroke he suffered months later.</p>
<p>Sean Clifford and his legal team claim that his scan on July 15, 2023, showed a 60 percent narrowing and irregularity in a major artery in his brain—the proximal right middle cerebral artery, a branch of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556132/">the most common artery involved in acute strokes</a>. But Prenuvo's reviews of the scan did not flag the finding and otherwise reported everything in his brain looked normal; there was "no adverse finding." (You can read Prenuvo's report and see Clifford's subsequent imaging <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=x3/W6aOHU_PLUS_hPKAJ4AMNnAw==&amp;system=prod">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Clifford suffered a massive stroke on March 7, 2024. Subsequent imaging found that the proximal right middle cerebral artery progressed to a complete blockage, causing the stroke. Clifford suffered paralysis of his left hand and leg, general weakness on his left side, vision loss and permanent double vision, anxiety, depression, mood swings, cognitive deficits, speech problems, and permanent difficulties with all daily activities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/man-got-2500-whole-body-mri-that-found-no-problems-then-had-massive-stroke/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A 14,400-year-old wolf puppy’s last meal is shedding light on the last days of one of the Ice Age’s most iconic megafauna species, the woolly rhinoceros.</p>
<p>When researchers dissected the frozen mummified remains of an Ice Age wolf puppy, they found a partially digested chunk of meat in its stomach: the remnants of the puppy’s last meal 14,400 years ago. DNA testing revealed that the meat was a prime cut of woolly rhinoceros, a now-extinct 2-metric-ton behemoth that once stomped across the tundras of Europe and Asia. Stockholm University paleogeneticist Sólveig Guðjónsdóttir and her colleagues recently sequenced a full genome from the piece of meat, which reveals some secrets about woolly rhino populations in the centuries before their extinction.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has toyed with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-gemini-ai-can-now-see-your-search-history/">personalized answers</a> in Gemini, but that was just a hint of what was to come. Today, the company is <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/personal-intelligence">announcing</a> extensive "personal intelligence" in Gemini that allows the chatbot to connect to Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube to craft more useful answers to your questions. If you don't want Gemini to get to know you, there's some good news. Personal intelligence is beginning as a feature for paid users, and it's entirely optional.</p>
<p>By every measure, Google's models are at or near the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/">top of the AI heap</a>. In general, the more information you feed into a generative AI, the better the outputs are. And when that data is personal to you, the resulting inference is theoretically more useful. Google just so happens to have a lot of personal data on all its users, so it's relatively simple to feed that data into Gemini.</p>
<p>As Personal Intelligence rolls out over the coming weeks, AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will see the option to connect those data sources. Each can be connected individually, so you might choose to allow Gmail access but block Photos, for example. When Gemini is allowed access to other Google products, it incorporates that data into its responses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/gemini-can-now-scan-your-photos-email-and-more-to-provide-better-answers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After repeatedly denying for weeks that his force used AI tools, the chief constable of the West Midlands police has finally admitted that a hugely controversial decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from the UK did involve hallucinated information from Microsoft Copilot.</p>
<p>In October 2025, Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) met to decide whether an upcoming football match between Aston Villa (based in Birmingham) and Maccabi Tel Aviv could be held safely.</p>
<p>Tensions were heightened in part due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_synagogue_attack">an October 2 terror attack</a> against a synagogue in Manchester where several people were killed by an Islamic attacker.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/deny-deny-admit-uk-police-used-copilot-ai-hallucination-when-banning-football-fans/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The rule, which does not require action by Congress, includes a suite of procedural changes to section 401 of the Clean Water Act—a law enacted in the 1970s that is the primary federal statute governing water pollution in the United States.</p>
<p>For decades, section 401 has granted states and tribes the authority to approve, impose conditions on, or reject, federal permits for projects that they determine will pollute or damage local waterways.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/epa-makes-it-harder-for-states-tribes-to-block-pipelines/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Like any industry led by designers, the automotive world is subject to trends and fashions. Often, these are things the rest of us complain about. Wheels <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/can-we-please-just-go-back-to-using-smaller-wheels-and-tires/">that used to be 16 inches are now 20s</a>, because the extra size makes the vehicle they're fitted to look smaller, particularly if it's an SUV with a slab of electric vehicle battery to conceal. Front seat passengers now find themselves with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/ai-good-passenger-infotainment-screens-bad-says-car-technology-survey/">their own infotainment screen</a>, often with some kind of active filter tech to prevent the driver from being distracted by whatever it is they're doing. And of course <em>le buzz du jour</em>, AI, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/in-car-ai-assistant-coming-to-fords-and-lincolns-in-2027/">is being crammed in</a> here, there, and everywhere.</p>
<p>But the thing about fashion and trends is that they don't remain in style forever. For a few years, it was hard to drive a new car that didn't use piano black trim all over the interior. The shiny black plastic surfaces hide infotainment screens well when the display is not turned on, but they scratch and show every speck of dust and lint and every smudge and fingerprint. And that's true for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/the-2023-kia-niro-returns-with-3-electrified-flavors/">cheap econobox</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/the-bentley-flying-spur-hybrid-proves-electric-motors-improve-the-breed/">plush luxobarge</a>. The industry finally cottoned on to this, and "black gloss has had its time—we can do without it," Kia designer Jochen Paesen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-our-first-look-at-kias-ev9-three-row-electric-suv/">told me a few years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Many of those design trends may have been annoying, but the switch away from buttons isn't just about aesthetics; it's affecting safety. And increasingly, safety regulators are pushing back. A couple of years ago, we learned that the Euro New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) organization, which crash tests cars for European consumers, decided that from 2026, it would start deducting points for basic controls that weren't separate, physical controls that the driver can easily operate without taking their eyes off the road. And now ANCAP, which provides similar crash testing for Australia and New Zealand, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.ancap.com.au/app/public/assets/55242003ce81cea982bcf523ce917f1763ea1ad6/original.pdf">has done the same</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/buttons-in-cars-australian-crash-testers-are-latest-to-require-them/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">BMW provided flights from Washington, DC, to Malaga, Spain, and accommodation so Ars could drive the iX3 and be briefed on the electric M Neue Klasse. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Late last year, we drove <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/great-handling-advanced-ev-tech-we-drive-the-2026-bmw-ix3/">BMW's new iX3</a>. It's the first of a series of electric BMWs to use a newly developed platform, known as the "Neue Klasse." Later this year, we'll see the first fully electric version of the 3 Series when the i3 sedan debuts. And next year, BMW enthusiasts will finally find out what the brand's M division—which infuses motorsport into the vehicles like few others—can do with an EV.</p>
<p>There have been M-tuned EVs before now, more powerful variants of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-2023-bmw-i4-is-the-electric-bmw-sedan-youve-been-waiting-for/">i4</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/05/dial-m-for-more-power-more-handling-the-2023-bmw-ix-m60-tested/">iX</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/the-2024-bmw-i7-m70-electric-luxury-turned-up-to-11/">i7</a>. And each time we've driven them, BMW has been at pains to point out that these weren't true M cars, not like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/the-2021-bmw-m3-when-youre-driving-it-you-dont-have-to-see-its-nose/">M3</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-bmw-m5-touring-review-way-more-power-way-too-much-weight/">M5</a>. Honestly, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-bmw-i4-edrive40-might-be-the-best-electric-sedan-on-sale-today/">they weren't better than the cheaper, less powerful versions</a>, something that won't be allowed for next year's performance EV, which might be called something like the iM3, assuming the naming convention remains logic-based.</p>
<p>"The next generation of models are set to establish a new benchmark in the high-performance vehicle segment," says Franciscus van Meel, managing director of BMW M GmbH. "With the latest generation of Neue Klasse technology, we are taking the BMW M driving experience to a new level and will inspire our customers with outstanding, racetrack-ready driving dynamics for everyday use."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/bmws-first-electric-m-car-is-coming-in-2027-with-one-motor-per-wheel/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have discovered a never-before-seen framework that infects Linux machines with a wide assortment of modules that are notable for the range of advanced capabilities they provide to attackers.</p>
<p>The framework, referred to as VoidLink by its source code, features more than 30 modules that can be used to customize capabilities to meet attackers' needs for each infected machine. These modules can provide additional stealth and specific tools for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement inside a compromised network. The components can be easily added or removed as objectives change over the course of a campaign.</p>
<h2>A focus on Linux inside the cloud</h2>
<p>VoidLink can target machines within popular cloud services by detecting if an infected machine is hosted inside AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent, and there are indications that developers plan to add detections for Huawei, DigitalOcean, and Vultr in future releases. To detect which cloud service hosts the machine, VoidLink examines metadata using the respective vendor’s API.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/never-before-seen-linux-malware-is-far-more-advanced-than-typical/">Read full article</a></p>
