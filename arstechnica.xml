              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX accomplished a groundbreaking engineering feat Sunday, when it launched the fifth test flight of its gigantic Starship rocket, then caught the booster back at the launch pad in Texas with mechanical arms seven minutes later.</p>
<p>This achievement is the first of its kind, and it's crucial for SpaceX's vision of rapidly reusing the Starship rocket, enabling human expeditions to the Moon and Mars, routine access to space for mind-bogglingly massive payloads, and novel capabilities that no other company—or country—seems close to attaining.</p>
<p>The test flight began with a thundering liftoff of the 398-foot-tall (121.3-meter) Starship rocket at 7:25 am CDT (12:25 UTC) from SpaceX's Starbase launch site in South Texas, a few miles north of the US-Mexico border. The rocket's Super Heavy booster stage fired 33 Raptor engines, generating nearly 17 million pounds of thrust and gulping 20 tons of methane and liquid oxygen propellants per second at full throttle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/spacex-catches-returning-rocket-in-mid-air-turning-a-fanciful-idea-into-reality/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On October 10, 2018, Tyndall Air Force Base on the Gulf of Mexico—a pillar of American air superiority—found itself under aerial attack. Hurricane Michael, first spotted as a Category 2 storm off the Florida coast, unexpectedly hulked up to a Category 5. Sustained winds of 155 miles per hour whipped into the base, flinging power poles, flipping F-22s, and totaling more than 200 buildings. The sole saving grace: Despite sitting on a peninsula, Tyndall avoided flood damage. Michael’s 9- to 14-foot storm surge swamped other parts of Florida. Tyndall’s main defense was luck.</p>
<p>That $5 billion disaster at Tyndall was just one of a mounting number of extreme-weather events that convinced the US Department of Defense that it needed new ideas to protect the 1,700 coastal bases it’s responsible for globally. As hurricanes Helene and Milton have just shown, beachfront residents face compounding threats from climate change, and the Pentagon is no exception. Rising oceans are chewing away the shore. Stronger storms are more capable of flooding land.</p>
<p>In response, Tyndall will later this month test a new way to protect shorelines from intensified waves and storm surges: a prototype artificial reef, designed by a team led by Rutgers University scientists. The 50-meter-wide array, made up of three chevron-shaped structures each weighing about 46,000 pounds, can take 70 percent of the <i>oomph</i> out of waves, according to tests. But this isn’t your grandaddy’s seawall. It’s specifically designed to be colonized by oysters, some of nature’s most effective wave-killers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/can-walls-of-oysters-protect-shores-against-hurricanes-darpa-wants-to-know/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Early Sunday morning, SpaceX will try something no one has ever done before. Around seven minutes after lifting off from South Texas, the huge stainless steel booster from SpaceX's Starship rocket will, if all goes according to plan, come back to the launch pad and slow to a hover, allowing powerful mechanical arms to capture it in midair.</p>
<p>This is SpaceX's approach to recovering Starship's Super Heavy booster. If it works, this method will make it easier and faster to reuse the rocket than it is to recycle boosters from SpaceX's smaller Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Falcon 9's boosters usually come down on a floating drone ship stationed hundreds of miles out to sea, requiring SpaceX to return the rocket to shore for refurbishment.</p>
<p>“We’re going for high reusability," said Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX's vice president of build and flight reliability.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/starship-is-about-to-launch-on-its-fifth-flight-and-this-time-theres-a-catch/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Pamela Goodwin has received hundreds of emails from patients asking if they should take a cheap, readily available drug, metformin, to treat their cancer.</p>
<p>It’s a fair question: Metformin, commonly used to treat diabetes, has been investigated for treating a range of cancer types <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=metformin+cancer&amp;sort=date">in thousands of studies</a> on laboratory cells, <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2024/evolution-of-multicelled-life">animals</a>, and people. But Goodwin, an epidemiologist and medical oncologist treating breast cancer at the University of Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital, advises against it. No gold-standard trials have proved that metformin helps treat breast cancer—and her recent research suggests it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Metformin’s development was inspired by centuries of use of French lilac, or goat’s rue (<em>Galega officinalis</em>), for diabetes-like symptoms. In 1918, researchers discovered that a compound from the herb lowers blood sugar. Metformin, a chemical relative of that compound, has been a top type 2 diabetes treatment in the United States since it was approved in 1994. It’s cheap—<a href="https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/metformin">less than a dollar per dose</a>—and readily available, with few side effects. Today, more than 150 million people worldwide take the stuff.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/why-a-diabetes-drug-fell-short-of-anticancer-hopes/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>As attempts to clean up after Hurricane Milton are beginning, scientists at the World Weather Attribution project have taken a quick look at whether climate change contributed to its destructive power. While <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/yet-another-hurricane-wetter-windier-and-more-destructive-because-of-climate-change/">the analysis</a> is limited by the fact that not all the meteorological data is even available yet, by several measures, climate change made aspects of Milton significantly more likely.</p>
<p>This isn't a huge surprise, given that Milton traveled across the same exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/helenes-carolina-rainfall-made-70-percent-more-likely-by-climate-change/">Helene had recently transited</a>. But the analysis does produce one striking result: Milton would have been a Category 2 storm at landfall if climate change weren't boosting its strength.</p>
<h2>From the oceans to the skies</h2>
<p>Hurricanes strengthen while over warm ocean waters, and climate change has been slowly cranking up the heat content of the oceans. But it's important to recognize that the slow warming is an average, and that can include some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/ocean-heat-waves-remake-pacific-and-caribbean-habitats/">localized extreme events</a>. This year has seen <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/what-you-need-to-know-about-record-breaking-heat-in-the-atlantic/">lots of ocean temperature records set</a> in the Atlantic basin, and that seems to be true in the Gulf of Mexico as well. The researchers note that a different rapid analysis released earlier this week showed that the ocean temperatures—which had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/hurricane-milton-becomes-second-fastest-storm-to-reach-category-5-status/">boosted Milton to a Category 5 storm</a> during its time in the Gulf—were <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-shift-index-alert/hurricane-milton-october-2024">between 400 and 800 times more likely</a> to exist thanks to climate change.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/climate-change-boosted-miltons-landfall-strength-from-category-2-to-3/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Former Twitter executives, including former CEO Parag Agrawal, are <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agrawal-v-Musk-Motion-to-Open-Discovery-10-10-24.pdf">urging</a> a court to open discovery in a dispute over severance and other benefits they allege they were wrongfully denied after Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022.</p>
<p>According to the former executives, they've been blocked for seven months from accessing key documents proving they're owed roughly $200 million under severance agreements that they say Musk willfully tried to avoid paying in retaliation for executives forcing him to close the Twitter deal. And now, as X's value tanks lower than ever—<a href="https://www.actionsxchangerepository.fidelity.com/ShowDocument/ComplianceEnvelope.htm?_fax=-18%2342%23-61%23-110%23114%2378%23117%2320%23-1%2396%2339%23-62%23-21%2386%23-100%2337%2316%2335%23-68%2391%23-66%2354%23103%23-16%2369%23-30%2358%23-20%2376%23-84%23-11%23-87%2348%23-52%23-21%23-96%23-58%23-33%23-107%23-46%2393%23113%23-112%23127%23-42%23-97%2330%23-58%23-24%23-27%23-119%2394%23-121%23-102%23-69%23-71%23-99%2338%2353%23-51%2361%23-106%23-18%23-43%23-106%23-20%23-31%2385%23-55%235%2388%23-74%2371%23107%23-82%23-3%23-86%23-27%23-57%23-125%2342%23119%2357%23-111%2321%2363%23-99%2317%23-28%2320%23-38%23-101%23113%2380%23-77%23-4%23">reportedly</a> worth 80 percent less than when Musk bought it—the ex-Twitter leaders fear their severance claims "may be compromised" by Musk's alleged "mismanagement of X," their court filing said.</p>
<p>The potential for X's revenue loss to impact severance claims appears to go beyond just the former Twitter executives' dispute. According to their <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agrawal-v-Musk-Complaint-3-4-2024.pdf">complaint</a>, "there are also thousands of non-executive former employees whom Musk terminated and is now refusing to pay severance and other benefits" and who have "sued in droves."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/ex-twitter-execs-push-for-200m-severance-as-elon-musk-runs-x-into-ground/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Music publishing companies notched another court victory against a broadband provider that refused to terminate the accounts of Internet users accused of piracy. In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/5th-circuit-grande.pdf">ruling</a> on Wednesday, the conservative-leaning US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with the big three record labels against Grande Communications, a subsidiary of Astound Broadband.</p>
<p>The appeals court ordered a new trial on damages because it said the $46.8 million award was too high, but affirmed the lower court's finding that Grande is liable for contributory copyright infringement.</p>
<p>"Here, Plaintiffs [Universal, Warner, and Sony] proved at trial that Grande knew (or was willfully blind to) the identities of its infringing subscribers based on Rightscorp’s notices, which informed Grande of specific IP addresses of subscribers engaging in infringing conduct. But Grande made the choice to continue providing services to them anyway, rather than taking simple measures to prevent infringement," said the unanimous ruling by three judges.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/record-labels-win-again-court-says-isp-must-terminate-users-accused-of-piracy/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, the idea of running PC games on a Mac, in Linux, or on Arm processors would have been laughable. But the developers behind Asahi Linux—the independent project that is getting Linux working on Apple Silicon Macs—have managed to do all three of these things at once.</p>
<p>The feat brings together a perfect storm of open source projects, <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html">according to</a> Asahi Linux GPU lead Alyssa Rosenzweig: the FEX project to translate x86 CPU code to Arm, the Wine project to get Windows binaries running on Linux, DXVK and the Proton project to translate DirectX 12 API calls into Vulkan API calls, and of course the Asahi project's Vulkan-conformant driver for Apple's graphics hardware.</p>
<p>Games are technically run <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/muvm">inside a virtual machine</a> because of differences in how Apple Silicon and x86 systems address memory—Apple's systems use 16 KB memory pages, while x86 systems use 4 KB pages, something that causes issues for Asahi and some other Arm Linux distros on <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Broken-Software">a regular basis</a> and a gap that the VM bridges.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/asahi-linuxs-bespoke-gpu-driver-is-running-windows-games-on-apple-silicon-macs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There comes a point in most experienced Steam shoppers' lives where they wonder what would happen if their account was canceled or stolen, or perhaps <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/">they just stopped breathing</a>. It's scary to think about how many games in your backlog will never get played; scarier, still, to think about how you don't, in most real senses of the word, own any of them.</p>
<p>Now Valve, seemingly working to comply with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426">a new California law</a> targeting "false advertising" of "digital goods," has added language to its checkout page to confirm that thinking. "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam," the Steam cart now tells its customers, with a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement further below.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We love all the feedback that Ars readers have submitted since we rolled out the Ars Technica 9.0 design last week—even the, err, deeply passionate remarks. It's humbling that, after 26 years, so many people still care so much about making Ars into the best possible version of itself.</p>
<p>Based on your feedback, we've just pushed a new update to the site that we hope fixes many readers' top concerns. (You might need to hard-refresh to see it.)</p>
<p>Much of the feedback (forum posts, email, DMs, the Ars comment form) has told us that the chief goals of the redesign—more layout options, larger text, better readability—were successful. But readers have also offered up interesting edge cases and different use patterns for which design changes would be useful. Though we can't please everyone, we will continue to make iterative design tweaks so that the site can work well for as many people as possible.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-9-0-1-redesign-is-now-live-with-density-tweaks-and-visited-link-colors/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p class="p1">"Car back!"</p>
<p class="p1">If you've ever been on a group bike ride, you've no doubt heard these two words shouted by a nearby rider. It's also the name of Trek's new $199 bike radar.</p>
<p class="p1">For safety-conscious cyclists, bike radars have been a game-changer. Usually mounted on the seat post, the radar units alert cyclists to cars approaching from behind. While they will work on any bike on any road, bike radar is most useful in suburban and rural settings. After all, if you're doing some urban bike commuting, you'll just assume cars are behind you because that's how it is. But on more open roads with higher speed limits or free-flowing traffic, bike radars are fantastic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/trek-carback-bike-radar-lets-you-know-when-cars-are-approaching/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[A longstanding mystery is finally solved 100 years after mountaineer's disappearance.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In June 1924, a British mountaineer named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory">George Leigh Mallory</a> and a young engineering student named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Irvine_(mountaineer)">Andrew "Sandy" Irvine</a> set off for the summit of Mount Everest and disappeared—two more casualties of a peak that has claimed over 300 lives to date. Mallory's body was found in 1999, but Irvine's was never found—until now. An expedition led by National Geographic Explorer and professional climber Jimmy Chin—who won an Oscar for the 2019 documentary <em>Free Solo</em>, which he co-directed—has located a boot and a sock marked with Irvine's initials at a lower altitude than where Mallory's body had been found.</p>
<p>The team took a DNA sample from the remains, and members of the Irvine family have volunteered to compare DNA test results to confirm the identification. “It’s an object that belonged to him and has a bit of him in it,” Irvine’s great-niece Julie Summers <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/sandy-irvine-body-found-everest">told National Geographic</a>. "It tells the whole story about what probably happened. I'm regarding it as something close to closure.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/natgeo-expedition-hunts-for-1924-climbers-body-in-lost-on-everest-documentary/">previously</a> reported, Mallory is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1923/03/18/archives/climbing-mount-everest-is-work-for-supermen-a-member-of-former.html">the man credited</a> with uttering the famous line "because it's there" in response to a question about why he would risk his life repeatedly to summit Everest. Mallory had already been to the mountain twice before the 1924 expedition: once in 1921 as part of a reconnaissance expedition to produce the first accurate maps of the region and again in 1922. He was forced to turn back on all three attempts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/remains-of-andrew-sandy-irvine-found-on-everest/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, Tesla's Optimus prototype was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/tesla-shows-off-underwhelming-human-robot-prototype-at-ai-day-2022/">an underwhelming mess of exposed wires</a> that could only operate in a carefully controlled stage presentation. Last night, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/">Tesla's "We, Robot" event</a> featured much more advanced Optimus prototypes that could walk around without tethers and interact directly with partygoers.</p>
<p>It was an impressive demonstration of the advancement of a technology Tesla's Elon Musk said he thinks "will be the biggest product ever of any kind" (way to set reasonable expectations, there). But the live demos have also set off a firestorm of discussion over just how autonomous these Optimus robots currently are.</p>
<h2>A robot in every garage</h2>
<p>Before the human/robot party could get started, Musk introduced the humanoid Optimus robots as a logical extension of some of the technology that Tesla uses in its cars, from batteries and motors to software. "It's just a robot with arms and legs instead of a robot with wheels," Musk said breezily, easily underselling the huge differences between human-like movements and a car's much more limited input options.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/are-teslas-robot-prototypes-ai-marvels-or-remote-controlled-toys/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you're going to eat a bear, make sure it's not rare.</p>
<p>You'd be forgiven for thinking that once the beast has been subdued, all danger has passed. But you might still be in for a scare. The animal's flesh can be riddled with encased worm larvae, which, upon being eaten, will gladly reproduce in your innards and let their offspring roam the rest of your person, including invading your brain and heart. To defeat these savage squirmers, all one must do is cook the meat to at least 165° Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>But that simple solution continues to be ignored, according to a report today in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In this week's issue, health officials in North Carolina report that rare bear meat was served at a November 23 gathering, where at least 22 people ate the meat and at least 10 developed symptoms of a worm infection. Of the 10, six were kids and teens between the ages of 10 and 18.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/rare-bear-meat-at-gathering-gives-10-people-a-scare-and-parasitic-worms/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, AMD announced its new <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi325x.html">MI325X</a> AI accelerator chip, which is set to roll out to data center customers in the fourth quarter of this year. At an event hosted in San Francisco, the company claimed the new chip offers "industry-leading" performance compared to Nvidia's current <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/nvidia-introduces-its-most-powerful-gpu-yet-designed-for-accelerating-ai/">H200 GPUs</a>, which are widely used in data centers to power AI applications such as ChatGPT.</p>
<p>With its new chip, AMD hopes to narrow the performance gap with Nvidia in the AI processor market. The Santa Clara-based company also revealed plans for its next-generation <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1220/amd-delivers-leadership-ai-performance-with-amd-instinct">MI350 chip</a>, which is positioned as a head-to-head competitor of Nvidia's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Blackwell</a> system, with an expected shipping date in the second half of 2025.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/998e15cc-bf46-46ab-ab04-934286f0923b">interview</a> with the Financial Times, AMD CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Su">Lisa Su</a> expressed her ambition for AMD to become the "end-to-end" AI leader over the next decade. "This is the beginning, not the end of the AI race," she <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/998e15cc-bf46-46ab-ab04-934286f0923b">told</a> the publication.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/amd-unveils-powerful-new-ai-chip-to-challenge-nvidia/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-orders-google-to-distribute-third-party-app-stores-on-google-play/">US court ruled earlier this week</a> that Google must open its Play Store to allow for third-party app stores and alternative payment options, Microsoft is moving quickly to slide into this slightly ajar door.</p>
<p>Sarah Bond, president of Xbox, <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255?t=SrOvyzBRyQLwuWk9wn58hw&amp;s=19">posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a> Thursday evening that the ruling "will allow more choice and flexibility." "Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android," Bond wrote.</p>
<p>Because the court order requires Google to stop forcing apps to use its own billing system and allow for third-party app stores inside Google Play itself, Microsoft now intends to offer Xbox games directly through its app. Most games will likely not run directly on Android, but a revamped Xbox Android app could also directly stream purchased or subscribed games to Android devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/xbox-plans-to-set-up-shop-in-androids-play-store-if-court-order-holds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last night, after a wait of roughly an hour after the official start time, Elon Musk spoke to a crowd of Tesla fans and some journalists on a film studio backlot in California to give us an update on the company's much-talked-about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-an-ai-company-now-heres-how-plausible-that-is/">pivot to robotics</a>. In an act redolent with symbolism, Musk emerged from a facade built to resemble an actual building, then stepped into an aerodynamically styled two-seater that combined the shape of a Honda CR-Z coupe with the doors from a McLaren supercar. This is the Tesla Cybercab, proving <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/733673/tesla-robotaxi-cybercab-spy-shot/">early leaks</a> right.</p>
<p>Musk claimed to have "50 fully autonomous cars here tonight," eliciting screams and cheers from the crowd of fans when he announced there were no pedals or steering wheel. The billionaire, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-political-donations-stephen-miller-desantis-39464294">who has spent the past couple of years funneling millions</a> of dollars to far-right causes, told the attendees that he didn't want a dark future like his favorite film <em>Blade Runner</em>—"except maybe that cool duster," he said, referring to the jacket of <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-main-character-blade-runner">his favorite character</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of his presentation, Musk made many promises, variations of ones he's made many times before. "Full self driving" will enter an unsupervised mode that will allow passengers to fall asleep and wake up at their destinations. For people who think the cars are too expensive, they'll be worth five or 10 times as much because owners only use them an average of 10 hours a week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/windows-11-24h2-the-biggest-update-in-two-years-starts-rolling-out-today/">Windows 11 2024 Update</a>, also known as Windows 11 24H2, started rolling out last week. Your PC may have even installed it already!</p>
<p>The continuous feature development of Windows 11 (and Microsoft's phased update rollouts) can make it a bit hard to track exactly what features you can expect to be available on any given Windows PC, even if it seems like it's fully up to date.</p>
<p>This isn't a comprehensive record of all the changes in the 2024 Update, and it doesn't reiterate some basic but important things like Wi-Fi 7 or 80Gbps USB4 support. But we've put together a small list of new and interesting changes that you're guaranteed to see when your version number rolls over from 22H2 or 23H2 to 24H2. And while Microsoft's announcement post spent most of its time on Copilot and features unique to Copilot+ PCs, here, we'll only cover things that will be available on any PC you install Windows 11 on (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-whether-your-pc-is-supported-or-not/">whether it's officially supported or not</a>).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/eleven-things-to-know-about-in-the-windows-11-2024-update/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.15 of the Rocket Report! It's a big week for big rockets, with SpaceX potentially launching its next Starship test flight and a Falcon Heavy rocket with NASA's Europa Clipper mission this weekend. And a week ago, United Launch Alliance flew its second Vulcan rocket, which lost one of its booster nozzles in midair and amazingly kept going to achieve a successful mission. Are you not entertained?</p>

<p><b>PLD Space is aiming high. </b>Spanish launch provider PLD Space has revealed a family of new rockets that it plans to introduce beyond its Miura 5 rocket, which is expected to make its inaugural flight in 2025, <a href="https://europeanspaceflight.com/pld-space-unveils-three-new-rockets-and-a-crew-capsule/">European Spaceflight reports</a>. The company also revealed that it was working on a crew capsule called Lince (Spanish for Lynx). PLD Space introduced its Miura Next, Miura Next Heavy, and Miura Next Super Heavy launch vehicles, designed in single stick, triple core, and quintuple core configurations with reusable boosters. At the high end of the rocket family's performance, the Miura Next Super Heavy could deliver up to 53 metric tons (nearly 117,000 pounds) of payload to low-Earth orbit. The Lince capsule could become Europe's first human-rated crew transportation spacecraft.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/rocket-report-europa-clipper-on-hold-for-milton-spanish-startups-big-ambitions/">Read full article</a></p>
