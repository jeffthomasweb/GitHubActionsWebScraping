<p>Rite Aid, the third biggest US drug store chain, said that more than 2.2 million of its customers have been swept into a data breach that stole personal information, including driver's license numbers, addresses, and dates of birth.</p>
<p>The company said in mandatory filings with the attorneys general of states including <a href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/c4bace65-85df-4fff-b99f-f8fd390bb41a.html">Maine</a>, <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/2024-1308-rite-aid-corporation/download">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="https://ago.vermont.gov/document/2024-07-15-rite-aid-data-breach-notice-consumers">Vermont</a>, and <a href="https://justice.oregon.gov/consumer/DataBreach/Home/Details/1364031490">Oregon</a> that the stolen data was associated with purchases or attempted purchases of retail products made between June 6, 2017, and July 30, 2018. The data provided included the purchaser's name, address, date of birth, and driver's license number or other form of government-issued ID. No social security numbers, financial information, or patient information was included.</p>
<p>“On June 6, 2024, an unknown third party impersonated a company employee to compromise their business credentials and gain access to certain business systems,” the filing stated. “We detected the incident within 12 hours and immediately launched an internal investigation to terminate the unauthorized access, remediate affected systems and ascertain if any customer data was impacted.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037497#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037497&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Can you really call them "leaks" if, every year, Google's Pixel phones end up being sloshed all over the web for months before their official release? What volume of photos, hardware specifications, and other details constitutes a leak, rather than a quick-draining colander?</p>
<p>Google's Pixel 9 series of phones are expected to be launched at an event on August 13. Because those phones need to be certified by various regulators, including the <a href="https://www.ncc.gov.tw/english/">Taiwanese National Communications Commission</a>, or NCC, there are now photos—so many photos—of all four phones Google is expected to announce next month. The Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google's second attempt at a folding phone, have been sized, measured, rated for battery life and charging speed, and even disassembled for a look inside.</p>
<p>As has been suggested by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/googles-pixel-9-gets-its-first-leaked-render-looks-a-lot-like-an-iphone/">Pixel 9 renders</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-pixel-9-might-have-three-models-adding-a-small-pro-phone/">renders of all three non-folding phones</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/first-real-life-pixel-9-pro-pictures-leak-and-it-has-16gb-of-ram/">pictures of prototypes</a>, the NCC pictures confirm that Google's "Pro" phone in this series is the same size as the standard model 9 but with three rear cameras and upgraded, possibly AI-friendly specs. The NCC filings don't confirm all internal specs, such as the eye-popping 16GB of RAM seen in an earlier Pixel 9 Pro prototype. Google has previously noted that keeping certain generative models to be "RAM-resident" requires more RAM.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037418#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037418&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1813263734707790301">announced</a> the formation of a new AI learning platform called <a href="https://eurekalabs.ai/">Eureka Labs</a>. The venture aims to create an "AI native" educational experience, with its first offering focused on teaching students how to build their own large language model (LLM).</p>

<p>"It's still early days but I wanted to announce the company so that I can build publicly instead of keeping a secret that isn't," Karpathy <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1813263734707790301">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>While the idea of using AI in education isn't particularly new, Karpathy's approach hopes to pair expert-designed course materials with an AI-powered teaching assistant based on an LLM, aiming to provide personalized guidance at scale. This combination seeks to make high-quality education more accessible to a global audience.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037425#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037425&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AI models at Apple, Salesforce, Anthropic, and other major technology players were trained on tens of thousands of YouTube videos without the creators' consent and potentially in violation of YouTube's terms, according to a new report appearing in both <a href="https://www.proofnews.org/apple-nvidia-anthropic-used-thousands-of-swiped-youtube-videos-to-train-ai/">Proof News</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-training-data-apple-nvidia-anthropic/">Wired</a>.</p>
<p>The companies trained their models in part by using "the Pile," a collection by nonprofit <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/about">EleutherAI</a> that was put together as a way to offer a useful dataset to individuals or companies that don't have the resources to compete with Big Tech, though it has also since been used by those bigger companies.</p>
<p>The Pile includes books, Wikipedia articles, and much more. That includes YouTube captions collected by YouTube's captions API, scraped from 173,536 YouTube videos across more than 48,000 channels. That includes videos from big YouTubers like MrBeast, PewDiePie, and popular tech commentator <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1813206956716212511">Marques Brownlee</a>. On X, Brownlee <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1813206956716212511">called out</a> Apple's usage of the dataset, but acknowledged that assigning blame is complex when Apple did not collect the data itself.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Fans of the Netflix series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindhunter_(TV_series)"><em>Mindhunter</em></a> might recall the character of Dr. Wendy Carr (Anna Torv), a psychologist who joins forces with FBI criminal profilers to study the unique psychology of serial killers in hopes of more effectively catching them. But they might not know about the inspiration for the character: Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Burgess">Ann Wolbert Burgess</a>, whose long distinguished career finally gets the attention it deserves in a new documentary from Hulu, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind:_To_Think_Like_a_Killer"><em>Mastermind: To Think Like a Killer</em></a>.</p>
<p>Burgess herself thought it was "fun" to see a fictional character based on her but noted that Hollywood did take some liberties. "They got it wrong," she told Ars. "They made me a psychologist. I'm a nurse"—specifically, a forensic and psychiatric nurse who pioneered research on sex crimes, victimology, and criminal psychology.</p>
<p><em>Mastermind</em> should go a long way toward setting things right. Hulu brought on Abby Fuller to direct, best known for her work on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table"><em>Chef's Table</em></a> series for Netflix. Fuller might seem like a surprising choice for making a true crime documentary, but the streamer thought she would bring a fresh take to a well-worn genre. "I love the true crime aspects, but I thought we could do something more elevated and cinematic and really make this a character-driven piece about [Ann], with true crime elements," Fuller told Ars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034664#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034664&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Video streaming providers have a big <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/subscribing-to-max-just-got-up-to-20-more-expensive/">churn problem</a>. While many streaming companies are not profitable yet, the entire industry is grappling with high and fast cancellation rates.</p>
<p>Users who sign up for streaming services only to cancel a few months later, likely because they watched what they wanted to already or are trying to save money, has created huge churn concerns for streaming companies. Those companies are largely responding with packages that bundle their services with other services, including rival streaming platforms. But with streaming subscribers already pushed to their financial limits, it's time for streaming providers to earn their keep, not piggyback on others.</p>
<p>This week, media research firm Hub Entertainment Research published its 2024 Monetization of Video <a href="https://hubresearchllc.com/reports/?category=2024&amp;title=2024-monetization-of-video">report </a>with findings from June interviews of 1,600 TV viewers ages 16 to 74. The respondents reportedly each watch at least one hour of TV weekly, and the sample is “US census balanced,” per Hub. When Hub asked respondents if they will "still have/use" their video streaming services a year from now, 85 percent of those using ad-free services said they definitely or probably will, compared to 74 percent of subscribers of streaming services with ads. Further suggesting that ad-free subscription tiers garner more loyalty, 15 percent of ad-free subscribers said they "might/might not" or "probably/definitely won't" have their subscription next year versus 26 percent of ad subscribers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037294#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037294&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A British judge is referring self-proclaimed bitcoin inventor Craig Wright to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider criminal charges of perjury and forgery. The judge said that CPS can decide whether Wright should be arrested and granted two injunctions that prohibit Wright from re-litigating his claim to be bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that I should refer the relevant papers in this case to the CPS for consideration of whether a prosecution should be commenced against Dr. Wright for his wholescale perjury and forgery of documents and/or whether a warrant for his arrest should be issued and/or whether his extradition should be sought from wherever he now is. All those matters are to be decided by the CPS," Justice James Mellor of England's High Court of Justice wrote in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/COPA-v-Wright-Approved-FOO-Judgment-16.07.2024.pdf">ruling</a> issued today.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>AMD has released more information about its next-generation Ryzen 9000 processors and their underlying Zen 5 CPU architecture this week ahead of their launch at the end of July. The company reiterated some of the high-level performance claims it made last month—low- to mid-double-digit performance increases over Zen 4 in both single- and multi-threaded tasks. But AMD also bragged about the chips' power efficiency compared to Ryzen 7000, pointing out that they would reduce power usage despite increasing performance.</p>
<h2>Prioritizing power efficiency</h2>
<p>AMD said that it has lowered the default power limits for three of the four Ryzen 9000 processors—the Ryzen 5 9600X, the Ryzen 7 9700X, and the Ryzen 9 7900X—compared to the Ryzen 7000 versions of those same chips. Despite the lower default power limit, all three of those chips still boast double-digit performance improvements over their predecessors. AMD also says that Ryzen 9000 CPU temperatures have been reduced by up to 7º Celsius compared to Ryzen 7000 chips at the same settings.</p>
  <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">
          <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMD-Ryzen%E2%84%A2-9000-Series-11-2-980x551.jpeg" alt=""></div>
          <p>
            Ryzen 9000's low-double-digit performance gains are coming despite the fact that the company has lowered most of its chips' default TDPs. These TDP settings determine how much power one of AMD's CPUs can use (though not necessarily how much they <em>will</em> use).                           [credit:
                              AMD                            ]
                      </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>It's worth noting that we generally tested the original Ryzen 7000 CPUs at multiple power levels, and for most chips—most notably the 7600X and 7700X—we found that the increased TDP levels didn't help performance all that much in the first place. The TDP lowering in the Ryzen 9000 may be enabled partly by architectural improvements or a newer manufacturing process, but AMD already had some headroom to lower those power usage numbers without affecting performance too much. TDP is also best considered as a power <em>limit</em> rather than the actual amount of power that a CPU will use for any given workload, even when fully maxed out.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037322#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037322&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mars trembles with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/most-monstrous-marsquake-ever-reveals-where-it-came-from/">marsquakes, but not all of them</a> are driven by phenomena that occur beneath the surface—many are the aftermath of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/a-meteorite-has-been-lost-in-the-sahara-since-1916-heres-how-we-might-find-it/">meteorite</a> strikes.</p>
<p>Meteorites crash down to Mars every day. After analyzing data from NASA’s InSight lander, an international team of researchers noticed that its seismometer, SEIS, detected six nearby seismic events. These were linked to the same acoustic atmospheric signal that meteorites generate when whizzing through the atmosphere of Mars. Further investigation identified all six as part of an entirely new class of quakes known as VF (very high frequency) events.</p>
<p>The collisions that generate VF marsquakes occur in fractions of a second, much less time than the few seconds it takes tectonic processes to cause quakes similar in size. This is some of the key seismological data that has helped us understand the occurrence of earthquakes caused by meteoric impacts on Mars. This is also the first time seismic data was used to determine how frequently impact craters are formed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037341#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037341&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>How badly do you want to play the upcoming <a href="https://store.focus-entmt.com/us/warhammer40000spacemarine2"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a> ahead of its September 9 launch? Enough to torrent a 75GB package from a Russian site? Enough to not only unpack and play it, but connect to a server and start building up your character?</p>
<p>Me neither, but that hasn't stopped seemingly hundreds of people from doing just that. Publisher Focus Entertainment had announced the third-person action game having "gone gold" (released for manufacturing) <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1810722430144631112">on July 9</a>. The leaked build might date to February 23, 2024, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">suggested by site Insider Gaming</a>, which had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240715211516/https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">previously suggested a June 20 date</a>.</p>
<p>Footage from the leaked builds, which has been mostly taken offline by Focus through copyright claims, suggested that it was a mostly complete version of the game, with some placeholder assets in menus. Said footage also suggests that the game's pirates are playing online, and their characters are retaining their levels and items. For now, at least.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037313#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037313&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google tried to derail a Microsoft antitrust <a href="https://cispe.cloud/cispe-and-microsoft-agree-settlement-in-fair-software-licensing-case/">settlement</a> over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/microsoft-irreparably-damaging-eus-cloud-ecosystem-industry-group-claims/">anticompetitive software licensing in the European Union</a> by offering a $500 million alternative deal to the group of cloud providers behind the EU complaint, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-16/google-offered-470-million-to-derail-microsoft-antitrust-pact">reported</a>.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Google's offer to the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) required that the group maintain its EU antitrust complaint. It came "just days" before CISPE settled with Microsoft, and it was apparently not compelling enough to stop CISPE from inking a deal with the software giant that TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/microsoft-settles-with-european-cloud-trade-body-over-antitrust-complaints/">noted</a> forced CISPE to accept several compromises.</p>
<p>Bloomberg uncovered Google's attempted counteroffer after reviewing confidential documents and speaking to "people familiar with the matter." Apparently, Google sought to sway CISPE with a package worth nearly $500 million for more than five years of software licenses and about $15 million in cash.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037295#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037295&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Lucid has just revealed the details of its model-year 2025 updates, and among the tweaks to its handsome electric sedan is an impressive bump in range efficiency. The entry-level Lucid Air Pure, which starts at $69,900, can now travel 420 miles on a single charge of its 84 kWh battery. That equates to 5 miles/kWh (12.4 kWh/100 km), making the Air Pure the most efficient electric vehicle for sale today.</p>
<p>The range bump is mostly thanks to Lucid making a heat pump standard across the range, after first adding one to the ultra-powerful, ultra-expensive Air Sapphire.</p>
<p>Lucid has also upgraded the computer hardware that oversees the Air's various subsystems. The automaker says it has tripled processing power and doubled the system's memory, which should translate to faster and better infotainment. And Lucid has made its advanced driver assistance system standard across the lineup, too.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037267#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037267&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first earthquake struck while the town was still asleep. Around 2:00 am on Dec. 16, 1811, New Madrid—a small frontier settlement of 400 people on land now located in Missouri—was jolted awake. Panicked townsfolk fled their homes as buildings collapsed and the smell of sulfur filled the air.</p>
<p>The episode didn’t last long. But the worst was yet to come. Nearly two months later, after dozens of aftershocks and another massive quake, the fault line running directly under the town ruptured. Thirty-one-year-old resident Eliza Bryan watched in horror as the Mississippi River receded and swept away boats full of people. In nearby fields, geysers of sand erupted, and a rumble filled the air.</p>
<p>In the end, the town had dropped at least 15 feet. Bryan and others spent a year and a half living in makeshift camps while they waited for the aftershocks to end. Four years later, the shocks had become less common. At last, the rattled townspeople began “to hope that ere long they will entirely cease,” Bryan wrote in a letter.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037262#p3">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037262&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The first deliveries of Porsche's new Macan EV are still a few weeks away, but today the automaker announced it is already expanding that lineup. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/porsches-first-electric-macan-goes-on-sale-starts-at-78800/">When the car broke cover in January</a>, we were shown a pair of variants: the all-wheel drive Macan 4, and the powerful Macan Turbo. The two new versions slot around those cars—there's a rear-wheel drive, single-motor Macan as the new entry-level car, and a Macan 4S that fills the gap between the two already-revealed cars.</p>
<h2>Macan</h2>
<p>The entry-level Macan uses the same rear drive unit as the Macan 4 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/the-2024-porsche-macan-ev-has-character-pace-and-the-right-badge/">we tested in April</a>. Doing without a front motor means a weight savings of 243 lbs (110 kg) from the front of the car, which should have a positive benefit on handling, even if this will be the slowest Macan in the range.</p>
<p>Slow being a relative term here, for we are discussing both a Porsche and also an electric car. A nominal output of 335 hp (250 kW) is more than sufficient for day-to-day driving, and the motor can overboost to 355 hp (265 kW) and 415 lb-ft (562 Nm) for standing starts in launch mode. Do so, and you can hurl the basic Macan down the road to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037178#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037178&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington to Munich and accommodation so Ars could be briefed about the A5, as well as two other models you can read about in the coming weeks. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>MUNICH—Although the world's automakers are in the midst of a great electrification, some of the more ambitious timelines for ditching the internal combustion engine are now looking quite unrealistic. That's due to a number of factors, but the relative lack of charging infrastructure and the still-high cost of lithium-ion batteries are both contributors. With ICE still on the menu for at least the next decade, Audi has developed a new platform, and the first model to debut will be the next Audi A5, due in US dealerships by next summer.</p>
<h2>Now it’s a sedan</h2>
<p>Audi's long-term model nomenclature recently went through a bit of a change. In the past, even-numbered cars like the A4, A6, and A8 were (mostly) sedans, and odd-numbered models (the A5 and A7) were different body styles, including five-door fastbacks—known as sportbacks in Audi-speak—but also coupes and convertibles. (The exception to this has been the station wagon variants, <em>aka</em> Avants, which were A4s and A6s.)</p>
<p>Forget all that. From now on, all even-numbered Audis are battery-electric vehicles, with odd-numbered Audi designations reserved for gas, diesel, and hybrid cars. (The same applies to the Q-designated SUVs and crossovers, but more on those in a few weeks.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036784#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036784&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's unclear yet how long SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket will remain grounded as engineers investigate a rare launch failure last week, but the next test flight of the company's next-generation Starship vehicle appears to be on track for liftoff next month.</p>
<p>On Monday, SpaceX test-fired the 33 Raptor engines on the Starship rocket's Super Heavy booster at the company's Starbase facility in South Texas. The methane-fueled engines fired for about eight seconds, long enough for SpaceX engineers to verify all systems functioned normally. At full power, the 33 engines generated nearly 17 million pounds of thrust, twice the power output of NASA's iconic Saturn V Moon rocket.</p>
<p>SpaceX confirmed the static fire test reached its full duration, and teams drained methane and liquid oxygen from the rocket, known as Booster 12 in the company's inventory of ships and boosters. The upper stage for the next Starship test flight, known as Ship 30, completed the static fire of its six Raptor engines in May.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037241#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037241&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple's next-generation operating systems are taking their next step toward release today: Apple is issuing the first public beta builds of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15 Sequoia, tvOS 18, and HomePod Software 18 today. Sign up for <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">Apple's public beta program</a> with your Apple ID, and you'll be able to select the public beta builds from Software Update in the Settings app.</p>
<p>We covered the highlights of most of these releases when they were announced during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/">more home screen customization</a> in iOS and iPadOS, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-announces-macos-15-sequoia/">window tiling and iPhone mirroring in macOS,</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/apple-announces-rcs-support-for-imessage/">RCS text messaging support</a> across all of Apple's platforms, and more. But Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/three-betas-in-ios-18-testers-still-cant-try-out-apple-intelligence-features/">still isn't ready</a> to show off a preview of its Apple Intelligence AI features, including the text and image generation features and a revamped Siri. Many of these features are still slated for "later this summer" and will presumably be available in some form in the final releases this fall.</p>
<p>Most devices that can run iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS 14 Sonoma will be able to update to the new versions, including owners of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-case-for-and-against-macos-15-sequoia-being-the-final-release-for-intel-macs/">the last couple generations of Intel Macs</a>. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/these-are-all-the-devices-compatible-with-ios-18-and-ipados-18/">a handful of older phones and tablets</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/macos-15-sequoia-still-supports-intel-macs-but-cuts-the-2018-macbook-air/">the 2018 MacBook Air</a> are being dropped by the new releases. The watchOS 11 update is also dropping the Series 4 and Series 5 models as well as the first-generation Apple Watch SE.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037128#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037128&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Major record labels sued Verizon on Friday, alleging that the Internet service provider violated copyright law by continuing to serve customers accused of pirating music. Verizon "knowingly provides its high-speed service to a massive community of online pirates," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.624722/gov.uscourts.nysd.624722.1.0.pdf">complaint</a> filed in US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>Universal, Sony, and Warner say they have sent over 340,000 copyright infringement notices to Verizon since early 2020. "Those notices identify specific subscribers on Verizon's network stealing Plaintiffs' sound recordings through peer-to-peer ('P2P') file-sharing networks that are notorious hotbeds for copyright infringement," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Record labels allege that "Verizon ignored Plaintiffs' notices and buried its head in the sand" by "continu[ing] to provide its high-speed service to thousands of known repeat infringers so it could continue to collect millions of dollars from them." They say that "Verizon has knowingly contributed to, and reaped substantial profits from, massive copyright infringement committed by tens of thousands of its subscribers."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037197#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037197&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Researchers have determined that two fake AWS packages downloaded hundreds of times from the open source NPM JavaScript repository contained carefully concealed code that backdoored developers' computers when executed.</p>
<p>The packages—<code>img-aws-s3-object-multipart-copy</code> and <code>legacyaws-s3-object-multipart-copy</code>—were attempts to appear as <a href="https://github.com/little-core-labs/aws-s3-object-multipart-copy">aws-s3-object-multipart-copy</a>, a legitimate JavaScript library for copying files using Amazon’s S3 cloud service. The fake files included all the code found in the legitimate library but added an additional JavaScript file named loadformat.js. That file provided what appeared to be benign code and three JPG images that were processed during package installation. One of those images contained code fragments that, when reconstructed, formed code for backdooring the developer device.</p>
<h2>Growing sophistication</h2>
<p>“We have reported these packages for removal, however the malicious packages remained available on npm for nearly two days,” researchers from Phylum, the security firm that spotted the packages, <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/fake-aws-packages-ship-command-and-control-malware-in-jpeg-files/">wrote</a>. “This is worrying as it implies that most systems are unable to detect and promptly report on these packages, leaving developers vulnerable to attack for longer periods of time.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037194#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037194&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Is space-based solar power a costly, risky pipe dream? Or is it a viable way to combat climate change? Although beaming solar power from space to Earth could ultimately involve transmitting gigawatts, the process could be made surprisingly safe and cost-effective, according to experts from Space Solar, the European Space Agency, and the University of Glasgow.</p>
<p>But we’re going to need to move well beyond <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/headed-to-space-today-test-hardware-for-a-solar-power-plant/">demonstration hardware</a> and solve a number of engineering challenges if we want to develop that potential.</p>
<h2>Designing space-based solar</h2>
<p>Beaming solar energy from space is not new; telecommunications satellites have been sending microwave signals generated by solar power back to Earth since the 1960s. But sending useful amounts of power is a different matter entirely.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037164#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037164&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
