<p>A dairy farm worker in Michigan has tested positive for an H5 bird flu virus, marking the second human case of bird flu that has been linked to the unprecedented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus among dairy cows in the US.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the worker only experienced a mild eye infection and has since recovered, much like the first case in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/we-still-dont-understand-how-one-human-apparently-got-bird-flu-from-a-cow/2/">a dairy farm worker in Texas</a>. The Michigan worker was being monitored for symptoms due to exposure—the person worked on a dairy farm with H5N1-infected cattle.</p>
<p>In a press briefing Wednesday afternoon, CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said the person was taking part in an active surveillance system, in which the state's health department sent out a text message every day asking about the presence of any symptoms. The worker's infection was identified after the person responded that there were symptoms.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026362#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026362&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>T-Mobile today is notifying customers on some older smartphone plans that their monthly prices will soon be increased by either $2 or $5.</p>
<p>T-Mobile confirmed the price increases when contacted by Ars today. "The increase is $2 or $5 per line. We won't be sharing the details on which plans but the portion of customers who are included are being notified today," a T-Mobile spokesperson told us.</p>
<p>The price increases, which reportedly will take effect during the June billing cycle, were <a href="https://tmo.report/2024/05/confirmed-t-mobile-is-raising-prices-on-some-legacy-plans/">previously confirmed</a> by The Mobile Report. The news article said that affected plans include One, Magenta, Magenta Max, Magenta 55+, Magenta First Responder, and Simple Choice. While smartphone plans will increase either $2 or $5, it appears that affected plans for tablets and hotspots will get a $2 price increase.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026437#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026437&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been a tumultuous run for Netflix's popular adaptation of The Witcher novels and games. A series of setbacks and controversies led to a long delay after the show lost its star, Henry Cavill. Now a brief season four teaser gives us our first look at Cavill's replacement in the role of Geralt of Rivia, Liam Hemsworth.</p>
<p>The video above reveals little about the direction for the season beyond establishing that, yes, Hemsworth is now Geralt, and here's what it looks like. He looks the part, though it's hard for some fans to imagine him matching Cavill's pitch-perfect presence and delivery for the character.</p>
<p>See, Cavill is famously a passionate gamer. He's talked at length about his deep fandom of <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, his experiences playing <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and yes, his experiences with 2015's immensely popular open-world RPG <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>. He even has appeared in a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2gYUVQrLzQ">building a gaming PC</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026264#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026264&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Here at Ars, we’ve been around long enough to chronicle every single time that Microsoft has tried to get Windows running on Arm-based processors, instead of the Intel and AMD-made x86 chips that have been synonymous with Windows for more than three decades. The most significant attempts happened in 2012 with Windows RT, which looked like Windows 8 but couldn’t run any x86 Windows apps; and in 2017 when Windows 10 Arm PCs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/12/microsoft-pushes-for-a-more-modern-pc-with-vr-project-evo-and-arm-support/">arrived with rudimentary x86 emulation</a>.</p>

<p>The main PC company backing each of those Arm efforts was Microsoft itself, which launched the original Surface to showcase Windows RT and the first Surface Pro X during the Windows 10 era. Since then, Microsoft has periodically refreshed the Arm version of the Surface tablet while continuing to sell Intel versions. A couple of PC OEMs put out Windows RT tablets, and most of them took a stab at one or two Windows 10-into-11-era Arm PCs. But there was never a big unified push that made it clear that the entire consumer PC ecosystem had bought into Arm.</p>
<p>This week’s announcements felt different—yes, there was a new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop from Microsoft leading the charge (and the new Surface Pro is the first Surface Pro ever to ship Arm as the default option for most people). But the Surface launch was accompanied by a major wave of systems from essentially every major PC OEM, suggesting at least some level of elevated enthusiasm for the Snapdragon X series that didn’t exist for older Arm chips.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025874#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025874&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The lizard <i>Podarcis</i><i> muralis nigriventris</i><i> </i>might not grow to a freakish size and smash everything in sight, but evolution has turned this lizard into the Incredible Hulk of sorts—green skin included. <em>P. </em><i>nigriventris</i> is something like the imposing Marvel superhero when compared to other strains of common wall lizards (<i>Podarcis muralis</i>). While the common version tends to be relatively small and brownish to greenish-brown, the <i>nigriventris</i> subspecies, which is found in central Italy, is visually impressive because of its green(er) skin with black markings, larger size, and heightened aggression.</p>
<p>A team of evolutionary biologists led by Nathalie Feiner of Lund University in Sweden decided to find out which genes contributed to making <i>P. nigriventris </i>so Hulkish. Like many fictional humans with superpowers (but unlike the mutant Hulk), this lizard is a hybrid.</p>
<h2>Hulking hybrids</h2>
<p>Though common wall lizards are found from the Iberian peninsula all the way to Asia Minor, the researchers focused on lizards from populations in central Italy (IT lineage) and the southern Alps (SA lineage). These lineages most likely diverged from a common ancestor between 5–6 million years ago and then began to hybridize—individuals from the different lineages mated with each other to produce hybrid offspring.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025795#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025795&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>With most computer programs—even complex ones—you can meticulously trace through the code and memory usage to figure out <em>why</em> that program generates any specific behavior or output. That's generally not true in the field of generative AI, where the non-interpretable neural networks underlying these models make it hard for even experts to figure out precisely <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">why they often confabulate information</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model">new research from Anthropic</a> offers a new window into what's going on inside the Claude LLM's "black box." The company's <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html">new paper</a> on "Extracting Interpretable Features from Claude 3 Sonnet" describes a powerful new method for at least partially explaining just how the model's millions of artificial neurons fire to create <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">surprisingly lifelike responses</a> to general queries.</p>
<h2>Opening the hood</h2>
<p>When analyzing an LLM, it's trivial to see which specific artificial neurons are activated in response to any particular query. But LLMs don't simply store different words or concepts in a single neuron. Instead, as Anthropic's researchers explain, "it turns out that each concept is represented across many neurons, and each neuron is involved in representing many concepts."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026236#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026236&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A proposed repeal of Section 230 is designed to punish Big Tech but is also facing opposition from library associations, the Internet Archive, the owner of Wikipedia, and advocacy groups from across the political spectrum who say a repeal is bad for online speech. Opposition poured in before a House <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/events/communications-and-technology-subcommittee-hearing-legislative-proposal-to-sunset-section-230-of-the-communications-decency-act">hearing</a> today on the bipartisan plan to "sunset" Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives online platforms <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/section-230-the-internet-law-politicians-love-to-hate-explained/">immunity from lawsuits</a> over how they moderate user-submitted content.</p>
<p>Lawmakers defended the proposed repeal. House Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.) today <a href="https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/media/press-releases/pallone-stresses-need-hold-big-tech-accountable-sunsetting-section-230">said</a> that "Section 230 has outlived its usefulness and has played an outsized role in creating today's 'profits over people' Internet" and criticized what he called "Big Tech's constant scare tactics about reforming Section 230."</p>
<p>Pallone teamed up with Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) to <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/bipartisan-energy-and-commerce-leaders-announce-legislative-hearing-on-sunsetting-section-230">propose</a> the Section 230 repeal. The lawmakers haven't come up with a replacement for the law, a tactic that some critics predict will lead to legislative chaos. A <a href="https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/05_22_24_Section_230_Leg_C_and_T_Hearing_Memo_1_9e8995c30b.pdf">hearing memo</a> said the draft bill "would sunset Section 230 of the Communications Act effective on December 31, 2025," but claimed the "intent of the legislation is not to have Section 230 actually sunset, but to encourage all technology companies to work with Congress to advance a long-term reform solution to Section 230."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026242#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026242&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The wearable startup Humane, makers of the bizarre Humane AI Pin, is already looking for the exit. Bloomberg reports the company is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-22/wearable-ai-startup-humane-is-said-to-explore-potential-sale">seeking a sale</a> after its first and only product launch was a big flop. Despite seemingly having nothing else in the pipeline and the AI Pin being dead on arrival, Bloomberg reports the company is "seeking a price of between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale." Humane was founded by two ex-Apple employees, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, in 2018 and has raised $230 million from some big-name investors like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</p>
<p>The Humane AI Pin <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-a-700-voice-command-box-definitely-wont-replace-your-phone/2/">immediately seemed</a> like an idea that only made sense in a VC pitch room. The device is a wearable voice command box and camera that you magnetically clip onto a shirt, sort of like a Star Trek communicator. It wanted to replace your smartphone yet had no traditional display, and the company bragged in the launch video: "We don't do apps." That means you're left with mostly voice commands for whatever the voice command system can process. You could press on the front and ask a question. The camera could also be involved in a "what's this thing?" capacity.</p>
<p>While there was no onboard display, it did have a one-color 720p laser projection system that would project onto your hand. The UI looked just like a smartwatch, and you controlled it with the same hand you're using as a projection screen. You could tilt your palm around to select something and tap your fingers together to confirm, all the while distorting and moving the "display" being projected onto your hand. The smartwatch-like UI raises the question: "Why not just wear a smartwatch instead?" Then you'd have real apps, a real display, a less-weird form factor, better input, and better voice commands, and it would probably cost less. Oh, yeah, about that price: The Humane AI Pin was $700 <em>plus</em> a $24-a-month subscription fee, while an Apple Watch Series 9 is $400.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026234#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026234&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whales use complex communication systems we still don’t understand, a trope exploited in sci-fi shows like Apple TV’s <em>Extrapolations</em>. That show featured a humpback whale (voiced by Meryl Streep) discussing Mahler’s symphonies with a human researcher via some AI-powered inter-species translation app developed in 2046.</p>
<p>We’re a long way from that future. But a team of MIT researchers has now analyzed a database of Caribbean sperm whales’ calls and has found there really is a contextual and combinatorial structure in there. But does it mean whales have a human-like language and we can just wait until Chat GPT 8.0 to figure out how to translate from English to Sperm-Whaleish? Not really.</p>
<h2>One-page dictionary</h2>
<p>“Sperm whales communicate using clicks. These clicks occur in short packets we call codas that typically last less than two seconds, containing three to 40 clicks,” said Pratyusha Sharma, a researcher at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the lead author of the study. Her team argues that codas are analogues of words in human language and are further organized in coda sequences that are analogues of sentences. “Sperm whales are not born with this communication system; it's acquired and changes over the course of time,” Sharma said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025782#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025782&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>General Motors appears to have solved the problem that was holding back the production of its Ultium-based electric vehicles. These are now rolling out of factories—you can expect to read about the new Silverado EV tomorrow and the (allegedly affordable) Equinox EV next week, to name but two. We got <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/the-2024-chevrolet-blazer-first-drive-gms-ev-platform-goes-mainstream/">a first-blush drive of the Blazer this past winter</a> before GM had to put a stop on sales due to some… <a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/701169/2024-blazer-ev-stranded-broken/">glitches</a>. Now, with the vehicle back on sale and the software debugged, it's time to see if the fixes helped.</p>
<p>In reintroducing the Blazer EV and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/gm-starts-selling-chevy-blazer-evs-again-cuts-prices-up-to-6250/">returning it to market</a>, Chevy has also lowered the price pretty significantly, by an average of about $6,000 per model. The LT AWD now starts at $48,800, and there's a $7,500 incentive for customers who aren't eligible for the IRS clean vehicle tax credit. The RS AWD, which we tested, has an MSRP of $53,200, but with the delivery charge and GM's cash on the hood, it came in at $47,095. Both have an 85 kWh battery good for 279 miles (449 km) max range per charge. The longer-range, bigger-battery 102 kWh RS RWD boasts a more impressive 324 miles ( 521 km) per charge and works out to $48,670.</p>
<p>These are pretty competitive prices when you consider the mid-sized EV SUV segment. An obvious comparison: The Ioniq 5 SE AWD costs $49,350 and cannot qualify for the federal tax credit (unless leased), and its range runs shy of the Chevy Blazer RS AWD, too, at 260 miles (418 km) versus the Chevy's 279.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026183#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026183&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This June, approximately 150 motorcycles will thunder down Route 9W in Saugerties, New York, for Ryan’s Ride for Recovery. Organized by Vince Kelder and his family, the barbecue and raffle will raise money to support their sober-living facility and honor their son who tragically died from a heroin overdose in 2015 after a yearslong drug addiction.</p>
<p>The Kelders established Raising Your Awareness about Narcotics (RYAN) to help others struggling with substance-use disorder. For years, the organization has relied on Eventbrite, an event management and ticketing website, to arrange its events. This year, however, alongside listings for Ryan’s Ride and other addiction recovery events, Eventbrite surfaced listings peddling illegal sales of prescription drugs like Xanax, Valium, and oxycodone.</p>
<p>“It’s criminal,” Vince Kelder says. “They’re preying on people trying to get their lives back together.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026185#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026185&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles account for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions">about 23 percent</a> of US vehicle emissions. That's much less than the amount of greenhouse gases emitted each year by light-duty vehicles, but if anything, businesses can often have a clearer case for electrification, whether that's to save money on annual running costs or to meet ESG goals. The annual Advanced Clean Transportation Expo is currently underway in Las Vegas, and yesterday Motiv Electric Trucks revealed the production version of its new modular medium-duty EV, the Argo.</p>
<p>Motiv has been around since 2009 and has been selling electric powertrains for school buses, step vans, box trucks, and even trolleys. Now it's branching out with its own vehicle, the modular Argo, which is capable of carrying up to 14,000 lbs (6,350 kg) with a range of up to 200 miles (321 km).</p>
<p>"Overnight we've moved from a company primarily serving a narrow slice of the $20 billion medium duty truck market to one that can serve nearly that entire market," said Motiv CEO Scott Griffith. "The launch of Argo is a transformational moment for our company as we can now offer more vehicles and options to help more fleet customers meet their sustainability goals."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026165#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026165&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla fans—and CEO Elon Musk himself—are excited about the prospects for Tesla’s Full Self Driving (FSD) software. Tesla released a major upgrade—version 12.3—of the software in March. Then, last month, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1776351450542768368" rel="">Musk announced</a> that Tesla would unveil a purpose-built robotaxi on August 8. Last week, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1790627471844622435" rel="">announced</a> that a new version of FSD—12.4—will come out in the coming days and will have a “5X to 10X improvement in miles per intervention.”</p>
<p>But I think fans expecting Tesla to launch a driverless taxi service in the near future will be disappointed.</p>
<p>During a late March trip to San Francisco, I had a chance to try the latest self-driving technology from both Tesla and Google’s Waymo.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026117#p3">Read 74 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026117&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>British electric vehicle company BEDEO specializes in turning diesel vans into hybrids thanks to smart in-wheel motor tech. And its latest project—an electric Land Rover Defender conversion—could see its tech wind up on your driveway.</p>
<p>Land Rover's now defunct "old" Defender is a ripe candidate for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/how-ev-technology-is-bringing-hot-rodding-into-the-21st-century/3/">an EV restomod</a>. There's space for motors, batteries, and various other sundries within; in certain parts of the world, you'll find yourself tripping over them without trying. For some reason, people go all gooey with nostalgia over them, so they don't mind throwing money at their perfect Landie. There are plenty out there already—the UK military is <a href="https://expeditionportal.com/british-army-to-electrify-classic-land-rover-defenders-with-electrogenic/">looking into converting</a> some of its fleet of Defenders into EVs, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/this-range-rover-classic-restomod-runs-on-tesla-power/">restomod companies will sell you</a> one upholstered with the skin of an exotic creature, and numerous others promise <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/want-a-boxy-suv-that-runs-on-batteries-check-out-the-twisted-nas-e/">super silent cruising</a> up and down the lumps and bumps of the world.</p>
<p>Whereas most will rip out the diesel motor and replace it with a traditional EV powertrain, BEDEO's method is different. Rather than mounting the motor(s) on the chassis, connected to the wheels by driveshafts, the company hub-mounts them, putting a motor in each wheel, saving room elsewhere to avoid encroaching on space previously used by oily bits.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025856#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025856&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first crewed test flight of Boeing's long-delayed Starliner spacecraft won't take off as planned Saturday and could face a longer postponement as engineers evaluate a stubborn leak of helium from the capsule's propulsion system.</p>
<p>NASA announced the latest delay of the Starliner test flight late Tuesday. Officials will take more time to consider their options for how to proceed with the mission after discovering the small helium leak on the spacecraft's service module.</p>
<p>The space agency did not describe what options are on the table, but sources said they range from flying the spacecraft "as is" with a thorough understanding of the leak and confidence it won't become more significant in flight, to removing the capsule from its Atlas V rocket and taking it back to a hangar for repairs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026155#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026155&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With a zap of electricity from well-placed electrodes on the back of the neck, patients with <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/tetraplegia">tetraplegia</a> can regain some modest yet potentially "life-changing" functioning of their hands and arms, according to data from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02940-9">a small clinical trial published Monday in Nature Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The relatively simple stimulation method—which requires no surgery—offers an accessible and more affordable non-invasive means for those living with paralysis to regain some meaningful function, the researchers behind the trial say. However, the therapy's further potential remains limited given that scientists have yet to fully understand exactly why it works.</p>
<p>For the trial, 60 patients with tetraplegia underwent the stimulation therapy over at least 24 sessions during a two-month period. At the end, 72 percent (43 patients) saw clinically meaningful improvements in both strength and functional performance. Further, 90 percent (54 patients) saw improvement from at least one strength or functional outcome. There were no serious adverse events reported.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026123#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026123&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, Google sent a cashier's check to the US government that it claimed in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/US-v-Google-Memo-in-Support-of-Motion-to-Dismiss-5-16-2024.pdf">court filing</a> covers "every dollar the United States could conceivably hope to recover" in damages during the Google <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies">adtech monopoly trial</a> scheduled to start this September.</p>
<p>According to Google, sending the check moots the government's sole claim for damages, which in turn foils the government's plan to seek a jury trial under its damages claim. While Google disputes liability for any of the government's claims, the payment serves to "prevent the tail from wagging the dog," the court filing said.</p>
<p>It's unclear just how big the check was. The court filing redacted key figures to protect Google's trade secrets. But Google claimed that testimony from US experts "shrank" the damages estimate "considerably" from initial estimates between $100 million and $300 million, suggesting that the current damages estimate is "substantially less" than what the US has paid so far in expert fees to reach those estimates.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026097#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026097&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It doesn't take a lot of energy to dig up coal or pump oil from the ground. By contrast, most renewable sources of energy involve obtaining and refining resources, sophisticated manufacturing, and installation. So, at first glance, when it comes to the energy used to get more energy—the energy return on investment—fossil fuels seem like a clear winner. That has led some to argue that transitioning to renewables will create an overall drop in net energy production, which nobody is interested in seeing.</p>
<p>A new study by researchers at the UK's University of Leeds, however, suggests that this isn't a concern at all—in most countries, renewables already produce more net energy than the fossil fuels they're displacing. The key to understanding why is that it's much easier to do useful things with electricity than it is with a hunk of coal or a glob of crude oil.</p>
<h2>Energy efficiency and utility</h2>
<p>The basic idea behind the new work is that while it's energetically cheap to extract fossil fuels, the stuff that comes out of the ground isn't ready to be put to use. There are energetic costs to making it into a useful form and transporting it to where it's needed, and then there is lost energy when it's being put to use. That's especially notable for uses like internal combustion engines, where significantly less than half of the energy available in gasoline actually gets converted into motion.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026106#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026106&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After three test flights, SpaceX has shown that the world's most powerful rocket can reach space. Now, engineers must demonstrate the company's next-generation Starship vehicle can get back home.</p>
<p>This will be the central objective for the fourth Starship test flight, which could happen as soon as early June, according to Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>There are lots of ways to enjoy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, beyond the core attack/dodge/survive gameplay. You can obsess over builds, appreciate the mastery of speedrunners and grand masters like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23198342/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-fromsoftware-bandai-namco-gift-box">Let Me Solo Her</a>, or mix and match the huge variety of armor in pursuit of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionsouls/">Fashion Souls</a>. And then there is lore. There is so much of it, and most of it has the consistency of campfire smoke.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring</em> tells its backstory (written <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135223/elden-ring-did-george-r-r-martin-write-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">in part by George R.R. Martin</a>) primarily through item descriptions and environmental hints. The scraps of narrative that do exist stand unsteadily against unreliable narrators, contradictions, <a href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-cut-content-shadow-erdtree-miquella-dreams-st-trina/">cut content</a>, and lovably enthusiastic fans who take small hints to their illogical extremes. Developer FromSoftware and primary creator Hidetaka Miyazaki do almost nothing to disprove misunderstandings or reward accurate conclusions, although they appreciate the energy. Miyazaki will just <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-look-back-interview-profile">casually tell IGN</a> that there's a "small element" that hasn't been discovered, offer nothing more on that, and leave fans like me craven with an unmet need for conclusion.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> story trailer. </p></div>
<p>I love this and cherish the way FromSoftware will never in my lifetime confirm my hopes or expectations. So with the surprise arrival of an honest-to-goodness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uT8wGtB3yQ">story-based trailer for the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion</a>, due out June 21, I was given yet another feast of vague notions and evocative images.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025855#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025855&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
