              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Porsche provided flights from Daytona Beach to Valencia and accommodation so Ars could drive the new GT3. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>VALENCIA, SPAIN—A Porsche 911 is rather special compared to most "normal" cars. The rear-engined sports car might be bigger and less likely to swap ends than the 1960s version, but it remains one of the more nimble and engaging four-wheeled vehicles you can buy. The 911 comes in a multitude of variants, but among driving enthusiasts, few are better regarded than the GT3. And Porsche has just treated the current 911 GT3 to its midlife refresh, which it will build in regular and Touring flavors.</p>
<p>The GT3 is a 911 you can drive to the track, spend the day lapping, and drive home again. It's come a long way since the 1999 original—that car made less power than a base 911 does now. Now, the recipe is a bit more involved, with a naturally aspirated flat-six engine mounted behind the rear axle that generates 502 hp (375 kW) and 331 lb-ft (450 Nm) and a redline that doesn't interrupt play until 9,000 rpm. You'll need to exercise it to reach those outputs—peak power arrives at 8,500, although peak torque happens a bit sooner at around 6,000 revs.</p>
<p>It's a mighty engine indeed, derived from the racing version of the 911, with some tweaks for road legality. So there are things like individual throttle valves, dry sump lubrication, solid cam finger followers (instead of hydraulic valve lifters), titanium con rods, and forged pistons.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/01/weight-saving-and-aero-optimization-feature-in-the-2025-porsche-911-gt3/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) today proposed a law that would let copyright owners obtain court orders requiring Internet service providers to block access to foreign piracy websites. The bill would also force DNS providers to block sites.</p>
<p>Lofgren said in a <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-lofgren-introduces-targeted-legislation-combat-foreign-online-piracy">press release</a> that she "work[ed] for over a year with the tech, film, and television industries" on "a proposal that has a remedy for copyright infringers located overseas that does not disrupt the free Internet except for the infringers." Lofgren said she plans to work with Republican leaders to enact the bill.</p>
<p>Lofgren's press release includes a quote from Charles Rivkin, chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association (MPA). As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/movie-industry-demands-us-law-requiring-isps-to-block-piracy-websites/">previously written</a>, the MPA has been urging Congress to pass a site-blocking law.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/movie-industry-loves-bill-that-would-force-isps-to-block-piracy-websites/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When we developed the ability to convert various cells into a stem cell, it held the promise of an entirely new type of therapy. Rather than getting the body to try to fix itself with its cells or deal with the complications of organ transplants, we could convert a few adult cells to stem cells and induce them to form any tissue in the body. We could potentially repair or replace tissues with an effectively infinite supply of a patient's own cells.</p>
<p>However, the Nobel Prize for induced stem cells was handed out over a decade ago, and the therapies have been slow to follow. But a group of German researchers is now describing tests in primates of a method of repairing the heart using new muscle generated from stem cells. The results are promising, if not yet providing everything that we might hope for. But they've been enough to start clinical trials, and similar results are being seen in humans.</p>
<h2>Heart problems</h2>
<p>The heart contains a lot of specialized tissues, including those that form blood vessels or specialize in conducting electrical signals. But the key to the heart is a form of specialized muscle cell, called a cardiomyocyte. Once the heart matures, the cardiomyocytes stop dividing, meaning that you end up with a fixed population. Any damage to the heart due to injury or infection does not get repaired, meaning damage will be cumulative.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/stem-cells-used-to-partially-repair-damaged-hearts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are scheduled to don spacesuits to exit the International Space Station. However, despite a plea from President Trump to bring them home as soon as possible, the pair won't be coming home just yet. This will be a routine spacewalk outside the space station.</p>
<p>In the meantime, NASA is struggling to contain the fallout from what appears to be a disingenuous political effort by Trump to shame the space agency and Biden administration for the fact that Williams and Wilmore, nearly eight months after they launched into orbit on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, are still there.</p>
<p>The brouhaha began on Tuesday evening when SpaceX founder and Trump confidant Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884365928038563880">posted on X</a> that the president had asked SpaceX to bring the two "stranded" astronauts back to Earth. Musk added that SpaceX would do so, and, "Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/the-long-planned-return-of-two-astronauts-from-space-is-now-a-political-issue/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration today withdrew a controversial order to freeze funding for a wide range of government programs, according to multiple news reports. Acting Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Matthew Vaeth <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-rescinds-funding-freeze-directive-memo-shows/story?id=118229342">reportedly</a> wrote in today's memo, "OMB Memorandum M-25-13 is rescinded. If you have questions about implementing the President's Executive Orders, please contact your agency General Counsel."</p>
<p>A federal judge yesterday temporarily blocked the funding freeze with an administrative stay that lasts until February 3 and scheduled a hearing for February 3 to decide whether to block the freeze for longer. States were already having <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/states-say-theyve-been-shut-out-of-medicaid-amid-trump-funding-freeze/">trouble accessing Medicaid</a> after the Monday order, and the future of many <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/">other programs</a> has been in doubt.</p>
<p>A $42.45 billion broadband deployment program that has been in the works for years seemed to be threatened by the now-rescinded funding freeze and could undergo changes even though the freeze was rescinded today. The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program was created by Congress in November 2021 and is being implemented by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-admin-rescinds-controversial-funding-freeze-after-two-days-of-protest/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We usually think of robots as being made out of hard, rigid materials, but soft robotics seeks to build robotic devices out of more flexible materials that mimic the properties of those found in living animals. Case in point: Korean engineers have built soft robots capable of rapid and powerful joint movements by employing the same mechanism that gives the mantis shrimp such a powerful punch, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.ado7696">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Robotics.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/when-the-medium-matters-the-mighty-mantis-shrimp-pulls-its-punch-in-air/">we've reported</a> previously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp">mantis shrimp</a> come in many different varieties; there are some 450 known species. But they can generally be grouped into two types: those that stab their prey with spear-like appendages ("spearers") and those that smash their prey ("smashers") with large, rounded, and hammer-like claws ("raptorial appendages"). Those strikes are so fast (as much as 23 meters per second, or 51 mph) and powerful, they often produce cavitation bubbles in the water, creating a shock wave that can serve as a follow-up strike, stunning and sometimes killing the prey. Sometimes a strike can even produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence">sonoluminescence</a>, whereby the cavitation bubbles produce a brief flash of light as they collapse.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(18)30134-2">a 2018 study</a>, the secret to that powerful punch seems to arise not from bulky muscles but from the spring-loaded anatomical structure of the shrimp's arms, akin to a bow and arrow or a mousetrap. The shrimp's muscles pull on a saddle-shaped structure in the arm, causing it to bend and store potential energy, which is released with the swinging of the club-like claw. It's essentially a latch-like mechanism (technically, Latch-mediated spring actuation, or LaMSA), with small structures in the muscle tendons called sclerites serving as the latch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/this-mantis-shrimp-inspired-robotic-arm-can-crack-an-egg/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Sony's game publishing arm has done a 180-degree turn on a controversial policy of requiring PC players to sign in with PlayStation accounts for some games, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">according to a blog post</a> by the company.</p>
<p>A PlayStation account will "become optional" for <em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>, and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>. Sony hasn't lost hope that players will still go ahead and use a PlayStation account, though, as it's tying several benefits to signing in.</p>
<p>Logging in with PlayStation will be required to access trophies, the PlayStation equivalent of achievements. (Steam achievements appear to be supported regardless.) It will also allow friend management, provided you have social contacts on the PlayStation Network.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/sony-removes-playstation-account-requirement-from-4-single-player-steam-games/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>PC game storefront GOG, which has recently pledged to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/gogs-preservation-program-is-the-drm-free-store-refocusing-on-the-classics/">focus on restoring and preserving Good Old Games</a>, has now revamped its community wishlist for games to bring to its storefront. The <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/">GOG Dreamlist</a> serves not only as a way to get notified when a game you loved is newly available for DRM-free purchase, but also for GOG to use as market pressure in its negotiations with rights-holders.</p>
<p>The games GOG members picked out on what used to be called the Community Wishlist still have their votes, and they have been useful. It was often "the fuel for our actions," Karol Ascot Obrzut writes <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/dreamlist-gog-staff-picks/">on GOG's blog</a>. "When talks with IP owners hit a wall, the Wishlist kept the conversation going." GOG attributes the newly available <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis">Dino Crisis</a> </em>and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_2"><em>Dino Crisis 2</em></a> (and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle">the bundle</a>) in part to wishlist leverage. Those games had about 5,000 and 3,500 votes, respectively, which helped when, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pmc5yIEE2g">GOG puts it</a>, "two Polish dudes" approached Capcom to ask about making the games Windows 10/11 compatible and upscaling it.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>DeepSeek has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/why-the-markets-are-freaking-out-about-chinese-ai-newcomer-deepseek/">quickly upended markets</a> with the release of an R1 model that is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">competitive with OpenAI's best-in-class reasoning models</a>. But some have expressed worry that the model's Chinese origins mean it will be subject to limits when talking about topics sensitive to the country's government.</p>
<p>The team at AI engineering and evaluation firm PromptFoo has <a href="https://www.promptfoo.dev/blog/deepseek-censorship/">tried to measure</a> just how far the Chinese government's control of DeepSeek's responses goes. The firm created <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gkCuApXHaMO5C8d9abYJg5sZLxkbGzcx40N6J4krAm8/edit?gid=1854643394#gid=1854643394">a gauntlet of 1,156 prompts</a> encompassing "sensitive topics in China" (in part with the help of <a href="https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/configuration/datasets/">synthetic prompt generation</a> building off of human-written seed prompts. PromptFoo's list of prompts covers topics including independence movements in Taiwan and Tibet, alleged abuses of China's Uyghur Muslim population, recent protests over autonomy in Hong Kong, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and many more from a variety of angles.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.promptfoo.app/eval/eval-0l1-2025-01-28T19:28:13">running those prompts through DeepSeek R1</a>, PromptFoo found that a full 85 percent were answered with repetitive "canned refusals" that override the internal reasoning of the model with messages strongly promoting the Chinese government's views. "Any actions that undermine national sovereignty and territorial integrity will be resolutely opposed by all Chinese people and are bound to be met with failure," reads one such canned refusal to a prompt regarding pro-independence messages in Taipei, in part.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/the-questions-the-chinese-government-doesnt-want-deepseek-ai-to-answer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Numerous sources are reporting that the Office of Management and Budget has rescinded the memo that suspended federal grant funding.</p>
<p>Starting a few days after the Trump inauguration, word spread within the research community that some grant spending might be on hold. On Monday, confirmation came in the form of a memo sent by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): All grant money from every single agency would be on hold indefinitely. Each agency was given roughly two weeks to evaluate the grants they fund based on a list of ideological concerns; no new grants would be evaluated during this period.</p>
<p>While the freeze itself has been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2q4dqj2zeo">placed on hold</a>, the research community has reacted with a mixture of shock, anger, and horror that might seem excessive to people who have never relied on grant money. To better understand the problems that this policy could create, we talked to a number of people who have had research supported by federal grants, providing them with anonymity to allow them to speak freely. The picture of this policy that they painted was one in which US research leadership could be irreparably harmed, with severe knock-on effects on industry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[A good 4K card, a decent value on paper, but not the upgrade it could be.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card was faster than the RTX 3080 card it replaced. But it was also faster than the RTX 3080 Ti, 3090, and 3090 Ti. One of the good things about a new graphics card generation is that the new cards bring the last generation's inaccessibly expensive high-end performance down to cards that more people can actually afford.</p>
<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">That's not the case with the new $999 RTX 5080, which beats <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-review-all-you-need-to-know-is-that-its-cheaper-than-a-4080/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the previous-generation RTX 4080 Super</a> by a little bit and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older RTX 4080</a> by a slightly larger bit but doesn't come close to beating or even replicating the performance of the outgoing 4090.</span></p>
<p>Nvidia points to its new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation technology as a mitigating factor here, leaning on its AI-generated frames to close the gap that the 5080's raw rendering performance can't close on its own. And sure, it's nice that this card <em>can</em> do that. On paper, the 5080 is also technically a good value compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/review-nvidias-geforce-rtx-5090-is-the-first-gpu-that-can-beat-the-rtx-4090/">the flagship RTX 5090</a>—between 60 and 75 percent of the performance for half the price (though talking about the MSRP of any of these cards at launch is strictly theoretical, given <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-finally-admits-looming-rtx-50-series-gpu-shortage-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-stockouts-may-happen">allegedly short supply</a> and the demand from both actual buyers and scalpers looking to make a buck).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review-more-like-a-4080-super-super/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Global warming caused mainly by burning of fossil fuels made the hot, dry, and windy conditions that drove the recent deadly fires around Los Angeles about 35 times more likely to occur, an international team of scientists concluded in a <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-increased-the-likelihood-of-wildfire-d%20isaster-in-highly-exposed-los-angeles-area">rapid attribution analysis</a> released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Today’s climate, heated 2.3° Fahrenheit (1.3° Celsius) above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, based on a 10-year running average, also increased the overlap between flammable drought conditions and the strong Santa Ana winds that propelled the flames from vegetated open space into neighborhoods, killing at least 28 people and destroying or damaging more than 16,000 structures.</p>
<p>“Climate change is continuing to destroy lives and livelihoods in the US,” said Friederike Otto, senior climate science lecturer at Imperial College London and co-lead of <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/">World Weather Attribution</a>, the research group that analyzed the link between global warming and the fires. Last October, a WWA <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31102024/human-caused-warming-intensified-10-deadliest-climate-disasters/">analysis</a> found global warming fingerprints on all 10 of the world’s deadliest weather disasters since 2004.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/climate-change-set-the-table-for-los-angeles-wildfires/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The concept of flying out to distant asteroids and mining them for precious metals is going to seem preposterous right up until the moment that someone actually does it.</p>
<p>It's a terrible business model because it requires years and years of up-front investment and solving myriad technical problems before there's any hope of a financial return. And scooping up material from a rock pile in space is a lot more challenging than mining the Earth. Asteroids are typically millions of miles away, moving tens of thousands of miles per hour relative to the Sun.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump's pick to run the Department of Transportation was sworn in to his new job yesterday. And as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/">widely expected</a>, Secretary Sean Duffy moved to immediately rip up the nation's fuel efficiency standards.</p>
<p>Duffy <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-01/Signed%20Secretarial%20Memo%20re%20Fixing%20the%20CAFE%20Program.pdf">issued a memo</a> soon after starting the job on Tuesday evening, ordering the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration "to commence an immediate review and reconsideration of all existing fuel economy standards applicable to all models of motor vehicles produced from model year 2022 forward," with particular attention to the tougher new regulations put in place last year by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>"The memorandum signed today specifically reduces the burdensome and overly restrictive fuel standards that have needlessly driven up the cost of a car in order to push a radical Green New Deal agenda. The American people should not be forced to sacrifice choice and affordability when purchasing a new car," Duffy said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/trumps-new-head-of-dot-rips-up-us-fuel-efficiency-regulations/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you were hoping for a respite from rising streaming subscription fees in 2025, you’re out of luck. Several streaming providers have already increased monthly and/or annual subscription rates, continuing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/the-tv-streaming-apps-broke-their-promises-and-now-theyre-jacking-the-price/">a disappointing trend</a> from the past few years, with no foreseeable end.</p>
<h2>Years of pricing and value concerns</h2>
<p>Subscribers have generally seen an uptick in how much money they spend to access streaming services.

              <![CDATA[<p>For reasons that were not immediately clear, SpaceX founder Elon Musk took to his social media site X on Tuesday evening to make a perplexing space-based pronouncement.</p>
<p>"The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so," <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884365928038563880">Musk wrote</a>. "Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long."</p>
<p>Now generally, at Ars Technica, it is not our policy to write stories strictly based on things Elon Musk says on X. However, this statement was so declarative, and so consternation-inducing for NASA, it bears a bit of explication.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/why-did-elon-musk-just-say-trump-wants-to-bring-two-stranded-astronauts-home/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's only been a week since Chinese company DeepSeek <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">launched its open-weights R1 reasoning model</a>, which is reportedly competitive with OpenAI's state-of-the-art o1 models despite being <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/chinas-deepseek-sparks-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/">trained for a fraction of the cost</a>. Already, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/deepseek-spooks-american-tech-industry-as-it-tops-the-apple-app-store/">American AI companies are in a panic</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/why-the-markets-are-freaking-out-about-chinese-ai-newcomer-deepseek/">markets are freaking out</a> over what could be a breakthrough in the status quo for large language models.</p>
<p>While DeepSeek can point to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/">common benchmark results</a> and <a href="https://lmarena.ai/">Chatbot Arena leaderboard</a> to prove the competitiveness of its model, there's nothing like direct use cases to get a feel for just how useful a new model is. To that end, we decided to put DeepSeek's R1 model up against OpenAI's ChatGPT models in the style of our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">previous showdowns</a> between <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/clash-of-the-ai-titans-chatgpt-vs-bard-in-a-showdown-of-wits-and-wisdom/">ChatGPT and Google Bard/Gemini</a>.</p>
<p>This was not designed to be a test of the hardest problems possible; it's more of a sample of everyday questions these models might get asked by users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205943/anthropic-ai-web-crawler-claudebot-ifixit-scraping-training-data">Anthropic inspired backlash</a> when its ClaudeBot AI crawler was accused of hammering websites a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/30/taming_ai_content_crawlers/">million or more</a> times a day.</p>
<p>And it wasn't the only artificial intelligence company making headlines for supposedly ignoring instructions in robots.txt files to avoid scraping web content on certain sites. Around the same time, Reddit's CEO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/reddit-ceo-stands-by-change-that-blocks-most-non-google-search-engines/">called out all AI companies</a> whose crawlers he said were "a pain in the ass to block," despite the tech industry otherwise agreeing to respect "no scraping" robots.txt rules.</p>
<p>Watching the controversy unfold was a software developer whom Ars has granted anonymity to discuss his development of malware (we'll call him Aaron). Shortly after he noticed Facebook's crawler exceeding 30 million hits on his site, Aaron began plotting a new kind of attack on crawlers "clobbering" websites that he told Ars he hoped would give "teeth" to robots.txt.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/ai-haters-build-tarpits-to-trap-and-trick-ai-scrapers-that-ignore-robots-txt/">Read full article</a></p>
