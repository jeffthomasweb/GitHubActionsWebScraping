<p>BRIGGS, Texas—The new medium-lift rocket under development by Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman will eventually incorporate a recoverable booster that will return to its launch site in Virginia for reuse.</p>
<p>Firefly has previously suggested rocket reuse is on the roadmap for the new rocket—known, for now, only as the Medium Launch Vehicle (MLV)—but officials revealed new details of the plan during a recent visit by Ars to Firefly's rocket factory in rural Central Texas.</p>
<p>“Northrop and Firefly have a similar perspective and that is, for that class of rocket, reusability is a requirement for a bunch of reasons," said Bill Weber, Firefly's CEO. "Economically, it becomes an advantage because we don't have to go build additional floor space ... Similarly, the pricing structure for customers starts to get super competitive, which we absolutely love, and we’ll be right in the middle of.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034632#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034632&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Vulnerabilities that went undetected for a decade left thousands of macOS and iOS apps susceptible to supply-chain attacks. Hackers could have added malicious code compromising the security of millions or billions of people who installed them, researchers said Monday.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities, which were fixed last October, resided in a “trunk” server used to manage <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>, a repository for open source Swift and Objective-C projects that roughly 3 million macOS and iOS apps depend on. When developers make changes to one of their “pods”—CocoaPods lingo for individual code packages—dependent apps typically incorporate them automatically through app updates, typically with no interaction required by end users.</p>
<h2>Code injection vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>“Many applications can access a user’s most sensitive information: credit card details, medical records, private materials, and more,” <a href="https://www.evasec.io/blog/eva-discovered-supply-chain-vulnerabities-in-cocoapods">wrote</a> researchers from EVA Information Security, the firm that discovered the vulnerability. “Injecting code into these applications could enable attackers to access this information for almost any malicious purpose imaginable—ransomware, fraud, blackmail, corporate espionage… In the process, it could expose companies to major legal liabilities and reputational risk.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034866#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034866&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington to Bilbao and accommodation so Ars could drive the Q6 e-tron. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>The arrival of the Q6 e-tron marks a significant milestone on the electric journey that Audi and its corporate siblings began in the wake of dieselgate, nearly a decade ago. Now, after developing electric vehicles based on its own gas-powered models, a cheaper VW platform, and a tweaked Taycan, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/throw-out-all-those-black-boxes-and-say-hello-to-the-software-defined-car/">the brand has led the development</a> of a new platform just for electric vehicles, one that incorporates lessons learned from those earlier EVs.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/audi-is-planning-20-all-electric-models-by-2025-heres-how-it-will-do-it/">followed the development</a> of that Premium Platform Electric architecture and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/audi-debuts-its-next-ev-platform-with-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/">the Q6 e-tron</a> for some time. Now, we've finally been behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Audi made its name with "quattro" all-wheel drive powertrains, and both versions of Q6 e-tron to be offered initially will use twin-motor, all-wheel drive powertrains—an asynchronous motor driving the front wheels and a permanent magnet synchronous motor at the rear. Both versions will use the same capacity 100 kWh (94.4 kWh net) battery pack, which operates at 800 V and DC fast-charges from 10–80 percent in 21 minutes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034780#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034780&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Keith Gill—the meme stock influencer known as "Roaring Kitty" and "DeepF—Value" who has rallied millions on X and Reddit behind GameStop—briefly faced a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Radev-v-Gill-Complaint-6-28-2024.pdf">lawsuit</a> claiming that he knowingly deceived his loyal followers to reap millions of dollars in gains. The lawsuit was <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/123121452012.pdf">voluntarily dismissed</a> by the plaintiff, Martin Radev, on July 1.</p>
<p>The proposed class action was filed Friday by Radev, a GameStop investor who accused Gill of a "pump-and-dump scheme" that allegedly artificially rose prices of GameStop securities between May 13 and June 13. As a result, perhaps thousands of investors were harmed, including Gill's followers, Radev's complaint alleged, while speculating on the class size. On Monday, Radev asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice.</p>
<p>Radev's complaint followed reports <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/gamestop-stock-influencer-roaring-kitty-may-lose-access-to-e-trade-report-says/">that E-Trade was considering banning Gill</a> for suspected stock manipulation but reportedly feared backlash from Gill's so-called meme stock army.

<p>It's clear that streaming services are the present and future of video distribution. But that doesn't mean that cable companies are ready to give up on your monthly dollars.</p>
<p>A sign of this is Comcast, the US's second-biggest cable company, debuting a new streaming service today. Comcast already had an offering that let subscribers stream its Xfinity cable live channels and access some titles on demand. NOW TV Latino differs in being a separate, additional streaming service that people can subscribe to independently of Xfinity cable for $10 per month.</p>
<p>However, unlike streaming services like Netflix or Max, you can only subscribe to NOW TV Latino if Xfinity is sold in your area. NOW TV Latino subscriptions include the ability to stream live TV from Spanish-language channels that Xfinity offers, like Sony Cine and ViendoMovies. And because Comcast owns NBCUniversal, people who subscribe to NOW TV Latino get a free subscription to Peacock with commercials, which usually costs $6 per month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034726#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034726&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Supreme Court has avoided making a final decision on challenges to the Texas and Florida social media laws, but the majority opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan criticized the Texas law and made it clear that content moderation is protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The Texas law "is unlikely to withstand First Amendment scrutiny," the Supreme Court majority wrote. "Texas has thus far justified the law as necessary to balance the mix of speech on Facebook's News Feed and similar platforms; and the record reflects that Texas officials passed it because they thought those feeds skewed against politically conservative voices. But this Court has many times held, in many contexts, that it is no job for government to decide what counts as the right balance of private expression—to 'un-bias' what it thinks biased, rather than to leave such judgments to speakers and their audiences. That principle works for social-media platforms as it does for others."</p>
<p>A Big Tech lobby group that challenged the state laws said it was pleased by the ruling. "In a complex series of opinions that were unanimous in the outcome, but divided 6-3 in their reasoning, the Court sent the cases back to lower courts, making clear that a State may not interfere with private actors' speech," the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association <a href="https://ccianet.org/news/2024/07/supreme-court-issues-ruling-in-ccia-netchoice-challenge-to-florida-texas-social-media-laws/">said</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034680#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034680&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has only been a few years since David Harbour starred in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy_(2019_film)">2019 reboot</a> of the Hellboy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy#In_other_media">film franchise</a>—a critical and box office failure, although Harbour's performance earned praise. But <a href="https://ew.com/see-first-trailer-hellboy-the-crooked-man-jack-kesy-8671521">via Entertainment Weekly</a>, we learned that there's a new reboot coming our way: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy:_The_Crooked_Man">Hellboy: The Crooked Man</a>.</em> The project wrapped filming in May and now has a teaser—inexplicably released in 480p [<strong>UPDATE</strong>: ONE Media posted a higher resolution version, now embedded above]—giving us our first glimpse of star Jack Kesy's (<em>Claws, Deadpool 2</em>) take on Mike Mignola's iconic character.</p>
<p>It's definitely a very different look and vibe from the previous big studio releases. Director Brian Taylor (<em>Crank</em>) is clearly leaning into the low-budget folk horror genre for this, but will fans embrace a bargain-basement <em>Hellboy</em> reboot—even one co-written by Mignola himself?</p>
<p>Mignola based his script on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy:_The_Crooked_Man_and_Others#The_Crooked_Man">a 2008 <em>Hellboy</em> limited series</a> he created, with artwork by Richard Corben. That story features a younger Hellboy wandering in the Appalachian Mountains in 1958 after "finishing up some stuff down South." He meets regional native Tom Ferrell, coming home after decades away. When he was young, Tom was initiated as a witch and has returned to atone for that, even though he has never actually practiced magic—apart from a magical "witch-bone" he carries with him.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034715#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034715&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A federal grand jury has indicted an embattled Alzheimer's researcher for <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/professor-charged-operating-multimillion-dollar-grant-fraud-scheme">allegedly falsifying data to fraudulently obtain $16 million in federal research funding</a> from the National Institutes of Health for the development of a controversial Alzheimer's drug and diagnostic test.</p>
<p>Hoau-Yan Wang, 67, a medical professor at the City University of New York, was a paid collaborator with the Austin, Texas-based pharmaceutical company Cassava Sciences. Wang's research and publications provided scientific underpinnings for Cassava's Alzheimer's treatment, Simufilam, which is <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05026177?term=Simufilam&amp;aggFilters=phase:3&amp;rank=2">now in</a> Phase III <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04994483?term=Simufilam&amp;aggFilters=phase:3&amp;rank=3">trials</a>.</p>
<p>Simufilam is a small-molecule drug that Cassava claims can restore the structure and function of a scaffolding protein in the brain of people with Alzheimer's, leading to slowed cognitive decline. But outside researchers have long expressed doubts and concerns about the research.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034747#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034747&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Exoskeletons today look like something straight out of sci-fi. But the reality is they are nowhere near as robust as their fictional counterparts. They’re quite wobbly, and it takes long hours of handcrafting software policies, which regulate how they work—a process that has to be repeated for each individual user.</p>
<p>To bring the technology a bit closer to <em>Avatar</em>’s Skel Suits or Warhammer 40k power armor, a team at North Carolina University’s Lab of Biomechatronics and Intelligent Robotics used AI to build the first one-size-fits-all exoskeleton that supports walking, running, and stair-climbing. Critically, its software adapts itself to new users with no need for any user-specific adjustments. “You just wear it and it works,” says Hao Su, an associate professor and co-author of the study.</p>
<h2>Tailor-made robots</h2>
<p>An exoskeleton is a robot you wear to aid your movements—it makes walking, running, and other activities less taxing, the same way an e-bike adds extra watts on top of those you generate yourself, making pedaling easier. “The problem is, exoskeletons have a hard time understanding human intentions, whether you want to run or walk or climb stairs. It’s solved with locomotion recognition: systems that recognize human locomotion intentions,” says Su.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034710#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034710&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Meta continues to hit walls with its heavily scrutinized plan to comply with the European Union's strict online competition law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), by offering Facebook and Instagram subscriptions as an alternative for privacy-inclined users who want to opt out of ad targeting.</p>
<p>Today, the European Commission (EC) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_3582">announced</a> preliminary findings that Meta's so-called "pay or consent" or "pay or OK" model—which gives users a choice to either pay for access to its platforms or give consent to collect user data to target ads—is not compliant with the DMA.</p>
<p>According to the EC, Meta's advertising model violates the DMA in two ways. First, it "does not allow users to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise equivalent to the 'personalized ads-based service." And second, it "does not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data," the press release said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034642#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034642&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was the last week in June, and José De Bardi hadn’t gotten much sleep. The trouble had really kicked off on June 18, about a week earlier, when the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/electric-vehicles/">electric vehicle</a> company Fisker announced it had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/ev-firm-fisker-files-for-bankruptcy-months-after-it-stopped-making-the-ocean/">filed for bankruptcy protection</a>. Now some 6,400 Fisker owners like De Bardi wondered: What will happen to their cars in the future?</p>
<p>The bankruptcy “lit a fire,” De Bardi says. “We had to get organized if we had any chance of representing owners’ interests.” Within days, he and a handful of other Fisker vehicle owners had established a nonprofit organization called the <a href="https://www.fiskeroa.com/">Fisker Owners Association</a>, dedicated to keeping their cars running. (Hence, the lack of sleep.) By the end of the month, 1,200 owners—representing nearly a fifth of total Fisker cars sold—had registered through the group’s website, De Bardi says.</p>

<p>One of the most promising Chinese space startups, Space Pioneer, experienced a serious anomaly this weekend while testing the first stage of its Tianlong-3 rocket near the city of Gongyi.</p>
<p>The rocket was undergoing a static fire test of the stage, in which a vehicle is clamped to a test stand while its engines are ignited, when the booster broke free. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240630112213/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6K2mdDWviOlk30oU-JH90Q">According to a statement from the company</a>, the rocket was not sufficiently clamped down and blasted off from the test stand "due to a structural failure."</p>
<p>Video of the accidental ascent showed the rocket rising several hundred meters into the sky before it crashed explosively into a mountain 1.5 km away from the test site. (See <a href="https://x.com/J1NFENG/status/1807334917031825869">various angles of the accident here</a>, on the social media site X, <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5050998629862652#&amp;video">or on Weibo</a>.) The statement from Space Pioneer sought to downplay the incident, saying it had implemented safety measures before the test, and there were no casualties as a result of the accident. "The test site is far away from the urban area of ​​Gongyi," the company said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034603#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034603&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Thus far, even AI companies have had trouble coming up with tools that can reliably detect when a piece of writing was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/openai-admits-that-ai-writing-detectors-dont-work/">generated using a large language model</a>. Now, a group of researchers has established a novel method for estimating LLM usage across a large set of scientific writing by measuring which "excess words" started showing up much more frequently during the LLM era (i.e., 2023 and 2024). The results "suggest that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs," according to the researchers.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016">a pre-print paper posted earlier this month</a>, four researchers from Germany's University of Tubingen and Northwestern University said they were inspired by studies that measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/07/gop-voters-had-higher-excess-deaths-rates-after-covid-vaccine-rollout/">by looking at excess deaths</a> compared to the recent past. By taking a similar look at "excess word usage" after LLM writing tools <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">became widely available in late 2022</a>, the researchers found that "the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words" that was "unprecedented in both quality and quantity."</p>
<h2>Delving in</h2>
<p>To measure these vocabulary changes, the researchers analyzed 14 million paper abstracts published on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a> between 2010 and 2024, tracking the relative frequency of each word as it appeared across each year. They then compared the expected frequency of those words (based on the pre-2023 trendline) to the actual frequency of those words in abstracts from 2023 and 2024, when LLMs were in widespread use.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034045#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034045&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"</span>If you're going to make a car and use all that energy, it should be a good car," said Thomas Ingenlath, CEO of Polestar. Ingenlath was referring to the company's latest electric vehicle, a midsize SUV with striking coupe looks called the Polestar 4. While Ingenlath is on point from a sustainability perspective, it makes good business sense, too. The Polestar 4 needs to be a good car to stand out as it enters <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/automakers-must-build-cheaper-smaller-evs-to-spur-adoption-report-says/">one of the most hotly contested segments</a> of the market.</p>
<p>In fact, Polestar uses less energy to make its latest EV than anything else in its range—the company quotes a carbon footprint of 19.9 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cradle-to-gate-assessment">cradle to gate</a>. Like some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/bmw-explores-recycling-with-the-i-vision-circular-concept/">other automakers</a>, Polestar is using a monomaterial approach to the interior to make recycling easier, choosing the same base plastic for all the components in a particular piece of trim, for example.</p>
<p>The carpets are made from, variously, recycled fishing nets or plastic bottles. The vinyl seats use pine oil instead of the stuff extracted from the ground, and the knitted upholstery fabric—also recycled plastic bottles—was designed to leave no off-cuts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034236#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034236&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ultra-athlete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Edgley">Ross Edgley</a> is no stranger to pushing his body to extremes. He once ran a marathon while pulling a 1-ton car; ran a triathlon while carrying a 100-pound tree; and climbed a 65-foot rope over and over again until he'd climbed the equivalent of Mt. Everest—all for charity. In 2016, he set the world record for the world's longest staged sea swim around the coastline of Great Britain: 1,780 miles over 157 days.</p>
<p>At one point during that swim, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basking_shark">basking shark</a> appeared and swam alongside Edgley for a day and a half. That experience ignited his curiosity about sharks and eventually led to his new National Geographic documentary, <em><a href="https://www.natgeotv.com/ca/shark-vs-ross-edgley">Shark vs. Ross Edgley</a>—</em>part of four full weeks of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qTvntc2MD0">2024 SHARKFEST</a> programming. Edgley matches his athletic prowess against four different species of shark. He tries to jump out of the water (polaris) like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark">great white shark</a>; withstand the G forces produced by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerhead_shark">hammerhead shark</a>'s fast, rapid turns; mimic the extreme fasting and feasting regimen of a migrating tiger shark; and match the swimming speed of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortfin_mako_shark">mako shark</a>. </p>
<p>"I love this idea of having a goal and then reverse-engineering and deconstructing it," Edgley told Ars. "[Sharks are] the ultimate ocean athletes. We just had this idea: what if you're crazy enough to try and follow in the footsteps of four amazing sharks? It's an impossible task. You're going to fail, you're going to be humbled. But in the process, we could use it as a sports/shark science experiment, almost like a Trojan horse to bring science and ocean conservation to a new audience."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034182#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034182&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a vast stretch of the Sonoran Desert, between the towns of San Luis Río Colorado and Sonoyta in northern Mexico, sits a modest building of cement, galvanized sheet metal, and wood—the only stop along 125 miles of inhospitable landscape dominated by thorny ocotillo shrubs and towering saguaro cactuses up to 50 feet high. It’s a <em>fonda</em>—a small restaurant—called La Liebre del Desierto (The Desert Hare), and for more than 20 years, owner Elsa Ortiz Ramos has welcomed and nourished weary travelers taking a break from the adjacent highway that runs through the arid Pinacate and Grand Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve.</p>
<p>But the dedication and care of this petite woman go beyond her simple menu. Every two weeks, she pays out of pocket for a 5,000-gallon tank of water to distribute to a network of water troughs strategically placed in the area. By doing so, she relieves the thirst of bighorn sheep, ocelots, pronghorn, coyotes, deer, and even bats that have been deprived of access to their natural water sources.</p>
<p>“The crows come to the house and scream to warn us that there is no more water ... it’s our alarm,” says Ortiz Ramos in her distinct northern Mexico accent. Her words sound straight from an Aesop’s fable, but they take on stark realism in this spot. Covering large parts of Arizona, California, and the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora, the Sonoran Desert—along with the Lut Desert in Iran—was cataloged in 2023 as having <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/move-over-death-valley-these-are-two-hottest-spots-earth">the hottest surface temperature on the planet</a>, at 80.8° Celsius (177° Fahrenheit).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034429#p3">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034429&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A remake of <em>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</em> launched this week, made by the original game's developers. It strikes a fascinating balance between re-creation and reinvention, and based on a couple of hours of playing it, it's a resounding success.</p>
<p><em>Myst</em> was the classic most people remembered fondly from the early CD-ROM era, but for me, its sequel, <em>Riven</em>, was the highlight. After that, the sequels declined in quality. The sophomore effort was the apex.</p>
<p>It was certainly more ambitious than <em>Myst</em>. Instead of a handful of tightly packed theme park worlds, it offered a singular, cohesive one that felt lived in and steeped in history in a way that <em>Myst</em> couldn't quite match.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034421#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two big things happened in the world of text-based disk operating systems in June 1994.</p>
<p>The first is that Microsoft released MS-DOS version 6.22, the last version of its long-running operating system that would be sold to consumers as a standalone product. MS-DOS would continue to evolve for a few years after this, but only as an increasingly invisible loading mechanism for Windows.</p>

<p>The second was that a developer named Jim Hall wrote a post announcing something called “PD-DOS.” Unhappy with Windows 3.x and unexcited by the project we would come to know as Windows 95, Hall wanted to break ground on a new “public domain” version of DOS that could keep the traditional command-line interface alive as most of the world left it behind for more user-friendly but resource-intensive graphical user interfaces.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033083#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033083&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A small group of woolly mammoths became trapped on Wrangel Island around 10,000 years ago when rising sea levels separated the island from mainland Siberia. Small, isolated populations of animals lead to inbreeding and genetic defects, and it has long been thought that the Wrangel Island mammoths ultimately succumbed to this problem about 4,000 years ago.</p>
<p>A paper in Cell on Thursday, however, compared 50,000 years of genomes from mainland and isolated Wrangel Island mammoths and found that this was not the case. What the authors of the paper discovered not only challenges our understanding of this isolated group of mammoths and the evolution of small populations, it also has important implications for conservation efforts today.</p>
<h2>A severe bottleneck</h2>
<p>It’s the culmination of years of genetic sequencing by members of the international team behind this new paper. They studied 21 mammoth genomes—13 of which were newly sequenced by lead author Marianne Dehasque; others had been sequenced years prior by co-authors Patrícia Pečnerová, Foteini Kanellidou, and Héloïse Muller. The genomes were obtained from Siberian woolly mammoths (<i>Mammuthus primigenius</i>), both from the mainland and the island before and after it became isolated. The oldest genome was from a female Siberian mammoth who died about 52,300 years ago. The youngest were from Wrangel Island male mammoths who perished right around the time the last of these mammoths died out (one of them died just 4,333 years ago).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034436#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034436&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Cryptocurrency has always made a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-cryptocurrency-theft-ethereum/">ripe target for theft</a>—and not just hacking, but the old-fashioned, up-close-and-personal kind, too. Given that it can be irreversibly transferred in seconds with little more than a password, it's perhaps no surprise that thieves have occasionally sought to steal crypto in home-invasion burglaries and even kidnappings. But rarely do those thieves leave a trail of violence in their wake as disturbing as that of one recent, ruthless, and particularly prolific gang of crypto extortionists.</p>
<p>The United States Justice Department earlier this week <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-convicted-violent-home-invasion-robberies-steal-cryptocurrency">announced</a> the conviction of Remy Ra St. Felix, a 24-year-old Florida man who led a group of men behind a violent crime spree designed to compel victims to hand over access to their cryptocurrency savings. That announcement and the criminal complaint laying out charges against St. Felix focused largely on a single theft of cryptocurrency from an elderly North Carolina couple, whose home St. Felix and one of his accomplices broke into before physically assaulting the two victims—both in their seventies—and forcing them to transfer more than $150,000 in bitcoin and ether to the thieves' crypto wallets. </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>
<p>In fact, that six-figure sum appears to have been the gang’s only confirmed haul from its physical crypto thefts—although the burglars and their associates made millions in total, mostly through more traditional crypto hacking as well as stealing other assets. A deeper look into court documents from the St. Felix case, however, reveals that the relatively small profit St. Felix’s gang made from its burglaries doesn’t capture the full scope of the harm they inflicted: In total, those court filings and DOJ officials describe how more than a dozen convicted and alleged members of the crypto-focused gang broke into the homes of 11 victims, carrying out a brutal spree of armed robberies, death threats, beatings, torture sessions, and even one kidnapping in a campaign that spanned four US states.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034420#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034420&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
