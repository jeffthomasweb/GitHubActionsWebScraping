              <![CDATA[<p>Andrew Cunningham and Lee Hutchinson have spent decades of their lives with Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson's <em>Wheel of Time</em> books, and they previously brought that knowledge to bear as they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/the-wheel-of-time-season-one/">recapped each first season episode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/the-wheel-of-time-season-two/">second season episode</a> of Amazon's <em>WoT</em> TV series. Now we're back in the saddle for season 3—along with insights, jokes, and the occasional wild theory.</p>
<p>These recaps won't cover every element of every episode, but they will contain major spoilers for the show and the book series. We'll do our best to not spoil major future events from the books, but there's always the danger that something might slip out. <strong>If you want to stay completely unspoiled and haven't read the books, these recaps aren't for you</strong>.</p>
<p>New episodes of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0D2VH77R1"><em>The Wheel of Time</em> season 3</a> will be posted for <a href="https://amzn.to/3Es0B7q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Prime</a> subscribers every Thursday. This write-up covers episode seven, "Goldeneyes," which was released on April 10.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/wheel-of-time-recap-the-show-nails-one-of-the-books-biggest-and-bestest-battles/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google is hosting dozens of extensions in its Chrome Web Store that perform suspicious actions on the more than 4 million devices that have installed them and that their developers have taken pains to carefully conceal.</p>
<p>The extensions, which so far number at least 35, use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers, and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs, and execute scripts. In more detail, the permissions are:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Tabs: manage and interact with browser windows</li>
<li aria-level="1">Cookies: set and access stored browser cookies based on cookie or domain names (ex., "Authorization" or "all cookies for GitHub.com")</li>
<li aria-level="1">WebRequest: intercept and modify web requests the browser makes</li>
<li aria-level="1">Storage: ability to store small amounts of information persistently in the browser (these extensions store their command &amp; control configuration here)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Scripting: the ability to inject new JavaScript into web pages and manipulate the DOM</li>
<li aria-level="1">Alarms: an internal messaging service to trigger events. The extension uses this to trigger events like a cron job as it can allow for scheduling the heartbeat callbacks by the extension</li>
<li aria-level="1">: This works in tandem with other permissions like webRequest, but allows for the extension to be functionally interact all browsing activity (completely unnecessary for an extension that should just look at your installed extensions</li>
</ul>
<p>These sorts of permissions give extensions the ability to do all sorts of potentially abusive things and, as such, should be judiciously granted only to trusted extensions that can’t perform core functions without them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/researcher-uncovers-dozens-of-sketchy-chrome-extensions-with-4-million-installs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/the-harrowing-story-of-what-flying-starliner-was-like-when-its-thrusters-failed/">wrote a story</a> about the wild ride of the Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station last summer. It was based largely on an interview with the commander of the mission, NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore.</p>
<p>His account of Starliner’s thruster failures—and his desperate efforts to keep the vehicle flying on course—was riveting. In the aftermath of the story, many readers, people on social media, and real-life friends congratulated me on conducting a great interview. But truth be told, it was pretty much all Wilmore.</p>
<p>Essentially, when I came into the room, he was primed to talk. I'm not sure if Wilmore was waiting for me specifically to talk to, but he pretty clearly wanted to speak with someone about his experiences aboard the Starliner spacecraft. And he chose me.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/private-jets-awkward-convos-and-kazakh-vodka-my-most-memorable-interviews/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.39 of the Rocket Report! Not getting your launch fix? Buckle up. We're on the cusp of a boom in rocket launches as three new megaconstellations have either just begun or will soon begin deploying thousands of satellites to enable broadband connectivity from space. If the megaconstellations come to fruition, this will require more than a thousand launches in the next few years, on top of SpaceX's blistering Starlink launch cadence. We discuss the topic of megaconstellations in this week's Rocket Report.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

<p><b>So, what is SpinLaunch doing now? </b>Ars Technica has mentioned SpinLaunch, the company that literally wants to yeet satellites into space, in previous Rocket Report newsletters. This company enjoyed some success in raising money for its so-crazy-it-just-might-work idea of catapulting rockets and satellites into the sky, a concept SpinLaunch calls "kinetic launch." But SpinLaunch is now making a hard pivot to small satellites, a move that, on its face, seems puzzling after going all-in on kinetic launch and even performing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEVD9k2GLXk">several impressive hardware tests</a>, throwing a projectile to altitudes of up to 30,000 feet. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/spinlaunch-yes-the-centrifuge-rocket-company-is-making-a-hard-pivot-to-satellites/">Ars got the scoop</a>, with the company's CEO detailing why and how it plans to build a low-Earth orbit telecommunications constellation with 280 satellites.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/rocket-report-no-mans-land-in-rocket-wars-isaacman-lukewarm-on-sls/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Before, ChatGPT just remembered a few facts. Now it can remember much more.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI today <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1910378768172212636">announced</a> a significant expansion of ChatGPT's customization and memory capabilities. For some users, it will now be able to remember information from the full breadth of their prior conversations with it and adjust its responses based on that information.</p>
<p>This means ChatGPT will learn more about the user over time to personalize its responses, above and beyond just a handful of key facts.</p>
<p>Some time ago, OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/amnesia-begone-soon-chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-tell-it-between-sessions/">added</a> a feature called "Memory" that allowed a limited number of pieces of information to be retained and used for future responses. Users often had to specifically ask ChatGPT to remember something to trigger this, though it occasionally tried to guess at what it should remember, too. (When something was added to its memory, there was a message saying that its memory had been updated.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-can-now-remember-and-reference-all-your-previous-chats/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Remember when teachers demanded that you "show your work" in school? Some new types of AI models promise to do exactly that, but <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/reasoning-models-dont-say-think">new research</a> suggests that the "work" they show can sometimes be misleading or disconnected from the actual process used to reach the answer.</p>
<p>New research from Anthropic—creator of the ChatGPT-like Claude AI assistant—examines simulated reasoning (SR) models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">DeepSeek's R1</a>, and its own Claude series. In a research paper <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/71876fabef0f0ed4/original/reasoning_models_paper.pdf">posted last week</a>, Anthropic's Alignment Science team demonstrated that these SR models frequently fail to disclose when they've used external help or taken shortcuts, despite features designed to show their "reasoning" process.</p>
<p>(It's worth noting that OpenAI's o1 and o3 series SR models were excluded from this study.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>After modest success with its first two smartwatches, OnePlus was poised to release a third-generation smartwatch early this year. Unfortunately, the company had to delay the Watch 3 from February to April, and now the previously announced $330 price tag is nowhere to be seen. Instead, the OnePlus Watch 3 has launched at an eye-watering $500 in the US, and you can probably guess why.</p>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 was all set for release a few months ago, but early reviewers spotted an embarrassing typo on the device. Like most smartwatches, OnePlus printed the watch's key specs on the bottom of the housing. Part of that text was supposed to read "Made in China," but instead, it said "Meda in China." Oops.</p>
<p>OnePlus delayed the launch so it could correct the mistake on retail units. However, the US-China trade relationship has deteriorated dramatically in the intervening weeks. Since the watch is <del>meda</del> made in China, it is subject to tariffs—the amount of Trump's China tariffs is changing on an almost daily basis, but it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/amazons-chinese-sellers-to-raise-prices-or-quit-us-market-as-tariffs-hit-145/">currently 145 percent</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/after-typo-fixing-delay-oneplus-watch-3-launches-with-50-higher-price/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 2023, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/take-an-eye-popping-3d-tour-of-the-titanics-digital-twin/">we reported</a> on the unveiling of the first full-size 3D digital scan of the remains of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>—a "digital twin" that captured the wreckage in unprecedented detail. Magellan Ltd, a <a href="https://www.magellan.gg/titanic-in-3d/">deep-sea mapping company</a>, and Atlantic Productions conducted the scans over a six-week expedition. That project is the subject of the new National Geographic documentary <a href="https://www.natgeotv.com/za/programs/natgeo/titanic-the-digital-resurrection"><em>Titanic: The Digital Resurrection</em></a>, detailing several fascinating initial findings from experts' ongoing analysis of that full-size scan.</p>
<p><em>Titanic</em> met its doom just four days into the Atlantic crossing, roughly 375 miles (600 kilometers) south of Newfoundland. At 11:40 pm ship's time on April 14, 1912, <em>Titanic</em> hit that infamous iceberg and began taking on water, flooding five of its 16 watertight compartments, thereby sealing its fate. More than 1,500 passengers and crew perished; only around 710 of those on board survived.</p>
<p><em>Titanic</em> remained undiscovered at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean until an expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and Robert Ballard reached the wreck on September 1, 1985. The ship split apart as it sank, with the bow and stern sections lying roughly one-third of a mile apart. The bow proved to be surprisingly intact, while the stern showed severe structural damage, likely flattened from the impact as it hit the ocean floor. There is a debris field spanning a 5×3-mile area, filled with furniture fragments, dinnerware, shoes and boots, and other personal items.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/3d-digital-twin-of-titanic-wreck-yields-fresh-insights/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google has long been on the lookout for ways to break Microsoft's stranglehold on US government office software, and the current drive to cut costs may be it. Google and the federal government have announced an agreement that makes Google Workspace available to all agencies at a significant discount, trimming 71 percent from the service's subscription price tag.</p>
<p>Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the government has engaged in a campaign of unbridled staffing reductions and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/despite-court-orders-climate-and-energy-programs-stalled-by-trump-freeze/">program cancellations</a>, all with the alleged aim of reducing federal spending. It would appear Google recognized this opportunity, negotiating with the General Services Administration (GSA) to offer Workspace at a lower price. Google claims the deal could yield up to $2 billion in savings.</p>
<p>Google has previously offered discounts for federal agencies interested in migrating to Workspace, but it saw little success displacing Microsoft. The Windows maker has enjoyed decades as an entrenched tech giant, leading the 365 productivity tools to proliferate throughout the government. While Google has gotten some agencies on board, Microsoft has traditionally won the lion's share of contracts, including the $8 billion Defense Enterprise Office Solutions contract that pushed Microsoft 365 to all corners of the Pentagon beginning in 2020.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-slashes-workspace-pricing-for-feds-to-capitalize-on-cost-cutting/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For quick reminders and can’t-miss memos, sticky notes are effective tools, and I'd argue that the simplicity of the sticky note is its best attribute. But the ease behind propping up sticky notes also means that it’s easy for people to find their desks covered in the things, making it difficult to glean critical information quickly.</p>
<p>Rocketbook, a Boston-based company that also makes<a href="https://getrocketbook.com/products/rocketbook-core"> reusable notebooks</a>, thinks it has a solution for sticky note overload in the form of an app that interprets handwriting and organizes reusable sticky notes. But not everyone has the need—or time—for a dedicated sticky notes app.</p>
<h2>Rocketbook’s Reusable Sticky Notes</h2>
<p>Like Rocketbook’s flagship notebooks, its Reusable Sticky Notes rely on erasable pens that allow you to use the paper repeatedly. The Reusable Sticky Notes work with the Rocketbook app (available for iOS or Android), which transforms the sticky notes into images that are automatically stored in the app and can be emailed to specified people (as a PDF) or shared with third-party apps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/hands-on-handwriting-recognition-app-brings-sticky-notes-into-the-21st-century/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating telework for staff who review drugs, medical devices, and tobacco, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-remote-work-telework-f7b6036c62f44359b5d04fafb9eb5fec">reporting by the Associated Press</a>. Review staff and supervisors are now allowed to resume telework at least two days a week, according to an internal email obtained by the AP.</p>
<p>The move reverses a jarring return-to-office decree by the Trump administration, which it used to spur resignations from federal employees. Now, after a wave of such resignations and a brutal round of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/this-will-be-a-painful-period-rfk-jr-slashes-24-of-us-health-dept/">layoffs that targeted about 3,500 staff</a>, the move to restore some telework appears aimed at keeping the remaining talent amid fears that the agency's review capabilities are at risk of collapse.</p>
<p>The cut of 3,500 staff is a loss of about 19 percent of the agency's workforce, and staffers told the AP that lower-level employees are "pouring" out of the agency amid the Trump administration's actions. Entire offices responsible for FDA policies and regulations have been shuttered. Most of the agency's communication staff have been wiped out, as well as teams that support food inspectors and investigators, the AP reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/fda-backpedals-on-rto-to-stop-talent-hemorrhage-after-hhs-bloodbath/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Chinese companies that sell to US customers on Amazon are reportedly preparing to raise prices or quit the US market because of tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has meanwhile confirmed that he expects the cost of tariffs to be passed on to US buyers.</p>
<p>Reuters talked to several individual sellers and a Chinese trade association that represents over 3,000 Amazon sellers for an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-sellers-amazon-hike-prices-or-exit-us-tariffs-soar-association-says-2025-04-10/">article</a> published today. "It'll be very hard for anyone to survive in the US market" because "the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed" by the tariffs, Reuters was told by Wang Xin, who leads the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association. Xin also "not[ed] the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs."</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-boosts-china-tariffs-to-125-pauses-tariff-hikes-on-other-countries/">increased tariffs</a> on China imports to 125 percent yesterday even as he announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes affecting other countries. The total tariffs are 145 percent because the newly raised tariff "comes on top of a 20 percent fentanyl-related tariff that Trump previously imposed on China," CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/china-trump-tariffs-live-updates.html">wrote</a> today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/amazons-chinese-sellers-to-raise-prices-or-quit-us-market-as-tariffs-hit-145/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, OpenAI <a href="ttps://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Musk-v-Altman-Response-to-Amended-Complaint-4-9-25.pdf">counter-sued</a> Elon Musk, alleging that Musk's "sham" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/sam-altman-openai-is-not-for-sale-even-for-elon-musks-97-billion-offer/">bid to buy OpenAI</a> was intentionally timed to maximally disrupt and potentially even frighten off investments from honest bidders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Slamming Musk for attempting to become an "AGI dictator," OpenAI said that if Musk's allegedly "relentless" yearslong campaign of "harassment" isn’t stopped, Musk could end up taking over OpenAI and tanking its revenue the same way he did with Twitter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In its filing, OpenAI argued that Musk and the other investors who joined his bid completely fabricated the $97.375 billion offer. It was allegedly not based on OpenAI's projections or historical performance, like Musk claimed, but instead appeared to be "a comedic reference to Musk’s favorite sci-fi" novel, Iain Banks' <em>Look to Windward</em>. Musk and others also provided "no evidence of financing to pay the nearly $100 billion purchase price," OpenAI said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/elon-musk-wants-to-be-agi-dictator-openai-tells-court/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For its third incarnation, the Mini Countryman now comes in an all-electric variant. The Countryman is Mini's take on the family car, a compact crossover with bold design both inside and out. At a time when far too many automakers are supersizing their vehicles, Mini's offerings are still right-sized, even if the Countryman is a bit bigger than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/minis-new-countryman-hybrid-is-hobbled-by-too-small-a-battery/">the model it replaces</a>. But at times, you might be left feeling that style took preference over substance.</p>
<p>The previous Countryman was available with the brand's only plug-in hybrid powertrain, but Mini now only offers the Countryman with either an internal combustion engine or as a full battery electric vehicle. Consequently, the Countryman SE is a fair bit more expensive now, starting at $45,200 before any tariffs are taken into account.</p>
<p>Much of that money has gone to more lithium-ion—66.5 kWh in total (64.7 kWh useable), coupled to a pair of electric motors with a combined output of 308 hp (230 kW) and 364 lb-ft (494 Nm). That's sufficient for an EPA range estimate of 212 miles (341 km), although that might be a little on the conservative side. Based on the past few hundred miles, the test car we spent a week with averaged 3.4 miles/kWh (18.3 miles/kWh), which should allow for 220 miles (354 km) on a single charge, at least in good weather.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/the-2025-mini-countryman-se-whimsy-doesnt-make-up-for-annoying/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Framework is <a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1910137465924702695">opening</a> US preorders for its new Laptop 12 today, a couple of months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/frameworks-laptop-12-is-its-first-stab-at-a-budget-convertible-touchscreen-pc/">announcing the system</a> at an event in February. Framework's DIY edition of the laptop, which is missing RAM, an SSD, a USB-C charger, and an OS and requires some assembly, will start at $549. A fully assembled pre-built version with 8GB of RAM, a 500GB SSD, a 60 W charger, and Windows 11 Home starts at $799.</p>
<p>All preorders placed on Framework's site require a $100 deposit, and almost all configurations begin shipping in July. A first batch of systems is slated to ship in June, but this requires <a href="https://frame.work/hacktheworld">a $250 donation to Hack Club</a>; Framework says the donation will be used to buy Framework 12 laptops for high school students.</p>
<p>The Laptop 12 was built to be a more budget-friendly system, which is reflected in its specs, screen size, and its mostly plastic construction. But like the Laptop 13, the Laptop 12 prioritizes upgradeability and repairability and retains the USB-C-based Expansion Card system that was the Laptop 13's biggest innovation when it was introduced. Each Laptop 12 has four Expansion Card bays plus a headphone jack, allowing the installation of USB-C, USB-A, DisplayPort, and HDMI ports, as well as the other Expansion Cards Framework offers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/frameworks-cheaper-colorful-laptop-12-up-for-preorder-starts-at-549-bare-bones/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Job cuts at the US traffic safety regulator instigated by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency disproportionately hit staff assessing self-driving risks, hampering oversight of technology on which the world’s richest man has staked the future of Tesla.</p>
<p>Of roughly 30 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration workers dismissed in February as part of Musk’s campaign to shrink the federal workforce, many were in the “office of vehicle automation safety,” people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The cuts are part of mass firings by Doge that have affected at least 20,000 federal employees and raised widespread concern over potential conflicts of interest for Musk given many of the targeted agencies regulate or have contracts with his businesses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/car-safety-experts-at-nhtsa-which-regulates-tesla-axed-by-doge/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It took a few years, but Google's Pixel phones have risen to the top of the Android ranks, and its new Pixel 9a keeps most of what has made flagship Pixel phones so good, including the slick software and versatile cameras. Despite a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/the-pixel-9a-arrives-this-month-for-499-with-streamlined-design-and-larger-battery/">revamped design and larger battery</a>, Google has maintained the $499 price point of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pixel-8a-review-googles-budget-champion-gets-even-better/">last year's phone</a>, undercutting other "budget" devices like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/iphone-16e-review-the-most-expensive-cheap-iphone-yet/">iPhone 16e</a>.</p>
<p>However, hitting this price point involves trade-offs in materials, charging, and—significantly—the on-device AI capabilities compared to its pricier siblings. None of those are deal-breakers, though. In fact, the Pixel 9a may be coming along at just the right time. As we enter a period of uncertainty for imported gadgets, a modestly priced phone with lengthy support could be the perfect purchase.</p>
<h2>A simpler silhouette</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9a sports the same rounded corners and flat edges we've seen on other recent smartphones. The aluminum frame has a smooth, almost silky texture, with rolled edges that flow into the front and back covers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-pixel-9a-review-all-the-phone-you-need/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A family altar in the Maya city of Tikal offers a glimpse into events in an enclave of the city’s foreign overlords in the wake of a local coup.</p>
<p>Archaeologists recently unearthed the altar in a quarter of the Maya city of Tikal that had lain buried under dirt and rubble for about the last 1,500 years. The altar—and the wealthy household behind the courtyard it once adorned—stands just a few blocks from the center of Tikal, one of the most powerful cities of Maya civilization. But the altar and the courtyard around it aren’t even remotely Maya-looking; their architecture and decoration look like they belong 1,000 kilometers to the west in the city of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico.</p>
<p>The altar reveals the presence of powerful rulers from Teotihuacan who were there at a time when a coup ousted Tikal’s Maya rulers and replaced them with a Teotihuacan puppet government. It also reveals how hard those foreign rulers fell from favor when Teotihuacan’s power finally waned centuries later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/painted-altar-in-maya-city-of-tikal-reveals-the-aftermath-of-an-ancient-coup/">Read full article</a></p>
