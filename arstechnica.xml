<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As part of today’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/politics/russia-us-prisoner-swap/index.html">blockbuster prisoner swap</a> between the US and Russia, which freed the journalist Evan Gershkovich and several Russian opposition figures, Russia received in return a motley collection of serious criminals, including an assassin who had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/europe/russia-krasikov-prisoner-swap.html">executed an enemy of the Russian state in the middle of Berlin</a>.</p>
<p>But the Russians also got two hackers, Vladislav Klyushin and Roman Seleznev, each of whom had been convicted of major financial crimes in the US. The US government <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.232574/gov.uscourts.mad.232574.248.0.pdf">said</a> that Klyushin “stands convicted of the most significant hacking and trading scheme in American history, and one of the largest insider trading schemes ever prosecuted.” As for Seleznev, federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/technology/russian-hacker-sentenced.html">said</a> that he has “harmed more victims and caused more financial loss than perhaps any other defendant that has appeared before the court.”</p>
<p>What sort of hacker do you have to be to attract the interest of the Russian state in prisoner swaps like these? Clearly, it helps to have hacked widely and caused major damage to Russia’s enemies. By bringing these two men home, Russian leadership is sending a clear message to domestic hackers: We’ve got your back.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040698#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040698&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A small study in Texas suggests that human bird flu cases are being missed on dairy farms where the H5N1 virus has taken off in cows, sparking an unprecedented nationwide outbreak.</p>
<p>The finding adds some data to what many experts have suspected amid the outbreak. But the authors of the study, led by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, went further, stating bluntly why the US is failing to fully surveil, let alone contain, a virus with pandemic potential.</p>
<p>"Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few," the authors write in <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.27.24310982v1">the topline summary of their study</a>, which was posted online as a pre-print and had not been peer-reviewed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040675#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040675&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It has now been eight weeks since Boeing's Starliner spacecraft launched into orbit on an Atlas V rocket, bound for the International Space Station. At the time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-drama-filled-day-boeings-starliner-finally-finds-its-way/">NASA officials said</a> the two crew members, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, could return to Earth as soon as June 14, just eight days later.</p>
<p>Yes, there had been some problems on Starliner's ride to the space station that involved helium leaks and failing thrusters. But officials said they were relatively minor and sought to downplay them. "Those are pretty small, really, issues to deal with," Mark Nappi, vice president and manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, said during a post-docking news conference. "We’ll figure them out for the next mission. I don’t see these as significant at all."</p>
<p>But days turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months as NASA and Boeing continued to study the two technical problems. Of these issues, the more pressing concern was the failure of multiple reaction control system thrusters that are essential to steering Starliner during its departure from the space station and setting up a critical engine burn to enter Earth's atmosphere.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040615#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040615&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are more than 2,000 mostly intact dead rockets circling the Earth, but until this year, no one ever launched a satellite to go see what one looked like after many years of tumbling around the planet.</p>
<p>In February, a Japanese company named <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/before-snagging-a-chunk-of-space-junk-astroscale-must-first-catch-up-to-one/">Astroscale sent a small satellite into low-Earth orbit</a> on top of a Rocket Lab launcher. A couple of months later, Astroscale's ADRAS-J (Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan) spacecraft completed its pursuit of a Japanese rocket stuck in orbit for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>ADRAS-J photographed the upper stage of an H-IIA rocket from a range of several hundred meters and then backed away. This was the first publicly released image of space debris captured from another spacecraft using rendezvous and proximity operations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040176#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040176&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Thin LCD-LED TVs are appealing because they're easy to find space for and are aesthetically pleasing. To stay slim, most thin TVs, like Samsung's The Frame pictured above, use edge-lit backlights. But beyond the image quality limitations of these designs, new <a href="https://www.rtings.com/research/thin-lcd-tvs-break-faster-under-prolonged-use">testing from RTINGs</a> suggests that there are inherent flaws in edge-lit TV designs that hurt durability.</p>
<p>Review site RTINGs has been running extreme tests on dozens of TVs and a few monitors that are meant to simulate years of use. So far, RTINGs is up to 10,000 hours of testing, which it says is equivalent to about six years of use. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiO4b37RsIk">YouTube video</a> this week, a representative for the publication's research team said that in the past few months, testing has revealed a "clear, but troubling trend" of LCD TVs with edge-lit backlights being "inherently prone to significant durability issue." She added that edge-lit TVs "fail faster than other LCD TV designs," or those with full array local dimming (FALD) or direct-lit (or global dimming) backlights.</p>
<p>For its torture test, RTINGs tested 11 edge-lit TVs and reported that seven of them have "noticeable" uniformity issues. Of those seven, two models are from LG, and five are Samsung TVs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040611#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040611&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple reported its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/">earnings results</a> for the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, and it satisfied investors' expectations at the top level with 5 percent growth year over year. The company set a third-quarter record with $85.8 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>Despite that growth, a couple of key things investors were concerned about—overall iPhone sales and revenue in China—slipped downward, and Apple's stock fell slightly in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Revenue in China fell to $14.7 billion, down 6.3 percent from a year ago, as Apple faces fierce competition from Huawei and other smartphone companies. CEO Tim Cook said on the investor call that iPhone models are still the top sellers "in urban China."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040637#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040637&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>San Francisco's Board of Supervisors this week approved a ban on software that is allegedly used by landlords to collude on rent prices. Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin recently <a href="https://sfbos.org/sites/default/files/RELEASE_President_Aaron_Peskin_Introduces_First_In_Nation_Local_Ban_on_Rent_Price_Fixing.pdf">proposed</a> what his office called "the first local ordinance in the country banning the sale or use of software which enables price collusion among large corporate landlords for the purpose of rent-gouging."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sfgov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6789588&amp;GUID=89BA28F7-B3B8-44D0-806B-FFDC5FC29015&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">ordinance</a> was approved on a first reading by a <a href="https://sfgov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=M&amp;ID=1217785&amp;GUID=A77F6F2A-1E1C-4F90-9CA3-B5785B6783BD">10-0 vote</a> by the board on Tuesday. It still needs to pass a final vote scheduled for September 3, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-31/san-francisco-to-ban-software-amid-worry-on-gouging-in-rents">Bloomberg wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The ban targets software companies RealPage and Yardi. "RealPage has exacerbated our rent crisis and empowered corporate landlords to intentionally keep units vacant. So we're taking action locally to ensure our working renters can afford to live here," Peskin said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040600#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040600&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has joined progressive groups—including Demand Progress, Open Markets Institute, and the Tech Oversight Project—pressuring the US Department of Justice to investigate Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market due to alleged antitrust concerns, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-progressives-push-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-08-01/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/demandprogress/letters/Letter_-_Nvidia_DOJ_2024-07-30.pdf">letter</a> to the DOJ's chief antitrust enforcer, Jonathan Kanter, groups demanding more Big Tech oversight raised alarms that Nvidia's top rivals apparently "are struggling to gain traction" because "Nvidia’s near-absolute dominance of the market is difficult to counter" and "funders are wary of backing its rivals."</p>
<p>Nvidia is currently "the world’s most valuable public company," their letter said, worth more than $3 trillion after taking near-total control of the high-performance AI chip market. Particularly "astonishing," the letter said, was Nvidia's dominance in the market for GPU accelerator chips, which are at the heart of today's leading AI. Groups urged Kanter to probe Nvidia's business practices to ensure that rivals aren't permanently blocked from competing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040556#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040556&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On Wednesday, US Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Marsha Blackburn (R.-Tenn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) <a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-coons-blackburn-klobuchar-tillis-introduce-bill-to-protect-individuals-voices-and-likenesses-from-ai-generated-replicas">introduced</a> the Nurture Originals, Foster Art, and Keep Entertainment Safe (<a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/no_fakes_act_bill_text.pdf">NO FAKES</a>) Act of 2024. The bipartisan legislation, up for consideration in the US Senate, aims to protect individuals from unauthorized AI-generated replicas of their voice or likeness.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The NO FAKES Act would create legal recourse for people whose digital representations are created without consent. It would hold both individuals and companies liable for producing, hosting, or sharing these unauthorized digital replicas, including those created by generative AI. Due to generative AI technology that has become mainstream in the past two years, creating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/unauthorized-david-attenborough-ai-clone-narrates-developers-life-goes-viral/">audio</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/thanks-to-ai-its-probably-time-to-take-your-photos-off-the-internet/">image</a> media fakes of people has become fairly trivial, with easy photorealistic video replicas likely next to arrive.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Coons emphasized the importance of protecting individual rights in the age of AI. "Everyone deserves the right to own and protect their voice and likeness, no matter if you're Taylor Swift or anyone else," he said, referring to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/fake-ai-taylor-swift-images-flood-x-amid-calls-to-criminalize-deepfake-porn/">widely publicized deepfake incident</a> involving the musical artist in January. "Generative AI can be used as a tool to foster creativity, but that can't come at the expense of the unauthorized exploitation of anyone's voice or likeness."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040488#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040488&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For the first time in the decade-plus that Microsoft has been trying to make Arm-powered Windows PCs happen, we’ve finally got some pretty good ones. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/surface-pro-11-and-laptop-7-review-an-apple-silicon-moment-for-windows/">latest Surface Pro and Surface Laptop</a> (and the other Copilot+ PCs) benefit from extensive work done to Windows 11’s x86 translation layer, a wider selection of native apps, and most importantly, Snapdragon X Pro and X Elite chips from Qualcomm that are as good as or better than Intel’s or AMD’s current offerings.</p>
<p>The main problem with these computers is that they’re all on the expensive side. The cheapest Snapdragon X PC right now is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/snapdragon-dev-kit-for-windows-is-a-next-gen-mini-desktop-with-snapdragon-x-elite/"><span class="s1">probably this $899 developer kit mini-desktop</span></a>; the cheapest laptops start around the same $1,000 price as the entry-level MacBook Air.</p>
<p>That’s a problem Qualcomm hopes to correct next year. Qualcomm CEO Christiano Amon said on the <a href="https://investor.qualcomm.com/">company’s Q3 earnings call</a> (as <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2040479%26action%3Dedit&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F7%2F31%2F24210783%2Fqualcomm-promises-snapdragon-x-pcs-will-cost-as-little-as-700-next-year&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=dac7d444445830f14f94a38207c1fcb4&amp;xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D">recorded by The Verge</a>) that the company was hoping to bring Arm PC prices down to $700 at some point in 2025, noting that these cheaper PCs wouldn’t compromise the performance of the Snapdragon X series’ built-in neural processing unit (NPU).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040479#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040479&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Do you remember the Lunar Gateway? You could be forgiven if not, as the program continues to be tossed around by NASA planners, and it is still not entirely clear what purpose the lunar space station is supposed to serve.</p>
<p>The Gateway—a small space station that will fly in a halo orbit around the Moon and spend most of its time far from the lunar surface—was initially supposed to launch in 2022. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">That obviously did not happen, and now, according to <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report from the US Government Accountability Office</a>, the space agency does not expect the launch of the initial elements of the Gateway until at least December 2027.</span> The baseline cost estimate is $5.3 billion.</p>
<p>NASA's present plans contemplate using the Gateway as part of the Artemis IV mission, presently scheduled for September 2028. Unfortunately, the Gateway's current launch target is already three months later than needed to support Artemis IV, the second mission to land humans on the Moon. But that's OK. There are a lot of other moving parts for this mission, so a launch any time this decade would be a win.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040396#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040396&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A wireless charging pad is now the most-desired in-car feature among people intending to buy a new vehicle. Being able to forget about a USB cable and still not run down one's battery topped the list of 163 features that AutoPacific asked about in its annual survey on future demand. Almost 15,000 people intending to buy a new car within the next three years replied to the survey, with 44 percent ticking the box for wireless charging for the front passengers.</p>
<p>This market research data is rather illuminating; as we test new cars, they're increasingly equipped with features or gadgets that don't seem exactly necessary—an extra infotainment screen for the front seat passenger, for example, or remote parking via a smartphone app. Sometimes, the features are even mandatory—several luxury brands won't let you order certain cars without a glass moonroof.</p>
<p>These decisions are justified by product planners as responding to customer demand, so it's helpful to see one of the sources that feeds into that.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040501#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040501&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singing off-key in front of others is one way to get embarrassed. Regardless of how you get there, why does embarrassment almost inevitably come with burning cheeks that turn an obvious shade of red (which is possibly even more embarrassing)?</p>
<p>Blushing starts not in the face but in the brain, though exactly where has been debated. Previous thinking often reasoned that the blush reaction was associated with higher socio-cognitive processes, such as thinking of how one is perceived by others.</p>
<p>After studying subjects who watched videos of themselves singing karaoke, however, researchers led by Milica Nicolic of the University of Amsterdam have found that blushing is really the result of specific emotions being aroused.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040443#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040443&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nothing has a new smartphone—the Phone (2a) Plus—nearly identical to the Phone (2a) it released earlier this year, but with slightly beefed-up specs. It costs $399 and is available in the US through the same beta program. But it isn't the new Android handset we find most interesting, it's the company's new widget.</p>
<p>The “News Reporter” widget, available by default on all Nothing and CMF smartphones plus other Android and iOS devices via the Nothing X app, lets you quickly play a news bulletin summarized by artificial intelligence. It is read out by the synthesized voice of Tim Holbrow, the company's chief financial officer. (Nothing is using ElevenLabs' tech for sound synthesis and output.) As soon as you tap the widget, you're greeted by a soothing British voice:</p>
<p>"Welcome to Nothing News, where the only thing we take seriously is not taking anything seriously. I'm Tim, your CFO and reluctant news reader. Today, we're making something out of nothing, because that's literally our job.” </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040429#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040429&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Boeing announced another financial charge Wednesday for its troubled Starliner commercial crew program, bringing the company's total losses on Starliner to $1.6 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/87a08bef-13bf-4f61-98db-438eab7f8b0f.pdf">In its quarterly earnings report</a>, Boeing registered a $125 million loss on the Starliner program, blaming delays on the spacecraft's still-ongoing Crew Flight Test, the program's first mission to carry astronauts into orbit. This is not the first time Boeing has reported a financial loss on Starliner. Including the new charge announced Wednesday, Boeing has now suffered an overall loss on the program of nearly $1.6 billion since 2016.</p>
<p>These losses have generally been caused by schedule delays and additional work to solve problems on Starliner. When NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to complete development of the Starliner spacecraft a decade ago, the aerospace contractor projected the capsule would be ready to fly astronauts by the end of 2017.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040414#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040414&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Over 7 million pounds of Boar's Head brand deli meats are being recalled amid a bacterial outbreak that has killed two people. The outbreak, which began in late May, has sickened a total of 34 people across 13 states, leading to 33 hospitalizations, <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/boars-head-provisions-co--expands-recall-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due">according to the US Department of Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>On June 26, Boar's Head recalled 207,528 pounds of products, including liverwurst, beef bologna, ham, salami, and "heat and eat" bacon. On Tuesday, the Jarratt, Virginia-based company expanded the recall to include about 7 million additional pounds of meat, including <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/food_label_pdf/2024-07/Recall-023-2024-EXP-Labels.pdf">71 different products</a> sold on the Boar's Head and Old Country brand labels. The products were sold nationwide.</p>
<p>The meats may be contaminated with <em>Listeria monocytogenes, </em>a foodborne pathogen that is particularly dangerous to pregnant people, people over the age of 65, and people with compromised immune systems. Infections during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or a life-threatening infection in newborns. For others who develop invasive illness, the fatality rate is nearly 16 percent. Symptoms of listeriosis can include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions that are sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040456#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040456&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A familiar debate is once again surrounding Cloudflare, the content delivery network that provides a free service that protects websites from being taken down in denial-of-service attacks by masking their hosts: Is Cloudflare a bastion of free speech or an enabler of spam, malware delivery, harassment and the very DDoS attacks it claims to block?</p>
<p>The controversy isn't new for Cloudflare, a network operator that has often taken a hands-off approach to moderating the enormous amount of traffic flowing through its infrastructure. With Cloudflare helping deliver <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/browser-market-share-2023-q3">16 percent</a> of global Internet traffic, processing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/about-overview/">57 million</a> web requests per second, and serving anywhere from <a href="https://backlinko.com/cloudflare-users">7.6 million</a> to <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-websites-use-cloudflare/">15.7 million</a> active websites, the decision to serve just about any actor, regardless of their behavior, has been the subject of intense disagreement, with many advocates of free speech and Internet neutrality applauding it and people fighting crime and harassment online regarding it as a pariah.</p>
<h2>Content neutral or abuse enabling?</h2>
<p>Spamhaus—a nonprofit organization that provides intelligence and blocklists to stem the spread of spam, phishing, malware, and botnets—has become the latest to criticize Cloudflare. On Tuesday, the project said Cloudflare provides services for 10 percent of the domains listed in its domain block list and, to date, serves sites that are the subject of more than 1,200 unresolved complaints regarding abuse.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040424#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040424&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've used Microsoft's Skype in recent years, you've probably noticed that the user experience is less than ideal because of the pervasiveness of ads in the software. Fortunately, that's going to change in a new update coming to all platforms in the near future.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/skype-insider-release-notes-for-skype-812576201/70072f8d-3a54-4739-ad2f-dd0cdc665a6f">release notes for Skype Insider build 8.125</a>, product manager Irene Namuganyi writes, "We’re excited to announce that Skype is now ad-free! Our latest update removes all ads from Skype channels and the entire Skype platform, ensuring a smoother, decluttered, and more enjoyable user experience."</p>
<p>Whereas there were previously ads in the "today" section of the application, it will now be ad-free, showing just the relevant newsfeed content. There won't be any ads in conversation views, either.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040411#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040411&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is standing by Reddit’s decision to block companies from scraping the site without an AI agreement.</p>
<p>Last week, 404 Media noticed that search engines that weren't Google were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/non-google-search-engines-blocked-from-showing-recent-reddit-results/">no longer listing recent Reddit posts</a> in results. This was because Reddit updated its Robots Exclusion Protocol (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1doc3pt/updating_our_robotstxt_file_and_upholding_our/?share_id=LWheQDxb-1jML29ocrt4T&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">txt file</a>) to block bots from scraping the site. The file reads: "Reddit believes in an open Internet, but not the misuse of public content." Since the news broke, OpenAI announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/openai-hits-google-where-it-hurts-with-new-searchgpt-prototype/">SearchGPT</a>, which can show recent Reddit results.</p>
<p>The change came a year after Reddit began its efforts to stop free scraping, which Huffman initially framed as an attempt to stop AI companies from making money off of Reddit content for free. This endeavor also led Reddit to begin charging for API access (the high pricing led to many <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/exploring-reddits-third-party-app-environment-7-months-after-the-apicalypse/">third-party Reddit apps</a> closing).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040398#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040398&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-explicit-deep-fake-content-update/">announced</a> new measures to combat the rapidly increasing spread of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/downranking-wont-stop-googles-deepfake-porn-problem-victims-say/">AI-generated non-consensual explicit deepfakes in its search results</a>.</p>
<p>Because of "a concerning increase in generated images and videos that portray people in sexually explicit contexts, distributed on the web without their consent," Google said that it consulted with "experts and victim-survivors" to make some "significant updates" to its widely used search engine to "further protect people."</p>
<p>Specifically, Google made it easier for targets of fake explicit images—which experts have said are overwhelmingly women—to report and remove deepfakes that surface in search results. Additionally, Google took steps to downrank explicit deepfakes "to keep this type of content from appearing high up in Search results," the world's leading search engine said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040372#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040372&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
