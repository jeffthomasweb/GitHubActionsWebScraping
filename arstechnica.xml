<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpyzRNzLwAs?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Kathryn Hahn reprises her WandaVision role as Agatha Harkness in the spinoff series <em>Agatha All Along</em>. </p></div>
<p>Disney introduced the poster and first full trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_All_Along_(miniseries)"><em>Agatha All Along</em></a> during its annual D23 Expo earlier this month. And now Marvel Studios has dropped a one-minute teaser that has fans wildly speculating about the possible true identity of one character in particular, who might just be a future Young Avenger.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision"><em>WandaVision</em></a> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/the-witchs-road-might-take-everything-in-agatha-all-along-d23-trailer/">previously reported</a>, the nine-episode series, starring Kathryn Hahn, is one of the TV series in the MCU's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Five">Phase Five</a>, coming on the heels of <em>Secret Invasion, Loki </em>S2, <em>What If...?</em> S2, and <em>Echo</em>. <em>Agatha All Along</em> has been in the works since 2021, officially announced in November of that year, inspired by Hahn's breakout performance in <em>WandaVision</em> as nosy neighbor Agnes—but secretly a powerful witch named Agatha Harkness who was conspiring to steal Wanda's power. The plot twist even inspired <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8u8md-NiHM">a meta-jingle</a> that went viral. <em>WandaVision</em> ended with Wanda victorious (of course) and Agatha robbed of all her powers, trapped in her nosy neighbor persona. This new series picks up where <em>WandaVision</em> left Agatha, and apparently we can expect a <a href="https://tvline.com/news/agatha-coven-of-chaos-musical-wandavision-spinoff-kathryn-hahn-1234921751/">few more catchy tunes</a>. Per the official premise:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046636#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046636&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A judge in Ohio has issued a temporary restraining order against a security researcher who presented evidence that a recent ransomware attack on the city of Columbus scooped up reams of sensitive personal information, contradicting claims made by city officials.</p>
<p>The order, issued by a judge in Ohio's Franklin County, came after the city of Columbus fell victim to a ransomware attack on July 18 that <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/ransomware-group-claims-columbus-attack-selling-6-terabytes-of-passwords-and-more/">siphoned 6.5 terabytes</a> of the city’s data. A ransomware group known as Rhysida took credit for the attack and offered to auction off the data with a starting bid of about <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/devastating-stolen-columbus-data-leaked-by-ransomware-group-after-auction-gets-no-bids/">$1.7 million in bitcoin</a>. On August 8, after the auction failed to find a bidder, Rhysida released what it said was about 45 percent of the stolen data on the group’s dark web site, which is accessible to anyone with a TOR browser.</p>
<h2>Dark web not readily available to public—really?</h2>
<p>Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said on August 13 that a “breakthrough” in the city’s forensic investigation of the breach found that the sensitive files Rhysida obtained were either <a href="https://statescoop.com/columbus-ohio-ransomware-data-unusable/">encrypted or corrupted</a>, making them “unusable” to the thieves. Ginther went on to say the data’s lack of integrity was likely the reason the ransomware group had been unable to auction off the data.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046614#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046614&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Major technology companies, including Google, Apple, and Discord, have been enabling people to quickly sign up to harmful “undress” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dark-side-open-source-ai-image-generators/">websites</a>, which use AI to remove clothes from real photos to make victims appear to be “nude” without their consent. More than a dozen of these deepfake websites have been using login buttons from the tech companies for months.</p>
<p>A WIRED analysis found 16 of the biggest so-called undress and “nudify” websites using the sign-in infrastructure from Google, Apple, Discord, Twitter, Patreon, and Line. This approach allows people to easily create accounts on the deepfake websites—offering them a veneer of credibility—before they pay for credits and generate images.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>NASA and Boeing are proceeding with final preparations to undock the Starliner spacecraft from the International Space Station next Friday, September 6, to head for landing at White Sands Space Harbor in southern New Mexico.</p>
<p>Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were supposed to return to Earth inside Starliner, will remain behind on the space station after NASA decided last week to conclude the Boeing test flight without its crew on board. NASA officials <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/">decided it was too risky</a> to put the astronauts on Starliner after the spacecraft suffered thruster failures during its flight to the space station in early June.</p>
<p>Instead, Wilmore and Williams will come home on a SpaceX Dragon capsule no earlier than February, extending their planned stay on the space station from eight days to eight months. Flying on autopilot, the Starliner spacecraft is scheduled to depart the station at approximately 6:04 pm EDT (22:04 UTC) on September 6. The capsule will fire its engines to drop out of orbit and target a parachute-assisted landing in New Mexico at 12:03 am EDT (04:03 UTC) on September 7, NASA said in a statement Thursday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046474#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046474&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Friday NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/correction-nasas-spacex-crew-9-changes-ahead-of-september-launch/">publicly announced</a> a decision that has roiled the top levels of the agency's human spaceflight program for several weeks. The space agency named the two crew members who will launch on a Crew Dragon mission set to lift off no earlier than September 24 to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>NASA astronaut Nick Hague will serve as the mission's commander, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will serve as mission specialist. Instead of a usual complement of four astronauts, a two-person crew was necessitated by the need to use the Crew 9 spacecraft, <em>Freedom</em>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/">as a rescue vehicle for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams</a>. They flew to the station in June aboard Boeing's Starliner vehicle, which has been deemed unsafe for them to return in.</p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams will join the Crew-9 increment on board the space station and fly back to Earth with Hague and Gorbunov next February.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046482#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046482&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After Stanford Internet Observatory researcher David Thiel found links to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/child-sex-abuse-images-found-in-dataset-training-image-generators-report-says/">child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) in an AI training dataset</a> tainting image generators, the controversial dataset was immediately taken down in 2023.</p>
<p>Now, the LAION (Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network) team has <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/relaion-5b/">released</a> a scrubbed version of the LAION-5B dataset called Re-LAION-5B and claimed that it "is the first web-scale, text-link to images pair dataset to be thoroughly cleaned of known links to suspected CSAM."</p>
<p>To scrub the dataset, LAION partnered with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) and the Canadian Center for Child Protection (C3P) to remove 2,236 links that matched with hashed images in the online safety organizations' databases. Removals include all the links flagged by Thiel, as well as content flagged by LAION's partners and other watchdogs, like Human Rights Watch, which warned of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/ai-trained-on-photos-from-kids-entire-childhood-without-their-consent/">privacy issues after finding photos of real kids included in the dataset</a> without their consent.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046573#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046573&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Few '90s tech sites other than Ars Technica are still operating here in 2024, and today, there's one fewer. AnandTech, a staple of CPU and GPU news and reviews since 1997, will stop publishing today, according to <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell">an announcement</a> from Editor-in-Chief Ryan Smith.</p>
<p>"For better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey—one that started with a <a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/42/amd-k6-review" data-hl-processed="none" data-custom-tracking-id="1166026689481089218" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-label="review of an AMD processor">review of an AMD processor</a>, and has ended with the <a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21524/the-amd-ryzen-9-9950x-and-ryzen-9-9900x-review" data-hl-processed="none" data-custom-tracking-id="7401013995211056289" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-label="review of an AMD processor">review of an AMD processor</a>," wrote Smith, referring to reviews of AMD's K6 and Ryzen 9000-series chips, respectively. "It’s fittingly poetic, but it is also a testament to the fact that we’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love, covering the chips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry."</p>
<p>The site's current owner, Future PLC, will keep the AnandTech archives online "indefinitely" and will continue to manage the site's forums, Smith wrote. Several AnandTech staffers will continue to publish articles at <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/">Tom’s Hardware</a>, another '90s vintage technology site that continues to publish today (AnandTech and Tom’s have both been owned by the same company since 2014, though they retained separate sites and branding).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046409#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046409&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, OpenAI said that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> has attracted over 200 million weekly active users, according to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/29/openai-chatgpt-200-million-weekly-active-users">report</a> from Axios, doubling the AI assistant's user base since November 2023. The company also revealed that 92 percent of Fortune 500 companies are now using its products, highlighting the growing adoption of generative AI tools in the corporate world.</p>

<p>The rapid growth in user numbers for ChatGPT (which is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/">not a new phenomenon</a> for OpenAI) suggests growing interest in—and perhaps reliance on— the AI-powered tool, despite frequent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gary-marcus.html">skepticism</a> from some critics of the tech industry.</p>
<p>"Generative AI is a product with no mass-market utility—at least on the scale of truly revolutionary movements like the original cloud computing and smartphone booms," PR consultant and vocal OpenAI critic Ed Zitron <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/to-serve-altman/">blogged</a> in July.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A federal judge in Texas yesterday ruled that Elon Musk's X Corp. can continue its lawsuit against Media Matters for America. US District Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas, who recently refused to recuse himself from the case despite having purchased Tesla stock, denied Media Matters' motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>X Corp. sued Media Matters after the nonprofit watchdog group published <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle">research</a> on ads being placed next to pro-Nazi content on X, formerly Twitter. X's lawsuit also names reporter Eric Hananoki and Media Matters President Angelo Carusone as defendants.</p>
<p>Because of O'Connor's ruling, X can move ahead with its claims of tortious interference with contract, business disparagement, and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. A jury trial is scheduled to begin on April 7, 2025.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046511#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046511&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Once-great social media and blogging platform Tumblr has gone through a number of big changes in recent years, and another one is right around the corner. Parent company Automattic says it is migrating all Tumblr blogs—more than half a billion in number—to the WordPress back end.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://automattic.com/2024/08/27/shipping-tumblr-and-wordpress/">blog post</a> announcing the initiative this week, Automattic is careful to note that it doesn't want anything about the front-end user experience of Tumblr to change. We love Tumblr’s streamlined posting experience and its current product direction. We’re not changing that," a rep wrote.</p>
<p>In terms of user experience, the two blogging platforms have very different emphases. WordPress is meant to be powerful, customizable, and extensible to serve a variety of needs, while Tumblr is meant to streamline the experience to be something like a middle ground between operating a WordPress blog and using something like X or Threads.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046479#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046479&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Federal inspections found 69 violations—many grisly—at the Boar's Head meat facility at the center of a deadly, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/five-more-dead-in-record-breaking-outbreak-linked-to-boars-head-meats/">nationwide <em>Listeria </em>outbreak</a> that has now killed nine people, sickened and hospitalized a total of 57 across 18 states, and spurred the nationwide recall of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/">more than 7 million pounds of meat</a>.</p>
<p>The Jarratt, Virginia-based facility had repeated problems with mold, water leaks, dirty equipment and rooms, meat debris stuck on walls and equipment, various bugs, and, at one point, puddles of blood on the floor, according to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/763954974/USDA-FOIA-records-requested-by-Alexander-Tin">inspection reports</a> from the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bugs-mold-mildew-inspection-boars-head-plant-listeria/">The reports were obtained by CBS News</a> through a Freedom of Information Act Request. In all, the reports outline 69 violations just between the dates of August 1, 2023, and August 2, 2024.</p>
<p>The findings in the reports reveal the perfect conditions for the company's meat to become contaminated with the germ behind the deadly outbreak, <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>. This is a hardy germ that is ubiquitous in the environment, including in soil and water, and it spreads among people via the fecal-oral route. In healthy people, it usually only causes gastrointestinal infections. But for older people, newborns, and the immunocompromised, it can cause a life-threatening invasive infection with a fatality rate of around 17 percent. It's also a significant danger to pregnant people, causing miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, and life-threatening infections in newborns.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046499#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046499&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The previously announced generative AI version of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant “will be powered primarily by Anthropic's Claude artificial intelligence models," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/amazon-turns-anthropics-claude-alexa-ai-revamp-2024-08-30/">Reuters</a> reported today. This comes after challenges with using proprietary models, according to the publication, which cited five anonymous people “with direct knowledge of the Alexa strategy.”</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazons-generative-ai-powered-alexa-is-as-big-a-privacy-red-flag-as-old-alexa/">demoed</a> a generative AI version of Alexa in September 2023 and touted it as being more advanced, conversational, and capable, including the ability to do multiple smart home tasks with simpler commands. Gen AI Alexa is expected to come with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-wants-to-charge-a-subscription-fee-for-alexa-eventually/">subscription fee</a>, as Alexa has reportedly lost Amazon tens of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/">billions of dollars</a> throughout <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/">the years</a>. Earlier reports said the updated voice assistant would arrive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/alexa-is-in-trouble-paid-for-alexa-gives-inaccurate-answers-in-early-demos/">in June</a>, but Amazon still hasn’t confirmed an official release date.</p>
<p>Now, Reuters is reporting that Amazon will no longer use its own large language models as the new Alexa's primary driver. Early versions of gen AI Alexa based on Amazon’s AI models “struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply,” Reuters said, citing one of its sources. Without specifying versions or features used, Reuters' sources said <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">Claude</a> outperformed proprietary software.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046432#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046432&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/03/game-review-peggle-pc/"><em>Peggle</em></a>? If you were lucky enough to play this deceptively deep <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2065.html">pachinko</a>-meets-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagatelle">bagatelle</a> game in the late '00s, you know how addictive and entrancing it could be to just watch a bouncing ball ricochet off brightly colored pegs.</p>
<p>While developer Popcap <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/03/peggle-has-been-quite-the/">released</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/xbox-one-game-extravaganza-hands-on-with-10-launch-exclusives/2/">few sequels</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/09/peggle-nights-is-here-look-upon-your-productivity-and-despair/">spinoffs</a> in the years after <em>Peggle</em>'s 2007 release, the series has largely languished since <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/us-electronicarts-idUSTRE76B7FK20110713/">Popcap's acquisition by EA in 2011</a>. Today, the only actively supported version of the game is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peggle-blast/id853834250"><em>Peggle Blast</em></a>, a smartphone port that dumbs down the gameplay with frequent pushes to spend real money on needed items, à la <em>Candy Crush</em> and its ilk.</p>

<p>The Jaguar I-Pace deserves more credit. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/forget-about-that-tesla-the-jaguar-i-pace-is-the-most-compelling-ev-yet/">When it debuted in 2018</a>, it was one of only two electric vehicles on sale that could offer Tesla-rivaling range. The other was the much more plebeian Chevrolet Bolt, which was cheaper but nowhere near as luxurious, nor as enjoyable to drive. Now, some I-Pace and Bolt owners have something else in common, as Jaguar issues a recall for some model-year 2019 I-Paces due to a fire risk, probably caused by badly folded battery anode tabs.</p>
<p>The problem doesn't affect all I-Paces, just those built between January 9, 2018, and March 14, 2019—2,760 cars in total in the US. To date, three fires have been reported following software updates, which <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V633-9392.PDF">Jaguar's recall report</a> says does not provide "an appropriate level of protection for the 2019MY vehicles in the US."</p>
<p>Although Jaguar's investigation is still ongoing, it says that its battery supplier (LG Energy Solutions) is inspecting some battery modules that were identified by diagnostic software as "having characteristics of a folded anode tab." In 2021, problems with LG batteries—in this case, folded separators and torn anode tabs—resulted in Chevrolet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/gm-recalls-every-chevy-bolt-ever-made-blames-lg-for-faulty-batteries/">recalling every Bolt on the road</a> and replacing their batteries under warranty at a cost of more than $1.8 billion.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046383#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046383&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/3/">first ROG Ally from Asus</a>, a $700 Windows-based handheld gaming PC, performed better than the Steam Deck, but it did so through notable compromises on battery life. The hardware also had a first-gen feel and software jank from both Asus’ own wraparound gaming app and Windows itself. The Ally asked an awkward question: “Do you want to pay nearly 50 percent more than you'd pay for a Steam Deck for a slightly faster but far more awkward handheld?”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-x-2024/">ROG Ally X</a> makes that question more interesting and less obvious to answer. Yes, it’s still a handheld that’s trying to hide Windows annoyances, and it's still missing trackpads, without which some PC games just feel bad. And (review spoiler) it still eats a charge faster than the Steam Deck OLED on less demanding games.</p>
<p>But the improvements Asus made to this X sequel are notable, and its new performance stats make it more viable for those who want to play more demanding games on a rather crisp screen. At $800, or $100 more than the original ROG Ally with no extras thrown in, you have to really, <em>really</em> want the best possible handheld gaming experience while still tolerating Windows' awkward fit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045977#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045977&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.09 of the Rocket Report! When will SpaceX launch the next test flight of Starship? It certainly doesn't look to be imminent, with SpaceX ground teams in Texas feverishly working to beef up the launch pad in preparation for an attempt to catch the rocket's massive Super Heavy booster when it returns to the launch site on the next flight. Meanwhile, the FAA is reviewing SpaceX's proposal to recover the booster on land for the first time. And on Thursday, a NASA official monitoring SpaceX's Starship effort said the next test flight was scheduled for launch in the "fall," suggesting it could be a month or more away. Also, we've listed the next three launches as "TBD" (To Be Determined) because SpaceX is waiting for FAA approval to resume Falcon 9 launches following a booster landing failure this week, and the Polaris Dawn mission is on hold due to an unfavorable weather forecast.</p>

<p>To say "I’m not a morning person" would be an understatement. Not only is it hard for me to be useful in the first hour (or so) of being awake, but it’s hard for me to wake up. I mean, <em>really hard.</em></p>
<p>I’ve tried various recommendations and tricks: I've set multiple alarms and had coffee ready and waiting, and I've put my alarm clock far from my bed and kept my blinds open so the sun could wake me. But I’m still prone to sleeping through my alarm or hitting snooze until the last minute.</p>
<p>The Hatch Restore 2, a smart alarm clock with lighting that mimics sunrises and sunsets, seemed like a technologically savvy approach to realizing my dreams of becoming a morning person.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046183#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046183&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When Raspberry Pi introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/new-2gb-raspberry-pi-5-option-knocks-the-price-down-to-50/">a new 2GB version of the Raspberry Pi 5 board</a> earlier this month, CEO Eben Upton said that the board would come with a slightly updated version of the board's Broadcom BCM2712C1 SoC. By removing chip functionality that the Pi 5 didn't use, the new D0 stepping of the chip would use less silicon, reducing its cost.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi enthusiast and YouTuber Jeff Geerling has <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/new-2gb-pi-5-has-33-smaller-die-30-idle-power-savings">performed some firsthand testing</a> of the 2GB Pi 5. As Upton said, the new board is functionally identical to the older 4GB and 8GB boards, with identical performance (as long as whatever workload you're running doesn't benefit from extra RAM, anyway). The new silicon die is also <a href="https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1828177919765532758">about 33 percent smaller</a> than the old one, which Geerling verified by <a href="https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1828177615640739901">removing the SoC's heat spreader</a> to expose the silicon underneath and measuring by hand.</p>
<p>Geerling also demonstrated that the 2GB Pi 5 comes with a couple of unexpected benefits that Upton didn't mention in his announcement—that the 2GB Pi 5 runs a little cooler and uses a little less power than the 4GB and 8GB editions. The 2GB Pi used just 2.4 W of power at idle and 8.9 W during a CPU stress test, compared to 3.3 W and 9.8 W in the 4GB version. The SoC of the 2GB Pi measured 30° Celsius at idle and 59° under load, compared to 32° and 63° for the 4GB version. Those are all small but significant differences, given that nothing has changed other than the SoC.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046291#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046291&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The head of US Space Command said Wednesday he would like to see more transparency from the Chinese government on space debris, especially as one of China's newer rockets has shown a propensity for breaking apart and littering low-Earth orbit with hundreds of pieces of space junk.</p>
<p>Gen. Stephen Whiting, commander of US Space Command, said he has observed some improvement in the dialogue between US and Chinese military officials this year. But the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/us-military-tracks-more-than-300-pieces-of-debris-from-chinese-launch/">disintegration of the upper stage from a Long March 6A rocket</a> earlier this month showed China could do more to prevent the creation of space debris and communicate openly about it when it happens.</p>
<p>The Chinese government acknowledged the breakup of the Long March 6A rocket's upper stage in a statement by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 14, more than a week after the rocket's launch August 6 with the first batch of 18 Internet satellites for a megaconstellation of thousands of spacecraft analogous to SpaceX's Starlink network.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046107#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046107&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Now, <a href="https://github.com/dragoonDorise">one of the coders</a> behind that software suite is dipping their toes into branded gaming hardware with <a href="https://x.com/EmuDeck/status/1829172047559397518">the EmuDeck Machines project</a>, now seeking <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/emudeck-machines-retro-emulation-console-pc#/">funding on IndieGogo</a>.</p>
<p>The EmuDeck Machines obviously come with EmuDeck software preinstalled to let users easily "play your retro games from your couch." But they also promise to let you run games from Steam and other popular PC launchers through the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Linux-based, gaming-focused Bazzite OS</a>. The vibe is definitely similar to that of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">Valve's own aborted Steam Machines effort</a> from years back, albeit in a less "official" capacity.</p>
<p>"I used to be a PC guy but in the last 20 years I switched to the Mac and in the Apple ecosystem choosing a computer is easy," project lead DragoonDorise told Ars in an email. "But then I found myself wanting a gaming rig so I started my search and boy oh boy I was lost. The PC industry seems to be trying to trick you every step of the way, gazillions of options, hard to understand what's good and what's not. If you are tech savvy it's not hard, you know what to get and what to avoid. Then it hit me, I made emulation easy with EmuDeck, why not make hardware easy too?"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046260#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046260&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
