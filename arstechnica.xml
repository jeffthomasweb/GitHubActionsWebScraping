                            <![CDATA[<p>For the last month, NASA's interim administrator, Sean Duffy, has been giving interviews and speeches around the world, offering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/nasas-acting-chief-angry-about-talk-that-china-will-beat-us-back-to-the-moon/">a singular message</a>: "We are going to beat the Chinese to the Moon."</p>
<p>This is certainly what the president who appointed Duffy to the NASA post wants to hear. Unfortunately, there is a very good chance that Duffy's sentiment is false. Privately, many people within the space industry, and even at NASA, acknowledge that the US space agency appears to be holding a losing hand. Recently, some influential voices, such as former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, have spoken out.</p>
<p>"Unless something changes, it is highly unlikely the United States will beat China’s projected timeline to the Moon’s surface," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/ted-cruz-criticizes-trump-plan-to-cancel-sls-and-lunar-gateway-as-folly/#gsc.tab=0">Bridenstine said</a> in early September.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/how-america-fell-behind-china-in-the-lunar-space-race-and-how-it-can-catch-back-up/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The company said it is building the Arc spacecraft to provide a capability to the US military to deliver as much as 500 pounds (225 kg) of supplies almost anywhere in the world, almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>"The nominal mission for us is pre-positioning Arcs on orbit, and having them stay up there for up to five years, able to be called upon and then autonomously go and land wherever and whenever they're needed, being able to bring their cargo or effects to the desired location in under an hour," said Justin Fiaschetti, co-founder and chief executive of Inversion, in an interview with Ars before the event.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/meet-the-arc-spacecraft-it-aims-to-deliver-cargo-anywhere-in-the-world-in-an-hour/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Scammers have been abusing unsecured cellular routers used in industrial settings to blast SMS-based phishing messages in campaigns that have been ongoing since 2023, researchers said.</p>
<p>The routers, manufactured by China-based Milesight IoT Co., Ltd., are rugged Internet of Things devices that use cellular networks to connect traffic lights, electric power meters, and other sorts of remote industrial devices to central hubs. They come equipped with SIM cards that work with 3G/4G/5G cellular networks and can be controlled by text message, Python scripts, and web interfaces.</p>
<h2>An unsophisticated, yet effective, delivery vector</h2>
<p>Security company Sekoia on Tuesday <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/silent-smishing-the-hidden-abuse-of-cellular-router-apis/">said</a> that an analysis of “suspicious network traces” detected in its honeypots led to the discovery of a cellular router being abused to send SMS messages with phishing URLs. As company researchers investigated further, they identified more than 18,000 such routers accessible on the Internet, with at least 572 of them allowing free access to programming interfaces to anyone who took the time to look for them. The vast majority of the routers were running firmware versions that were more than three years out of date and had known vulnerabilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/that-annoying-sms-phish-you-just-got-may-have-come-from-a-box-like-this/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna may be people’s fault after all, according to a recent study.</p>
<p>A team of archaeologists recently examined animal bones at sites dating to the waning years of the last Ice Age. Their results suggest that extinct megafauna like giant sloths, giant armadillos, and elephant-like creatures were on the menu for Pleistocene hunters in South America. And that means human hunters may have played a nontrivial role in killing off the continent’s last great Ice Age megafauna.</p>
<h2>Giant ground sloth: It’s what’s for dinner</h2>
<p>Archaeologist Luciano Prates of Mexico's National University of La Plata and his colleagues counted the animal bones left behind by ancient people at 20 archaeological sites in modern-day Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. They compared the number of bones from extinct megafauna (technically, “megafauna” describes any animal over 44 kilograms) to the number of bones from smaller prey. They also tallied the remains of still-living species of megafauna like vicuñas. The archaeologists hoped to learn whether giant sloths, giant armadillos, and now-extinct species of horses were staples in the diets of Ice Age South Americans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/ice-age-hunters-in-south-america-preferred-now-extinct-megafauna/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The lawsuit was filed in August after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/apple-gets-yanked-into-elon-musks-chatbot-war-with-openai/">Musk raged on X</a> about Apple never listing Grok on its editorially curated "Must Have" apps list, which ChatGPT frequently appeared on.</p>
<p>According to Musk, Apple linking ChatGPT to Siri and other native iPhone features gave OpenAI exclusive access to billions of prompts that only OpenAI can use as valuable training data to maintain its dominance in the chatbot market. However, OpenAI and Apple are now mocking Musk's math in court filings, urging the court to agree that xAI's lawsuit is doomed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/openai-mocks-musks-math-in-suit-over-iphone-chatgpt-integration/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/its-october-1-so-the-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-is-dead-now/">we wrote about</a> how Ford, General Motors, and Tesla have reacted to the end of the clean vehicle tax credits. Now we know what Hyundai is doing, and the answer is "giving the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better/">Ioniq 5</a> a huge price cut."</p>
<p>The cheapest Ioniq 5 is still the SE RWD. A model-year 2025 SE RWD cost $42,600; for model-year 2026 it's now $35,000. The price cuts for other versions are even greater—between $9,150 and $9,800. For example, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/our-favorite-ev-goes-mad-max-the-2025-ioniq-5-xrt/">Ioniq 5 XRT</a> that you see in the photo above had a starting price of $55,500 for MY25; now it starts at a very reasonable $46,275.</p>
<p>"Hyundai is taking bold steps to ensure our award-winning Ioniq 5 remains a top choice for EV buyers," said Randy Parker, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor North America. "This pricing realignment reflects our commitment to delivering exceptional technology and innovation without compromise."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/hyundai-gives-the-ioniq-5-a-huge-price-cut-for-model-year-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Streaming is overtaking broadcast, cable, and satellite. But amid all the cord cutting lies a much smaller, yet intriguing, practice: going <em>back to cable</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2120271&amp;action=edit">Cord reviving</a> is when cord cutters, or people who previously abandoned traditional TV services in favor of streaming, decide to go back to traditional pay-TV services, like cable.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that this happens far less frequently than cord cutting. But TiVo's Q2 2025 Video Trends Report: North America <a href="https://go2.tivo.com/Video_Trends_Report_Q2_2025_NAM">released today</a> points to growth in cord reviving.

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">announced</a> Sora 2, its second-generation video-synthesis AI model that can now generate videos in various styles with synchronized dialogue and sound effects, which is a first for the company. OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls "cameos."</p>
<p>OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.</p>
<p>Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls "sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism." In May, Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">Veo 3</a> became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released <a href="https://wan25.net/">Wan 2.5</a>, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openais-sora-2-lets-users-insert-themselves-into-ai-videos-with-sound/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission yesterday voted to end funding for two programs designed to help schoolchildren and library patrons access the Internet.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claims that Biden-era orders to establish the programs exceeded the FCC's authority. The FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reverses-unlawful-expansion-covid-era-wi-fi-hotspots-program-0">voted</a> 2-1 to <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-end-unlawful-inclusion-school-bus-wi-fi-through-e-rate-0">kill the programs</a>, with Republican Olivia Trusty voting with Carr and Democrat Anna Gomez dissenting.</p>
<p>In the previous administration, the FCC expanded the Universal Service Fund's E-Rate program in 2024 to let schools and libraries lend out Wi-Fi hotspots and services that could be used off-premises. The FCC separately decided in 2023 to let the E-Rate program pay for Wi-Fi service on school buses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/fcc-chairman-leads-cruel-vote-to-take-wi-fi-access-away-from-school-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months, many AI boosters have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/new-ai-model-turns-photos-into-explorable-3d-worlds-with-caveats/">increasingly interested</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/microsofts-new-interactive-ai-world-model-still-has-a-long-way-to-go/">generative video models</a> and their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-model-can-hallucinate-a-game-of-1993s-doom-in-real-time/">seeming ability</a> to show at least <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">limited emergent knowledge</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/new-physics-sim-trains-robots-430000-times-faster-than-reality/">the physical properties of the real world</a>. That kind of learning could underpin a robust version of a so-called "world model" that would represent a major breakthrough in generative AI's actual operant real-world capabilities.</p>
<p>Recently, Google's DeepMind Research tried to add some scientific rigor to how well video models can actually learn about the real world from their training data. In the bluntly titled paper <a href="https://video-zero-shot.github.io/">"Video Models are Zero-shot Learners and Reasoners,"</a> the researchers used <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">Google's Veo 3 model</a> to generate thousands of videos designed to test its abilities across dozens of tasks related to perceiving, modeling, manipulating, and reasoning about the real world.</p>
<figure class="video ars-wp-video">
  <div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative" style="aspect-ratio: 1.7777777777778;">
    <video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" id="video-2120175-3" width="1280" height="720" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/robot_throw_and_catch.mp4?_=3"></source></video>
  </div>

  <figcaption>
    <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span>
      </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the paper, the researchers boldly claim that Veo 3 "can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for" (that's the "zero-shot" part of the title) and that video models "are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models." But digging into the actual results of those experiments, the researchers seem to be grading today's video models on a bit of a curve and assuming future progress will smooth out many of today's highly inconsistent results.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/can-todays-ai-video-models-accurately-model-how-the-real-world-works/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aulMPhE12g?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Netflix has released the full official trailer for director Guillermo del Toro's hotly anticipated new film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein_(2025_film)"><em>Frankenstein</em></a>, starring Oscar Isaac as the brilliant but tragically flawed mad scientist, Victor Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Del Toro has been telling interviewers for years about his enduring love for Mary Shelley's novel and his long-standing desire to direct a film that would capture the novel's sense of grand Miltonian tragedy. He loved the original script for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 adaptation, <em>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, </em>but the final film, alas, deviated sharply from that script and was just not that good. After several false starts, del Toro finally signed on to film his vision for Netflix in 2023. He <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/guillermo-del-toro-frankenstein-netflix-theatrical-1236501951/">called this film</a> “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” at the Netflix Tudum event earlier this year, adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. There are strands of <em>Frankenstein </em>through my films.”</p>
<p>"It was a religion for me," <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/guillermo-del-toro-frankenstein-netflix-theatrical-1236501951/">del Toro said</a> during a press conference at the film's world premiere in Venice last month. "Since I was a kid—I was raised very Catholic—I never quite understood the saints. And then when I saw Boris Karloff on the screen, I understood what a saint or a messiah looked like. So I've been following the creature since I was a kid, and I always waited for the movie to be done in the right conditions, both creatively in terms of achieving the scope that it needed for me to make it different, to make it at a scale that you could reconstruct the whole world."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/trailer-for-del-toros-frankenstein-is-pure-macabre-mythology/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Taiwan has no plans to move half its chip production into the US, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun confirmed, quickly pushing back on seemingly false claims that the US had raised the condition during recent trade talks.</p>
<p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/taiwan-pressured-to-move-50-of-chip-production-to-us-or-lose-protection/">suggested</a> that Taiwan was currently mulling moving half its semiconductor supply chain to the US in exchange for "some kind of security guarantee," as Taiwan faces the ongoing threat of a potential Chinese invasion. Trump has maintained since taking office that reshoring of semiconductor supply chains is critical for economic and national security, and Lutnick indicated that Taiwan should agree to the unusual terms because it needs the US for protection.</p>
<p>But speaking Wednesday, Cheng said that while "certain progress" has been made in trade talks, Taiwan has not only made "no such commitment" but that "this issue was not discussed in this round of negotiation, and we will not agree to such a condition," Bloomberg <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/taiwan-pressured-to-move-50-of-chip-production-to-us-or-lose-protection/">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/taiwan-says-trump-cant-pressure-it-into-giving-up-half-its-chip-supply/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The UK Home Office demanded in early September that Apple create a means to allow officials access to encrypted cloud backups, but stipulated that the order applied only to British citizens’ data, according to people briefed on the matter.</p>
<p>A previous technical capability notice (TCN) issued in January sought global access to encrypted user data. That move sparked a diplomatic clash between the UK and US governments and threatened to derail the two nations’ efforts to secure a trade agreement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/uk-once-again-demands-backdoor-to-apples-encrypted-cloud-storage/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Sadly, this was not a surprise. During last year's election, the Trump campaign made no secret of its disgust toward clean vehicles (and clean energy in general), and it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/trump-team-puts-ev-tax-credit-on-the-block-tesla-is-on-board-report/">promised to end subsidies</a> meant to encourage Americans to switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Like anybody, I have a few controversial gaming opinions and tastes. One of the most controversial is that<em> Fallout 76</em> —the multiplayer take on Bethesda's rethink of a beloved '90s open-world computer roleplaying game—has been my <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/theres-never-been-a-better-time-to-get-into-fallout-76/">favorite online multiplayer game since its launch</a>.</p>
<p>As much as I like the game, though, I've been surprised that it has actually grown over the past seven years. I'm not saying it's seen a full, <em>No Man's Sky</em>-like redemption story, though. It's still not for everyone, and in some ways, it has fallen behind the times since 2018.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the success of the streaming TV show based on the game franchise has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">attracted new players</a> and given the developers a chance to seize the moment and attempt to complete a partial redemption story. To help make that happen, the game's developers will soon release an expansion fully capitalizing on that TV series for the first time, and I got to spend a few hours playing that update to see if it's any fun.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/hands-on-with-fallout-76s-next-expansion-yep-it-has-walton-goggins/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's products and services have been flooded with AI features over the past couple of years, but smart home has been largely spared until now. The company's plans to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/end-of-life-gemini-will-completely-replace-google-assistant-later-this-year/">replace Assistant</a> are moving forward with a big Google Home reset. We've been told over and over that generative AI will do incredible things when given enough data, and here's the test.</p>
<p>There's a new Home app with Gemini intelligence throughout the experience, updated subscriptions, and even some new hardware. The revamped Home app will allegedly gain deeper insights into what happens in your home, unlocking advanced video features and conversational commands. It demos well, but will it make smart home tech less or more frustrating?</p>
<h2>A new Home</h2>
<p>You may have already seen some elements of the revamped Home experience percolating to the surface, but that process begins in earnest today. The new app apparently boosts speed and reliability considerably, with camera feeds loading 70 percent faster and with 80 percent fewer app crashes. The app will also bring new Gemini features, some of which are free. Google's new Home subscription retains the same price as the old Nest subs, but naturally, there's a lot more AI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/googles-gemini-powered-smart-home-revamp-is-here-with-a-new-app-and-cameras/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AI poses an obvious danger to the millennia-long human fight to find the truth. Large language model "hallucinations," vocal deepfakes, and now increased use of video deepfakes have all had a blurring effect on facts, letting bad actors around the globe brush off even recorded events as mere "fake news."</p>
<p>The danger is perhaps most acute in the political realm, where deepfake audio and video can make any politician say or appear to do anything. In such a climate, our most senior elected officials have a special duty to model truth-seeking behavior and responsible AI use.</p>
<p>But what's the fun in that, when you can just blow up negotiations over a budget impasse by posting a deepfake video of your political opponents calling themselves "a bunch of woke pieces of shit" while mariachi music plays in the background? Oh—and did I mention the fake mustache? Or the CGI sombrero?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/ai-leadership-trump-posts-deepfakes-of-dems-calling-themselves-woke-pieces-of-s-t/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Without explanation, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under the Trump administration has reverted from using the disease name "mpox" to the obsolete "monkeypox," which the world abandoned in 2022 because it was seen as racist and stigmatizing.</p>
<p>Mpox is the name of the disease caused by <em><a href="https://ictv.global/taxonomy/taxondetails?taxnode_id=202404771&amp;taxon_name=Orthopoxvirus%20monkeypox#release_40">Orthopoxvirus monkeypox</a></em>, a relative of smallpox and cowpox that has exploded to global prominence in recent years.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amazon’s voice assistant is hanging on by a thread. And that thread is generative AI—or, in Amazon’s case, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/">Alexa+</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon hasn’t had a problem getting people to buy cheap, Alexa-powered gadgets. However, the Alexa in millions of homes today doesn’t make Amazon money. It’s largely used for simple tasks unrelated to commerce, like setting timers and checking the weather. As a result, Amazon’s Devices business has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/">reportedly been siphoning money</a>, and the clock is ticking for Alexa to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/">prove its worth.</a></p>
<p>Alexa+, a subscription-based generative AI service ($20 per month or included with Prime, which starts at $15/month), is supposed to solve Amazon's woes with Alexa. More conversational and powerful than the original Alexa, Alexa+ is designed to play a more central role in user transactions, enabling, in theory, Amazon to finally make money from voice assistants after 11 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/alexas-survival-hinges-on-you-buying-more-expensive-amazon-devices/">Read full article</a></p>
