                            <![CDATA[<p>As of today, the US is no longer a member of the World Health Organization—and it leaves the United Nations health agency with hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/21/trump-withdrawal-world-health-organization-leaves-unpaid-bills-behind/">reporting by Stat News</a>.</p>
<p>A year ago today, the US <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-orders-us-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/">informed the WHO</a> of its intent to exit, setting the clock for a one-year withdrawal period mandated in a 1948 joint resolution of Congress. But, in practice, the withdrawal was immediate, with the Trump administration cutting all ties with WHO upon the announcement. In explaining his reasoning for leaving the WHO, Trump referenced his long-standing complaints about the agency’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, dues payments, and alleged protection of China. Trump had attempted extract the US from WHO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/trump-officially-takes-us-out-of-who-but-withdrawal-is-a-year-long-process/">during his first term</a>, but the Biden administration rescinded the withdrawal on the first day in office, well before the one-year notice period was reached.</p>
<p>The joint resolution also stipulated that the US would have to pay its financial obligations in full before departing. But, that too has not been honored by the Trump administration. According to Stat, the US owed the WHO $278 million in dues, which are a percentage of each member state’s gross domestic product. That dues payment covered the country's 2024–2025 membership, as WHO runs on a two-year budget cycle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/us-stiffs-who-hundreds-of-millions-as-it-officially-withdrawals/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The project developer for one of the Internet’s most popular networking tools is scrapping its vulnerability reward program after being overrun by a spike in the submission of low-quality reports, much of it AI-generated slop.</p>
<p>“We are just a small single open source project with a small number of active maintainers,” Daniel Stenberg, the founder and lead developer of the open source app cURL, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/20312">said Thursday</a>. “It is not in our power to change how all these people and their slop machines work. We need to make moves to ensure our survival and intact mental health.”</p>
<h2>Manufacturing bogus bugs</h2>
<p>His comments came as cURL users complained that the move was treating the symptoms caused by AI slop without addressing the cause. The users said they were concerned the move would eliminate a key means for ensuring and maintaining the security of the tool. Stenberg largely agreed, but indicated his team had little choice.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/overrun-with-ai-slop-curl-scraps-bug-bounties-to-ensure-intact-mental-health/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“Ten years ago, I decided that I would hack the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” Lichtenstein wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-hacked-bitcoin-exchange-10-billion-heres-what-ilya-lichtenstein-vgyje/?trackingId=5Wh8%2BdnTSgmxW9eS5XSP4w%3D%3D">LinkedIn</a>, detailing a time when his startup was barely making money and he decided to steal some instead.</p>
<p>“This was a terrible idea. It was the worst thing I had ever done,” he added. “It upended my life, the lives of people close to me, and affected thousands of users of the exchange. I know I disappointed a lot of people who believed in me and grossly misused my talents.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/hacker-who-stole-120000-bitcoins-wants-a-second-chance-and-a-security-job/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin">with tech publication The Information.</a></p>
<p>The product is said to be "the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker," and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple's solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.</p>
<p>The Information's sources don't specify whether that's the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/01/report-apple-plans-to-launch-ai-powered-wearable-pin-device-as-soon-as-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that students worldwide use AI chatbots to do their homework and avoid learning things. On the flip side, students can also use AI as a tool to beef up their knowledge and plan for the future with flashcards or study guides. Google hopes its latest Gemini feature will help with the latter. The company has <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/education/practice-sat-gemini/">announced</a> that Gemini can now create free SAT practice tests and coach students to help them get higher scores.</p>
<p>As a standardized test, the content of the SAT follows a predictable pattern. So there's no need to use a lengthy, personalized prompt to get Gemini going. Just say something like, "I want to take a practice SAT test," and the chatbot will generate one complete with clickable buttons, graphs, and score analysis.</p>
<p>Of course, generative AI can go off the rails and provide incorrect information, which is a problem when you're trying to learn things. However, Google says it has worked with education firms like The Princeton Review to ensure the AI-generated tests resemble what students will see in the real deal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-begins-offering-free-sat-practice-tests-powered-by-gemini/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmEx7wQI6RY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Ars readers of a certain age no doubt remember the 1980s <em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</em> series (and its spinoff, <em>She-Ra: Princess of Powers</em>) and the many, many offshoots of this hugely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe">popular Mattel franchise</a>, including an extensive line of action figures. Amazon MGM Studios no doubt hopes to cash in on any lingering nostalgia with its forthcoming film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe_(2026_film)"><em>Masters of the Universe.</em></a> Judging by the extended teaser trailer, we're getting an origin story for He-Man.</p>
<p>It's not the first time someone has turned He-Man into a feature film: Dolph Lundgren starred in 1987's <em>Masters of the Universe</em>, a critical and box office bomb that also featured Frank Langella as arch-villain Skeletor. Its poor reception might have stemmed from the 1987 film deviating significantly from the original cartoon, angering fans. But frankly, it was just a bad, cheesy movie, though it still has its share of cult fans today.</p>
<p>This latest big-screen live-action adaptation has been languishing in development hell for nearly two decades. There were rumors in 2007 that John Woo would direct a He-Man feature for Warner Bros., but the project never got the green light. Sony Pictures gained the rights in 2009, and there were multiple script rewrites and much shuffling of possible directors (with John Chu, McG, and David S. Goyer among the candidates).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/check-out-the-first-trailer-for-masters-of-the-universe/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google believes AI is the future of search, and it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/at-i-o-2025-google-leaves-no-doubt-that-ai-mode-is-the-future-of-search/">not shy about saying it</a>. After adding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/gemini-can-now-scan-your-photos-email-and-more-to-provide-better-answers/">account-level personalization</a> to Gemini earlier this month, it's now updating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/">AI Mode</a> with so-called "Personal Intelligence." According to Google, this makes the bot's answers more useful because they are tailored to your personal context.</p>
<p>Starting today, the feature is rolling out to all users who subscribe to Google AI Pro or AI Ultra. However, it will be a <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/22">Labs feature</a> that needs to be explicitly enabled (subscribers will be prompted to do this). Google tends to expand access to new AI features to free accounts later on, so free users will most likely get access to Personal Intelligence in the future. Whenever this option does land on your account, it's entirely optional and can be disabled at any time.</p>
<p>If you decide to integrate your data with AI Mode, the search bot will be able to scan your Gmail and Google Photos. That's less extensive than the Gemini app version, which supports Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history. Gmail will probably be the biggest contributor to AI Mode—a great many life events involve confirmation emails. Traditional search results when you are logged in are adjusted based on your usage history, but this goes a step further.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-ai-mode-can-now-customize-responses-with-your-email-and-photos/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-the-ars-technica-review/">reviewed the Switch 2 back in June</a>, I noted that the lack of any sort of extended grip on the extremely thin Joy-Con 2 controllers made them relatively awkward to hold, both when connected to the system and when cradled in separate hands. At the time, I said that "my Switch 2 will probably need something like <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-pro-purple-style-wireless-joy-pad-for-switch-switch-oled?sv1=affiliate&amp;sv_campaign_id=78888&amp;sscid=95943_1769092363_1038034ce8587237102389cdbd188388&amp;awc=95943_1769092363_1038034ce8587237102389cdbd188388">the Nyxi Hyperion Pro</a>, which I’ve come to rely on to make portable play on the original Switch much more comfortable."</p>
<p>Over half a year later, Nyxi is once again addressing my Switch controller-related comfort concerns with the <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-3-wireless-joypad-for-switch-2">Hyperion 3</a>, which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NYXIGameOFFICIAL/videos/25434137766281969/">made available for preorder earlier this week</a> ahead of planned March 1 shipments. Unfortunately, it looks like players will have to pay a relatively high price for a potentially more ergonomic Switch 2 experience.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, eBay updated its <a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> to explicitly ban third-party "buy for me" agents and AI chatbots from interacting with its platform without permission, first spotted by <a href="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/ebay-bans-ai-agents-updates-arbitration-user-agreement-feb-2026/">Value Added Resource</a>. On its face, a one-line terms of service update doesn't seem like major news, but what it implies is more significant: The change reflects the rapid emergence of what some are calling "agentic commerce," a new category of AI tools designed to browse, compare, and purchase products on behalf of users.</p>
<p>eBay's updated terms, which go into effect on February 20, 2026, specifically prohibit users from employing "buy-for-me agents, LLM-driven bots, or any end-to-end flow that attempts to place orders without human review" to access eBay's services without the site's permission. The previous version of the agreement contained a general prohibition on robots, spiders, scrapers, and automated data gathering tools but did not mention AI agents or LLMs by name.</p>
<p>At first glance, the phrase "agentic commerce" may sound like aspirational marketing jargon, but the tools are already here, and people are apparently using them. While fitting loosely under one label, these tools come in many forms.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ebay-bans-illicit-automated-shopping-amid-rapid-rise-of-ai-agents/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>NASA, on Wednesday, January 21, revealed the contents of the Artemis II mission's Official Flight Kit (OFK), continuing a tradition dating back to the Apollo program of packing a duffel bag-sized pouch of symbolic and celebratory items to commemorate the flight and recognize the people behind it. The kit includes more than 2,300 items, including a handful of relics.</p>
<p>"This mission will bring together pieces of our earliest achievements in aviation, defining moments from human spaceflight and symbols of where we're headed next," Jared Isaacman, NASA's administrator, said in a statement. "Historical artifacts flying aboard Artemis II reflect the long arc of American exploration and the generations of innovators who made this moment possible."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasa-to-fly-apollo-aviation-artifacts-on-artemis-ii/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As Meta heads to trial in the state of New Mexico for allegedly failing to protect minors from sexual exploitation, the company is making an aggressive push to have certain information excluded from the court proceedings.</p>
<p>The company has petitioned the judge to exclude certain research studies and articles around social media and youth mental health; any mention of a recent high-profile case involving teen suicide and social media content; and any references to Meta’s financial resources, the personal activities of employees, and Mark Zuckerberg’s time as a student at Harvard University.</p>
<p>Meta’s requests to exclude information, known as motions in limine, are a standard part of pretrial proceedings, in which a party can ask a judge to determine in advance which evidence or arguments are permissible in court. This is to ensure the jury is presented with facts and not irrelevant or prejudicial information and that the defendant is granted a fair trial.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/meta-wants-to-block-data-about-social-media-use-mental-health-in-child-safety-trial/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge today ordered the US government to stop searching devices seized from the house of a Washington Post reporter. It may be only a temporary reprieve for the Post and reporter Hannah Natanson, however. Further proceedings will be held on whether the search can resume or whether the government must return the devices.</p>
<p>Natanson herself isn't the subject of investigation, but the FBI executed a search warrant at her home and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fbi-fights-leaks-by-seizing-washington-post-reporters-phone-laptops-and-watch/">seized her work and personal devices</a> last week as part of an investigation into alleged leaks by a Pentagon contractor. The Post filed a motion to force the return of the reporter's property, and a separate motion for a standstill order that would prevent review of the seized devices until the court rules on whether they must be returned.</p>
<p>"Almost none of the seized data is even potentially responsive to the warrant, which seeks only records received from or relating to a single government contractor," a Post <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.588772/gov.uscourts.vaed.588772.9.0.pdf">court filing</a> today said. "The seized data is core First Amendment-protected material, and some is protected by the attorney-client privilege."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-stop-to-fbi-search-of-devices-seized-from-washington-post-reporter/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The links are sent to people seeking a range of services, including those offering insurance quotes, job listings, and referrals for pet sitters and tutors. To eliminate the hassle of collecting usernames and passwords—and for users to create and enter them—many such services instead require users to provide a cell phone number when signing up for an account.

<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09232">paper</a> published last week has found more than 700 endpoints delivering such texts on behalf of more than 175 services that put user security and privacy at risk. One practice that jeopardizes users is the use of links that are easily enumerated, meaning scammers can guess them by simply modifying the security token, which usually appears at the right of a URL. By incrementing or randomly guessing the token—for instance, by first changing 123 to 124 or ABC to ABD and so on—the researchers were able to access accounts belonging to other users. From there, the researchers could view personal details, such as partially completed insurance applications.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/millions-of-people-imperiled-through-sign-in-links-sent-by-sms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a small clinical trial, customized mRNA vaccines against high-risk skin cancers appeared to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death by nearly 50 percent over five years when compared with standard treatment alone. That's <a href="https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=7585547225835569&amp;symbol=MRNA">according to Moderna and Merck</a>, the two pharmaceutical companies that have collaborated on the experimental cancer vaccine, called intismeran autogene (mRNA-4157 or V940).</p>
<p>So far, the companies have only reported the top-line results in a press release this week. However, the results align closely with previous, more detailed analyses from the trial, which examined rates of recurrence and death at earlier time points, specifically at <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/moderna-and-merck-announce-mrna-4157-v940-an-investigational-individualized-neoantigen-therapy-in-combination-with-keytruda-pembrolizumab-demonstrated-superior-recurrence-free-survival-in/">two years</a> and <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/moderna-and-merck-announce-mrna-4157-v940-in-combination-with-keytruda-pembrolizumab-demonstrated-continued-improvement-in-recurrence-free-survival-and-distant-metastasis-free-survival-in-pa/">three years</a> after the treatment. More data from the trial—a Phase 2 trial—will soon be presented at a medical conference, the companies said. A Phase 3 trial is also underway, with enrollment complete.</p>
<p>The ongoing Phase 2 trial included 157 patients who were diagnosed with stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma and were at high risk of having it recur after surgical removal. A standard treatment to prevent recurrence after such surgery is immunotherapy, including Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab). This drug essentially enables immune cells, specifically T cells, to attack and kill cancer cells—something they normally do. But, in many types of cancers, including melanoma, cancer cells have the ability to bind to receptors on T cells (called PD-1 receptors), which basically shuts the T cells down. Keytruda works by physically blocking the PD-1 receptors, preventing cancer cells from binding and keeping the T cells activated so they can kill the cancer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/mrna-cancer-vaccine-shows-protection-at-5-year-follow-up-moderna-and-merck-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission today issued a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows, saying these shows may no longer qualify for an exemption to the FCC's equal-time rule. Because the FCC is chaired by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/no-one-loves-president-trump-more-than-fcc-chairman-brendan-carr/">vocal Trump supporter Brendan Carr</a>, changing how the rule is enforced could pressure shows into seeking out more interviews with Republican candidates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/bureau-provides-guidance-political-equal-opportunities-requirement">public notice</a> providing what the FCC calls "guidance on political equal opportunities requirement for broadcast television stations" appears to be part of the Trump administration's campaign against alleged liberal bias on broadcast TV. Carr, who has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/fcc-deletes-independent-agency-from-website-as-carr-defends-allegiance-to-trump/">eroded the FCC's historical independence</a> from the White House, previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">pressured ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel</a> and threatened ABC’s <em>The View</em> with the equal-time rule.</p>
<p>The Carr FCC's public notice today said that federal rules "prevent broadcast television stations, which have been given access to a valuable public resource (namely, spectrum), from unfairly putting their thumbs on the scale for one political candidate or set of candidates over another." These rules come from "the decision by Congress that broadcast television stations have an obligation to operate in the public interest—not in any narrow partisan, political interest," the Carr FCC said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/trump-fcc-tries-to-get-more-republicans-on-late-night-and-daytime-talk-shows/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>For a lot of the games I've written about in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/carsgames/">C:\ArsGames</a> series, I've come to the conclusion that the games hold up pretty well, despite their age—<em>Master of Orion II</em>, <em>Jill of the Jungle</em>, and <em>Wing Commander Privateer</em>, for example. Each of those have flaws that show now more than ever, but I still had a blast revisiting each of them.</p>
<p>This time I'd like to write about one that I think doesn't hold up quite as well for me: For the first time in almost 30 years, I revisited the original<em> Tomb Raider</em> via 2024's <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Ftomb_raider_i_to_iii_remastered"><em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em></a> collection.</p>
<p>You might be thinking this is going to be a dunk on the work done on the remaster, but that's not the case, because the core issue with playing 1996's <em>Tomb Raider</em> in 2026 is actually unsolvable, no matter how much care is put into a remaster.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/the-problem-with-revisiting-tomb-raider-reacclimating-to-tank-controls/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The companies that make RAM and flash memory chips are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/high-ram-prices-mean-record-setting-profits-for-samsung-and-other-memory-makers/">enjoying record profits</a> because of the AI-induced memory crunch—and they’re also indicating that they don’t expect conditions to improve much if at all in 2026. And while RAM kits have been hit the fastest and hardest by shortages and price increases, we shouldn't expect SSD pricing to improve any time soon, either.</p>
<p>That's the message from Shunsuke Nakato (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/ssds/memory-manufacturer-kioxia-reveals-its-entire-nand-flash-production-volume-for-2026-is-already-sold-out/">via PC Gamer</a>), managing director of the memory division of Kioxia, the Japanese memory company that was spun off from Toshiba at the end of the 2010s. Nakato says that Kioxia’s manufacturing capacity is sold out through the rest of 2026, driving the market for both enterprise and consumer SSDs to a “high-end and expensive phase.”</p>
<p>“There is a sense of crisis that companies will be eliminated the moment they stop investing in AI, so they have no choice but to continue investing,” said Nakato, as <a href="https://www.ddaily.co.kr/page/view/2026012017211958377">reported</a> by the Korean-language publication Digital Daily. Absent a big change in the demand for generative AI data centers, that cycle of investments will keep prices high for the foreseeable future.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/kioxias-memory-is-sold-out-for-2026-prolonging-a-high-end-and-expensive-phase/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers at Princeton University have built a swarm of interconnected mini-robots that "bloom" like flowers in response to changing light levels in an office. According to their <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.ady7233">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Robotics, such robotic swarms could one day be used as dynamic facades in architectural designs, enabling buildings to adapt to changing climate conditions as well as interact with humans in creative ways.</p>
<p>The authors drew inspiration from so-called "living architectures," such as beehives. Fire ants provide <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/study-ids-simple-rules-for-how-floating-fire-ant-rafts-change-shape-over-time/">a textbook example</a> of this kind of collective behavior. A few ants spaced well apart behave like individual ants. But pack enough of them closely together, and they behave more like a single unit, exhibiting both solid and liquid properties. You can pour them from a teapot like ants, as Goldman’s lab demonstrated several years ago, or they can link together to build towers or floating rafts—a handy survival skill when, say, a hurricane floods Houston. They <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/08/we-can-learn-the-secrets-of-smooth-traffic-flow-by-watching-fire-ants/">also excel</a> at regulating their own traffic flow. You almost never see an ant traffic jam.</p>
<p>Naturally scientists are keen to mimic such systems. For instance, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan3891">in 2018</a>, Georgia Tech researchers built ant-like robots and programmed them to dig through 3D-printed magnetic plastic balls designed to simulate moist soil. Robot swarms capable of efficiently digging underground without jamming would be super beneficial for mining or disaster recovery efforts, where using human beings might not be feasible.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/watch-a-robot-swarm-bloom-like-a-garden/">Read full article</a></p>
