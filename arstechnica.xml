<p>Welcome to Edition 6.41 of the Rocket Report! As I finish up this edition I'm listening to the post-Flight Readiness Review news conference for Boeing's Crew Flight Test. It sounds like everything remains on track for a launch attempt on May 6, at 10:34 pm ET. It's exciting to see this important milestone for Boeing and the US human spaceflight program so near to hand.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Shetland spaceport advancing toward launch</strong>. SaxaVord Spaceport in Scotland is on track to launch the United Kingdom’s first vertical rocket into orbit, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdg4x3524eo">the BBC reports</a>. The Civil Aviation Authority has granted a range license to the Scottish spaceport, which will allow the company to control the sea and airspace during launch. Previously, the site received a spaceport license in December 2023. Ambitiously, the facility aims to launch up to 30 rockets every year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019995#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019995&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution Wednesday that would have reaffirmed a nearly 50-year-old ban on placing weapons of mass destruction into orbit, two months after reports Russia has plans to do just that.</p>
<p>Russia's vote against the resolution was no surprise. As one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, Russia has veto power over any resolution that comes before the body. China abstained from the vote, and 13 other members of the Security Council voted in favor of the resolution.</p>
<p>If it passed, the resolution would have affirmed a binding obligation in Article IV of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which says nations are "not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020070#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020070&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Logitech announced a new mouse last week. A company rep reached out to inform Ars of Logitech’s “newest wireless mouse.” The gadget’s <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/signature-ai-edition-m750-wireless-mouse.910-007396.html">product page</a> reads the same as of this writing.</p>
<p>I’ve had good experience with Logitech mice, especially wireless ones, one of which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/gears-technica-the-keyboards-and-mice-our-editors-swear-by/">I'm using now</a>. So I was keen to learn what Logitech might have done to improve on its previous wireless mouse designs. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/logitech-mx-master-3s-review-the-best-wireless-mouse-gets-slightly-better/">A quieter click</a>? A new shape to better accommodate my overworked right hand? Multiple onboard profiles in a business-ready design?</p>
<p>I was disappointed to learn that the most distinct feature of the Logitech Signature AI Edition M750 is a button located south of the scroll wheel. This button is preprogrammed to launch the ChatGPT prompt builder, which Logitech recently added to its peripherals configuration app Options+.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019927#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019927&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Trendy, unproven "vampire facials" performed at an unlicensed spa in New Mexico left at least three women with HIV infections. This marks the first time that cosmetic procedures have been associated with an HIV outbreak, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7316a3.htm?s_cid=mm7316a3_w">a detailed report of the outbreak investigation published today.</a></p>
<p>Ars reported on the cluster last year when state health officials announced they were still identifying cases linked to the spa despite it being shut down in September 2018. But today's investigation report offers more insight into the unprecedented outbreak, which linked five people with HIV infections to the spa and spurred investigators to contact and test nearly 200 other spa clients. The report appears in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>
<p>The investigation began when a woman between the ages of 40 and 50 turned up positive on a rapid HIV test taken while she was traveling abroad in the summer of 2018. She had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/whatishiv.html">a stage 1 acute infection</a>. It was a result that was as dumbfounding as it was likely distressing. The woman had no clear risk factors for acquiring the infection: no injection drug use, no blood transfusions, and her current and only recent sexual partner tested negative. But, she did report getting a vampire facial in the spring of 2018 at a spa in Albuquerque called VIP Spa.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020165#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020165&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            The HMD Pulse base model.                           [credit:

        </div>

      </ul>

<p>HMD has been known as the manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones for years now, but now the company wants to <a href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/press/hmd-pulse-press-release">start selling phones</a> under its own brand. The first is the "HMD Pulse" line, a series of three low-end phones that are headed for Europe. The US is getting an HMD-branded phone, too—the HMD Vibe—but that won't be out until May.</p>
<p>Europe's getting the 140-euro HMD Pulse, 160-euro Pulse+, and the 180-euro Pulse Pro. If you can't tell from the prices, these are destined for Europe for now, but if you convert them to USD, that's about $150, $170, and $190, respectively. With only $20 between tiers, there isn't a huge difference from one model to the next. They all have bottom-of-the-barrel Unisoc T606 SoCs. That's a 12 nm chip with two Cortex A75 Arm cores, two A55 cores, an ARM Mali-G57 MP1, and it's 4G only. Previously, HMD used this chip in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/the-nokia-g22-pitches-standard-low-end-phone-design-as-repairable/">2023 HMD Nokia G22</a>. They also all have 90 Hz, 6.65-inch, 1612×720 LCDs, 128GB of storage, and 5,000 mAh batteries.</p>
<p>As for the differences, the base model has 4GB of RAM, a 13 MP main rear camera, an 8 MP front camera, and 10 W wired charging. The Plus model upgrades to a 50 MP main camera, while the Pro model has 6GB of RAM, a 50 MP main camera, 50 MP front camera, and 20 W wired charging. There is a second lens camera on the back, but it appears to be only a 2 MP "depth sensor" on all models.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019993#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019993&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the world of AI, what might be called "small language models" have been growing in popularity recently because they can be run on a local device instead of requiring data center-grade computers in the cloud. On Wednesday, Apple<a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM"> introduced</a> a set of tiny source-available AI language models called OpenELM that are small enough to run directly on a smartphone. They're mostly proof-of-concept research models for now, but they could form the basis of future on-device AI offerings from Apple.</p>

<p>Apple's new AI models, collectively named OpenELM for "Open-source Efficient Language Models," are currently available on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM">Hugging Face</a> under an <a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM/blob/main/LICENSE">Apple Sample Code License</a>. Since there are some restrictions in the license, it may not fit the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">commonly accepted definition</a> of "open source," but the source code for OpenELM is available.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, we covered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/microsofts-phi-3-shows-the-surprising-power-of-small-locally-run-ai-language-models/">Microsoft's Phi-3 models</a>, which aim to achieve something similar: a useful level of language understanding and processing performance in small AI models that can run locally. Phi-3-mini features 3.8 billion parameters, but some of Apple's OpenELM models are much smaller, ranging from 270 million to 3 billion parameters in eight distinct models.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020032#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020032&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years now, video game preservationists, librarians, and historians have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/the-quest-to-save-todays-gaming-history-from-being-lost-forever/">arguing</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">a DMCA exemption</a> that would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/why-game-archivists-are-dreading-this-months-3ds-wii-u-eshop-shutdown/">allow them</a> to legally share emulated versions of their physical game collections with researchers remotely over the Internet. But those preservationists continue to face pushback from industry trade groups, which worry that an exemption would open a legal loophole for "online arcades" that could give members of the public free, legal, and widespread access to copyrighted classic games.</p>
<p>This long-running argument was joined once again earlier this month during <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2122947184?t=04h04m48s">livestreamed testimony</a> in front of the Copyright Office, which is considering new DMCA rules as <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/">part of its regular triennial process</a>. During that testimony, representatives of the <a href="https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/">Software Preservation Network</a> and the <a href="https://www.librarycopyrightalliance.org/">Library Copyright Alliance</a> defended their proposal for a system of "individualized human review" to help ensure that temporary remote game access would be granted "primarily for the purposes of private study, scholarship, teaching, or research."</p>

<p>History might consider the most important aspect of Ubuntu 24.04 to be something that it doesn't have: vulnerabilities to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">the XZ backdoor that nearly took over the global Linux scene</a>.</p>
<p>Betas, and the final release of Ubuntu 24.04, a long-term support (LTS) release of the venerable Linux distribution, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/ubuntu-2404-beta-delayed-due-to-malicious-code-in-xz-utils-other-linux-distros-are-also-affected">were delayed</a>, as backing firm Canonical worked in early April 2024 to rebuild every binary included in the release. xz Utils, an almost ubiquitous data-compression package on Unix-like systems, had been compromised through a long-term and elaborate supply-chain attack, discovered only because a Microsoft engineer noted some oddities with SSH performance on a Debian system. Ubuntu, along with just about every other regularly updating software platform, had <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/xz-liblzma-security-update-post-2/43801?_gl=1*vyfrlq*_gcl_au*NTE4NjE3MTIwLjE3MTE2MzkwMjg.">a lot of work to do this month</a>.</p>

<p>A now-abandoned USB worm that backdoors connected devices has continued to self-replicate for years since its creators lost control of it and remains active on thousands, possibly millions, of machines, researchers said Thursday.</p>
<p>The worm—which first came to light in a <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/03/09/border-hopping-plugx-usb-worm/">2023 post</a> published by security firm Sophos—became active in 2019 when a variant of malware known as PlugX added functionality that allowed it to infect USB drives automatically. In turn, those drives would infect any new machine they connected to, a capability that allowed the malware to spread without requiring any end-user interaction. Researchers who have tracked PlugX since at least 2008 have said that the malware has origins in China and has been used by various groups tied to the country’s Ministry of State Security.</p>
<h2>Still active after all these years</h2>
<p>For reasons that aren’t clear, the worm creator abandoned the one and only IP address that was designated as its command-and-control channel. With no one controlling the infected machines anymore, the PlugX worm was effectively dead, or at least one might have presumed so. The worm, it turns out, has continued to live on in an undetermined number of machines that possibly reaches into the millions, researchers from security firm Sekoia <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/unplugging-plugx-sinkholing-the-plugx-usb-worm-botnet/">reported</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020055#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020055&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>US electric vehicle manufacturing got a bit of a boost today. Toyota has revealed that it is spending $1.4 billion to upgrade its factory in Princeton, Indiana, in order to assemble a new three-row electric SUV. That will add an extra 340 jobs to the factory, which currently employs more than 7,500 workers who assemble the Toyota Sienna minivan and the Toyota Highlander, Grand Highlander, and Lexus TX SUVs.</p>
<p>"Indiana and Toyota share a nearly 30-year partnership that has cultivated job stability and economic opportunity in Princeton and the surrounding southwest Indiana region for decades," said Governor Eric Holcomb.</p>
<p>"Toyota's investment in the state began with an $800 million commitment and has grown to over $8 billion. Today's incredible announcement shows yet again just how important our state’s business-friendly environment, focus on long-term success, and access to a skilled workforce is to companies seeking to expand and be profitable far into the future. Indiana proudly looks forward to continuing to be at the center of the future of mobility,” Holcomb said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020012#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020012&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Historical accounts vary about how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Greek philosopher Plato</a> died: in bed while listening to a young woman playing the flute; at a wedding feast; or peacefully in his sleep. But the few surviving texts from that period indicate that the philosopher was buried somewhere in the garden of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy">the Academy</a> he founded in Athens. The garden was quite large, but archaeologists have now <a href="https://www.heritagedaily.com/2024/04/carbonised-herculaneum-papyrus-reveals-burial-place-of-plato/151747#google_vignette">deciphered</a> a charred ancient papyrus scroll recovered from the ruins of Herculaneum, indicating a more precise burial location: in a private area near a sacred shrine to the Muses, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/23/mystery-plato-buried-solved-bionic-eye-texts-shrine-athens/#:~:text=They%20used%20infrared%20and%20X,Academy%20which%20were%20previously%20illegible.&amp;text=It%20has%20made%20locating%20Plato's,the%20results%20of%20the%20project">according to Constanza Millani</a>, director of the Institute of Heritage Science at Italy's National Research Council.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/researchers-use-synchrotron-to-read-ancient-burned-scrolls-from-rome/">previously reported</a>, the ancient Roman resort town Pompeii wasn't the only city destroyed in <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5825459/the-roman-city-of-pompeii-pictures-of-a-lost-world-frozen-in-time" data-uri="3bb9f599cdac4781965ee9a8ab698092">the catastrophic 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius</a>. Several other cities in the area, including the wealthy enclave of Herculaneum, were fried by clouds of hot gas called pyroclastic pulses and flows. But still, some remnants of Roman wealth survived. One palatial residence in Herculaneum—believed to have once belonged to a man named Piso—contained hundreds of priceless written scrolls made from papyrus, singed into carbon by volcanic gas.</p>
<p>The scrolls stayed buried under volcanic mud until they were excavated in the 1700s from a single room that archaeologists believe held the personal working library of an Epicurean philosopher named Philodemus. There may be even more scrolls still buried on the as-yet-unexcavated lower floors of the villa. The few opened fragments helped scholars identify various Greek philosophical texts, including <em>On Nature</em> by Epicurus and several by Philodemus himself, as well as a handful of Latin works. But the more than 600 rolled-up scrolls were so fragile that it was long believed they would never be readable, since even touching them could cause them to crumble.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019913#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019913&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission voted 3–2 to impose net neutrality rules today, restoring the common-carrier regulatory framework enforced during the Obama era and then abandoned while Trump was president.</p>
<p>The rules prohibit Internet service providers from blocking and throttling lawful content and ban paid prioritization. Cable and telecom companies plan to fight the rules in court, but they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/net-neutrality-and-title-ii-win-in-court-as-isps-lose-case-against-fcc/">lost a similar battle</a> during the Obama era when judges upheld the FCC's ability to regulate ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act.</p>
<p>"Consumers have made clear to us they do not want their broadband provider cutting sweetheart deals, with fast lanes for some services and slow lanes for others," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said at today's meeting. "They do not want their providers engaging in blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. And if they have problems, they expect the nation's expert authority on communications to be able to respond. Because we put national net neutrality rules back on the books, we fix that today."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020006#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020006&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Honda announced today that it will spend $11 billion to expand its electric vehicle manufacturing presence in North America. The Japanese automaker already has a number of factories in the US, Mexico, and Canada, and it's this last one that will benefit from the expansion, with four EV-related plants planned for Ontario.</p>
<p>Honda says it has begun evaluating requirements for what it's calling an "innovative and environmentally responsible" EV factory and a standalone EV battery plant in Alliston, Ontario, which is already home to Honda's two existing Canadian manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the automaker wants to set up another two sites as joint ventures. One will be a plant that processes cathode active materials and their precursors—the various elements like nickel and manganese that are combined with lithium in lithium-ion batteries—set up in a partnership with POSCO Future M, a South Korean battery material and chemical company. (POSCO is already working with General Motors on another joint venture battery precursor material facility in Betancour, Quebec, that is supposed to become operational in 2026.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019981#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019981&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, Baltimore County Police arrested Pikesville High School's former athletic director, Dazhon Darien, and charged him with using AI to impersonate Principal Eric Eiswert, according to a report by <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/education/k-12-schools/eric-eiswert-ai-audio-baltimore-county-YBJNJAS6OZEE5OQVF5LFOFYN6M/">The Baltimore Banner</a>. Police say Darien used AI voice synthesis software to simulate Eiswert's voice, leading the public to believe the principal made racist and antisemitic comments.</p>

<p>The audio clip, posted on a popular Instagram account, contained offensive remarks about "ungrateful Black kids" and their academic performance, as well as a threat to "join the other side" if the speaker received one more complaint from "one more Jew in this community." The recording also mentioned names of staff members, including Darien's nickname "DJ," suggesting they should not have been hired or should be removed "one way or another."</p>
<p>The comments led to significant uproar from students, faculty, and the wider community, many of whom initially believed the principal had actually made the comments. A Pikesville High School teacher named Shaena Ravenell reportedly played a large role in disseminating the audio. While she has not been charged, police indicated that she forwarded the controversial email to a student known for their ability to quickly spread information through social media. This student then escalated the audio's reach, which included sharing it with the media and the NAACP.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019931#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019931&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-suite-standards-reduce-pollution-fossil-fuel">announced a suite of rules</a> that target pollution from fossil fuel power plants. In addition to limits on carbon emissions and a tightening of existing regulations on mercury releases, additional rules target coal ash waste left over from power generation and contaminants in the water used during the operation of power plants. While some of these regulations will affect the operation of plants powered by natural gas, most directly target the use of coal and will likely be the final nail in the coffin for the already dying industry.</p>
<p>The decision to release all four rules at the same time goes beyond simply getting the pain over with at once. Rules governing carbon emissions are expected to influence the emissions of other pollutants like mercury, and vice versa. As a result, the EPA expects that creating a single plan for compliance with all the rules will be more cost-effective.</p>
<h2>Targeting carbon</h2>
<p>The regulations that target carbon dioxide emissions have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/epas-new-rules-will-shift-power-plants-to-carbon-capture-green-hydrogen/">been in the works</a> for roughly a year. The rules came in response to a Supreme Court decision in <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/court-severely-limits-the-epas-ability-to-regulate-carbon-emissions/">West Virginia v. EPA</a>,</em> which ruled that Clean Air Act regulations had to target individual power plants rather than giving states flexibility regarding how to meet broader standards. As a result, the new rules target carbon dioxide the only way they can: Plants can either switch to burning non-fossil fuels such as green hydrogen, or they can capture their carbon emissions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019957#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019957&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The popular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/04/3598/">long-running</a> Source-engine physics sandbox <em>Garry's Mod</em> has begun to take down Nintendo-related items from the game's Steam Workshop page, following an apparent takedown request from Nintendo.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/garrysmod/announcements/detail/4200245595694413053?snr=2___">a Steam Community news post</a>, mod creator Garry Newman writes that some items have already been taken down as part of an "ongoing process, as we have 20 years of uploads to go through." Indeed, combing through the over <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=4000">1.8 million <em>Garry's Mod</em> Steam Workshop add-ons</a> to find all of Nintendo's copyrighted content is sure to be a significant task. A simple search for <em>Pokemon</em> Thursday morning <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=4000&amp;searchtext=pokemon&amp;childpublishedfileid=0&amp;browsesort=trend&amp;section=readytouseitems&amp;created_date_range_filter_start=0&amp;created_date_range_filter_end=0&amp;updated_date_range_filter_start=0&amp;updated_date_range_filter_end=0">turns up nearly 3,000 seemingly copyright-infringing results</a> on its own.</p>
<p>"If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo-related uploads and never uploading them again, that would help us a lot," Newman jokes in the announcement post.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019937#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019937&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TikTok’s Beijing-based owner ByteDance tightened its grip over its US operations over the past two years, according to company insiders, even as momentum to ban the short-video app grew in Washington.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-if-chinese-owner-bytedance-doesnt-sell/">US government passed legislation this week</a> aimed at forcing TikTok to divest from its parent or face a countrywide ban, but prising the viral video app from its $268 billion parent company would present a formidable challenge.</p>
<p>More than two dozen current and former employees told the Financial Times that TikTok has only become more deeply interwoven with ByteDance as tensions over the app’s ownership escalated.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019930#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019930&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a SpaceX engineer working on the Starship program about five years ago, Jaret Matthews could see the future of spaceflight quite clearly and began to imagine the possibilities.</p>
<p>For decades everything that went to space had to be carefully measured, optimized for mass, and serve an extremely specialized purpose. But Starship, Matthews believed, held the potential to change all that. With full reusability, a barn-size payload fairing, and capability to loft 100 or more metric tons to orbit in a single throw, Starship offered the tantalizing prospect of a world in which flying into space was not crazy expensive. He envisioned Starships delivering truckloads of cargo to the Moon or Mars.</p>
<p>Matthews spent a decade working on robots and rovers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory before coming to SpaceX in 2012. He began to suggest that the company work on a system that could unload and distribute cargo from Starship, like the cranes and trucks that offload cargo from large container ships in port. However, he didn't get far, as SpaceX was focused on developing the Starship transportation system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019216#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019216&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X series of chips promises to be the company’s first that can go toe-to-toe with Apple Silicon, and the PC ecosystem <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/is-the-arm-version-of-windows-ready-for-its-close-up/">is reacting accordingly</a>. Microsoft reportedly plans for the Arm version of its next Surface tablet to be the flagship, and major apps like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-launches-chrome-nightlies-for-windows-11-on-arm/">Chrome</a> and Dropbox have recently released Arm-native Windows versions for the first time.</p>
<p>Ahead of the chips' launch late this year, Qualcomm announced a new lower-end model destined for cheaper devices. Dubbed the Snapdragon X Plus, it shares a lot in common with the flagship <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/">Snapdragon X Elite</a>.</p>

<p>The Snapdragon X Plus includes 10 CPU cores instead of the Elite’s 12, though the more noticeable change is its lack of support for clock-speed boosting; the chip’s 3.4 GHz base frequency is as fast as it goes, where the Elite chips can boost two cores to 4.2 GHz and one core up to 4.3 GHz, depending on the specific model. Qualcomm also rates the X Plus’ integrated GPU at 3.8 TFLOPs, down from the X Elite’s maximum of 4.6 TFLOPs. Aside from those high-level FLOP numbers, we still know very little about how the GPU will be configured; we also don’t know the ratio of “big” and “little” CPU cores.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019890#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019890&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Gadgets aren’t fun anymore,” sighed my wife, watching me tap away on my Palm Zire 72 as she sat on the couch with her MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And it’s true: The smartphone has all but eliminated entire classes of gadgets, from point-and-shoot cameras to MP3 players, GPS maps, and even flashlights. But arguably no style of gadget has been so thoroughly superseded as the personal digital assistant, the handheld computer that dominated the late '90s and early 2000s. The PDA even set the template for <i>how</i> its smartphone successors would render it obsolete, moving from simple personal information management to encompass games, messaging, music, and photos.</p>
<p>But just as smartphones would do, PDAs offered a dizzying array of operating systems and applications, and a great many of them ran Palm OS. (I bought my first Palm, an m505, new in 2001, upgrading from an HP 95LX.) Naturally, there’s no way we could enumerate every single such device in this article. So in this Ars retrospective, we’ll look back at some notable examples of the technical evolution of the Palm operating system and the devices that ran it—and how they paved the way for what we use now.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013776#p3">Read 92 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013776&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
