              <![CDATA[<p>Federal support for mRNA vaccine research appears in jeopardy after <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-grants-mrna-vaccines-trump-administration-hhs-rfk/">KFF Health News</a> reported Sunday that officials at the National Institutes of Health have directed scientists to remove all references to the lifesaving technology from their grant applications. All such research is now under direct scrutiny from health secretary and long-time anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>A senior official at the NIH's National Cancer Institute confirmed to KFF that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli "sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s office and the White House."</p>
<p>Further, two independent scientists told the outlet that they were informed by NIH officials that any mention of mRNA vaccines needed to be removed from their grant applications. One, a biomedical researcher in Philadelphia, said that the NIH had "flagged our pending grant as having an mRNA vaccine component." The other, a researcher in New York who works on vaccines but not mRNA vaccines, was told that background mentions of mRNA vaccine efficacy in their previous grant applications needed to be removed from future applications.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/federal-funding-for-mrna-vaccine-research-in-jeopardy-under-rfk-jr/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Plastics are great, except when it comes to making or disposing of them. Production generally requires the use of chemicals derived from fossil fuels, and so helps to continue our reliance on them. And the final products are generally not biodegradable, so they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/01/plastic-is-everywhere-including-our-food-and-bottled-water/">tend to stick around</a> despite breaking down into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/airborne-microplastics-aid-in-cloud-formation/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">ever smaller fragments</a>.</p>
<p>Biology might ultimately provide a solution, however. Researchers have identified bacteria that evolved the ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/does-newly-discovered-bacteria-recycle-plastic/">digest some plastics</a>. And improvements in our ability to design proteins have allowed us to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/">make new enzymes</a> that can chew up plastics.</p>
<p>This week brings some progress on the other side of the equation, with a team of Korean researchers describing how they've engineered a bacterial strain that can make a useful polymer starting with nothing but glucose as fuel. The system they developed is based on an enzyme that the bacteria use when they're facing unusual nutritional conditions, and it can be tweaked to make a wide range of polymers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/researchers-engineer-bacteria-to-produce-plastics/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Owners of smart TVs and streaming sticks running Roku OS are already subject to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/roku-ad-push-continues-with-plans-to-put-video-ads-in-os-home-screen/">video advertisements on the home screen.</a> Now, Roku is testing what it might look like if it took things a step further and forced people to watch a video ad play before getting to the Roku OS home screen.</p>
<p>Reports of Roku customers seeing video ads automatically play before they could view the OS’ home screen started appearing online this week. A Reddit user, for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1jcuibl/question_about_ads/">posted</a> yesterday: “I just turned on my Roku and got an ... ad for a movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.” Multiple apparent users reported seeing an ad for the movie <em>Moana 2</em>. The ads have a close option, but some users appear to have not seen it.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, a Roku spokesperson shared a company statement that confirms that the autoplaying ads are expected behavior but not a permanent part of Roku OS currently. Instead, Roku claimed, it was just trying the ad capability out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/roku-says-unpopular-autoplay-ads-are-just-a-test/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A federal broadband official departed the US government with a warning that a Trump administration plan will strand rural Americans with worse Internet access in order to help Elon Musk secure public money for Starlink.</p>
<p>"Stranding all or part of rural America with worse Internet so that we can make the world's richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington," wrote Evan Feinman, who had been a Commerce Department official and director of the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program since 2022.</p>
<p>As Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/16/official-exits-commerce-department-musk-warning-00232278">reported</a>, Feinman made the statement in "a blistering email to his former colleagues on his way out the door Sunday warning that the Trump administration is poised to unduly enrich Elon Musk's satellite Internet company with money for rural broadband."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-plan-to-fund-musks-starlink-over-fiber-called-betrayal-of-rural-us/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you're frustrated by some of your favorite apps pestering you to sign up for a subscription, some new data may help you empathize with their developers more. According to revenue data from "over 75,000" mobile apps, the vast majority have a hard time making $1,000 per month.</p>
<p>The data is detailed in RevenueCat's 2025 <a href="http://www.revenuecat.com/report">State of Subscription Apps</a> report. RevenueCat makes a mobile app subscription tool kit and gathered the report's data from apps using its platform. The report covers "more than $10 billion in revenue across more than a billion transactions," and RevenueCat's customer base ranges from indie-sized teams to large publishers. Buffer, ChatGPT, FC Barcelona, Goodnotes, and Reuters are among the San Francisco-based firm's customer base.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report examines apps that rely primarily on in-app subscriptions, as well as those that only generate some revenue from subscriptions. All apps examined, though, actively generate subscription revenue and "meet a minimum threshold of installs or revenue (to ensure statistically meaningful findings," according to the report.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/sobering-revenue-stats-of-70k-mobile-apps-show-why-devs-beg-for-subscriptions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's Windows updates over the last couple of years have mostly been focused on adding generative AI features to the operating system, including multiple versions of the Copilot assistant. Copilot has made it into Windows 11 (and even, to a more limited extent, the aging Windows 10) as a native app, and then a wrapper around a web app, and soon <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/03/update-for-copilot-on-windows-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders-with-new-features-and-improvements/">as a native app again</a>.</p>
<p>But this month's Windows updates are removing the Copilot app from some Windows 11 PCs and unpinning it from the taskbar, according to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/march-11-2025-kb5053598-os-build-26100-3476-a248e951-daef-43ad-aa10-0b99f551cec2">this Microsoft support document</a>. This bug obviously won't affect systems where Copilot had already been uninstalled, but it has <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/why-copilot-app-has-been-removed-in-the-new-update/744bc919-3aef-4a10-91fb-a944e273b564">already led to confusion</a> among some Windows users.</p>
<p>Microsoft says it is "working on a resolution to address the issue" but that users who want to get Copilot back can <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nht9rb2f4hd?hl=en-us&amp;gl=US">reinstall the app from the Microsoft Store</a> and repin it to the taskbar, the same process you use to install Copilot on PCs where it has been removed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/this-months-windows-updates-are-removing-the-copilot-app-accidentally/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcement of a first-of-its-kind United Kingdom law that Elon Musk wants Donald Trump to gut <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/enforcing-the-online-safety-act-platforms-must-start-tackling-illegal-material-from-today">kicked in today</a>, with potentially huge penalties possibly imminent for any Big Tech companies deemed non-compliant.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">Online Safety Act</a> (OSA) forces tech companies to detect and remove dangerous online content, threatening fines of up to 10 percent of global turnover. In extreme cases, widely used platforms like Musk's X could be shut down or executives even jailed if UK online safety regulator Ofcom determines there has been a particularly egregious violation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Critics call it a censorship bill, listing over 130 "priority" offenses across 17 categories detailing what content platforms must remove. The list includes illegal content connected to terrorism, child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, illegal drugs, animal welfare, and other crimes. But it also broadly restricts content in legally gray areas, like posts considered "extreme pornography," harassment, or controlling behavior.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-may-not-be-able-to-save-elon-musk-from-uks-strict-online-safety-law/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Assistant is becoming less helpful as Google "prioritizes" experiences. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google Assistant is not long for this world. Google confirmed what many suspected last week, that it will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/end-of-life-gemini-will-completely-replace-google-assistant-later-this-year/">transition everyone to Gemini in 2025</a>. Assistant holdouts may find it hard to stay on Google's old system until the end, though. Google has confirmed some popular Assistant features are being removed in the coming weeks. You may not miss all of them, but others could force a change to your daily routine.</p>
<p>As Google has increasingly become totally consumed by Gemini, it was a foregone conclusion that Assistant would get the ax eventually. In 2024, Google removed features like media alarms and voice messages, but that was just the start. The full list of removals is still available on its <a href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/13971691?hl=en#zippy=%2Cassistant-changes">support page</a> (spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/16/google-assistant-losing-features-2025/">9to5Google</a>), but there's now a new batch of features at the top. Here's a rundown of what's on the chopping block.</p>
<ul>
<li>Favorite, share, and ask where and when your photos were taken with your voice</li>
<li>Change photo frame settings or ambient screen settings with your voice</li>
<li>Translate your live conversation with someone who doesn’t speak your language with interpreter mode</li>
<li>Get birthday reminder notifications as part of Routines</li>
<li>Ask to schedule or hear previously scheduled Family Bell announcements</li>
<li>Get daily updates from your Assistant, like “send me the weather everyday”</li>
<li>Use Google Assistant on car accessories that have a Bluetooth connection or AUX plug</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are no great loss—you'll probably live without the ability to get automatic birthday reminders or change smart display screensavers by voice. However, others are popular features that Google has promoted aggressively. For example, interpreter mode made a splash in 2019 and has been offering real-time translations ever since; Assistant can only translate a single phrase now. Many folks also use the scheduled updates in Assistant as part of their morning routine. Family Bell is much beloved, too, allowing Assistant to make custom announcements and interactive checklists, which can be handy for getting kids going in the morning. Attempting to trigger some of these features will offer a warning that they will go away soon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/why-wait-google-is-already-dismantling-assistant-as-it-switches-to-gemini/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1's four-wheeled circus got underway this past weekend in Melbourne, Australia. Held on the roads around a lake in Albert Park, the track is one of F1's trickier challenges, made more so on Sunday thanks to rain that eased off before the start of the race, only to return with a vengeance a dozen or so laps before the end. It proved to be a tough day for four of the sport's six new drivers, as well as some more well-known names, and it gave us a clearer idea of the pecking order between the teams, at least for now.</p>
<p>True F1 junkies were probably following the preseason test earlier this month in Bahrain, as the sport now helpfully shows those three days of running on its streaming platform. But those devoted enough to watch the cars circulate for hours with nothing on the line also know you shouldn't read too much into a preseason test, especially one held at a circuit that is unrepresentative of most of the others that F1 visits—and in unseasonably cold weather, to boot.</p>
<p>Little has changed in the way of the technical regulations between the end of last year and the start of this one, other than an increasing scrutiny on the front and rear wings' ability to flex when they're not supposed to. Flexing or deflecting under load at opportune times reduces the drag and allows a car to go a little faster in a straight line for the same amount of power, giving that car an unfair advantage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/a-tough-race-for-the-rookies-as-f1-starts-2025-in-australia/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA["Channeling" during brewing process can lead to non-uniform filtration and lower extraction yield.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Many variables can affect the quality of a steaming cup of espresso, including so-called "channeling" during the brewing process, in which the water doesn't seep uniformly through the grounds but branches off in various preferential paths instead. This significantly reduces the extraction yield and thus the quality of the final brew. Scientists from the University of Warsaw have gleaned insights into the underlying physics of channeling that will help coffee lovers achieve more consistent results when brewing espresso. They presented their preliminary findings at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit in Anaheim, California, this morning.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/01/the-math-of-brewing-a-better-espresso/">previously reported</a>, there's an official industry standard for brewing espresso, courtesy of the Specialty Coffee Association, which sets out strict guidelines for its final volume (25–35 mL, or roughly 1 ounce) and preparation. The water must be heated to 92° to 95°C (197° to 203°F) and forced (at a specific pressure) through a bed of 7 to 9 grams (about a quarter of an ounce) of finely ground coffee for 20 to 30 seconds. But most coffee shops don't follow this closely, as the brewing machines allow baristas to configure water pressure, temperature, and other key variables to their liking. The result of all those variations in technique is a great deal of variability in quality and taste.</p>
<p>Naturally, scientists find this fascinating. For instance, in 2020, Christopher Hendon's lab at the University of Oregon <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(19)30410-2">helped devise</a> a mathematical model for brewing the perfect cup of espresso over and over while minimizing waste. Hendon is a computational materials chemist, and his lab holds regular coffee hours for the Eugene campus community. The researchers focused on an easily measurable property known as the extraction yield (EY): the fraction of coffee that dissolves into the final beverage. That, in turn, depends on controlling water flow and pressure as the liquid percolates through the coffee grounds.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-physics-of-brewing-the-perfect-espresso/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Alphabet is spinning out laser-based Internet company Taara from its “moonshot” incubator, hoping to turbocharge the start-up that provides high-bandwidth services to hard-to-reach areas in competition with Elon Musk’s Starlink network of satellites.</p>
<p>Taara is the latest project to spring from X—Alphabet’s experimental hub that produced AI lab Google Brain and Waymo’s self-driving cars—and has its origins in a concept called Loon. That envisaged shooting beams of light between thousands of balloons floating on the edge of space to provide phone and Internet services across remote areas.</p>
<p>Loon was wound up in 2021 due to the political and regulatory hurdles to flying the balloons and the difficulty of servicing the 20-mile-high equipment. However, its lasers found a second life on Taara’s towers under engineer Mahesh Krishnaswamy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/alphabet-spins-off-laser-based-internet-backbone-provider-taara/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Cadillac provided flights from Los Angeles to San Fransisco and accommodation so Ars could drive the Escalade IQ. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO—Newsflash: The new electric Cadillac Escalade IQ weighs over 9,000 lbs, or a fair amount more than 4,000 kilograms. For context, that figure works out to almost exactly half again as much as the 682 hp (509 kW) Escalade V that comes equipped with a barking-mad 6.2 L supercharged V8. Yet the latest and supposedly greatest from Cadillac needed to weigh so very much to achieve a class-leading range target of 460 miles (740 km), thanks to a 205 kWh battery pack.</p>
<p>The Escalade IQ shares a modular General Motors (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/general-motors-is-ditching-ultium-branding-for-its-ev-batteries/">formerly Ultium</a>) chassis and battery pack with the gargantuan <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/driving-the-biggest-least-efficient-electric-car-the-hummer-ev-suv/">Hummer EV</a>, and even more hardware with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-chevrolet-silverado-evs-great-range-comes-at-a-high-cost/">Silverado</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/the-2025-gmc-sierra-ev-denali-brings-big-power-at-a-bigger-cost/">Sierra</a> pickup truck siblings. As opposed to trying to attract rugged work truck and off-roading cred, though, for Cadillac that kind of range figure seemed necessary to appeal to a "no compromise" lifestyle that Escalade buyers might well expect while considering a switch to fully electric power.</p>
<p>And the new IQ certainly puts down plenty of instantaneously available grunt, and despite its mass, it can punch out a 0–60 time in under five seconds with the Velocity Max button pushed, thanks to dual motors rated at 750 hp (560 kW) and 786 lb-ft (1,065 Nm).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-cadillac-escalade-iq-first-drive-460-miles-on-a-single-charge/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Back when EV enthusiasm was higher, there were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/ford-f-150-lightnings-will-soon-offer-home-ac-power-possibly-cheaper-than-grid/">fits</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/gm-adds-the-ability-to-power-your-house-from-one-of-its-new-evs/">starts</a> of vehicle-to-home concepts and products. If EVs and their ginormous batteries are expensive, resource-intensive purchases, the thinking went, maybe we should get something more out of them than just groceries and school pick-ups. Maybe we could find other things for that huge battery to do during <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/03/10/its-true-the-typical-car-is-parked-95-percent-of-the-time">the 95 percent of time it spends parked</a> in or near our homes.</p>
<p>An EV powering your whole home, or even pushing power back to the grid, is something higher-end EVs might do at some point with some utilities. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/superchargers-are-the-reliable-fast-charging-backup-my-chevy-bolt-always-needed">I have a Chevy Bolt</a>, an EV that does not have even a three-prong 110 V plug on it, let alone power-your-home potential. If I wanted to keep the essentials running during an outage, it seemed like I needed to buy a fuel-based generator—or one of those <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-portable-power-stations/">big portable power stations</a>.</p>
<p>Or so I thought, until I came across inverter kits. Inverters take the direct current available from your vehicle's 12V battery—the lead-acid brick inside almost every car—and turns it into alternating current suitable for standard plugs. Inverters designed for car batteries have been around a long time, opening up both novel and emergency uses. The catch is that you have to start the car's gas engine often enough to keep the battery charged.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/old-bolt-new-tricks-making-an-ev-into-a-backup-power-station-with-an-inverter/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Open source software used by more than 23,000 organizations, some of them in large enterprises, was compromised with credential-stealing code after attackers gained unauthorized access to a maintainer account, in the latest open source supply-chain attack to roil the Internet.</p>
<p>The corrupted package, <a href="https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/">tj-actions/changed-files</a>, is part of <a href="https://github.com/tj-actions">tj-actions</a>, a collection of files that's used by more than 23,000 organizations. Tj-actions is one of many <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions">GitHub Actions</a>, a form of platform for streamlining software available on the open source developer platform. Actions are a core means of implementing what's known as <a href="https://github.com/resources/articles/devops/ci-cd">CI/CD</a>, short for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery).</p>
<h2>Scraping server memory at scale</h2>
<p>On Friday or earlier, the source code for all versions of tj-actions/changed-files received unauthorized updates that changed the "tags" developers use to reference specific code versions. The tags pointed to a publicly available file that copies the internal memory of severs running it, searches for credentials, and writes them to a log. In the aftermath, many publicly accessible repositories running tj-actions ended up displaying their most sensitive credentials in logs anyone could view.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/03/supply-chain-attack-exposing-credentials-affects-23k-users-of-tj-actions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Anthony and Joe Russo's new sci-fi adventure film, <em>The Electric State</em>, is adapted from the graphic novel by Swedish artist/designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_St%C3%A5lenhag">Simon Stålenhag</a>. So naturally the directors wanted to create their own distinctive look and tone—complete with a colorful array of quirky misfit robots who team up with their human counterparts to take down an evil corporation.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p><em>The Electric State</em> is Stålenhag's third book, published in 2018. Like much of work, it's set in a dystopian, ravaged landscape: a reimagined America in an alternate 1990s where a war between robots and humans has devastated the country. Paragraphs of text, accompanied by larger artworks, tell the story of a teen girl named Michelle (Milly Bobby Brown) who must travel across the country with her robot companion, Cosmo (Alan Tudyk), to find her long-lost genius brother, Christopher (Woody Norman), while being pursued by a federal agent (Giancarlo Esposito).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/behind-the-scenes-of-the-electric-state/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Biohybrid robots work by combining biological components like muscles, plant material, and even fungi with non-biological materials. While we are pretty good at making the non-biological parts work, we’ve always had a problem with keeping the organic components alive and well. This is why machines driven by biological muscles have always been rather small and simple—up to a couple centimeters long and typically with only a single actuating joint.</p>
<p>“Scaling up biohybrid robots has been difficult due to the weak contractile force of lab-grown muscles, the risk of necrosis in thick muscle tissues, and the challenge of integrating biological actuators with artificial structures,” says Shoji Takeuchi, a professor at the Tokyo University, Japan. Takeuchi led a research team that built a full-size, 18 centimeter-long biohybrid human-like hand with all five fingers driven by lab-grown human muscles.</p>
<h2>Keeping the muscles alive</h2>
<p>Out of all the roadblocks that keep us from building large-scale biohybrid robots, necrosis has probably been the most difficult to overcome. Growing muscles in a lab usually means a liquid medium to supply nutrients and oxygen to muscle cells seeded on petri dishes or applied to gel scaffoldings. Since these cultured muscles are small and ideally flat, nutrients and oxygen from the medium can easily reach every cell in the growing culture.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/a-biohybrid-robotic-hand-built-using-real-human-muscle-cells/">Read full article</a></p>

Now we're back in the saddle for season three—along with insights, jokes, and the occasional wild theory.</p>
<p>These recaps won't cover every element of every episode, but they will contain major spoilers for the show and the book series. We'll do our best to not spoil major future events from the books, but there's always the danger that something might slip out. <strong>If you want to stay completely unspoiled and haven't read the books, these recaps aren't for you</strong>.</p>

<p>Most of the residents had never heard of <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/technology/2021/the-dazzling-history-solar-power">solar power</a> either. When, in 2021, a renewable-energy company proposed installing a solar “mini-grid” in their community, the villagers scoffed at the idea of the sun powering their homes. “We didn’t imagine that something [like this] can exist,” says Solomon Andrew Obot, a resident in his early 30s.</p>
<p>The small installation of solar panels, batteries and transmission lines proposed by the company Prado Power would service 180 households in Mbiabet Esieyere and Mbiabet Udouba, giving them significantly more reliable electricity for a fraction of the cost of diesel generators. Village leaders agreed to the installation, though many residents remained skeptical. But when the panels were set up in 2022, lights blinked on in the brightly painted two-room homes and tan mud huts dotted sparsely through the community. At a village meeting in September, locals erupted into laughter as they recalled walking from house to house, turning on lights and plugging in phone chargers. “I [was] shocked,” Andrew Obot says.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/for-climate-and-livelihoods-africa-bets-big-on-solar-mini-grids/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ideally, you'd expect any Super NES console—if properly maintained—to operate identically to any other Super NES unit ever made (in the same region, at least). Given the same base ROM file and the same set of precisely timed inputs, all those consoles should hopefully give the same gameplay output across individual hardware and across time.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tas.bot/wiki/Main_Page">TASBot community</a> relies on this kind of solid-state predictability when creating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/how-a-game-playing-robot-coded-super-mario-maker-onto-an-snes-live-on-stage/">tool-assisted speedruns</a> that can be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/inside-tasbots-semi-secret-probably-legal-effort-to-control-the-nintendo-switch/">executed</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/how-a-robot-got-super-mario-64-and-portal-running-on-an-snes/">robotic precision</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/how-to-beat-super-mario-bros-3-in-less-than-a-second/">actual console hardware</a>. But on the SNES in particular, the team has largely struggled to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/">emulated speedruns</a> to sync up with demonstrated results on real consoles.</p>
<p>After significant research and testing on dozens of actual SNES units, the TASBot team now thinks that a cheap ceramic resonator used in the system's Audio Processing Unit (APU) is to blame for much of this inconsistency. While <a href="https://snes.nesdev.org/wiki/SNES_Development_Manual">Nintendo's own documentation</a> says the APU should run at a consistent rate of 24.576 Mhz (and the associated Digital Signal Processor sample rate at a flat 32,000 Hz), in practice, that rate can vary just a bit based on heat, system age, and minor physical variations that develop in different console units over time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/this-small-snes-timing-issue-is-causing-big-speedrun-problems/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Falcon 9 rocket launched four astronauts safely into orbit on Friday evening, marking the official beginning of the Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Although any crew launch into orbit is notable, this mission comes with an added bit of importance as its success clears the way for two NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to finally return home from space after a saga spanning nine months.</p>
<p>Friday's launch came two days after an initial attempt was scrubbed on Wednesday evening. This was due to a hydraulic issue with the ground systems that handle the Falcon 9 rocket at Launch Complex 39A in Florida.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/crew-10-launches-finally-clearing-the-way-for-butch-and-suni-to-fly-home/">Read full article</a></p>
