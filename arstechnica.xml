              <![CDATA[<p>Get ready to transform and roll out, Arsians: It's Prime Day! Named in honor of famous Autobot leader Optimus Prime, Prime Day is the international day of celebration where we—wait, they're telling me that Prime Day is in fact <em>not</em> named after famous Autobot leader Optimus Prime and is in fact <em>not</em> an international day of celebration. Well, if that's the case, then what the hell am I going to do with this gigantic Optimus Prime costume I spent all week making? I've got a whole list of Optimus Prime-related activities we were going to do! I brought craft supplies! We were going to make little macrame trucks!</p>
<p>This has really taken the wind out of my sails, ugh. While I figure out what to do with an overwhelming amount of Transformers party supplies, maybe you folks can pull up your chairs, pull out your wallets, and peruse the Amazon Prime Day deals below (which are, I am assured, the best deals the commerce team could sniff out). Because if we can't celebrate Prime Day by cosplaying as our favorite Transformers characters, maybe we can still hold onto the spirit of the day by buying a whole bunch of stuff on sale! Retail therapy for everyone! It's what Optimus would have wanted!</p>
<p>(A note on pricing: We've confirmed the prices on all the items below are accurate as of the publication time of this article. However, much like Megatron's evil schemes, Prime Day pricing is mutable and constantly changing. Make sure to verify the price on what you want to buy before you buy it!)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-prime-day-2024-techstravaganza-the-best-deals-on-the-best-things/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, Egyptian archaeologists discovered what they thought were the ruins of an ancient Egyptian temple dating back to the sixth century BCE. Subsequent finds at the site indicate that the structure was actually an astronomical observatory, deemed the first and largest such structure yet found, <a href="https://mota.gov.eg/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-2/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%84%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B3-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%83%D9%81%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AE/">according to</a> Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.</p>
<p>The L-shaped structure was found within a larger complex called the Temple of Buto (a later Greek name), known to the ancient Egyptians as Per-Wadjet and located east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta. It's now called Tell El Fara'in ("Hill of the Pharaohs"). Buto was once a sacred site dedicated to the goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadjet">Wadjet</a>, believed to be the matron and protector of lower Egypt, who took on a cobra form. Buto was well-known for its temple and the oracle of Wadjet, with an annual festival held there in her honor.</p>
<p>There were archaeological excavations of the site in the 1960s and 1980s, revealing a palace dating back to the Second Dynasty, as well as six Greek bathhouses. An Egyptian team began fresh excavations a few years ago. In 2022, they uncovered a hall at the southwestern end of the temple, with the remains of three papyrus-shaped columns aligned on a north-south axis. They also found  engraved stone fragments and a limestone painting of a bird's head wearing a white crown within two feathers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/archaeologists-found-an-ancient-egyptian-observatory/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Review: new expansion adds to an already vastly improved game. ]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When we reviewed <em>Diablo IV</em>, the latest installment in the long-running action roleplaying game series last year, we said it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/diablo-4-review-off-to-a-hell-of-a-good-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off to a hell of a good start</a>. But ARPGs live and die by their endgame loops, and it was far too early at the time to accurately assess the game’s true staying power.</p>
<p>Sadly, after that confident first step, like so many loot-hunting games before it, <em>Diablo IV</em> fell flat on its face. I’ve seen plenty of boneheaded updates to live-service games, but <em>Diablo IV</em>’s first major patch, released a couple of months after the game’s release, was still pretty shocking. By that point, a consensus had emerged that the endgame was a bit barren, and getting to the game’s level cap of 100 was a tedious slog. But that’s the great thing about live-service games, right? Tweak some numbers, throw in a couple of fun high-level activities, and, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2PlqXw03Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baby, you’ve got a stew going</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the game’s developers at Blizzard had other plans. The patch notes for that first update read like someone had systematically gone through the game and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801426/diablo-4s-season-1-patch-1-1-nerfs-community-reaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed anything that could be considered fun</a>. Almost every character build had been mercilessly nerfed, and worst of all, the game became even slower. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1534z13/patch_11_is_essentially_a_slowdown_to_every/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fans were incensed</a>, and <em>Diablo IV</em> floundered like this for its first three <a href="https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Season_(Diablo_IV)">seasons</a>. I mostly lost interest.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/diablo-iv-is-in-a-great-place-whether-you-buy-vessel-of-hatred-or-not/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Chinese government hackers penetrated the networks of several large US-based Internet service providers and may have gained access to systems used for court-authorized wiretaps of communications networks, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b">reported Saturday</a>. "People familiar with the matter" told the WSJ that hackers breached the networks of companies including Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Lumen (also known as CenturyLink).</p>
<p>"A cyberattack tied to the Chinese government penetrated the networks of a swath of US broadband providers, potentially accessing information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized network wiretapping requests," the WSJ wrote. "For months or longer, the hackers might have held access to network infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful US requests for communications data, according to people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>These "attackers also had access to other tranches of more generic Internet traffic," according to the WSJ's sources. The attack is being attributed to a Chinese hacking group called Salt Typhoon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/reports-china-hacked-verizon-and-att-may-have-accessed-us-wiretap-systems/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, a NASA spacecraft smashed into a small asteroid millions of miles from Earth to test a technique that could one day prove useful to deflect an object off a collision course with Earth. The European Space Agency launched a follow-up mission Monday to go back to the crash site and see the damage done.</p>
<p>The nearly $400 million (363 million euro) Hera mission, named for the Greek goddess of marriage, will investigate the aftermath of a cosmic collision between NASA's DART spacecraft and the skyscraper-size asteroid Dimorphos on September 26, 2022. NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission was the first planetary defense experiment, and it worked, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/dart-mission-successfully-shifted-its-targets-orbit/">successfully nudging Dimorphos off its regular orbit</a> around a larger companion asteroid named Didymos.</p>
<p>But NASA had to sacrifice the DART spacecraft in the deflection experiment. Its destruction meant there were no detailed images of the condition of the target asteroid after the impact. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/analyzing-images-from-a-close-flyby-of-darts-asteroid-impact/">small Italian CubeSat deployed by DART</a> as it approached Dimorphos captured fuzzy long-range views of the collision, but Hera will perform a comprehensive survey when it arrives in late 2026.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/european-mission-departs-earth-to-investigate-an-asteroid-wrecked-by-nasa/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <em>Alien </em>franchise is about uncaring monsters, unfeeling corporations, and horrific, claustrophobic terror. Given this setting, it almost made sense, what happened to the original <em>Alien: Isolation</em>.</p>
<p>The game was released to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">positive reviews</a>, is now considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best#2014">one of the best games ever made</a>, and sold more than 2 million copies within its first few months. Despite this, <em>Isolation</em> only got "close to break-even or just about in the black," then-Creative Assembly studio director Tim Heaton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/web/20170427202334/http://go.skimresources.com/?id=87431X1540261&amp;site=eurogamer.net&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesindustry.biz%2Farticles%2F2015-09-30-sega-europe-were-definitely-on-the-right-track&amp;xguid=&amp;xuuid=638630bcdcb174d5fd1afe32be6f2553&amp;xsessid=&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20170427202705%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true&amp;xtz=0">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> a year after release. With the rapid evolution of AAA game development, that wasn't enough. And so, like a salvage team diverted to a bio-weapon recovery mission, <em>Isolation</em> and its momentum were seemingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true">abandoned</a>.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Reliable rumors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/report-big-batch-of-m4-macs-and-cheaper-ipads-on-tap-for-october-apple-event/">have suggested</a> that M4 Macs are right around the corner, and now Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q">forecasting</a> a specific launch date: November 1, following a late-October announcement that mirrors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/new-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-add-m3-chips-plus-a-1599-entry-level-model/">last year's Halloween-themed reveal</a> for the first M3 Macs.</p>
<p>This date could be subject to change, and not all the products announced in October would necessarily launch on November 1—lower-end Macs are more likely to launch early, and higher-end models would be more likely to ship a bit later in the month.</p>
<p>The list of what to expect is the same as it has been for a while: refreshed 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, a new M4 version of the 24-inch iMac, and an M4 update to the Mac mini that leapfrogs the M3 entirely. These will all be the first Macs to get the M4, following its unexpected introduction in the iPad Pro earlier this year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/report-first-wave-of-m4-macs-including-smaller-mac-mini-coming-november-1/">Read full article</a></p>

Refusing to comply, X spent the past year <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1264/311993/20240530144316325_23-xxxx%20-%20X%20Corp.%20v.%20United%20States%20-%20cert.%20petition.pdf">arguing</a> that the gag order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on X's speech and an "end-run" around a record law shielding privileged presidential communications.</p>
<p>Under its so-called free speech absolutist owner Elon Musk, X took this fight all the way to the Supreme Court, only for the nation's highest court to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100724zor_4gdj.pdf">decline</a> to review X's appeal on Monday.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The legal saga over Martin Shkreli's infamous 5,000 percent price hike of a life-saving anti-parasitic drug has ended with a flat denial from the highest court in the land.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected Shkreli's petition to appeal an order to return $64.6 million in profits from the pricing scheme of Daraprim, a decades-old drug used to treat toxoplasmosis. The condition is caused by a single-celled parasite that can be deadly for newborns and people with compromised immune systems, such as people who have HIV, cancer, or an organ transplant.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors successfully argued in courts that Shkreli orchestrated an illegal anticompetitive scheme that allowed him to dramatically raise the price of Daraprim overnight. When Shkreli and his pharmaceutical company, Vyera (formerly Turing), bought the rights to the drug in 2015, the price of a single pill jumped to $750 after being priced between $13.50 and $17.50 earlier that year. And Shkreli quickly came to epitomize callous greed in the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/scotus-denial-ends-saga-of-shkrelis-infamous-5000-drug-price-scheme/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The companies behind the streaming industry, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/">smart TV</a> and streaming stick manufacturers and streaming service providers, have developed a "surveillance system" that has "long undermined privacy and consumer protection," according to a report from the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) published today and sent to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Unprecedented tracking techniques aimed at pleasing advertisers have resulted in connected TVs (CTVs) being a "privacy nightmare," according to Jeffrey Chester, report co-author and CDD executive director, resulting in calls for stronger regulation.</p>
<p>The 48-page report, <em>How TV Watches Us: Commercial Surveillance in the Streaming Era</em> [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CDD-CTV-Report-Oct24-1.1.pdf">PDF</a>], cites Ars Technica, other news publications, trade publications, blog posts, and statements from big players in streaming—from Amazon to NBCUniversal and Tubi, to LG, Samsung, and Vizio. It provides a detailed overview of the various ways that streaming services and streaming hardware target viewers in newfound ways that the CDD argues pose severe privacy risks. The nonprofit composed the report as part of efforts to encourage regulation. Today, the CDD sent letters to the FTC [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FTCCHairKhanletter10724Final.pdf">PDF</a>], Federal Communications Commission (FCC), California attorney general [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CAAGletter10724Final.pdf">PDF</a>], and California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CCPAletter10724Final.pdf">PDF</a>], regarding its concerns.</p>
<p>"Not only does CTV operate in ways that are unfair to consumers, it is also putting them and their families at risk as it gathers and uses sensitive data about health, children, race, and political interests,” Chester said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/streaming-industry-has-unprecedented-surveillance-manipulation-capabilities/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the Nobel Committee announced that two US researchers, Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun, will <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2024/summary/">receive the prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for their discovery of a previously unknown mechanism for controlling the activity of genes. They discovered the first of what is now known to be a large collection of MicroRNAs, short (21-23 bases long) RNAs that bind to and alter the behavior of protein-coding RNAs. While first discovered in a roundworm, they've since been discovered to play key roles in the development of most complex life.</p>
<p>The story behind the discovery is typical of a lot of the progress in the biological sciences: genetics helps identify a gene important for the development of one species, and then evolutionary conservation reveals its widespread significance.</p>
<h2>In the worm</h2>
<p>Ambros and Ruvkun started on the path to discovery while post-doctoral fellows in the lab of earlier Nobel winner Robert Horvitz, who won for his role in developing the roundworm <em>C. elegans</em> as an experimental genetic organism. As part of the early genetic screens, people had identified a variety of mutations that caused developmental problems for specific lineages of cells. These <em>lin</em> mutations included <em>lin-4</em>, which Ambros was characterizing. It lacked a number of specialized cell types, as well as the physical structures that depended on them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/medicine-nobel-goes-to-previously-unknown-way-of-controlling-genes/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In less than a day, Hurricane Milton has rapidly intensified over the southern Gulf of Mexico, exploding from a small Category 1 hurricane into a Category 5 storm. Unfortunately, the hurricane is likely to strengthen further as it tracks eastward toward Florida.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center reported that Milton had reached sustained winds of 160 mph as of 11:44 pm ET on Monday, with a central pressure of 925 millibars. The storm is moving steadily eastward and is likely to reach the west coast of Florida on Wednesday evening as a major hurricane.</p>
<p>Based upon Atlantic basin records, Milton has tied Hurricane Maria (2017) for the second-fastest intensification from a Category 1 to Category 5 hurricane, taking just 18 hours. Only Hurricane Wilma (2005) did so more rapidly, in just 12 hours.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/hurricane-milton-becomes-second-fastest-storm-to-reach-category-5-status/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Dogplayingtetris blasts past 3,300-line rollover in two-hour, 29M-point endurance test.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Months ago, 13-year-old Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/someone-has-finally-beaten-nes-tetris/">became the first person to "beat" NES <em>Tetris</em></a>, crashing the game after a 1,511-line, 157-level performance. Over the weekend, 16-year-old Michael "dogplayingtetris" Artiaga became the first to reach an even more impressive plateau in the game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhbti5SneE%22">looping past Level 255</a> and instantly rolling the game all the way back to the ultra-slow Level 0.</p>
<p>It took Artiaga a bit over 80 minutes and a full 3,300 cleared lines to finally achieve the game's first near-mythical "rebirth" <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2268738212">live in front of hundreds of Twitch viewers</a>. And after a bit of celebration and recovery on the low levels, Artiaga managed to keep his rolled-over game going for another 40 minutes, finally topping out after a total of 4,216 lines and a record 29.4 million points.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXhbti5SneE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div><div class="caption mt-1 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-lg leading-tight text-gray-300">
    <div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"></div>
    <div class="caption-content">
      Artiaga's record-setting game starts a few minutes in, while the "rebirth" rollover happens at 1:21:24.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Artiaga's record does come with a small asterisk since he used a version of the game that was modified to avoid the crashes that stopped Blue Scuti's historic run. Still, NES <em>Tetris</em>' first-ever level rollover is a monumental achievement and a testament to just how far competitive classic <em>Tetris</em> has come in a short time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nes-tetris-first-ever-rebirth-loops-past-level-255-and-back-to-zero/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In Granbury, Texas, residents can hear the sound of money being made at all hours of the day, but it’s not making them rich. Instead, neighbors in the town southwest of Fort Worth say that the persistent low hum emanating from the Bitcoin mine operated by Marathon Digital has caused them stress, loss of sleep, and other unexplained ailments.</p>
<p>They filed a lawsuit in Texas state court Friday in Hood County alleging that the noise from the Bitcoin mine creates a nuisance that has ruined their quality of life. The environmental law group Earthjustice is representing a group of neighbors organized under the name Citizens Concerned About Wolf Hollow. The suit is seeking a permanent injunction to stop operation of the facility unless it can operate without producing disruptive noise.</p>
<p>The 300 megawatt Marathon Digital facility is located alongside a gas-fired power plant called Wolf Hollow II. Residents recently <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12092024/texas-bitcoin-mining-power-plant-expansion-backlash/">spoke out against a proposed expansion</a> to upgrade the natural gas facility currently providing electricity for Bitcoin mining and releasing up to 760,000 tons of additional carbon dioxide per year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/neighbors-sue-over-loud-bitcoin-mine/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>But since then, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed rapidly, and a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01564-5">study</a> shows that mosses, along with some lichen, liverworts and associated algae, have colonized more than 4.6 square miles, an area nearly four times the size of New York’s Central Park.</p>
<p>The findings, published Friday in Nature Geoscience, based on a meticulous analysis of Landsat images from 1986 to 2021, show that the greening trend is distinct from natural variability and that it has accelerated by 30 percent since 2016, fast enough to cover nearly 75 football fields per year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/greening-of-antartica-shows-how-climate-change-affects-the-frozen-continent/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Dozens of neo-Nazis are fleeing Telegram and moving to a relatively unknown secret chat app that has received funding from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>In a report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/neo-nazi-accelerationists-seek-new-digital-refuge-amid-looming-telegram-crackdown">published on Friday morning</a>, researchers found that in the wake of the arrest of Telegram founder <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pavel-durov-defends-telegram-privacy-changes/">Pavel Durov</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/terrorgram-collective-indictments/">charges against leaders of the so-called Terrorgram Collective</a>, dozens of extremist groups have moved to the app SimpleX Chat in recent weeks over fears that Telegram’s privacy policies expose them to being arrested. The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/terrorgram-collective-indictments/">Terrorgram Collective</a> is a neo-Nazi propaganda network that calls for acolytes to target government officials, attack power stations, and murder people of color.</p>

While ISD stopped short of naming SimpleX in its report, the researchers point out that the app promotes itself as “having a different burner email or phone for each contact, and no hassle to manage them.” This is exactly how SimpleX refers to itself <a href="https://simplex.chat/">on its website</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/neo-nazis-head-to-encrypted-simplex-chat-app-bail-on-telegram/">Read full article</a></p>
