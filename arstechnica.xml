<p>A computer controlling the Atlas V rocket's countdown triggered an automatic hold less than four minutes prior to liftoff of Boeing's commercial Starliner spacecraft Saturday, keeping the crew test flight on the ground at least a few more days.</p>
<p>NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already aboard the spacecraft when the countdown stopped due to a problem with a ground computer. "Hold. Hold. Hold," a member of Atlas V launch team called out on an audio feed.</p>
<p>With the hold, the mission missed an instantaneous launch opportunity at 12:25 pm EDT (16:25 UTC), and later Saturday, NASA announced teams will forego a launch opportunity Sunday. The next chance to send Starliner into orbit will be 10:52 am EDT (14:52 UTC) Wednesday. The mission has one launch opportunity every one-to-two days, when the International Space Station's orbital track moves back into proper alignment with the Atlas V rocket's launch pad in Florida.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028368#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028368&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Friday night the dearMoon project—a plan to launch a Japanese billionaire and 10 other 'crew members' on a circumlunar flight aboard SpaceX's Starship vehicle—was abruptly canceled.</p>
<p>"It is unfortunate to be announcing that 'dearMoon', the first private circumlunar flight project, will be cancelled," the mission's official account on the social media site X <a href="https://x.com/dearmoonproject/status/1796759847817625933">said</a>. "We thank everyone who has supported us and apologize to those who have looked forward to this project."</p>
<p>Shortly afterward the financial backer of the project and its 'crew leader,' Yusaku Maezawa, explained this decision on X. When Maezawa agreed to the mission in 2018, he said, the assumption was that the dearMoon mission would launch by the end of 2023.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028351#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028351&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Hyundai provided accommodation in Monterey, California, so Ars could drive the Elantra N. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Few cars are aimed quite at driving enthusiasts like the wholesome sport compact. In terms of everyday usability and fun factor, little can touch them, and luckily, there's still a good variety of them on the new market. Among the best is the Hyundai Elantra N, which, for the 2024 model year, received a styling and chassis refresh. Pricing starts at $33,245 for three pedals and a manual gearbox, or $35,515 for a dual-clutch eight-speed, and either is a massive value for the performance and fun factor that they offer.</p>
<h2>Amply sporty styling, plenty spacious</h2>
<p>The 2024 Elantra N's biggest change is in its face. Where previously it had beady eyes surrounded in a sea of black trim—kind of like the vehicular equivalent of a Belgian Malinois—its headlight, grille, and intake are now more geometric. Looks are subjective, but I'm a fan of the headlights, and the functional inlets improve radiator and brake cooling over the previous fascia.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it's pretty much the same angular four-door wearing some trapezoidal accents across its body panels and a pronounced rear spoiler. A new set of forged 19-inch wheels is wrapped in 245/35/19 Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires—these also shave off 8.25 lbs (3.75 kg) of unsprung weight at each corner, which bodes well for acceleration and handling.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028060#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028060&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fritz Haber: good guy or bad guy? He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his part in developing the Haber-Bosch process, a method for generating ammonia using the nitrogen gas in air. The technique freed agriculture from the constraint of needing to source guano or manure for nitrogen fertilizer and is widely credited for saving millions from starvation. About half of the world’s current food supply relies on fertilizers made using it, and about half of the nitrogen atoms in our bodies can be traced back to it.</p>
<p>But it also allowed farmers to use this newly abundant synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with abandon. This has accentuated agriculture’s role as a significant contributor to global warming because the emissions that result from these fertilizers is a greenhouse gas—one that has a warming potential almost 300 times greater than that of carbon dioxide and remains in the atmosphere for 100 years. Microbes in soil convert nitrogen fertilizer into nitrous oxide, and the more nitrogen fertilizer they have to work with, the more nitrous oxide they make.</p>

<p>Agriculture also leaks plenty of the excess nitrogen into waterways in the form of nitrate, generating algal blooms that create low-oxygen ‘dead zones’ where no marine life can live.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028024#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028024&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The safety and efficacy data on the use of MDMA (aka ecstasy) for post-traumatic stress disorder therapy is "challenging to interpret," the Food and Drug Administration said in <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/178984/download">a briefing document</a> posted Friday. The agency noted significant flaws in the design of the underlying clinical trials as well as safety concerns for the drug, particularly cardiovascular harms.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, June 4, the FDA will <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/updated-meeting-time-and-public-participation-information-june-4-2024-meeting-psychopharmacologic#event-materials">convene an advisory committee</a> that will review the evidence and vote on MDMA's efficacy and whether its benefits outweigh its risks. The FDA does not have to follow the committee's recommendations, but it often does. If the FDA subsequently approves MDMA as part of treatment for PTSD, it would mark a significant shift in the federal government's stance on MDMA, as well as psychedelics, generally. Currently, the US Drug Enforcement Administration considers MDMA a Schedule I drug, defined as one with "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." It would also offer a new treatment option for patients with PTSD, a disabling psychiatric condition with few treatment options currently.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/mdma-aka-ecstasy-submitted-to-fda-as-part-of-ptsd-therapy/">As Ars has reported previously</a>, the submission of MDMA for approval is based on two clinical trials. The first trial, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3">published in Nature Medicine in 2021</a>, involved 90 participants with moderate PTSD and found that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy significantly improved Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) scores compared with participants who were given psychotherapy along with a placebo. In the second study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02565-4?">published in September in Nature Medicine</a>, the finding held up among 104 participants with moderate or severe PTSD (73 percent had severe PTSD).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028335#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028335&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Shortly after World War II, a French manufacturer by the name of Solex started selling mopeds. These were not your "typical" moped that looks kind of like a motorcycle with pedals—the <a href="https://france-amerique.com/solex-half-bike-half-moped/">mopeds made by Solex</a> were essentially bicycles with a small, two-stroke engine mounted over the front wheel that could propel the rider around 100 km on a single liter of gas mixture. The downside: Solex mopeds were loud and cumbersome to ride due to the weight distribution, and they never really caught on in North America.</p>
<p><a href="https://clip.bike">Clip</a>, a startup based in Brooklyn, New York, has come up with its own twist on the Solex. Its only product, the eponymously named Clip, is a friction drive unit that attaches to the front fork of any bicycle, turning it into an e-bike. At $499 for the Commuter model and $599 for the Explorer, it is a relatively inexpensive way to turn just about any bicycle into an e-bike for a fraction of the cost of a new one.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/clip-closeup.jpg"><img alt="The Clip mounts to the front fork just below the brake caliper.

<p>Weighing in at 8.8 lb (4 kg) for the Commuter model (the Explorer is a pound heavier), the Clip is at its essence a portable friction-drive. There's a detachable controller that mounts on the handlebar and the unit itself. The Explorer model, the one we reviewed, has a 192 Wh battery that takes an hour to fully charge. Its range is pegged at "up to 12 miles," a claim that is pretty accurate based on our testing, and the top speed is 15 mph. The Commuter model offers half the battery capacity, charge time, and range.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028235#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028235&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/29/atlantic-vox-media-openai-licensing-deal">broke the news</a> that OpenAI had signed deals with The Atlantic and Vox Media that will allow the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> maker to license their editorial content to further train its language models. But some of the publications' writers—and the unions that represent them—were surprised by the announcements and aren't happy about it. Already, two unions have released statements expressing "alarm" and "concern."</p>

<p>"The unionized members of The Atlantic Editorial and Business and Technology units are deeply troubled by the opaque agreement The Atlantic has made with OpenAI," reads a <a href="https://www.nyguild.org/front-page-details/statement-the-atlantic-union-alarmed-demands-answers-after-licensing-product-deal-with-openai">statement</a> from the Atlantic union. "And especially by management's complete lack of transparency about what the agreement entails and how it will affect our work."</p>
<p>The Vox Union—which represents The Verge, SB Nation, and Vulture, among other publications—reacted in similar fashion, writing in a statement, "Today, members of the Vox Media Union ... were informed without warning that Vox Media entered into a 'strategic content and product partnership' with OpenAI. As both journalists and workers, we have serious concerns about this partnership, which we believe could adversely impact members of our union, not to mention the well-documented ethical and environmental concerns surrounding the use of generative AI."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028010#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028010&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In a technical disclosure published this month, HP explored a Micro LED monitor concept that would enable consumers to easily use various multi-monitor configurations through the use of "Lego-like building blocks." HP has no immediate plans to make what it has called "composable Micro LED monitors," but its discussion explores a potential way to simplify multitasking with numerous displays.</p>
<p>HP's paper [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Composable-MicroLED-monitors.pdf">PDF</a>], written by HP scientists and technical architects, discusses a theoretical monitor that supports the easy addition of more flat or curved screens on its left, right, or bottom sides (the authors noted that top extensions could also be possible but they were "trying to keep the number of configurations manageable"). The setup would use one 12×12-inch "core" monitor that has a cable to the connected system. The computer's operating system (OS) would be able to view the display setup as one, two, or multiple monitors, and physical switches would let users quickly disable displays.</p>
  <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">
          <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7b.jpg" alt=""></div>
          <p>
            The illustration shows a monitor made of a core unit and two extension panels viewed as three monitors (left), two monitors (middle), and two monitors with different orientations (right).                          [credit:
                              <a href="https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/7031/">HP/Technical Disclosure Commons</a>

                      </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<h2>Not a real product</h2>
<p>HP's paper is only a technical disclosure, which companies often publish in order to support potential patent filings. So it's possible that we'll never see HP release "composable Micro LED monitors" as described. An HP spokesperson told me:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028012#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028012&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, Google capped off a rough week of providing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">inaccurate and sometimes dangerous</a> answers through its experimental AI Overview feature by authoring a follow-up <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/">blog post</a> titled, "AI Overviews: About last week." In the post, attributed to Google VP Liz Reid, head of Google Search, the firm formally acknowledged issues with the feature and outlined steps taken to improve a system that appears flawed by design, even if it doesn't realize it is admitting it.</p>

<p>To recap, the AI Overview feature—which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">the company showed off</a> at Google I/O a few weeks ago—aims to provide search users with summarized answers to questions by using an AI model integrated with Google's web ranking systems. Right now, it's an experimental feature that is not active for everyone, but when a participating user searches for a topic, they might see an AI-generated answer at the top of the results, pulled from highly ranked web content and summarized by an AI model.</p>
<p>While Google claims this approach is "highly effective" and on par with its <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/featured-snippets">Featured Snippets</a> in terms of accuracy, the past week has seen numerous examples of the AI system generating bizarre, incorrect, or even potentially harmful responses, as we detailed in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">recent feature</a> where Ars reporter Kyle Orland replicated many of the unusual outputs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027953#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027953&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TikTok is now disputing a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tiktok-preparing-us-copy-apps-core-algorithm-sources-say-2024-05-30">report</a> that claims the short-video app is cloning its algorithm to potentially offer a different version of the app, which might degrade over time, just for US users.</p>
<p>Sources "with direct knowledge" of the project—granted anonymity because they're not authorized to discuss it publicly—told Reuters that the TikTok effort began late last year. They said that the project will likely take a year to complete, requiring hundreds of engineers to separate millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>As these sources reported, TikTok's tremendous undertaking could potentially help prepare its China-based owner ByteDance to appease US lawmakers who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-if-chinese-owner-bytedance-doesnt-sell/">passed a law in April</a> forcing TikTok to sell its US-based operations by January 19 or face a ban. But TikTok has maintained that the "qualified divestiture" required by the law would be impossible, and on Thursday, TikTok denied the accuracy of Reuters' report while reiterating its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/bytedance-unlikely-to-sell-tiktok-as-former-trump-official-plots-purchase/">stance that a sale is not in the cards</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028059#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028059&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google Chrome will be shutting down its older, more capable extension system, Manifest V2, in favor of exclusively using the more limited Manifest V3. The deeply controversial Manifest V3 system was announced in 2019, and the full switch has been delayed a million times, but now Google says it's really going to make the transition: As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/">previously announced</a>, the phase-out of older Chrome extensions is starting next week.</p>
<p>Google Chrome has been working toward a plan for a new, more limited extension system for a while now. Google says it created "Manifest V3" extensions with the goal of "improving the security, privacy, performance, and trustworthiness of the extension ecosystem."</p>
<p>Other groups don't agree with Google's description, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which called Manifest V3 "<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">deceitful and threatening</a>" back when it was first announced in 2019, saying the new system "will restrict the capabilities of web extensions—especially those that are designed to monitor, modify, and compute alongside the conversation your browser has with the websites you visit." It has <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">a whole article out</a> detailing how Manifest V3 won't help security.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028009#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028009&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has added a critical security bug in Linux to its list of vulnerabilities known to be actively exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-1086 and carrying a severity rating of 7.8 out of a possible 10, allows people who have already gained a foothold inside an affected system to escalate their system privileges. It’s the result of a use-after-free error, a class of vulnerability that occurs in software written in the C and C++ languages when a process continues to access a memory location after it has been freed or deallocated. Use-after-free vulnerabilities can result in remote code or privilege escalation.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, which affects Linux kernel versions 5.14 through 6.6, resides in the NF_tables, a kernel component enabling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter">Netfilter</a>, which in turn facilitates a variety of network operations, including packet filtering, network address [and port] translation (NA[P]T), packet logging, userspace packet queueing, and other packet mangling. It was patched in January, but as the CISA advisory indicates, some production systems have yet to install it. At the time this Ars post went live, there were no known details about the active exploitation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028017#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028017&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Almost 1,500 genes have been implicated in intellectual disabilities; yet for most people with such disabilities, genetic causes remain unknown. Perhaps this is in part because geneticists have been focusing on the wrong stretches of DNA when they go searching. To rectify this, Ernest Turro—a biostatistician who focuses on genetics, genomics, and molecular diagnostics—used whole genome sequencing data from the <a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/initiatives/100000-genomes-project">100,000 Genomes Project</a> to search for areas associated with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>His lab found a genetic association that is the most common one yet to be associated with neurodevelopmental abnormality. And the gene they identified doesn’t even make a protein.</p>
<h2>Trouble with the spliceosome</h2>
<p>Most genes include instructions for how to make proteins. That’s true. And yet human genes are not arranged linearly—or rather, they are arranged linearly, but not contiguously. A gene containing the instructions for which amino acids to string together to make a particular protein—hemoglobin, insulin, serotonin, albumin, estrogen, whatever protein you like—is modular. It contains part of the amino acid sequence, then it has a chunk of DNA that is largely irrelevant to that sequence, then a bit more of the protein’s sequence, then another chunk of random DNA, back and forth until the end of the protein. It’s as if each of these prose paragraphs were separated by a string of unrelated letters (but not a meaningful paragraph from a different article).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028013#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028013&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The New York Times is fighting to take down a game called <a href="https://worldledaily.com/"><em>Worldle</em></a>, according to a legal filing viewed <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrr5ee5zv8o">by the BBC</a>, in which The Times apparently argued that the geography-based game is "creating confusion" by using a name that's way too similar to <em>Wordle</em>.</p>
<p><em>Worldle</em> is "nearly identical in appearance, sound, meaning, and imparts the same commercial impression" to <em>Wordle</em>, The Times claimed.</p>
<p>The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/media/new-york-times-wordle.html">bought <em>Wordle</em> in 2022</a>, paying software developer Josh Wardle seven figures for the daily word-guessing puzzle game after its breakout success during the pandemic. Around the same time, <em>Worldle</em> was created—along with <a href="https://medium.com/floodgates/the-complete-and-authoritative-list-of-wordle-spinoffs-fb00bfafc448">more than 100 other <em>Wordle</em> spinoffs</a> offering niche alternatives to <em>Wordle</em>, including versions in different languages and completely different games simply using the name construction ending in "-le." The Times filed for a <em>Wordle</em> trademark the day after buying the game and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/new-york-times-takes-down-third-party-wordle-archive/">by March 2022, it started sending takedown requests</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027980#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027980&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Jeep brand has finally debuted its first purpose-built electric vehicle. It's targeting the hotly contested SUV segment with the new Wagoneer S, which goes on sale this fall. But other than its name, it shares little with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/2022-wagoneer-rocks-a-high-end-vast-interior-while-guzzling-hydrocarbons/">the gasoline-powered Wagoneer</a>; the Wagoneer S uses the same EV architecture—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/plug-in-jeeps-and-an-ev-ram-1500-pickup-are-part-of-stellantis-new-plan/">called STLA Large</a>—as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/dodge-debuts-the-2024-electric-charger-daytona-with-670-horsepower/">forthcoming electric Dodge Charger</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like Jeep is using a similar playbook to Dodge and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/ram-goes-for-an-oversized-battery-to-give-ev-truck-500-miles-of-range/">Ram</a> as it introduces its electric models: Give them the same name and styling as a familiar bestseller to keep customers comfortable, then give them serious power output and some headline-grabbing numbers to generate a halo effect.</p>
<h2>Powerful</h2>
<p>That's why the Jeep Wagoneer S Launch Edition will offer 600 hp (447 kW), 617 lb-ft (837 Nm), and a 0–60 mph (0-98 km/h) time of 3.4 seconds. It's powered by a 100.5 kWh battery pack with nickel manganese cobalt chemistry operating at 400 V.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027967#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027967&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI has revealed operations linked to Russia, China, Iran and Israel have been using its artificial intelligence tools to create and spread disinformation, as technology becomes a powerful weapon in information warfare in an election-heavy year.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based maker of the ChatGPT chatbot said in a report on Thursday that five covert influence operations had used its AI models to generate text and images at a high volume, with fewer language errors than previously, as well as to generate comments or replies to their own posts. OpenAI’s policies prohibit the use of its models to deceive or mislead others.</p>
<p>The content focused on issues “including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza, the Indian elections, politics in Europe and the United States, and criticisms of the Chinese government by Chinese dissidents and foreign governments,” OpenAI said in the report.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027948#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027948&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>ABU DHABI—We live in a weird time for autonomous vehicles. Ambitions come and go, but genuinely autonomous cars are further off than solid-state vehicle batteries. Part of the problem with developing autonomous cars is that teaching road cars to take risks is unacceptable.</p>
<p>A race track, though, is a decent place to potentially crash a car. You can take risks there, with every brutal crunch becoming a learning exercise. (You’d be hard-pressed to find a top racing driver without a few wrecks smoldering in their junior career records.)</p>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.46 of the Rocket Report! It looks like we will be covering the crew test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft and the fourth test flight of SpaceX's giant Starship rocket over the next week. All of this is happening as SpaceX keeps up its cadence of flying multiple Starlink missions per week. The real stars are the Ars copy editors helping make sure our stories don't use the wrong names.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).
