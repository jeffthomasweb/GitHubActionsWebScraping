<p>It's unclear yet how long SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket will remain grounded as engineers investigate a rare launch failure last week, but the next test flight of the company's next-generation Starship vehicle appears to be on track for liftoff next month.</p>
<p>On Monday, SpaceX test-fired the 33 Raptor engines on the Starship rocket's Super Heavy booster at the company's Starbase facility in South Texas. The methane-fueled engines fired for about eight seconds, long enough for SpaceX engineers to verify all systems functioned normally. At full power, the 33 engines generated nearly 17 million pounds of thrust, twice the power output of NASA's iconic Saturn V Moon rocket.</p>
<p>SpaceX confirmed the static fire test reached its full duration, and teams drained methane and liquid oxygen from the rocket, known as Booster 12 in the company's inventory of ships and boosters. The upper stage for the next Starship test flight, known as Ship 30, completed the static fire of its six Raptor engines in May.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037241#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037241&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple's next-generation operating systems are taking their next step toward release today: Apple is issuing the first public beta builds of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15 Sequoia, tvOS 18, and HomePod Software 18 today. Sign up for <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">Apple's public beta program</a> with your Apple ID, and you'll be able to select the public beta builds from Software Update in the Settings app.</p>
<p>We covered the highlights of most of these releases when they were announced during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/">more home screen customization</a> in iOS and iPadOS, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-announces-macos-15-sequoia/">window tiling and iPhone mirroring in macOS,</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/apple-announces-rcs-support-for-imessage/">RCS text messaging support</a> across all of Apple's platforms, and more. But Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/three-betas-in-ios-18-testers-still-cant-try-out-apple-intelligence-features/">still isn't ready</a> to show off a preview of its Apple Intelligence AI features, including the text and image generation features and a revamped Siri. Many of these features are still slated for "later this summer" and will presumably be available in some form in the final releases this fall.</p>
<p>Most devices that can run iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS 14 Sonoma will be able to update to the new versions, including owners of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-case-for-and-against-macos-15-sequoia-being-the-final-release-for-intel-macs/">the last couple generations of Intel Macs</a>. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/these-are-all-the-devices-compatible-with-ios-18-and-ipados-18/">a handful of older phones and tablets</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/macos-15-sequoia-still-supports-intel-macs-but-cuts-the-2018-macbook-air/">the 2018 MacBook Air</a> are being dropped by the new releases. The watchOS 11 update is also dropping the Series 4 and Series 5 models as well as the first-generation Apple Watch SE.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037128#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037128&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Major record labels sued Verizon on Friday, alleging that the Internet service provider violated copyright law by continuing to serve customers accused of pirating music. Verizon "knowingly provides its high-speed service to a massive community of online pirates," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.624722/gov.uscourts.nysd.624722.1.0.pdf">complaint</a> filed in US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>Universal, Sony, and Warner say they have sent over 340,000 copyright infringement notices to Verizon since early 2020. "Those notices identify specific subscribers on Verizon's network stealing Plaintiffs' sound recordings through peer-to-peer ('P2P') file-sharing networks that are notorious hotbeds for copyright infringement," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Record labels allege that "Verizon ignored Plaintiffs' notices and buried its head in the sand" by "continu[ing] to provide its high-speed service to thousands of known repeat infringers so it could continue to collect millions of dollars from them." They say that "Verizon has knowingly contributed to, and reaped substantial profits from, massive copyright infringement committed by tens of thousands of its subscribers."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037197#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037197&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Researchers have determined that two fake AWS packages downloaded hundreds of times from the open source NPM JavaScript repository contained carefully concealed code that backdoored developers' computers when executed.</p>
<p>The packages—<code>img-aws-s3-object-multipart-copy</code> and <code>legacyaws-s3-object-multipart-copy</code>—were attempts to appear as <a href="https://github.com/little-core-labs/aws-s3-object-multipart-copy">aws-s3-object-multipart-copy</a>, a legitimate JavaScript library for copying files using Amazon’s S3 cloud service. The fake files included all the code found in the legitimate library but added an additional JavaScript file named loadformat.js. That file provided what appeared to be benign code and three JPG images that were processed during package installation. One of those images contained code fragments that, when reconstructed, formed code for backdooring the developer device.</p>
<h2>Growing sophistication</h2>
<p>“We have reported these packages for removal, however the malicious packages remained available on npm for nearly two days,” researchers from Phylum, the security firm that spotted the packages, <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/fake-aws-packages-ship-command-and-control-malware-in-jpeg-files/">wrote</a>. “This is worrying as it implies that most systems are unable to detect and promptly report on these packages, leaving developers vulnerable to attack for longer periods of time.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037194#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037194&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Is space-based solar power a costly, risky pipe dream? Or is it a viable way to combat climate change? Although beaming solar power from space to Earth could ultimately involve transmitting gigawatts, the process could be made surprisingly safe and cost-effective, according to experts from Space Solar, the European Space Agency, and the University of Glasgow.</p>
<p>But we’re going to need to move well beyond <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/headed-to-space-today-test-hardware-for-a-solar-power-plant/">demonstration hardware</a> and solve a number of engineering challenges if we want to develop that potential.</p>
<h2>Designing space-based solar</h2>
<p>Beaming solar energy from space is not new; telecommunications satellites have been sending microwave signals generated by solar power back to Earth since the 1960s. But sending useful amounts of power is a different matter entirely.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037164#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037164&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A federal court on Friday temporarily stayed enforcement of net neutrality regulations but has not decided on the merits of a telecom-industry request to block the rules on a longer-term basis.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-restores-net-neutrality-rules-that-ban-blocking-and-throttling-in-3-2-vote/">revived net neutrality rules</a> were <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-governmental-affairs/fcc-announces-effective-date-net-neutrality-order">scheduled</a> to take effect on July 22. But the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit needs more time to consider the industry motion to block the rules and wants the parties to file supplemental briefs. As a result, the FCC can't enforce the rules until at least August 5.</p>
<p>"To provide sufficient opportunity to consider the merits of the motion to stay the FCC's order, we conclude that an administrative stay is warranted. The FCC's order is hereby temporarily stayed until August 5, 2024," the <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nn-stay-july-2024.pdf">court said</a> on Friday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037120#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037120&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTQWymHp0n0">interview</a> with Sequoia Capital's Training Data podcast published last Tuesday, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott doubled down on his belief that so-called large language model (LLM) "scaling laws" will continue to drive AI progress, despite some skepticism in the field that progress has leveled out. Scott played a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90957311/how-microsoft-cto-kevin-scott-helped-forge-the-companys-deal-with-openai">key role</a> in forging a $13 billion technology-sharing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/openai-and-microsoft-reaffirm-shared-quest-for-powerful-ai-with-new-investment/">deal</a> between Microsoft and OpenAI.</p>

<p>"Despite what other people think, we're not at diminishing marginal returns on scale-up," Scott said. "And I try to help people understand there is an exponential here, and the unfortunate thing is you only get to sample it every couple of years because it just takes a while to build supercomputers and then train models on top of them."</p>
<p>LLM scaling laws refer to patterns explored by OpenAI researchers in 2020 showing that the performance of language models tends to improve predictably as the models get larger (more parameters), are trained on more data, and have access to more computational power (compute). The laws suggest that simply scaling up model size and training data can lead to significant improvements in AI capabilities without necessarily requiring fundamental algorithmic breakthroughs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036166#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036166&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One month after PC emulator UTM was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/apple-rejects-pc-emulators-on-the-ios-app-store/">rejected from the iOS App Store</a>, the developers have <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1812238024220238180">announced</a> that a new "UTM SE" version is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-se-retro-pc-emulator/id1564628856">now available for free on the App Store</a>. But the app's performance is severely hampered by Apple's restrictions on so-called "just-in-time" (JIT) compilation, limiting the app's suitability for effectively emulating many PC games.</p>
<p>Built on <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">the generic command-line emulation layer QEMU</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM">open-source UTM</a> boasts support for "30+ processors," from x86 and PowerPC to RISC-V and ARM64. The App Store listing promises you can "run classic software and old-school games" through both a VGA graphics mode and text-based terminal.</p>
<p>Don't expect a seamless, RetroArch-style path to playing <em>Space Cadet Pinball</em> on your iPhone, though. The UTM developers <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/">link to pre-configured settings downloads</a> for versions of Windows going back to XP, alongside guides for getting those OSes up and running on iOS. But users will need to bring their own legitimate Windows installation ISO and go through the cumbersome process of installing the OS as well as <a href="https://www.spice-space.org/">a version of SPICE tools</a> to help coordinate access through iOS (downloading pre-built, UTM-compatible Linux builds seems more straightforward).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037072#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037072&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The ongoing dispute between the United States and China over electric vehicles shows no sign of abating. Today, Reuters reports that China has asked the World Trade Organization to set up a special panel to determine if US EV subsidies are an unfair trade barrier.</p>
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has been the most significant climate legislation in US history, with hundreds of billions of dollars of funding for the clean energy transition. Among its many details, it revamped the federal tax credit for buying a new electric vehicle.</p>
<p>In the past, a credit of up to $7,500 was tied to a plug-in vehicle's battery capacity. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-ev-tax-credit-for-2023/">But it's now</a> tied to where the car and its batteries were assembled, as well as where the battery minerals come from. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/more-evs-are-eligible-for-clean-vehicle-tax-credits-up-to-7500/">Final assembly</a> of the vehicle must be in North America, for example, and ever-increasing amounts of the battery pack's content and value must come from North America or a country with which the US has a free trade agreement.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037076#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037076&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is in talks to buy cybersecurity start-up Wiz for about $23 billion, in what would be the largest acquisition in the tech group’s history, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Alphabet’s discussions to acquire Wiz are still weeks away from completion, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter, while people briefed about the transaction said there was still a chance the deal would fall apart, with a number of details still needing to be addressed in talks.</p>
<p>If a deal were to be reached it would be a test case for antitrust regulators, which in recent years have been cracking down on tech groups buying out emerging companies in the sector. Alphabet’s last big deal came more than a decade ago with the $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037057#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037057&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Know your enemy, know yourself. It's a centuries-old strategy. But even in the present-day war against cancer, achieving it remains elusive. In many cases, cancer cells blend in with healthy ones. They bear no unique molecular markers or targets that we can aim clinical defenses at. That means any deadly strike on enemy cancer cells could result in casualties among healthy ones as well. The untenable toxicity of this artless warfare has led some researchers to rethink the ancient script—and flip it: know yourself, know your enemy.</p>
<p>In a set of clever and highly technical tricks, researchers are working on ways to precisely mark and shield healthy cells from chemical weapons, abandoning the effort to pick out enemy cancer cells specifically. By exploiting molecular markers common among many types of cells, researchers can safeguard healthy cells, leaving only the cancer cells in harm's way.</p>
<p>A drug or therapy that targets common markers would normally lay waste to cancerous and healthy cells alike. But that's not the case in this radical approach, which is first being used to treat blood cancers. For the strategy, researchers collect healthy blood stem cells and genetically engineer tiny, benign changes to a common molecular marker on them. Those tiny changes make the healthy cells essentially invisible to killer treatments. After the engineered cells are transplanted into a patient, clinicians can deploy the treatments. The cancerous cells that lack the genetic tweak are now easily killed by the drug or therapy, while the healthy engineered cells are left untouched.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032102#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032102&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Isaac Newton would never have discovered the laws of motion had he studied only cats.</p>
<p>Suppose you hold a cat, stomach up, and drop it from a second-story window. If a cat is simply a mechanical system that obeys Newton’s rules of matter in motion, it should land on its back. (OK, there are some technicalities—like this should be done in a vacuum, but ignore that for now.) Instead, most cats usually avoid injury by twisting themselves on the way down to land on their feet.</p>
<p>Most people are not mystified by this trick—everybody has seen videos attesting to cats’ acrobatic prowess. But for more than a century, scientists have wondered about the physics of how cats do it. Clearly, the mathematical theorem analyzing the falling cat as a mechanical system <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04565">fails for live cats</a>, as Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek points out in a recent paper.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036947#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036947&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During their summit in Washington, DC, this week, NATO member states committed more than $1 billion to improve the sharing of intelligence from national and commercial reconnaissance satellites.</p>
<p>The agreement is a further step toward integrating space assets into NATO military commands. It follows the bloc's adoption of an official space policy in 2019, which recognized space as a fifth war-fighting domain alongside air, land, maritime, and cyberspace. The next step was the formation of the NATO Space Operations Center in 2020 to oversee space support for NATO military operations.</p>
<p>On June 25, NATO announced the establishment of a "space branch" in its Allied Command Transformation, which identifies trends and incorporates emerging capabilities into the alliance's security strategy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036686#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036686&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google is making it easier for people to lock down their accounts with strong multifactor authentication by adding the option to store secure cryptographic keys in the form of passkeys rather than on physical token devices.</p>
<p>Google’s Advanced Protection Program, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/googles-strongest-security-those-who-need-it-most/">introduced</a> in 2017, requires the strongest form of multifactor authentication (MFA). Whereas many forms of MFA rely on one-time passcodes sent through SMS or emails or generated by authenticator apps, accounts enrolled in advanced protection require MFA based on cryptographic keys stored on a secure physical device. Unlike one-time passcodes, security keys stored on physical devices are immune to credential phishing and can’t be copied or sniffed.</p>
<h2>Democratizing APP</h2>
<p>APP, short for Advanced Protection Program, requires the key to be accompanied by a password whenever a user logs into an account on a new device. The protection prevents the types of account takeovers that allowed Kremlin-backed hackers to access the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/russia-linked-phishing-campaign-behind-the-dnc-breach-also-hit-podesta-powell/">Gmail accounts of Democratic officials</a> in 2016 and go on to leak stolen emails to interfere with the presidential election that year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036985#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036985&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">OpenAI recently unveiled a five-tier system to gauge its advancement toward developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to an OpenAI spokesperson who spoke with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/openai-sets-levels-to-track-progress-toward-superintelligent-ai">Bloomberg</a>. The company shared this new classification system on Tuesday with employees during an all-hands meeting, aiming to provide a clear framework for understanding AI advancement. However, the system describes hypothetical technology that does not yet exist and is possibly best interpreted as a marketing move to garner investment dollars.</p>

<p>OpenAI has previously stated that AGI—a nebulous term for a hypothetical concept that means an AI system that can perform novel tasks like a human without specialized training—is currently the <a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/">primary goal</a> of the company. The pursuit of technology that can replace humans at most intellectual work drives most of the enduring hype over the firm, even though such a technology would likely be wildly disruptive to society.</p>
<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously <a href="https://time.com/6342827/ceo-of-the-year-2023-sam-altman/">stated his belief</a> that AGI could be achieved within this decade, and a large part of the CEO's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ai-technology-can-go-quite-wrong-openai-ceo-tells-senate/">public messaging</a> has been related to how the company (and society in general) might handle the disruption that AGI may bring. Along those lines, a ranking system to communicate AI milestones achieved internally on the path to AGI makes sense.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036853#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036853&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the ancient Chinese game of <em>Go</em>, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence has generally been able to defeat the best human players <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/google-ai-begins-battle-with-humanitys-best-go-player-tonight/">since at least 2016</a>. But in the last few years, researchers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/new-go-playing-trick-defeats-world-class-go-ai-but-loses-to-human-amateurs/">discovered flaws in these top-level AI <em>Go</em> algorithms</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/man-beats-machine-at-go-in-human-victory-over-ai/">give humans a fighting chance</a>. By using unorthodox "cyclic" strategies—ones that even a beginning human player could detect and defeat—a crafty human can often exploit gaps in a top-level AI's strategy and fool the algorithm into a loss.</p>
<p>Researchers at MIT and <a href="https://far.ai/">FAR AI</a> wanted to see if they could improve this "worst case" performance in otherwise "superhuman" AI Go algorithms, testing a trio of methods to harden the top-level <a href="https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo">KataGo algorithm</a>'s defenses against adversarial attacks. The results show that creating truly robust, unexploitable AIs may be difficult, even in areas as tightly controlled as board games.</p>
<h2>Three failed strategies</h2>
<p>In the pre-print paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12843">"Can <em>Go</em> AIs be adversarially robust?"</a>, the researchers aim to create a <em>Go</em> AI that is truly "robust" against any and all attacks. That means an algorithm that can't be fooled into "game-losing blunders that a human would not commit" but also one that would require any competing AI algorithm to spend significant computing resources to defeat it. Ideally, a robust algorithm should also be able to overcome potential exploits by using additional computing resources when confronted with unfamiliar situations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036897#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036897&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The German Navy is working on modernizing its <a href="https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/ausruestung-technik-bundeswehr/seesysteme-bundeswehr/brandenburg-klasse-f123-fregatte">Brandenburg-class F123 frigates</a>, which means ending their reliance on 8-inch floppy disks.</p>
<p>The F123 frigates use floppy disks for their onboard data acquisition (DAQ) systems, as noted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/german-navy-aims-to-replace-aging-8-inch-floppy-drives-with-an-emulated-solution-for-its-anti-submarine-frigates">Tom’s Hardware</a> on Thursday. <a href="https://augengeradeaus.net/2024/07/modernisierung-der-brandenburg-klasse-mach-mir-eine-floppy/">Augen geradeaus!</a>, a German defense and security policy blog by journalist <a href="https://wiegold.de/bio/">Thomas Wiegold</a>, notes that DAQs are important for controlling frigates, including power generation, "because the operating parameters have to be recorded," per a Google translation. The ships themselves specialize in anti-submarine warfare and air defense.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Augen geradeaus! spotted a tender for service published June 21 by Germany's Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology, and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) to modernize the German Navy's four F123 frigates. The ships were commissioned from October 1994 to December 1996. As noted by German IT news outlet <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/opinion/Floppy-disk-drive-wanted-Why-the-Navy-defends-the-country-with-floppy-disks-9796441.html">Heise</a>, the continued use of 8-inch floppies despite modern alternatives being available for years "has to do with the fact that established systems are considered more reliable.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036848#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036848&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The launch date for the Europa Clipper mission to study the intriguing moon orbiting Jupiter, which ranks alongside the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn as NASA's most expensive and ambitious planetary science mission, is now in doubt.</p>
<p>The $4.25 billion spacecraft had been due to launch in October on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. However, NASA revealed that transistors on board the spacecraft may not be as radiation-hardened as they were believed to be.</p>
<p>"The issue with the transistors came to light in May when the mission team was advised that similar parts were failing at lower radiation doses than expected," the space agency wrote <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/europaclipper/2024/07/11/nasa-continues-assessing-electrical-switches-on-europa-clipper/">in a blog post</a> Thursday afternoon. "In June 2024, an industry alert was sent out to notify users of this issue. The manufacturer is working with the mission team to support ongoing radiation test and analysis efforts in order to better understand the risk of using these parts on the Europa Clipper spacecraft."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036841#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036841&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
