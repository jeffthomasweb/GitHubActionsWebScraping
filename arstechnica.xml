                            <![CDATA[<p>Congressional Republicans angered local government leaders with a plan for what local groups call an “unprecedented federal intrusion” into how municipalities issue permits for construction of broadband networks. The Republican plan drew rave reviews from cable lobby groups, however.</p>
<p>A House subcommittee moved ahead with the plan today despite the opposition from local leaders and criticism from Congressional Democrats. Under the bills, some kinds of local telecom projects would be approved automatically if a city or town doesn’t rule within a deadline set by Congress.</p>
<p>“These bills represent an unprecedented federal intrusion into established local decision-making processes, favoring large broadband, telecommunications, wireless, and cable companies at the expense of residents and taxpayers,” four groups representing local leaders wrote in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251117-Local-Gov-Associations-Opp-Commerce-CT-Markup_merged.pdf">letter</a> to US lawmakers. “These bills strip local governments of the ability to effectively manage the infrastructure built on local streets and in neighborhoods, while imposing no reciprocal obligations on providers.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/gop-overhaul-of-broadband-permit-laws-cities-hate-it-cable-companies-love-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, a DoorDash driver in upstate New York delivered an item to a local house in Oswego—only to find the front door open and a man apparently unconscious or asleep on a couch in the front room. The man was also quite naked, with pants and underwear around his ankles, and he was fully visible from the porch.</p>
<p>The DoorDasher was a 23-year-old woman named Olivia Henderson, and she felt like the whole situation was some kind of creepy exploitation play. Was this guy purposely exposing himself to her? Was he even asleep? Should she have to endure the sight of random male genitalia just to make a few bucks?</p>
<p>She did not think so, and she decided to do something about it. Henderson filmed the man from outside the home, and she later posted the video on TikTok to shame him. Naturally, it went viral.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/doordasher-claims-sexual-assault-but-cops-arrest-her-for-filming-nude-drunk-man/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal health officials have linked two massive US measles outbreaks, confirming that the country is about two months away from losing its measles elimination status, according to a report by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/health/measles-us-elimination-status-outbreaks.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The Times obtained a recording of a call during which officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to state health departments that the ongoing measles outbreak <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/measles-outbreak-investigation-in-utah-blocked-by-patient-who-refuses-to-talk/">at the border of Arizona and Utah</a> is a continuation of the explosive outbreak in West Texas that began in mid- to late-January. That is, the two massive outbreaks are being caused by the same subtype of measles virus.</p>
<p>This is a significant link that hasn’t previously been reported despite persistent questions from journalists and concerns from health experts, particularly in light of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/canada-fought-measles-and-measles-won-virus-now-endemic-after-1998-elimination/">Canada losing its elimination status last week</a>. The loss of an elimination status means that measles will once again be considered endemic to the US, an embarrassing public health backslide for a vaccine-preventable disease.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/cdc-data-confirms-us-is-2-months-away-from-losing-measles-elimination-status/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After years of pushback from the Federal Trade Commission over Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta has defeated the FTC’s monopoly claims.</p>
<p>In a Tuesday <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FTC-v-Meta-Opinion-11-18-25.pdf">ruling</a>, US District Judge James Boasberg said the FTC failed to show that Meta has a monopoly in a market dubbed “personal social networking.” In that narrowly defined market, the FTC unsuccessfully argued, Meta supposedly faces only two rivals, Snapchat and MeWe, which struggle to compete due to its alleged monopoly.</p>
<p>But the days of grouping apps into “separate markets of social networking and social media” are over, Boasberg wrote. He cited the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who “posited that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” while telling the FTC they missed their chance to block Meta’s purchase.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/meta-wins-monopoly-trial-convinces-judge-that-social-networking-is-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

Nvidia will commit up to $10 billion to Anthropic and Microsoft up to $5 billion, with both companies investing in Anthropic’s next funding round.</p>
<p>The deal brings together two companies that have backed OpenAI and connects them more closely to one of the ChatGPT maker’s main competitors. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl7vHnOgEg0&amp;t=4s">said</a> in a video that OpenAI “remains a critical partner,” while adding that the companies will increasingly be customers of each other.</p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has been adding AI features to Windows 11 for years, but things have recently entered a new phase, with both generative and so-called “agentic” AI features working their way <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsofts-vision-for-ai-pcs-looks-a-lot-like-another-crack-at-cortana/">deeper into the bedrock</a> of the operating system. A new build of Windows 11 released to Windows Insider Program testers yesterday includes a new “experimental agentic features” toggle in the Settings to support a feature called Copilot Actions, and Microsoft has <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">published a detailed support article</a> detailing more about just how those “experimental agentic features” will work.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar, “agentic” is a buzzword that Microsoft has used repeatedly to describe its future ambitions for Windows 11—in plainer language, these agents are meant to accomplish assigned tasks in the background, allowing the user’s attention to be turned elsewhere. Microsoft says it wants agents to be capable of “everyday tasks like organizing files, scheduling meetings, or sending emails,” and that Copilot Actions should give you “an active digital collaborator that can carry out complex tasks for you to enhance efficiency and productivity.”</p>
<p>But like other kinds of AI, these agents can be prone to error and confabulations and will often proceed as if they know what they’re doing even when they don’t. They also present, in Microsoft’s own words, “novel security risks,” mostly related to what can happen if an attacker is able to give instructions to one of these agents. As a result, Microsoft’s implementation walks a tightrope between giving these agents access to your files and cordoning them off from the rest of the system.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/new-windows-11-ai-agents-can-work-in-the-background-but-create-new-security-risks/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever tried to hook an old Nintendo 64 up to a modern HDTV, you know the results can be less than ideal. Assuming your original hardware still works and your flatscreen even has the requisite R/F and/or composite inputs to allow for the connection, the N64’s output will probably look like a blurry mess on a flatscreen that wasn’t designed with those old video signals as a priority.</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D solves this very specific problem very well, with a powerful FPGA core that accurately replicates a Nintendo 64 and well-made display filters that do a good job of approximating that cathode-ray tube glow you remember from decades ago. But the lack of easy expandability limits the appeal of this $250 device to all but the most die-hard fans of original N64 hardware.</p>
<h2>A beauty to behold</h2>
<p>As a piece of physical design, the Analogue 3D is a work of art. The gentle curves of its sleek black shell evoke the original N64 design without copying it, coming in at a slightly smaller footprint and height. Plus, there’s no ugly power brick.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/the-analogue-3d-is-the-modern-n64-fans-have-been-waiting-for/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As Kent Halliburton stood in a bathroom at the Rosewood Hotel in central Amsterdam, thousands of miles from home, running his fingers through an envelope filled with 10,000 euros in crisp banknotes, he started to wonder what he had gotten himself into.</p>
<p>Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-worlds-biggest-bitcoin-mine-is-rattling-this-texas-oil-town/">bitcoin mining hardware</a> on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States.</p>
<p>As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. Before finalizing the deal, the family office had asked to meet Halliburton in person.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/11/bonkers-bitcoin-heist-5-star-hotels-cash-filled-envelopes-vanishing-funds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo">warned</a> of “irrationality” in the AI market, telling the BBC in an interview, “I think no company is going to be immune, including us.” His comments arrive as scrutiny over the state of the AI market has reached new heights, with Alphabet shares doubling in value over seven months to reach a $3.5 trillion market capitalization.</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to the BBC at Google’s California headquarters, Pichai acknowledged that while AI investment growth is at an “extraordinary moment,” the industry can “overshoot” in investment cycles, as we’re seeing now. He drew comparisons to the late 1990s Internet boom, which saw early Internet company valuations surge before collapsing in 2000, leading to bankruptcies and job losses.</p>
<p>“We can look back at the Internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the Internet was profound,” Pichai said. “I expect AI to be the same. So I think it’s both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/googles-sundar-pichai-warns-of-irrationality-in-trillion-dollar-ai-investment-boom/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has kicked its Gemini rollout into high gear over the past year, releasing the much-improved Gemini 2.5 family and cramming various flavors of the model into Search, Gmail, and just about everything else the company makes.</p>
<p>Now, Google’s increasingly unavoidable AI is getting an upgrade. Gemini 3 Pro is <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3">available in a limited form today</a>, featuring more immersive, visual outputs and fewer lies, Google says. The company also says Gemini 3 sets a new high-water mark for vibe coding, and Google is announcing a new AI-first integrated development environment (IDE) called <a href="https://antigravity.google/blog/introducing-google-antigravity">Antigravity</a>, which is also available today.</p>
<h2>The first member of the Gemini 3 family</h2>
<p>Google says the release of Gemini 3 is yet another step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). The new version of Google’s flagship AI model has expanded simulated reasoning abilities and shows improved understanding of text, images, and video. So far, testers like it—Google’s latest LLM is once again atop the LMArena leaderboard with an ELO score of 1,501, besting Gemini 2.5 Pro by 50 points.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The big holiday releases are still waiting in the wings, but it’s not too soon to look forward to what’s coming in 2026. Amazon MGM Studios has released a new trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary_(film)"><em>Project Hail Mary</em></a>, which is based on Andy Weir’s (<em>The Martian</em>) bestselling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary">2021 novel</a> about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space.</p>
<p>Weir <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/books/andy-weir-project-hail-mary.html">told The New York Times</a> that the inspiration for his novel came from a planned multi-book space opera called <em>Zhek</em> that he began writing after <em>The Martian</em>, about a potential fuel for interstellar travel. He eventually abandoned that effort and wrote the 2017 novel, <em>Artemis</em>, instead, but aspects of <em>Zhek</em> found their way into the <em>Project Hail Mary</em> novel.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/ryan-gosling-is-a-reluctant-astronaut-in-project-hail-mary-trailer/">previously reported</a>, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for <em>The Martian</em>, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (<em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie</em>) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/11/stranded-astronaut-finds-an-alien-ally-in-project-hail-mary-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As Tesla’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-profits-fall-37-in-q3-despite-healthy-sales/">profits shrink</a> and its model lineup continues to age, the company remains focused on establishing new lines of business. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says there’s not much his Optimus robots won’t be able to do in the future—following people around to <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-says-tesla-robot-124016396.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGL2PMrDRySobHT85Y1xQQnDD17Yi89Ly2KOjwsvnLsB1NHWhw3J3FZtqSbFr5C3DetQIyvhoJy7POwrSvbF4aHQLjCj08FQEvEPw3VXA4xTwIr0mcIJlwTZv5TCdC-yikkZSxUJj-mdGa_MRir4_20OP2CnO07-X33w-scaEBhr">prevent them from committing crimes</a> is the latest—despite the technology not quite existing yet.</p>
<p>Musk’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/robotaxi-and-cybercab-are-too-unoriginal-to-trademark-uspto-tells-tesla/">robotaxis</a> are a little closer to reality, with a kind of limited service being offered in Austin, Texas, as well as parts of San Francisco. But Tesla might need to rethink its approach to safety drivers after a Tesla rideshare passenger in San Francisco took to Reddit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1p00wmx/my_tesla_robotaxi_safety_driver_fell_asleep/?share_id=HpTj0olW-TsMSpEJVQToh&amp;cache-bust=1763470696107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to share a video</a> of the operator asleep in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>In fact, the safety driver fell asleep three times during the ride, which took place a little over a week ago, according to Reddit user ohmichael. In his post, which contains a 12-second clip of a man sleeping and then waking in the front seat of a moving Tesla, the poster says he contacted Tesla to report this behavior but never heard back.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/tesla-safety-driver-falls-asleep-during-passengers-robotaxi-ride/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When the Trump administration brutally cut federal funding for biomedical research earlier this year, at least 383 clinical trials that were already in progress were abruptly canceled, cutting off over 74,000 trial participants from their experimental treatments, monitoring, or follow-ups, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840939">a study published today in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The study, led by researchers at Harvard, fills a knowledge gap of how the Trump administration’s research funding cuts affected clinical trials specifically. It makes clear not just the wastefulness and inefficiency of the cuts but also the deep ethical violations, JAMA Internal Medicine editors wrote in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840943">an accompanying editor’s note</a>.</p>
<p>In March, the National Institutes of Health, under the control of the Trump administration, announced that it would cancel $1.8 billion in grant funding that wasn’t aligned with the administration’s priorities. The Harvard researchers, led by health care policy expert Anupam Jena, used an NIH database and a federal accountability tracking tool to find grants supporting clinical trials that were active as of February 28 but had been terminated by August 15.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/over-74000-people-were-kicked-out-of-clinical-trials-because-of-trump-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos is one of the world’s richest and most famous tech CEOs, but he hasn’t actually been a CEO of anything since 2021. That’s now changing as he takes on the role of co-CEO of a new AI company, according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/technology/bezos-project-prometheus.html">New York Times report</a> citing three people familiar with the company.</p>
<p>Grandiosely named Project Prometheus (and not to be confused with the NASA project of the same name), the company will focus on using AI to pursue breakthroughs in research, engineering, manufacturing, and other fields that are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/project-prometheus25/about/">dubbed</a> part of “the physical economy”—in contrast to the software applications that are likely the first thing most people in the general public think of when they hear “AI.”</p>
<p>Bezos’ co-CEO will be Vik Bajaj, a chemist and physicist who previously led life sciences work at Google X, an Alphabet-backed research group that worked on speculative projects that could lead to more product categories. (For example, it developed technologies that would later underpin Google’s Waymo service.) Bajaj also worked at Verily, another Alphabet-backed research group focused on life sciences, and Foresite Labs, an incubator for new AI companies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/with-a-new-company-jeff-bezos-will-become-a-ceo-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Five men have pleaded guilty to running laptop farms and providing other assistance to North Koreans to obtain remote IT work at US companies in violation of US law, federal prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The pleas come amid a rash of similar schemes orchestrated by hacking and threat groups backed by the North Korean government. The campaigns, which ramped up nearly five years ago, aim to steal millions of dollars in job revenue and cryptocurrencies to fund North Korean weapons programs. Another motive is to seed cyber attacks for espionage. In one such incident, a North Korean man who fraudulently obtained a job at US security company KnowBe4 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/us-security-firm-unwittingly-hired-apparent-nation-state-hacker-from-north-korea/">installed malware</a> immediately upon beginning his employment.</p>
<p>On Friday, the US Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-nationwide-actions-combat-illicit-north-korean-government">said</a> that five men pleaded guilty to assisting North Koreans in obtaining jobs in a scheme orchestrated by <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082/">APT38</a>, also tracked under the name Lazarus. APT38 has targeted the US and other countries for more than a decade with a stream of attack campaigns that have grown ever bolder and more advanced. All five pleaded guilty to wire fraud, and one to aggravated identity theft, for a range of actions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/5-plead-guilty-to-laptop-farm-and-id-theft-scheme-to-land-north-koreans-us-it-jobs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, a US District Court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the United States government from halting federal funding at UCLA or any other school in the University of California system. The ruling came in response to a suit filed by groups representing the faculty at these schools challenging the Trump administration’s attempts to force UCLA into a deal that would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trumps-ucla-deal-pay-us-1b-and-we-can-still-cut-your-grants-again/">substantially revise</a> instruction and policy.</p>
<p>The court’s decision lays out how the Trump administration’s attacks on universities follow a standard plan: use accusations of antisemitism to justify an immediate cut to funding, then use the loss of money to compel an agreement that would result in revisions to how the university is run. The court finds that this plan was deficient on multiple grounds, from violating legal procedures for cutting funding to an illegal attempt at suppressing the First Amendment rights of faculty.</p>
<p>The result is a reprieve for the entire University of California system, as well as a clear pathway for any universities to fight back against the Trump administration’s attacks on research and education.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/ucla-faculty-gets-big-win-in-suit-against-trumps-university-attacks/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In records filed Friday, District Judge LeAnn Rafferty, in Panola County, also rejected Paxton’s unusual request to block Kenvue from distributing $400 million in dividends to shareholders later this month.</p>
<p>The denials are early losses for Paxton in a politically charged case that hinges on the unproven claim that Tylenol causes autism and other disorders—a claim first introduced by President Trump and his anti-vaccine health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/judge-smacks-down-texas-ags-request-to-immediately-block-tylenol-ads/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>But last week the company took a tremendous stride forward, not just launching its second orbital rocket, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/blue-origin-caps-second-heavy-lift-launch-with-first-offshore-landing/">but subsequently landing the booster</a> on a barge named <em>Jacklyn</em>. It now seems clear that Blue Origin is in the midst of a transition from sleeping giant to force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>To get a sense of where the company goes from here, Ars spoke with the company’s chief executive, Dave Limp, on the eve of last week’s launch. The first thing he emphasized is how much the company learned about New Glenn, and the process of rolling the vehicle out and standing it up for launch, from the vehicle’s first attempt in January.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/after-last-weeks-stunning-landing-heres-what-comes-next-for-blue-origin/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple’s Power Mac and Mac Pro towers used to be the company’s primary workstations, but it has been years since they were updated with the same regularity as the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro. The Mac Pro has seen just four hardware updates in the last 15 years, and that’s counting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/">a 2012 refresh</a> that was mostly identical to the 2010 version.</p>
<p>Long-suffering Mac Pro buyers may have taken heart when Apple finally <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/this-is-the-new-apple-silicon-mac-pro/">added an M2 Ultra processor to the tower in mid-2023</a>, making it one of the very last Macs to switch from Intel to Apple Silicon—surely this would mean that the computer would at least be updated once every year or two, like the Mac Studio has been? But Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-16/apple-s-iphone-road-map-iphone-air-2-iphone-18-mac-pro-future-tesla-carplay-mi1q4l2o">says</a> that Mac Pro buyers shouldn’t get their hopes up for new hardware in 2026.</p>
<p>Gurman says that the tower is “on the back burner” at Apple and that the company is “focused on a new Mac Studio” for the next-generation M5 Ultra chip that is in the works. As we reported earlier this year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-announces-m3-ultra-and-says-not-every-generation-will-see-an-ultra-chip/">Apple doesn’t have plans to design or release an M4 Ultra</a>, and the Mac Studio refresh from this spring included an M3 Ultra alongside the M4 Max.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/report-claims-that-apple-has-yet-again-put-the-mac-pro-on-the-back-burner/">Read full article</a></p>
