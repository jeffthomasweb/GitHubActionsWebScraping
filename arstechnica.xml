<p>Your keyboard is the thread that connects you to your computer. The way a keyboard feels—from the sensations of each key pressing down and resetting to the build of the board’s chassis—has a direct impact on your typing experience, affecting accuracy, speed, and fatigue.</p>
<p>We’ve dug into the joys of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/the-best-wireless-mechanical-keyboards/">quality keyboards</a> and the thrills of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/typing-my-way-down-the-mechanical-keyboard-rabbit-hole-with-the-drop-ctrl/">customization</a> at Ars Technica before. But what really makes one type of keyboard feel better than another? People say membrane keyboards feel mushy, but <em>why</em>? And what about keyboards with cult-like followings? What makes decades-old IBM keyboards or expensive Topres so special?</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll look at how some of the most popular keyboard categories work and how their differences impact typing feel.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007717#p3">Read 51 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007717&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When mega pop star Taylor Swift gave a series of concerts last August at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, regional seismic network stations recorded unique harmonic vibrations known as "concert tremor." A similar <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/entertainment/taylor-swift-seismic-activity/index.html">"Swift quake"</a> had occurred the month before in Seattle, prompting scientists from the California Institute of Technology and UCLA to take a closer look at seismic data collected during Swift's LA concert.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that the vibrations were largely generated by crowd motion as "Swifties" jumped and danced enthusiastically to the music and described their findings in a <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/doi/10.1785/0220230385/636176/Shake-to-the-Beat-Exploring-the-Seismic-Signals?redirectedFrom=fulltext">new paper</a> published in the journal Seismological Research Letters. The authors contend that gaining a better understanding of atypical seismic signals like those generated by the Swift concert could improve the analysis of seismic signals in the future, as well as bolster emerging applications like using signals from train noise for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_interferometry">seismic interferometry</a>.</p>
<p>Concert tremor consists of low-frequency signals of extended duration with harmonic frequency peaks between 1 and 10 Hz, similar to the signals generated by volcanoes or trains. There has been considerable debate about the source of these low-frequency concert tremor signals: Are they produced by the synchronized movement of the crowd, or by the sound systems or instruments coupled to the stage? Several prior studies of stadium concerts have argued for the former hypothesis, while a <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70189620">2015 study</a> found that a chanting crowd at a football game produced similar harmonic seismic tremors. However, a <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/79/4/546/143430/Seismic-Raves-Tremor-Observations-from-an">2008 study</a> concluded that such signals generated during an outdoor electronic dance music festival came from the sound system vibrating to the musical beat.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010047#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010047&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US Supreme Court on Tuesday heard arguments in a case seeking to limit access to the abortion and miscarriage drug mifepristone, with a majority of justices expressing skepticism that the anti-abortion groups that brought the case have the legal standing to do so.</p>
<p>The case threatens to dramatically alter access to a drug that has been safely used for decades and, according to the Guttmacher Institute, was used in <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020">63 percent of abortions documented in the health care system in 2023</a>. But, it also has sweeping implications for the Food and Drug Administration's authority over drugs, marking the first time that courts have second-guessed the agency's expert scientific analysis and moved to restrict access to an FDA-approved drug.</p>
<p>As such, the case has rattled health experts, reproductive health care advocates, the FDA, and the pharmaceutical industry alike. But, based on the line of questioning in today's oral arguments, they have reason to breathe a sigh of relief.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012710#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012710&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crooks are working overtime to anonymize their illicit online activities using thousands of devices of unsuspecting users, as evidenced by two unrelated reports published Tuesday.</p>
<p>The first, from security firm Lumen Labs, reports that roughly 40,000 home and office routers have been drafted into a criminal enterprise that anonymizes illicit Internet activities, with another 1,000 new devices being added each day. The malware responsible is a variant of <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Linksys+Worm+TheMoon+Summary+What+we+know+so+far/17633">TheMoon</a>, a malicious code family dating back to at least 2014. In its earliest days, TheMoon almost exclusively infected Linksys E1000 series routers. Over the years it <a href="https://blog-netlab-360-com.translate.goog/themoon-botnet-a-review-and-new-features/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US">branched out</a> to targeting the Asus WRTs, Vivotek Network Cameras, and multiple D-Link models.</p>
<p>In the years following its debut, TheMoon’s self-propagating behavior and growing ability to compromise a broad base of architectures enabled a growth curve that captured attention in security circles. More recently, the visibility of the Internet of Things botnet trailed off, leading many to assume it was inert. To the surprise of researchers in Lumen’s Black Lotus Lab, during a single 72-hour stretch earlier this month, TheMoon added 6,000 ASUS routers to its ranks, an indication that the botnet is as strong as it’s ever been.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012682#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012682&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey yesterday <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/attorney-general-bailey-files-suit-against-media-matters-for-refusal-to-cooperate-with-investigation/">sued Media Matters</a> in an attempt to protect Elon Musk and X from the nonprofit watchdog group's investigations into hate speech on the social network. Bailey's <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/Final-Media-Matters-Petition.pdf">lawsuit</a> claims that "Media Matters has used fraud to solicit donations from Missourians in order to trick advertisers into removing their advertisements from X, formerly Twitter, one of the last platforms dedicated to free speech in America."</p>
<p>Bailey didn't provide much detail on the alleged fraud but claimed that Media Matters is guilty of "fraudulent manipulation of data on X.com." That's apparently a reference to Media Matters reporting that X placed ads for major brands next to posts touting Hitler and Nazis. X has accused Media Matters of manipulating the site's algorithm by endlessly scrolling and refreshing.</p>
<p>Bailey yesterday issued an <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/Final-CID-to-Media-Matters.pdf">investigative demand</a> seeking names and addresses of all Media Matters donors who live in Missouri and a range of internal communications and documents regarding the group's research on Musk and X. Bailey anticipates that Media Matters won't provide the requested materials, so he filed the lawsuit asking Cole County Circuit Court for an order to enforce the investigative demand.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012671#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012671&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple posted about the event with the following <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/">generic copy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Join us online for the biggest developer event of the year. Be there for the unveiling of the latest Apple platforms, technologies, and tools. Learn how to create and elevate your apps and games. Engage with Apple designers and engineers and connect with the worldwide developer community. All online and at no cost.</p></blockquote>
<p>As always, the conference will kick off with a keynote presentation on the first day, which is Monday, June 10. You can be sure Apple will use that event to at least announce the key features of its next round of annual software updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012651#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012651&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Under the very unassuming name of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/modding-wavelet-patch-1-1-0f1.1640000/">patch 1.1.0f1</a>, <em>Cities: Skylines 2 </em>is getting something quite big. The sequel now has the modding, map editing, and code modding support that made its predecessor such a sprawling success.</p>
<p>Only time will tell if community energy can help restore some of the momentum that has been dispersed by the fraught launch of <em><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about">Cities: Skylines 2</a> (C:S2)</em>. The project of relatively small developer Colossal Order arrived in October 2023 with performance issues and a lack of content compared to its predecessor. Some of that content perception stemmed from the game's lack of modding support, which had contributed to entire aspects of the original game not yet available in the sequel.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/an-interview-with-cities-skylines-2-developers-ceo-mariina-hallikainen/">Ars interviewed Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen</a> in December, she said that modding support was the thing she was most looking forward to arriving. Modding support was intended to be available at launch, but the challenges of building the new game's technical base, amid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/">many other technical issues</a>, pushed it back, along with console releases.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012649#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012649&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>We are quickly barreling toward an age of viable Arm-powered Windows laptops with the upcoming launch of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite CPU. Hardware options are great, but getting useful computers out of them will require a lot of new software, and a big one has just launched: Chrome for Windows on Arm.</p>
<p>Google has had a nightly "canary" build running <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-launches-chrome-nightlies-for-windows-11-on-arm/">since January</a>, but now it has <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/download-google-chrome-windows-pc-arm/">a blog post</a> up touting a production-ready version of Chrome for "Arm-compatible Windows PCs powered by Snapdragon." That's right, Qualcomm has a big hand in this release, too, with <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/03/fast--secure-and-native--chrome-comes-to-windows-on-snapdragon">its own press announcement</a> touting Google's browser release for its upcoming chip. Google promises a native version of Chrome will be "fully optimized for your PC’s [Arm] hardware and operating system to make browsing the web faster and smoother."</p>
<p>Apple upended laptop CPU architecture when it dumped Intel and launched the Arm-based Apple Silicon M1. A few years later and Qualcomm is ready to answer—mostly by buying <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/qualcomm-closes-nuvia-deal-promises-in-house-laptop-cpus-by-2h-2022/">a company full</a> of Apple Silicon veterans—with the upcoming launch of the Snapdragon X Elite chip. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/">Qualcomm claims</a> the X Elite will bring Apple Silicon-class hardware to Windows, but the chip isn't out yet—it's due for a "mid-2024" release. Most of the software you'll be running will still be written in x86 and need to go through a translation layer, which will slow things down, but at least it won't have to be your primary browser.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012585#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012585&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>A container ship <a href="https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-53169b379820032f832de4016c655d1b">rammed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore</a> around 1:30 am on March 26, 2024, causing a portion of the bridge to collapse into Baltimore Harbor.

<p>On Monday, Florida became the first state to ban kids under 14 from social media without parental permission. It appears likely that the law—considered one of the most restrictive in the US—will face significant legal challenges, however, before taking effect on January 1.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3/BillText/er/PDF">HB 3</a>, apps like Instagram, Snapchat, or TikTok would need to verify the ages of users, then delete any accounts for users under 14 when parental consent is not granted. Companies that "knowingly or recklessly" fail to block underage users risk fines of up to $10,000 in damages to anyone suing on behalf of child users. They could also be liable for up to $50,000 per violation in civil penalties.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/25/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-protect-children-and-uphold-parental-rights/">statement</a>, Florida governor Ron DeSantis said the "landmark law" gives "parents a greater ability to protect their children" from a variety of social media harm. Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, who spearheaded the law, explained some of that harm, saying that passing HB 3 was critical because "the Internet has become a dark alley for our children where predators target them and dangerous social media leads to higher rates of depression, self-harm, and even suicide."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012595#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012595&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NEW YORK—You can always rely on Genesis to bring at least one interesting concept to the New York International Auto Show. This year, the company brought several. At a busy reveal at the brand's Genesis House in Manhattan, it showed us its high-performance ambitions with not one but four bright orange machines, plus one rather famous Belgian racing driver. Then, in a chamber reminiscent of <em><a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/nasm2018-00448jpg">The Barmacide Feast</a></em>, we got to see the poshest Genesis yet, the brand's take on a big luxury electric vehicle inspired by Korean hospitality.</p>

      </ul>

<p>Genesis was tight-lipped in the lead-up to Monday night's unveilings, but no one was entirely surprised to see a big electric SUV. Genesis is owned by Hyundai Group, after all, and has access to the E-GMP architecture, a thoroughly up-to-date flexible platform that keeps impressing us. Kia just used E-GMP to great effect to make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/heres-our-first-look-at-kias-ev9-three-row-electric-suv/">the EV9</a>, a three-row family SUV. And Hyundai's take on that form factor is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/hyundai-hints-at-ioniq-7-with-its-latest-concept-ev-seven/">due later this year</a> in the production Ioniq 7, so an upmarket model from Genesis seemed obvious.</p>
<p>"The last eight years, it was about finding who we are and then discovering DNA for the Genesis," said SangYup Lee, global design head for Genesis. "Now it's time to expand."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012586#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012586&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This star system is only about 2.8 million years old. In terms of cosmic time, that is but a blink of the eye.

<p>The <em>Super Mario Maker</em> community and <a href="https://twitter.com/Team0Percent">"Team 0%"</a> have declared victory in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/the-super-mario-maker-community-faces-its-final-boss/">their years-long effort to clear every user-submitted level</a> in the original Wii U game before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/wii-u-3ds-online-servers-to-shut-down-in-six-months/">the servers shut off for good on April 8</a>. That victory declaration comes despite the fact that no human player has yet to clear "Trimming the Herbs" (TTH), the ultra-hard level that gained notoriety this month as what was thought to be the final "uncleared" level in the game.</p>
<p>This strange confluence of events is the result of an admission by Ahoyo, the creator of Trimming the Herbs, who came clean Friday evening regarding his use of <a href="https://tasvideos.org/WelcomeToTASVideos">automated, tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) methods</a> in creating the level. That means he was able to use superhuman capabilities like slow-motion, rewinding, and frame advance to pre-record the precise set of perfectly timed inputs needed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siz4oB4CGKo">craft the "creator clear"</a> that was necessary to upload the level in the first place.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/siz4oB4CGKo?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Ahoyo's video of a "creator clear" for Trimming the Herbs, which he now admits was created using TAS methods. </p></div>
<p>"I’m sorry for the drama [my level] caused within the community, and I regret the ordeal," Ahoyo <a href="https://discord.com/channels/394519186610847754/1220808827621085294/1220844130947563541">wrote on the Team 0% Discord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Ahoyoo_Twitch/status/1771286936944099483">social media</a>. "But at least it was interesting. However in the end the truth matters most. Congratulations to Team 0% for their well-earned achievement!"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012413#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012413&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>HOUSTON—While it doesn't have the same relevance to public consciousness as safety problems with commercial airliners, a successful test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in May would be welcome news for the beleaguered aerospace company.</p>
<p>This will be the first time the Starliner capsule flies into low-Earth orbit with humans aboard. NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are in the final stages of training for the so-called Crew Flight Test (CFT), a milestone running seven years behind the schedule Boeing said it could achieve when it won a $4.2 billion commercial crew contract from NASA a decade ago.</p>
<p>If schedules hold, Wilmore and Williams will take off inside Boeing's Starliner spacecraft aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket after midnight May 1, local time, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. They will fly Starliner to the International Space Station for a stay of at least eight days, then return the capsule to a parachute-assisted, airbag-cushioned landing in the western United States, likely at White Sands, New Mexico.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012455#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012455&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>American workers who have more flexibility and security in their jobs also have better mental health, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816735">a study of 2021 survey data</a> from over 18,000 nationally representative working Americans.</p>
<p>The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, may not be surprising to those who have faced return-to-office mandates and rounds of layoffs amid the pandemic. But, it offers clear data on just how important job flexibility and security are to the health and well-being of workers.</p>
<p>For the study, job flexibility was assessed in terms of ease of adjusting work schedules, advance notice of scheduling changes, and whether schedules were changed by employers often. People who reported greater flexibility in their job had 26 percent lower odds of serious psychological distress, which was measured on a validated, widely used questionnaire that assesses depression, nervousness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, among other forms of distress. Greater job flexibility was also linked to 13 percent lower odds of experiencing daily anxiety, 11 percent lower odds of experiencing weekly anxiety, and 9 percent lower odds of experiencing anxiety a few times a year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012543#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012543&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            This is one of the Panasonic Avionics Astrova in-flight entertainment systems, set to debut in Icelandair, Qantus, and United Airlines flights in the next couple of years.                          [credit:

<p>Flying on commercial airlines today might be a lot more of a pain than it used to be, but new tech is going to bring some improvement to one part of the experience—in-flight entertainment. Panasonic Avionics' brand <a href="https://www.panasonic.aero/our-offerings/systems/astrova/">Astrova</a> in-flight entertainment systems are starting to roll out on commercial flights on certain airlines, promising 4K HDR TVs and other features to the backs of seats that should be a huge upgrade over the abysmal screens we normally watch in-flight movies on.</p>
<p>Look at most commercial airlines today, and you'll find a tiny, terrible LCD TV embedded in the seat in front of you. These HD, standard dynamic range screens have terrible contrast and poor viewing angles, and they aren't bright enough to achieve a good viewing experience when the overhead lights are on.</p>
<p>They're bad enough that I always bring my own hardware for flights—most recently, I took three flights with Apple's Vision Pro headset, which I plan to write about later this week. But most people just bring a tablet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012437#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012437&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Justice Department on Monday unsealed an indictment charging seven men with hacking or attempting to hack dozens of US companies in a 14-year campaign furthering an economic espionage and foreign intelligence gathering by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>All seven defendants, federal prosecutors alleged, were associated with Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd. a front company created by the Hubei State Security Department, an outpost of the Ministry of State Security located in Wuhan province. The MSS, in turn, has funded an advanced persistent threat group tracked under names including APT31, Zirconium Violet Typhoon, Judgment Panda, and Altaire.</p>
<h2>Relentless 14-year campaign</h2>
<p>“Since at least 2010, the defendants … engaged in computer network intrusion activity on behalf of the HSSD targeting numerous US government officials, various US economic and defense industries and a variety of private industry officials, foreign democracy activists, academics and parliamentarians in response to geopolitical events affecting the PRC,” federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1345141/dl?inline">alleged</a>. “These computer network intrusion activities resulted in the confirmed and potential compromise of work and personal email accounts, cloud storage accounts and telephone call records belonging to millions of Americans, including at least some information that could be released in support of malign influence targeting democratic processes and institutions, and economic plans, intellectual property, and trade secrets belonging to American businesses, and contributed to the estimated billions of dollars lost every year as a result of the PRC’s state-sponsored apparatus to transfer US technology to the PRC.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012482#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012482&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://monitor.mozilla.org/">Mozilla's Monitor Plus</a>, a service <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/mozilla-expands-its-privacy-focus-with-monitor-plus-data-broker-removal-service/">launched by the privacy-minded tech firm in February</a>, notes on its pitch page that there is "a $240 billion industry of data brokers selling your private information for profit" and that its offering can "take back your privacy."</p>
<p>Mozilla's most recent move to protect privacy has been to cut out one of the key providers of Monitor Plus' people-search protections, <a href="https://onerep.com/">Onerep</a>. That comes after reporting from security reporter Brian Krebs, who uncovered Onerep CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest as the founder of "dozens of people-search services since 2010," including one, Nuwber, that still sells the very kind of "background reports" that Monitor Plus seeks to curb.</p>
<p>Shelest <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dimitri-Shelest-Letter-_-Comment-on-Krebs-article-3.20.24-1.pdf">told Krebs in a statement</a> (PDF) that he did have an ownership stake in Nuwber, but that Nuwber has "zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep" and that he no longer operates any other people-search sites. Shelest admitted the bad look but said that his experience with people search gave Onerep "the best tech and team in the space."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012417#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012417&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has just released version 14.4.1 for macOS Sonoma, a small-but-significant patch that claims to fix several issues with third-party software and accessories that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/usb-hubs-printers-java-and-more-seemingly-broken-by-macos-14-4-update/">cropped up in the 14.4 update</a>. The 14.4.1 release also includes a pair of security fixes.</p>
<p>Apple’s release notes highlight fixes for three major problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>USB hubs connected to external displays may not be recognized</li>
<li>Copy protected Audio Unit plug-ins designed for professional music apps may not open or pass validation</li>
<li>Apps that include Java may quit unexpectedly</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Users and companies began noticing problems shortly after the macOS 14.4 update was released earlier this month. Reports of broken USB hubs cropped up on Reddit, the Apple Support Communities forums, and elsewhere within the first couple of days, and issues with Java and <a href="https://help.ilok.com/faq_licenses.html#sonoma_14_4_plugins">iLok audio software DRM devices</a> were reported later on. Some users also reported broken printer drivers and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/sonoma-bug-destroys-saved-versions-icloud-drive/">deleted file revisions in iCloud Drive</a>, though Apple's release notes don't mention those problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012440#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012440&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
