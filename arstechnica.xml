<p>Telecom provider CenturyLink left a couple in Oregon without landline phone service for two months, then sent a bill for $239.</p>
<p>CenturyLink customer Kirstin Appel and her husband live in Banks, a city with fewer than 2,000 residents in Oregon's Tualatin Valley. They keep a landline for emergencies because their only Internet service is satellite, and cellular service in the area is poor. Appel said they pay $41 a month for CenturyLink phone service.</p>
<p>CenturyLink phone service became spotty and intermittent around January 20 when winter storms hit the area and then went out completely on January 27, Appel told us. She contacted Ars nearly two months after the outage began, desperate for a fix because her various chats with CenturyLink customer service led nowhere.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020483#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020483&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Facing competition from Starlink and other emerging satellite broadband networks, the two companies that own most of the traditional commercial communications spacecraft in geostationary orbit announced plans to join forces Tuesday.</p>
<p>SES, based in Luxembourg, will buy Intelsat for $3.1 billion. The acquisition will create a combined company boasting a fleet of some 100 multi-ton satellites in geostationary orbit, a ring of spacecraft located more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. This will be more than twice the size of the fleet of the next-largest commercial geostationary satellite operator.</p>
<p>The problem is that demand is waning for communication services through large geostationary (GEO) satellites. There are some large entrenched customers, like video media companies and the military, that will continue to buy telecom capacity on geostationary satellites. But there's a growing demand among consumers, and some segments of the corporate and government markets, for the types of services offered by constellations of smaller satellites flying closer to Earth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020892#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020892&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, the US General Services Administration began <a href="https://gsaauctions.gov/auctions/preview/282996">an auction</a> for the decommissioned <a href="https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history/cheyenne">Cheyenne supercomputer</a>, located in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The 5.34-petaflop supercomputer ranked as the <a href="https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history/cheyenne">20th most powerful</a> in the world at the time of its installation in 2016. Bidding started at $2,500, but it's price is currently $27,643 with the reserve not yet met.</p>

<p>The supercomputer, which officially operated between January 12, 2017, and December 31, 2023, at the <a href="https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-wyoming-supercomputing-center">NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center</a>, was a powerful (and once considered energy-efficient) system that significantly advanced atmospheric and Earth system sciences research.</p>
<p>"In its lifetime, Cheyenne delivered over 7 billion core-hours, served over 4,400 users, and supported nearly 1,300 NSF awards," writes the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) on its official Cheyenne <a href="https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history/cheyenne">information page</a>. "It played a key role in education, supporting more than 80 university courses and training events. Nearly 1,000 projects were awarded for early-career graduate students and postdocs. Perhaps most tellingly, Cheyenne-powered research generated over 4,500 peer-review publications, dissertations and theses, and other works."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020861#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020861&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has spent the last year trying to convince gamers that they can get a console-like, triple-A experience on the latest iPhones. The newest test of that promise will be Ubisoft's <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, which now has a release date and pricing information.</p>
<p><em>Mirage</em> will land on compatible iPhones—the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max—on June 6, according to Ubisoft (though the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-mirage/id6472704261">App Store listing</a> says June 10.) That coincides pretty closely with Apple's annual developer conference, so we'd expect it to get a shoutout there. <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6hRBheSWDoKUdnKxzy5YOg/assassins-creed-mirage-is-coming-to-ios">Ubisoft's blog post</a> also says it will come to the iPad Air and iPad Pro models with an M1 chip or later.</p>
<p>The game will be a free download with a 90-minute free trial. After that, you'll have to pay $50 to keep playing, which is pretty close to what the game costs on PC and consoles. It will support cross-progression, provided you sign into Ubisoft Connect. Ubisoft Connect is not exactly beloved by players, but it's nice to be able to take your saves back and forth between other platforms if you can stomach it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020857#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020857&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US Drug Enforcement Administration is preparing to reclassify marijuana to a lower-risk drug category, a major federal policy change that is in line with recommendations from the US health department last year. The upcoming move was first reported by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-biden-dea-criminal-justice-pot-f833a8dae6ceb31a8658a5d65832a3b8">Associated Press</a> on Tuesday afternoon and has since been confirmed by several other outlets.</p>
<p>The DEA currently designates marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, defined as drugs "with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." It puts marijuana in league with LSD and heroin. According to the reports today, the DEA is moving to reclassify it as a Schedule 3 drug, defined as having "a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence." The move would place marijuana in the ranks of ketamine, testosterone, and products containing less than 90 milligrams of codeine.</p>
<p>Marijuana's rescheduling would be a nod to its potential medical benefits and would shift federal policy in line with many states. To date, 38 states have already legalized medical marijuana.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020872#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020872&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Change Healthcare, the health care services provider that recently experienced a ransomware attack that hamstrung the US prescription market for two weeks, was hacked through a compromised account that failed to use multifactor authentication, the company CEO told members of Congress.</p>
<p>The February 21 attack by a ransomware group using the names ALPHV or BlackCat took down a nationwide network Change Healthcare administers to allow healthcare providers to manage customer payments and insurance claims. With no easy way for pharmacies to calculate what costs were covered by insurance companies, payment processors, providers, and patients <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/us-prescription-market-hamstrung-for-9-days-so-far-by-ransomware-attack/">experienced long delays</a> in filling prescriptions for medicines, many of which were lifesaving. Change Healthcare has also reported that hackers behind the attacks obtained personal health information for a "substantial portion" of the US population.</p>
<h2>Standard defense not in place</h2>
<p>Andrew Witty, CEO of Change Healthcare parent company UnitedHealth Group, said the breach started on February 12 when hackers somehow obtained an account password for a portal allowing remote access to employee desktop devices. The account, Witty admitted, failed to use multifactor authentication (MFA), a standard defense against password compromises that requires additional authentication in the form of a one-time password or physical security key.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020827#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020827&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One reason plastic waste persists in the environment is because there's not much that can eat it. The chemical structure of most polymers is stable and different enough from existing food sources that bacteria didn't have enzymes that could digest them. Evolution has started to change that situation, though, and a number of strains have been identified that can digest some common plastics.</p>
<p>An international team of researchers has decided to take advantage of those strains and bundle plastic-eating bacteria into the plastic. To keep them from eating it while it's in use, the bacteria is mixed in as inactive spores that should (mostly—more on this below) only start digesting the plastic once it's released into the environment. To get this to work, the researchers had to evolve a bacterial strain that could tolerate the manufacturing process. It turns out that the evolved bacteria made the plastic even stronger.</p>
<h2>Bacteria meet plastics</h2>
<p>Plastics are formed of polymers, long chains of identical molecules linked together by chemical bonds. While they can be broken down chemically, the process is often energy-intensive and doesn't leave useful chemicals behind. One alternative is to get bacteria to do it for us. If they've got an enzyme that breaks the chemical bonds of a polymer, they can often use the resulting small molecules as an energy source.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020830#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020830&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're using Amazon Web Services and your S3 storage bucket can be reached from the open web, you'd do well not to pick a generic name for that space. Avoid "example," skip "change_me," don't even go with "foo" or "bar." Someone else with the same "change this later" thinking can cost you a MacBook's worth of cash.</p>
<p>Ask Maciej Pocwierz, who just happened to pick an S3 name that "one of the popular open-source tools" used for its default backup configuration. After setting up the bucket for a client project, he checked his billing page and found nearly 100 million unauthorized attempts to create new files on his bucket (PUT requests) within one day. The bill was over $1,300 and counting.</p>

<p>"All this actually happened just a few days after I ensured my client that the price for AWS services will be negligible, like $20 at most for the entire month," Pocwierz wrote over chat.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Sunday, word began to spread on social media about a new mystery chatbot named "gpt2-chatbot" that appeared in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/turing-test-on-steroids-chatbot-arena-crowdsources-ratings-for-45-ai-models/">LMSYS Chatbot Arena</a>. Some people speculate that it may be a secret test version of OpenAI's upcoming GPT-4.5 or GPT-5 large language model (LLM). The paid version of ChatGPT is currently powered by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">GPT-4 Turbo</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, the new model is only available for use through the <a href="https://arena.lmsys.org/">Chatbot Arena website</a>, although in a limited way. In the site's "side-by-side" arena mode where users can purposely select the model, gpt2-chatbot has a rate limit of eight queries per day—dramatically limiting people's ability to test it in detail.</p>
<p>So far, gpt2-chatbot has inspired plenty of rumors online, including that it could be the stealth launch of a test version of GPT-4.5 or even <a href="https://x.com/colin_fraser/status/1785002691803976040">GPT-5</a>—or perhaps a <a href="https://x.com/neilsuperduper/status/1785011618080022941">new version</a> of 2019's <a href="https://openai.com/research/better-language-models">GPT-2</a> that has been trained using <a href="https://x.com/albfresco/status/1784964830887104999">new techniques</a>. We reached out to OpenAI for comment but did not receive a response by press time. On Monday evening, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seemingly dropped a hint by <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1785107943664566556">tweeting</a>, "i do have a soft spot for gpt2."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020588#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020588&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If your iPhone's alarm hasn't woken you lately, it seems you're not alone: Apple has <a href="https://www.today.com/video/how-to-make-sure-your-iphone-s-alarm-goes-off-in-the-morning-209952837765">confirmed to Today</a> that a software bug is to blame, following user complaints on TikTok and other social platforms.</p>
<p>Apple is "aware of an issue causing some iPhone alarms to not play the expected sound," according to the report and "is working on a fix." The company's official statement didn't go into more detail on what caused the bug or why it seems to affect some users but not others.</p>
<p>These sorts of bugs usually relate to some kind of time change; one circa 2010 iOS alarm bug was caused by Daylight Saving Time, and another cropped up in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/fool-me-twice-iphone-users-burned-again-with-new-alarm-bug/">the first two days of 2011</a> when alarms suddenly stopped working for the first two days of the year (for whatever reason. they began working properly again on January 3 without any kind of software update). Daylight Saving Time in 2024 kicked in all the way back in mid-March, so it's hard to say whether the problem is related to the change this time around.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020772#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020772&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced this week a proposed settlement [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Razer-PACER-No3-1-ProposedStipulatedOrder.pdf">PDF</a>] against Razer that would see the tech company pay $1,171,254.33 for its misleading claims about the Zephyr RGB face mask. Razer marketed the device as offering capabilities similar to those of an N95 respirator.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2021, Razer began selling the Zephyr and its replacement filters. Razer continued to sell the mask until January 2022 and kept pushing the filters until July 2022, according to the FTC's complaint [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Razer-PACER-No1-Complaint.pdf">PDF</a>].</p>
<p>Per the FTC, when Razer.com listed the Zephyr in 2021, it said that the mask offered "replaceable N95 Grade filters" and that Zephyr was "FDA-registered and lab-tested for 99 percent BFE [bacterial filtration efficiency]" and offered "greater protection compared to standard disposable/cloth masks, and filters air both inhaled and exhaled to safeguard you and others around you." Razer's site also reportedly said that the mask was "not tested specifically against the COVID-19 virus, but offers the same functionality and adequate protection due to its 99 percent BFE rating.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020701#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020701&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The European Commission today accused Meta of violating rules related to deceptive advertising, political content, and election monitoring. The owner of Facebook and Instagram "may have breached the Digital Services Act (DSA)," the EU government body said in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_2373">press release</a>.</p>
<p>"The Commission suspects that Meta does not comply with DSA obligations related to addressing the dissemination of deceptive advertisements, disinformation campaigns, and coordinated inauthentic behavior in the EU," the EC said. "The proliferation of such content may present a risk to civic discourse, electoral processes and fundamental rights, as well as consumer protection."</p>
<p>The EC alleged "that the mechanism for flagging illegal content on the services ('Notice-and-Action') as well as the user redress and internal complaint-mechanisms are not compliant with the requirements of the Digital Services Act and that there are shortcomings in Meta's provision of access to publicly available data to researchers."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020750#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020750&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Another day, another round of Google layoffs. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/google-lays-off-staff-from-flutter-dart-python-weeks-before-its-developer-conference/">TechCrunch</a> reports the company has axed people across development teams like the Flutter, Dart, and Python groups. Google confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but didn't say how many people were affected.</p>
<p>Flutter is Google's write-once, run-anywhere development kit. Flutter apps can work on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and the Flutter UI and rendering engine, included with every app, translates everything to the OS layer. It's much like programming a game for Unity or Unreal but for app development. Flutter apps are written in the Dart programming language, which is also getting hit with layoffs. Google Smart Displays run a Flutter-native operating system called "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/google-launches-its-third-major-operating-system-fuchsia/">Fuchsia</a>," which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/big-layoffs-at-googles-fuchsia-os-call-the-projects-future-into-question/">hit with layoffs</a> last year. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/01/15/google-is-no-longer-bringing-the-full-chrome-browser-to-fuchsia/">Plans</a> to do <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/07/25/google-abandons-assistant-speakers-fuchsia/">anything meaningful</a> with that project seem to have cooled down.</p>
<p>Any hits to the Flutter team ought to terrify a lot of people since many businesses are built on Flutter, and well, you all know Google's reputation for killing products. A <a href="https://twitter.com/leighajarett/status/1783848728878522620?t=gx4pLcWymgM0sFGFMqMJfA">product manager for Flutter</a> said that the layoffs affected "<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">a LOT of teams</span>" but that "<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Flutter and Dart were not affected any more or less than others.</span>"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020709#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020709&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Racing simulators keep evolving as graphics get more and more realistic while physical motion systems innovate new ways to mimic the sensation of driving a real race car. The task of rendering the controlled environment of a well-known racing circuit makes most modern sims a bit easier to understand, and the physical footprints of screens, seats, VR goggles, and motion systems continue to shrink. But now, leading developer CXC Simulations has unveiled a massive sim that offers a more embodied experience of off-road racing. The project began in partnership with Norwegian Cruise Line, but CXC will now sell the Motion Pro Truck to the general public, albeit at a starting price of $600,000.</p>
<p>I visited CXC's headquarters in Los Angeles to learn more about how <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/ford-pushes-the-off-road-button-with-f-150-lightning-switchgear/">the wild physicality of high-speed off-roading</a> translates to sim racing. After all, the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/01/the-50000-racing-simulator-cheaper-than-crashing-the-real-thing/">most popular Motion Pro II sim setup</a> typically features a compact racing seat, steering wheel, and pedals atop a small base platform, with the choice of one or three screens or a set of VR goggles. The Motion Pro II has proved popular since founder Chris Considine originally launched CXC out of his garage in 2007, to the point that his company now works with professional racing teams, enthusiasts, federal government agencies, the military, and law enforcement agencies on six continents.</p>
<p>I tested CXC's Motion Pro II, which is equipped with three 55-inch screens, and Considine loaded me into a Radical SR8 racecar at the Watkins Glen circuit. The realistic pedals and steering wheel feedback, as well as subtle tilting at the seat of my pants and seatbelts that tightened under hard braking, all contributed to a fun experience. And as someone who typically suffers from motion sickness, I never felt any nausea creeping in—while appreciating how much the wraparound triple screens contributed to a sense of speed that other single-screen sims entirely lack.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020717#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020717&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Renowned British author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a> is best known for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia"><em>Chronicles of Narnia</em></a>, but Lewis's prolific <em>oeuvre</em> also included a science-fiction trilogy, an allegorical novel, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till_We_Have_Faces">marvelous retelling</a> of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, various nonfiction works of Christian apologetics, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107604702/?tag=arstech20-20">literary criticism</a>. Now, a literary scholar has discovered a previously unknown short poem by Lewis among a cache of documents acquired by the University of Leeds 10 years ago. Written in 1935, the poem has been published for the first time, with an <a href="https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/10.3366/ink.2024.0216">accompanying analysis</a> in the Journal of Inkling Studies.</p>
<p>The journal's title refers to the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inklings">Oxford Inklings</a>," a group of Oxford-based scholars and writers who met regularly to read each others' works aloud, most often at an Oxford pub called The Eagle and Child (aka the Bird and the Baby). In addition to Lewis, the group included J.R.R. Tolkien and Charles Williams. (All three were the main characters of James A. Owens' fantasy series, <em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/series/Chronicles-of-the-Imaginarium-Geographica-The">The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica</a></em>.) I <a href="https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2006/05/random_walks_na.html">once called</a> the Inklings "arguably the literary mythmakers" of their generation.</p>
<p>Lewis and Tolkien shared a love of Norse mythology, and Lewis read the first early drafts of what would become Tolkien's <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. Tolkien later said he owed his friend "an unpayable debt" for convincing him the "stuff" could be more than merely a "private hobby." Tolkien, in turn, was the one who convinced Lewis—an atheist in his youth—to convert to Christianity.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019330#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019330&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Over the course of the last seven decades, the vast majority of satellites have launched into orbit with propulsion mostly as an afterthought. That's not to say having thrusters is not important, but once the vehicle reached its intended orbit, the on-board propulsion was used mainly for station keeping and small maneuvers.</p>
<p>One of the truisms about spaceflight, in fact, has been that a vehicle isn't going anywhere after it reaches a particular orbit. That's because the energy needed to make significant changes in one's orbit around Earth is very high.</p>
<p>In space today, the current choices of on-orbit maneuverability are not optimal. There are conventional rocket-powered thrusters that require an extraordinary amount of propellant to move around. There are ion thrusters, which are significantly more fuel-efficient, but cannot make changes quickly. And that's really about it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020625#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020625&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's more chaos at Tesla this week. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-plans-more-layoffs-as-two-senior-tesla-executives-depart">The Information reports</a> that last night, the company's erratic CEO Elon Musk emailed workers with news that he has dismissed a key pair of executives—one responsible for the Supercharger network and the other head of new vehicle development.</p>
<p>The electric car maker posted its quarterly results last week, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-profits-drop-55-as-elon-musk-dodges-cheap-car-questions/">they paint a poor picture</a>, with shrinking sales and plummeting profit margins. While Tesla once had a strong first-mover advantage and benefited from Musk's marketing savvy, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/experts-say-tesla-has-repeated-car-industry-mistakes-from-the-1980s/">the company has frequently ignored the many hard-learned lessons</a> of the auto industry.</p>
<p>Customers not turned off by Musk's antics instead are losing interest with a product lineup of two EVs that are ancient in car years (the Models S and X) and two EVs that are merely old (the Models 3 and Y). The Models 3 and Y are also the only two vehicles that Tesla sells in volume. Any other automaker would have a second-generation Model 3 ready to go either this year or next, but at Tesla, the product pipeline is empty.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020655#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020655&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Some time next year, NASA believes SpaceX will be ready to link two Starships in orbit for an ambitious refueling demonstration, a technical feat that will put the Moon within reach.</p>
<p>SpaceX is under contract with NASA to supply two human-rated Starships for the first two astronaut landings on the Moon through the agency's Artemis program, which aims to return people to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. The first of these landings, on NASA's Artemis III mission, is currently targeted for 2026, although this is widely viewed as an ambitious schedule.</p>
<p>Last year, NASA awarded a contract to Blue Origin to develop its own human-rated Blue Moon lunar lander, giving Artemis managers two options for follow-on missions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020606#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020606&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
