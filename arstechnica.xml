<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A third person has died in a nationwide bacterial outbreak linked to Boar's Head brand deli meats. Last week, the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/">recalled more than 7 million pounds of its meats</a>, which was in addition to a recall of over 200,000 pounds of meat from July 26. In all, 71 types of products made between May 10, 2024, and July 29, 2024, and sold nationwide have been recalled.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24/index.html">an update Thursday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, the outbreak has now sickened a total of 43 people, an increase from 34 last week. There have been 43 hospitalizations, up from 33 last week. The illnesses are reported from 13 states. The three deaths in the outbreak include one from Illinois and one from New Jersey, and the newly reported death is from Virginia. The CDC expects the tally of illnesses so far to be a significant undercount of actual cases, and additional states may be affected.</p>
<p>The illnesses in the outbreak are caused by <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, a foodborne bacterium that is particularly dangerous to people who are pregnant, people aged 65 years or older, and people who have weakened immune systems. In these high-risk groups, the bacteria are more likely to move beyond the gastrointestinal system to cause an invasive infection called listeriosis. During pregnancy, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or a life-threatening infection in newborns. For non-pregnant people who develop listeriosis, nearly 90 percent require hospitalization, and one in six die.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042033#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042033&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Roombas can be both convenient and fun, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/cats-playing-with-robots-proves-a-winning-combo-in-novel-art-installation/">particularly for cats</a> who like to ride on top of the machines as they make their cleaning rounds. But the obstacle-avoidance cameras collect images of the environment—sometimes rather personal images, as was the case in 2020 when images of a young woman on the toilet captured by a Romba <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/">leaked to social media</a> after being uploaded to a cloud server. It's a vexing problem in this very online digital age, in which Internet-connected cameras are used in a variety of home monitoring and health applications, as well as more public-facing applications like autonomous vehicles and security cameras.</p>
<p>University of Michigan (UM) engineers have been developing a possible solution: PrivacyLens, a new camera that can detect people in images based on body temperature and replace their likeness with a generic stick figure. They have filed a provisional patent for the device, described in a <a href="https://petsymposium.org/popets/2024/popets-2024-0146.php">recent paper</a> published in the Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium, <a href="https://petsymposium.org/2024/program.php">held last month</a>.</p>
<p>"Most consumers do not think about what happens to the data collected by their favorite smart home devices. In most cases, raw audio, images and videos are being streamed off these devices to the manufacturers' cloud-based servers, regardless of whether or not the data is actually needed for the end application," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1051407">said co-author Alanson Sample</a>. "A smart device that removes personally identifiable information (PII) before sensitive data is sent to private servers will be a far safer product than what we currently have."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038906#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038906&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange formerly helmed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/guilty-sam-bankman-fried-convicted-on-all-counts-after-monthlong-trial/">fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, has agreed to pay $12.7 billion to customers blindsided by Bankman-Fried's deceptions covering up FTX's flagrant misuse of customer funds.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CFTC-v-FTX-consent-order-8-8-2024.pdf">order</a> yesterday, US District Judge P. Kevin Castel said that FTX must pay $8.7 billion in restitution to victims of Bankman-Fried's fraudulent scheme, as well as disgorge another $4 billion in "gains received in connection with the violations" to further compensate customers who suffered significant losses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8938-24">According to Ian McGinley</a>, the division of enforcement director for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), "this multi-billion-dollar recovery for victims" is "the largest such recovery in CFTC history."

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Addressing blowback from Sonos' wildly unpopular app redesign will cost the company $20 to $30 million "in the short term," according to CEO Patrick Spence.</p>
<p>In May, Sonos launched an updated app that aggravated <a href="https://en.community.sonos.com/events-at-sonos-229141/sonos-app-redesign-ama-6893676">many users</a> due to its removal of common functions, like <a href="https://mosen.org/sonos2024/">accessibility features and</a> the ability to edit playlists and song queues, use sleep timers, and access local music libraries. Sonos said it wanted to modernize the app's interface and make it easier to navigate. While the app initially succeeded in making certain things quicker, like adjusting the volume, the changes caused <a href="https://en.community.sonos.com/product-updates/14-12-update-6872573">outrage</a> among Sonos' typically loyal <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151704/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-missing-features">user base</a>. In July, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/pained-by-having-let-you-down-sonos-apologizes-for-app-failures/">Spence apologized</a> for the maligned redesign and said Sonos would fix the app with <a href="https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/release-notes-for-sonos-software-updates">biweekly updates</a>.</p>
<p>During Sonos' fiscal Q3 2024 earnings call yesterday, Spence said that fixing the app and managing related customer fallout will cost Sonos millions. The costs come from three primary areas—app updates, customer support, and winning back customers and partners—and are “necessary to right the ship for the long term," Spence said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041920#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041920&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russia is no stranger to unique poisonings. State agents have been known to use everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko">polonium-laced tea</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal">deadly nerve agent "novichok"</a> when making assassination attempts against both defectors in the UK and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexei_Navalny">internal political rivals like Alexei Navalny</a>. But a new "first" in the long history of poisonings was opened this month in the Russian republic of Dagestan, where a 40-something chess player named Amina Abakarova attempted to poison a rival by depositing liquid mercury on and around her chess board.</p>
<p>Malcolm Pein, the English Chess Federation's director of international chess, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/07/russian-chess-player-smears-pieces-mercury-poisons-rival/">told the UK's Telegraph</a> that he had “never seen anything like this before... This is the first recorded case of somebody using a toxic substance, to my knowledge, in the history of the game of chess." Usually, he said, chess rivals confine themselves to "psychological" tactics.</p>
<p>Oliver Carroll, a Ukraine war correspondent for The Economist, summed up the situation with some <a href="https://x.com/olliecarroll/status/1821168219303928248">social media snark</a>: "I know that on the standards of Russian doping it's perhaps only a 7 out of 10.

<p>An advertising industry initiative targeted by an Elon Musk lawsuit is "discontinuing" its activities and has deleted the member list from its website.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Musk's X Corp. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/elon-musk-declares-it-is-war-on-ad-industry-as-x-sues-over-illegal-boycott/">sued the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA)</a> over what X claims is an illegal boycott spearheaded by a WFA initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). The WFA isn't disbanding but is halting GARM's activities, and the <a href="https://wfanet.org/leadership/garm/members-governance">GARM member page</a> now produces a 404 error. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240807225842/https:/wfanet.org/leadership/garm/members-governance">archived version</a> of the page from yesterday shows the initiative members, including X.</p>

But while X may never obtain financial damages from the advertising group or corporations like CVS and Unilever that it also named as defendants, fighting the lawsuit could be costly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041956#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041956&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple hasn't updated its Mac mini desktop lineup <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/m2-pro-mac-mini-review-apples-goldilocks-desktop-for-semi-professionals/">since the beginning of 2023</a>, when it added M2 and M2 Pro chips and discontinued the last of the Intel models. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/mac-mini-m4-apple-plans-to-release-smallest-desktop-computer-yet?srnd=phx-technology">reports</a> that the update drought will end later this year, when the mini will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/report-mac-mini-could-skip-the-apple-m3-jump-right-to-the-m4-in-2024-or-2025/">skip right from the M2 to the M4</a>, something he originally reported back in April.</p>
<p>But the mini will reportedly come with more than just new chips: it will also get a new, smaller design, which Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/mac-mini-m4-apple-plans-to-release-smallest-desktop-computer-yet?srnd=phx-technology">says</a> will be closer in size to an Apple TV box (specifically, he says it may be a bit taller, but will have a substantially smaller footprint). The new mini could have "at least three USB-C ports," as well as a power connector and an HDMI port.</p>
<p>This would be Apple's first overhaul of the Mac mini's design since the original aluminum unibody version was released <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-2-duo-2.4-mid-2010-specs.html">back in June of 2010</a>. That model did include a slot for a built-in SuperDrive DVD burner, something Apple dropped from later models as optical drives became less necessary, but the M2 Mac mini has the same basic design and the same footprint as that Core 2 Duo Mac mini introduced over a decade ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041901#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041901&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, researchers at Google DeepMind <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03906">revealed</a> the first AI-powered robotic table tennis player capable of competing at an amateur human level. The system combines an industrial robot arm called the <a href="https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robots/articulated-robots/irb-1100">ABB IRB 1100</a> and custom AI software from DeepMind. While an expert human player can still defeat the bot, the system demonstrates the potential for machines to master complex physical tasks that require split-second decision-making and adaptability.</p>

<p>"This is the first robot agent capable of playing a sport with humans at human level," the researchers wrote in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03906">preprint paper</a> listed on arXiv. "It represents a milestone in robot learning and control."</p>
<p>The unnamed robot agent (we suggest "AlphaPong"), developed by a team that includes David B. D'Ambrosio, Saminda Abeyruwan, and Laura Graesser, showed notable performance in a series of matches against human players of varying skill levels. In a study involving 29 participants, the AI-powered robot won 45 percent of its matches, demonstrating solid amateur-level play. Most notably, it achieved a 100 percent win rate against beginners and a 55 percent win rate against intermediate players, though it struggled against advanced opponents.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041804#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041804&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The past several years have been absolute scorchers, with 2023 being the warmest year ever recorded. And things did not slow down in 2024. As a result, we entered a stretch where every month set a new record as the warmest iteration of that month that we've ever recorded. Last month, that pattern <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/climate-wise-it-was-a-full-year-of-exceptional-months/">stretched out for a full 12 months</a>, as June of 2024 once again became the warmest June ever recorded. But, despite some exceptional temperatures in July, it fell just short of last July's monthly temperature record, bringing the streak to a close.</p>
<p>Europe's Copernicus system was <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/july-was-second-warmest-record-ending-record-breaking-13-month-streak">first to announce</a> that July of 2024 was ever so slightly cooler than July of 2023, missing out on setting a new record by just 0.04° C. So far, none of the other major climate trackers, such as Berkeley Earth or NASA GISS, have come out with data for July. These each have slightly different approaches to tracking temperatures, and, with a margin that small, it's possible we'll see one of them register last month as warmer or statistically indistinguishable.</p>
<p>How exceptional are the temperatures of the last few years? The EU averaged every July from 1991 to 2020—a period well after climate change had warmed the planet significantly—and July of 2024 was still 0.68° C above that average.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041893#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041893&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/amazon-slash-anthropic-partnership-merger-inquiry">launched </a>a probe into Amazon's $4 billion partnership with the AI firm Anthropic, as it continues to monitor <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-foundation-models-update-paper">how the largest tech companies might seize control of AI</a> to further entrench their dominant market positions.</p>
<p>Through the partnership, "Amazon will become Anthropic’s primary cloud provider for certain workloads, including agreements for purchasing computing capacity and non-exclusive commitments to make Anthropic models available on Amazon Bedrock," the CMA <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6627b69f838212a903a7e668/B._Invitation_to_comment.pdf">said</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon and Anthropic deny there's anything wrong with the deal. But because the CMA has seen "some" foundational model (FM) developers "form partnerships with major cloud providers" to "secure access to compute" needed to develop models, the CMA is worried that "incumbent firms" like Amazon "could use control over access to compute to shape FM-related markets in their own interests."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041859#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041859&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Humane AI Pins were returned at faster rate than they were sold between May and August, according to a report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24211339/humane-ai-pin-more-daily-returns-than-sales">The Verge</a> on Wednesday. The AI gadget released in April to abysmal reviews, and Humane is now reportedly dealing with over $1,000,000 worth of returned product.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-a-700-voice-command-box-definitely-wont-replace-your-phone/2/">AI Pin</a> is a lapel pin that markets numerous features—like an AI voice assistant, camera, and laser projector—which its creators claim will replace smartphones as a go-to gadget. It costs $700 and requires a subscription that costs $24 per month, not including taxes and fees, for cloud storage, cellular data, and a number.</p>
<p>In June, The New York Times, citing two anonymous sources, reported that Humane <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/humane-ai-pin.html">had sold 10,000 of its AI devices</a>. But today, only 7,000 sold units have not been returned, The Verge reported yesterday, citing someone "with direct knowledge." The Verge said it viewed internal sales data showing returns outpacing device/accessory sales of about $9,000,000. Internal data also reportedly revealed that 1,000 AI Pin orders were canceled before they even shipped.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041809#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041809&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've searched your name online in the last few years, you know what's out there, and it's bad. Alternately, you've seen the lowest-common-denominator ads begging you to search out people from your past to see what crimes are on their record. People-search sites are a gross loophole in the public records system, and it doesn't feel like there's much you can do about it.</p>
<p>Not that some firms haven't promised to try. Do they work? Not really, Consumer Reports (CR) suggests in a recent study.</p>
<p>"[O]ur study shows that many of these services fall short of providing the kind of help and performance you'd expect, especially at the price levels some of them are charging," said Yael Grauer, program manager for CR, in <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/consumer-reports-evaluation-of-people-search-site-removal-services-finds-that-they-are-largely-ineffective/">a statement</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041818#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041818&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The NASA program to develop a new upper stage for the Space Launch System rocket is seven years behind schedule and significantly over budget, <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/office-of-inspector-general-oig/nasas-management-of-space-launch-system-block-1b-development/">a new report</a> from the space agency's inspector general finds. However, beyond these headline numbers, there is also some eye-opening information about the project's prime contractor, Boeing, and its poor quality control practices.</p>
<p>The new Exploration Upper Stage, a more powerful second stage for the SLS rocket that made its debut in late 2022, is viewed by NASA as a key piece of its Artemis program to return humans to the Moon. The current plan calls for the use of this new upper stage beginning with the second lunar landing, the Artemis IV mission, currently scheduled for 2028. In NASA parlance, the upgraded version of the SLS rocket is known as Block 1B.</p>
<p>However, for many reasons—including the readiness of lunar landers, Lunar Gateway hardware, a new mobile launch tower, and more—NASA is unlikely to hold that date. Now, based on information in this new report, we can probably add the Exploration Upper Stage to the list.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041826#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041826&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>System76 has released an alpha version of its <a href="https://system76.com/cosmic">Cosmic desktop environment</a> for Linux and Unix-like systems. The Linux hardware firm isn't targeting only its customers with its GNOME replacement; it also hopes to get distro maintainers and app makers on board with its Rust-built, UX-focused desktop.</p>
<p>While the Cosmic desktop will be built into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-system76-pangolin-is-a-solid-15-inch-slab-of-linux-with-a-few-quirks/">the Linux vendor's Pop!_OS</a> (which is also in the alpha ISO), it's also available to other systems, as you might expect. System76 provides drop-in instructions for Fedora and Arch Linux installs, among others.</p>
<p>System76 says it is "excited to see COSMIC integration elevate Linux as a whole," along with what results "from making UX-building more accessible." By building Cosmic natively in the Rust language, System76 also intends to provide a more stable and memory-safe environment for apps.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041716#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041716&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last year, a remarkable thing happened in the car world. Just as it looked like everyone other than Tesla had settled on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/3/">an industry-standard charging plug</a>, the industry moved <em>en masse</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/ford-evs-will-get-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-in-2024/">to the smaller, more elegant plug</a> designed by Tesla.</p>
<p>But native ports won't start showing up in non-Tesla EVs until next year, and more than half of the EVs already on North American roads use J1776 (for AC) and CCS1 (for DC) charge ports. For many drivers, the future will probably involve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/ford-says-customers-will-get-free-adapters-to-use-tesla-superchargers/">keeping an adapter in the trunk</a>. ChargePoint's Omni Port, which debuted this morning, will let drivers forget about their dongles.</p>
<p>"With Omni port, ChargePoint solved the challenges associated with a multiple-connector environment, ensuring Tesla and non-Tesla drivers can continue to expect a world-class driver experience. We are giving drivers and site hosts assurance that ChargePoint will continue to meet all their charging needs now and in the future,” said Rick Wilmer, ChargePoint CEO.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041806#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041806&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google and Meta made a secret deal to target advertisements for Instagram to teenagers on YouTube, skirting the search company’s own rules for how minors are treated online.</p>
<p>According to documents seen by the Financial Times and people familiar with the matter, Google worked on a marketing project for Meta that was designed to target 13- to 17-year-old YouTube users with adverts that promoted its rival’s photo and video app.</p>
<p>The Instagram campaign deliberately targeted a group of users labeled as “unknown” in its advertising system, which Google knew skewed toward under-18s, these people said. Meanwhile, documents seen by the FT suggest steps were taken to ensure the true intent of the campaign was disguised.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041783#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041783&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>During a news conference on Wednesday, NASA officials for the first time publicly discussed divisions within the agency about whether the Starliner spacecraft is really reliable enough to return two veteran astronauts—Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams—back to Earth from the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The space agency also confirmed key elements exclusively reported by Ars over the last week, chiefly that NASA has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/yes-nasa-really-could-bring-starliners-astronauts-back-on-crew-dragon/">quietly been working for weeks</a> with SpaceX on a potential rescue mission for Wilmore and Williams, that the Crew-9 mission launch has been delayed to September 24 to account for this possibility, and that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasa-likely-to-significantly-delay-the-launch-of-crew-9-due-to-starliner-issues/">Starliner is unable to undock autonomously</a> with the current software configuration on the vehicle.</p>
<p>The chief of space human spaceflight operations for NASA, former astronaut Ken Bowersox, said no final decisions have been made on how Wilmore and Williams return to Earth. He said there were reasonable disagreements among engineers at NASA, which is the customer for the spaceflight, and Boeing, which developed and operates Starliner, about the viability of the 28 reaction control system thrusters that are used for delicate maneuvering and pointing of the vehicle.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041586#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041586&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>At 1:18 pm ET on July 21, 2023, President Joe Biden stepped to the podium in the White House's Roosevelt Room and announced, "I'm the AI." The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/07/21/remarks-by-president-biden-on-artificial-intelligence/">official transcript</a> of the event says that this remark was followed by "laughter," but it's no joke to the increasing number of conspiracy theorists who claim that the real Joe Biden has been somehow replaced by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>For instance, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/technology/biden-conspiracy-theories-misinformation.html">new story published today</a>, The New York Times looked at conspiracy theorists who questioned whether (or even claimed that) Biden had died. Of course, if he was dead, the cabal of elites running the Biden administration, in true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_at_Bernie%27s"><em>Weekend at Bernie's</em></a> fashion, certainly couldn't <em>admit</em> that he was dead. Fortunately, they could use AI to make it look like Biden was still alive!</p>
<p>That sort of thinking led to one influencer's "just asking questions" post on July 24, 2024, which was viewed 78,000 times: “What If [sic] during this supposed live broadcast to the nation the holographic AI glitches and Joe Biden dissappears [sic] for a few seconds now that we know the software they have been using in Azure has been compromised?”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041714#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041714&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A deadly outbreak of <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox">mpox</a> (previously called monkeypox) is spilling out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, raising alarm among global health experts.</p>
<p>The DRC has reported more than 22,000 suspected cases since the start of 2023, including 1,200 suspected deaths, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/outbreak/2023-drc.html">according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. A high proportion of the cases are in children younger than 15 years old.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp">the CDC released a health advisory</a> noting that although mpox is endemic to the DRC, the current outbreak is larger and more widespread than any outbreak the country has previously seen. The virus has also spilled over to several neighboring countries in recent months, including the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. The World Health Organization reported that cases have also been detected in Kenya.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041729#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041729&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>So if Disney is starting to make money, why has it decided to jack up prices... <em>again</em>?</p>
<h2>Disney says it has “earned” higher prices</h2>
<p>On October 17, pricing for ad and ad-free subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ will increase by as much as 25 percent, depending on the plan (you can see a breakdown of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/so-tired-disney-hulu-espn-prices-increase-by-up-to-25-percent-in-october/">pricing changes here</a>).
