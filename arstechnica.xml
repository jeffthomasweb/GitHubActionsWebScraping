<p>Whereas the original Dolby Vision was meant to give creators the ability to finely tune exactly how TVs present content in HDR, Dolby Vision 2 appears to significantly broaden that feature to include motion handling as well—and it also tries to bridge the gap between filmmaker intent and the on-the-ground reality of the individual viewing environments.</p>
<p>What does that mean, exactly? Well, Dolby says one of the pillars of Dolby Vision 2 will be "Content Intelligence," which introduces new "AI capabilities" to the Dolby Vision spec. Among other things, that means using sensors in the TV to try to fix the oft-complained-about issue of shows being too dark.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/the-new-dolby-vision-2-hdr-standard-is-probably-going-to-be-controversial/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Daily squirts of a safe, over-the-counter allergy nasal spray may prevent COVID-19 infections from taking hold, according to results <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2838335">published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>. In a mid-staged trial, the spray appeared to reduce infections by promising 67 percent, though a larger trial will need to confirm that robust efficacy.</p>
<p>The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial conducted by researchers at Germany's Saarland University between March 2023 and July 2024. The study included 450 healthy adults, about half of whom (227) spritzed their noses three times a day with the generic antihistamine nasal spray, azelastine, which can be purchased over the counter in the US. The placebo, meanwhile, was a spray with an identical composition except for the absence of the antihistamine. The two groups had similar mixes of previous COVID-19 vaccination and infection statuses.</p>
<p>After about 56 days of frequent mistings, only five people using the allergy spray (2.2 percent) caught a SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 15 people using a placebo (6.7 percent) got the pandemic infection. That 4.5 percentage-point drop represents a 67 percent reduction in COVID-19 cases, though the numbers here are small. Still, the researchers noted that the five people using the allergy spray who contracted COVID-19 took more time to get the infection than the 15 in the placebo group (31 days versus 19.5). This could hint that the spray held off some infections from exposures early in the trial. And when the allergy spray users did get COVID-19, they were positive on a rapid antigen test for less time than those infected in the placebo group (3.4 days versus 5.1 days), suggesting they cleared the virus a bit faster.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/otc-nasal-spray-seemed-to-cut-covid-infections-by-67-in-mid-sized-trial/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has avoided the worst-case scenario in the pivotal search antitrust case brought by the US Department of Justice. DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google doesn't have to give up the Chrome browser to mitigate its illegal monopoly in online search. The court will only require a handful of modest behavioral remedies, forcing Google to release some search data to competitors and limit its ability to make exclusive distribution deals.</p>
<p>More than a year ago, the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">secured a major victory</a> when Google was found to have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/">remedy phase</a> took place earlier this year, with the DOJ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">calling for Google to divest the market-leading Chrome browser</a>. That was the most notable element of the government's proposed remedies, but it also wanted to explore a spin-off of Android, force Google to share search technology, and severely limit the distribution deals Google is permitted to sign.</p>
<p>Mehta has decided on a much narrower set of remedies. While there will be some changes to search distribution, Google gets to hold onto Chrome. The government contended that Google's dominance in Chrome was key to its search lock-in, but Google claimed no other company could hope to operate Chrome and Chromium like it does. Mehta has decided that Google's use of Chrome as a vehicle for search is not illegal in itself, though. "Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture (<em>sic</em>) of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints," the ruling reads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Rhagobot isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind at the mention of a robot. Inspired by <i>Rhagovelia </i>water striders, semiaquatic insects also known as ripple bugs, these tiny bots can glide across rushing streams because of the robotization of an evolutionary adaptation.</p>
<p><i>Rhagovelia </i>(as opposed to other species of water striders) have fan-like appendages toward the ends of their middle legs that passively open and close depending on how the water beneath them is moving. This is why they appear to glide effortlessly across the water’s surface. Biologist Victor Ortega-Jimenez of the University of California, Berkeley, was intrigued by how such tiny insects can accelerate and pull off rapid turns and other maneuvers, almost as if they are flying across a liquid surface.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/robotic-bug-literally-walks-on-water/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday afternoon, while much of the country enjoyed Labor Day, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1962591324022153607">published</a> a new master plan for the company to his social media platform. It's the fourth such document for Tesla, replacing the goals Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/tesla-investor-day-promises-master-plan-3-but-details-are-scant/">laid out in 2023</a> when he said the company would sell 20 million EVs a year in 2030. This time, it is not entirely sure what Tesla's plan actually entails. The text, which reads as though it was written by AI, is at times anodyne, at times confusing, but always free of specifics.</p>
<p>Each iteration of the master plan is Tesla's north star, the new plan reads, promising to "to deliver unconstrained sustainability without compromise," whatever that actually means.</p>
<p>"Now, we are combining our manufacturing capabilities with our autonomous prowess to deliver new products and services that will accelerate global prosperity and human thriving driven by economic growth shared by all," reads the plan.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/tesla-has-a-new-master-plan-it-just-doesnt-have-any-specifics/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The cable industry's top lobbying group has a new president and CEO. Cory Gardner, a Republican who spent 10 years in Congress, was <a href="https://www.ncta.com/news/former-u-s-senator-and-congressman-cory-gardner-named-president-ceo-of-ncta-the-internet-television-association/">announced today</a> as the new head of NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association.</p>
<p>Gardner represented Colorado in the US senate from 2015 to 2021 and was in the US House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. He had to leave the Senate after losing a re-election bid and later became chairman of the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/thune-senate-fundraising-super-pac-trump">Senate Leadership Fund</a>, a <a href="https://senateleadershipfund.org/about/">super PAC devoted to</a> "protecting and expanding the Republican Senate Majority."</p>
<p>Gardner will take over the NCTA's reins on September 22, replacing Michael Powell, who is retiring from the lobby group after nearly 15 years. Before becoming the cable industry's chief lobbyist, Powell was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2001 to 2005. Powell led a Republican majority at the FCC.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/cable-industrys-new-chief-lobbyist-is-a-republican-fundraiser-and-ex-senator/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We're roughly six months into Donald Trump's trade war, and tech firms remain in a fog, unsure what tariffs or retaliations could be coming next.</p>
<p>To shed light on this struggle, we invite you to join us for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/k0dGDVbeedc">Ars Live talk at 3 pm ET </a>on Tuesday, September 2, with Consumer Technology Association (CTA) Vice President of International Trade Edward Brzytwa. We'll be discussing how tech firms are responding to tariffs so far and how looming chip tariffs could pose the biggest hurdle yet in sourcing alternative supply chains. And anyone joining will have an opportunity to ask their biggest questions about how tariffs could impact consumer tech.</p>
<p>Before Trump even took office, experts had warned that his global trade war—imposing tariffs on imports of various goods from various countries in a bid to strike more favorable trade deals for the US—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/laptop-smartphone-and-game-console-prices-could-soar-after-the-election/">risked spiking prices of popular tech products</a> like laptops, game consoles, and smartphones.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/ars-live-consumer-tech-firms-stuck-scrambling-ahead-of-looming-chip-tariffs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Here in the year 2025, it's not every day that a classic gaming console from the 20th century becomes playable via emulation for the first time. But that's just what happened last week with <a href="https://ares-emu.net/news/ares-v146-released?ref=readonlymemo.com">the release of Ares v146</a> and its first-of-its-kind <a href="https://techdocs.exodusemulator.com/Console/PioneerLaserActive/Software.html#emulation">support for Mega LD titles designed for the Pioneer LaserActive</a>.</p>
<p>Even retro console superfans would be forgiven for not knowing about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserActive">LaserActive</a>, a pricey LaserDisc player released in 1994 alongside swappable hardware modules that could add support for Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16 games and controllers. Using those add-ons, you could also play <a href="https://segaretro.org/List_of_LaserActive_games">a handful of games specifically designed for the LaserActive format</a>, which combined game data and graphics with up to 60 minutes of full-screen, standard-definition analog video per side.</p>
<p>Mega-LD games (as the Genesis-compatible LaserActive titles were called) were, for the most part, super-sized versions of the types of games you'd find on early CD-ROM console of the era. That means a lot of edutainment titles, branching dungeon crawlers, <em>Dragon's Lair</em>-style animated quick-time event challenges, and rail shooters that overlayed standard Genesis or TG-16 graphics on top of elaborate animated video backgrounds (sometimes complete with filmed actors).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/over-30-years-later-a-rare-laserdisc-game-console-gets-its-first-pc-emulator/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The sky is falling, and Gmail has supposedly been hacked to bits by malicious parties unknown. Or has it? Reports circulated last week claiming that Gmail was the subject of a major data breach, citing a series of warnings Google has distributed and increasing reports of phishing attacks. The hysteria was short-lived, though. In a brief post on its official blog, <a href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/gmail-security-protections/">Google says</a> that Gmail's security is "strong and effective," and reports to the contrary are mistaken.</p>
<p>This story seems to have developed due to a random confluence of security events. Google experienced a Gmail data breach in June, but the attack was limited to the company's corporate Salesforce server. The hacker was able to access publicly available information like business names and contact details, but no private information was compromised.</p>
<p>Over the following weeks, Google alerted Gmail users to an increase in phishing attacks in July and August. It didn't offer many details, but many believed the spike in phishing was related to the corporate server breach. Indeed, more people are talking about hacking attempts on social media right now. This led to the claim that Gmail's entire user base of 2.5 billion people was about to be hacked at any moment, with some reports advising everyone to change their passwords and enable two-factor authentication. While that's generally good security advice, Google says the truth is much less dramatic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-says-reports-of-massive-gmail-data-breach-are-entirely-false/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>First, there's the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacex-has-built-the-machine-to-build-the-machine-but-what-about-the-machine/">sprawling factory</a> that SpaceX has constructed at its Starbase location along the Gulf Coast in South Texas. The building, known as Starfactory, is designed to produce one Starship per day. A couple of miles to the east, SpaceX has built one Starship launch pad and is preparing to activate a second one.</p>
<p>With Starship, SpaceX seeks to buck the old way of doing things. Tanker trucks have <a href="https://www.airproducts.com/company/news-center/2025/08/0821-air-products-liquid-hydrogen-nasa-kennedy-space-center">traditionally delivered rocket propellant</a> to launch pads at America's busiest spaceports in Florida and California.

<p>Marvel Studios has (mercifully) slowed the pace of new releases of late, but this month we're getting the miniseries <em>Marvel Zombies</em>—and the studio just dropped the official trailer. It's adapted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Zombies">Marvel Comics series</a> and a spinoff of the 2021 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If..._Zombies%3F!"><em>What If...?</em> episode</a> featuring several Avengers in zombified form. It's part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Six.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the 2021 <em>What If...?</em> episode below.)</strong></p>
<p>In the <em>What If...?</em> episode—which retconned the events of <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> and <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>—the trouble started when Hank Pym entered the quantum realm to rescue his wife, Janet. Alas, Janet was now a zombie due to a mysterious quantum virus. Hank was infected in turn right before the pair returned to the lab; Scott Lang/Ant-Man was attacked, but Hank and Janet's daughter, Hope Pym, escaped. Within 24 hours, much of the northwestern US was infected, including many members of the Avengers who showed up to thwart the zombie apocalypse.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/the-avengers-face-an-undead-thanos-in-marvel-zombies-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>All of the original US senators who created and sustained NASA's Space Launch System rocket over the last 15 years—Bill Nelson, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Richard Shelby—have either retired or failed to win reelection. However, a new champion has emerged to continue the fight: Texas Republican Ted Cruz.</p>
<p>He seems an unlikely hero for NASA's large rocket, which costs the federal government more than $2 billion to launch. Cruz, after all, is a self-described pro-capitalist, fiscal conservative. SpaceX and Blue Origin, which are building large and significantly lower-cost alternatives to the SLS rocket, have large operations in Texas. In previous legislative sessions, Cruz has often carried legislation important to the commercial space industry, such as the <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/-sens-cruz-rubio-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-american-space-commerce-act">American Space Commerce Act</a> and the <a href="https://spacenews.com/cruz-plans-to-try-again-with-commercial-space-legislation/">Space Frontier Act</a>.</p>
<p>But now that he chairs the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Cruz has made a significant shift toward supporting the SLS rocket and its chief contractor, Boeing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/ted-cruz-reminds-us-why-nasas-rocket-is-called-the-senate-launch-system/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Despite its lack of upgradeable system memory, Framework has tried to make its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/review-framework-desktop-is-a-mash-up-of-a-regular-desktop-pc-and-the-mac-studio/">Framework Desktop</a> a welcoming platform for upgraders and modders, releasing 3D-printable versions of a few case parts and generally sticking to standard-sized parts and standard connectors.</p>
<p>Often, it's independent creators who are making the weirdest and most interesting mods for Framework's devices, but PC cooling company Noctua has just <a href="https://noctua.at/en/how-to-make-the-framework-desktop-run-even-quieter">announced</a> what amounts to a fairly major cooling upgrade for the Framework Desktop, at least for anyone with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-my-first-few-months-with-a-bambu-lab-a1-3d-printer-part-1/">access to a 3D printer</a>. By printing a new fan duct and a custom side panel, Noctua managed to lower the noise levels of the Framework Desktop's default cooling fan by between five and seven decibels, without replacing or modifying any other components.</p>
<p>The key is apparently the design of the fan grill, which Noctua also used to reduce noise levels in the Noctua edition of <a href="https://noctua.at/en/seasonic-prime-tx-1600-noctua-edition">this 1,600 W Seasonic power supply</a>. The grill has a distinctive spiral pattern that allows the fan to move similar amounts of air at lower rotation speeds, which is where the noise reduction comes from.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/noctuas-3d-printed-mod-singlehandedly-makes-the-framework-desktop-run-quieter/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If Tesla was hoping that decent sales in China might boost the company's fast-diminishing profits, it was a forlorn hope. For the second month in a row, the automaker has experienced a year-over-year decrease in sales in China.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-china-made-ev-sales-drop-year-august-jump-month-2025-09-02/">According to Reuters</a>, Tesla's sales dropped by 4 percent in August compared to the same month in 2024. That's not quite as dire as July, when Tesla saw Chinese sales decrease by 8.4 percent. Much of Tesla's Shanghai factory's slack was taken up by exporting EVs to other markets.</p>
<p>Some of Tesla's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/byd-has-caught-up-with-tesla-in-the-global-ev-race-heres-how/">stiffest competition</a> in China has come from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/a-small-cheap-ev-you-cant-buy-in-the-us-we-test-the-byd-dolphin/">BYD</a>, but the Chinese automaker has started to experience its own struggles at home, too. Yesterday, BYD reported a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/china-urges-halt-auto-industrys-bruising-price-wars-2025-05-31/">30 percent drop</a> in quarterly profits, in part due to the Chinese government telling automakers at the start of the summer that their price war was over.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/chinese-ev-buyers-are-cooling-on-tesla-and-byd/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/building-more-helpful-chatgpt-experiences-for-everyone/">announced</a> plans to roll out parental controls for ChatGPT and route sensitive mental health conversations to its simulated reasoning models, following what the company has called "heartbreaking cases" of users <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/with-ai-chatbots-big-tech-is-moving-fast-and-breaking-people/">experiencing crises</a> while using the AI assistant. The moves come after multiple reported <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">incidents</a> where ChatGPT allegedly failed to intervene appropriately when users expressed suicidal thoughts or experienced mental health episodes.</p>
<p>"This work has already been underway, but we want to proactively preview our plans for the next 120 days, so you won’t need to wait for launches to see where we’re headed," OpenAI wrote in a blog post published Tuesday. "The work will continue well beyond this period of time, but we’re making a focused effort to launch as many of these improvements as possible this year."</p>
<p>The planned parental controls represent OpenAI's most concrete response to concerns about teen safety on the platform so far. Within the next month, OpenAI says, parents will be able to link their accounts with their teens' ChatGPT accounts (minimum age 13) through email invitations, control how the AI model responds with age-appropriate behavior rules that are on by default, manage which features to disable (including memory and chat history), and receive notifications when the system detects their teen experiencing acute distress.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-announces-parental-controls-for-chatgpt-after-teen-suicide-lawsuit/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>WARSAW, Indiana—The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/amazon-backed-startup-wants-to-sell-a-bare-bones-ev-truck-for-20000/">Blank Slate pickup</a> scratches a particular itch for some, fulfilling the desire for an EV powertrain without all the bells and whistles associated with a modern vehicle. Gone is the infotainment screen, the lane-keeping assistance, and, for those concerned about surveillance, a modem. Instead, it's an unpainted modular pickup and can be configured post-production into nearly anything the owner wants. Oh, and it's cheap.</p>
<h2>This Old Factory</h2>
<p>For decades, the RR Donnelley &amp; Sons printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana, pumped out catalogs. Glossy shopping books from JCPenney, Sears, and—my personal favorite—Radio Shack left the plant and were shipped all over the country to eager shoppers looking for their next mail-order delight. Then the Internet broke all of that.</p>

<p>Curved displays in cars are increasingly common, adding a bit of shape to the increasing pixel overload we face behind the steering wheel. The designers of Porsche's upcoming Cayenne Electric, though, decided to do something more dramatic with the touchscreen that commands the center of the forthcoming SUV's dashboard.</p>
<p>Its shape flows between dashboard and center console in a smooth, organic way, with a pronounced bend in the middle. The first time I dragged my finger from top to bottom, traversing that kink, I decided I was going to hate this layout. But a day behind the wheel of a prototype version of Porsche's electric SUV changed my mind. I was left wondering why nobody has used this shape.</p>
<p>That was just one feature out of dozens that impressed in this SUV that promises somewhere north of 1,000 horsepower (745 kW) and something in excess of 300 miles (482 km) of range on a charge. It won't hit dealerships until sometime next year, but early impressions are that it will be worth the wait.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/porsches-next-cayenne-is-fully-electric-we-drove-the-prototype/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission's Republican chairman is eliminating regulations at breakneck speed by using a process that cuts dozens of rules at a time while giving the public only 10 or 20 days to review each proposal and submit objections.</p>
<p>Chairman Brendan Carr started his "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-democrat-to-resign-cementing-republican-majority-for-chairman-carr/">Delete, Delete, Delete</a>" rule-cutting initiative in March and later announced he'd be using the Direct Final Rule (DFR) mechanism to eliminate regulations without a full public-comment period. Direct Final Rule is just one of several mechanisms the FCC is using in the Delete, Delete, Delete initiative. But despite the seeming obscurity of regulations deleted under Direct Final Rule so far, many observers are concerned that the process could easily be abused to eliminate more significant rules that protect consumers.</p>
<p>On July 24, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-deletes-obsolete-telegraph-rabbit-ear-receiver-phone-booth-rules-0">removed</a> what it called "11 outdated and useless rule provisions" related to telegraphs, rabbit-ear broadcast receivers, and phone booths. The FCC said the 11 provisions consist of "39 regulatory burdens, 7,194 words, and 16 pages."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/delete-delete-delete-how-fcc-republicans-are-killing-rules-faster-than-ever/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. August's list includes a 3D digital reconstruction of the Shroud of Turin; injecting succulent leaves with phosphors to create plants that glow in different colors; a nifty shape-changing antenna; and snails with a unique ability to grow back their eyeballs.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous "holy relic" is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin">Shroud of Turin</a>, an old linen cloth that retains a distinct impression of the body of a crucified mine (both front and back). The legend is that Jesus himself was wrapped in the shroud upon his death around 30 CE, although modern scientific dating methods revealed the shroud is actually a medieval artifact dating to between 1260 and 1390 CE. A 3D designer named Cícero Moraes has created a 3D digital reconstruction to lend further credence to the case for the shroud being a medieval forgery, according to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/arcm.70030">a paper</a> published in the journal Archaeometry.</p>
<p>Moraes developed computer models to simulate draping a sheet on both a 3D human form and a bas-relief carving to test which version most closely matched the figure preserved in the shroud. He concluded that the latter was more consistent with the shroud's figure, meaning that it was likely created as an artistic representation or a medieval work of art. It was certainly never draped around an actual body. Most notable was the absence of the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_of_Agamemnon">Agamemnon mask effect</a>," in which a human face shrouded in fabric appears wider once flattened.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/research-roundup-6-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed-2/">Read full article</a></p>

He later called this idea the butterfly effect to communicate that small changes in initial conditions, like a butterfly flapping its wings in Nepal, could produce wildly different outcomes, like rain in New York.</p>
<p>But better understanding those initial conditions and how the biological world couples with the atmospheric one can provide better predictions about the future of the planet—from where umbrellas may be most needed in a given season to where electricity needs might sap the grid.</p>
<p>Today, computers are much more powerful than when Lorenz was working, and scientists use a special kind of simulation that accounts for physics, chemistry, biology, and water cycles to try to grasp the past and predict the future. These simulations, called Earth system models, or ESMs, attempt to consider the planet as a system made up of components that nudge and shove each other. Scientists first developed physical climate models in the 1960s and 1970s, and became better at integrating atmospheric and ocean models in subsequent years. As both environmental knowledge and computing power increased, they began to sprinkle in the other variables, leading to current-day ESMs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/earth-models-can-predict-the-planets-future-but-not-their-own/">Read full article</a></p>
