              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/the-spectacular-downfall-of-a-common-useless-cold-medicine/">In a long-sought move</a>, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday formally began the process of abandoning oral doses of a common over-the-counter decongestant, which the agency concluded last year is not effective at relieving stuffy noses.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FDA issued <a href="https://dps.fda.gov/omuf/ordersearch/order_otc000036">a proposed order</a> to remove oral phenylephrine from the list of drugs that drugmakers can include in over-the-counter products—also known as the OTC monograph. Once removed, drug makers will no longer be able to include phenylephrine in products for the temporary relief nasal congestion.</p>
<p>"It is the FDA’s role to ensure that drugs are safe and effective," Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. "Based on our review of available data and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/fda-proposes-ditching-common-decongestant-for-being-completely-useless/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An international coalition of police agencies has taken a major whack at criminals accused of running a host of online scams, including phishing, the stealing of account credentials and other sensitive data, and the spreading of ransomware, Interpol said recently.</p>
<p>The operation, which ran from the beginning of April through the end of August, resulted in the arrest of 41 people and the takedown of 1,037 servers and other infrastructure running on 22,000 IP addresses. Synergia II, as the operation was named, was the work of multiple law enforcement agencies across the world, as well as three cybersecurity organizations.</p>
<h2>A global response</h2>
<p>“The global nature of cybercrime requires a global response which is evident by the support member countries provided to Operation Synergia II,” Neal Jetton, director of the Cybercrime Directorate at INTERPOL, <a href="https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2024/INTERPOL-cyber-operation-takes-down-22-000-malicious-IP-addresses">said</a>. “Together, we’ve not only dismantled malicious infrastructure but also prevented hundreds of thousands of potential victims from falling prey to cybercrime. INTERPOL is proud to bring together a diverse team of member countries to fight this ever-evolving threat and make our world a safer place.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/law-enforcement-operation-takes-down-22000-malicious-ip-addresses-worldwide/">Read full article</a></p>

The writing and production staff involved might not inspire confidence from fans, though.</p>
<p>The series' writer and executive producer is slated to be Daniel Casey, who until now was best known as the primary screenwriter on <em>F9: The Fast Saga</em>, one of the late sequels in the Fast and the Furious franchise. He was also part of a team of writers behind the relatively little-known 2018 science fiction film <em>Kin</em>.</p>
<p>Karim Zreik will also produce, and his background is a little more encouraging; his main claim to fame is in the short-lived Marvel Television unit, which produced relatively well-received series like <em>Daredevil</em> and <em>Jessica Jones</em> for Netflix before Disney+ launched with its Marvel Cinematic Universe shows.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-is-actually-going-to-be-made/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Subscribing to the Max streaming service is expected to become more costly in 2025. That could mean indirectly, like through another streaming password crackdown, or directly, like through increases to monthly and/or annual subscription prices.</p>
<h2>Password crackdowns as a “form of price rises”</h2>
<p>During the earnings call for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for its fiscal Q3 2024, which ended on September 30, WBD signaled that it's gearing up to roll out its next strategy for growing streaming revenue—charging subscribers extra for sharing passwords—over the next few months. This will start with "very soft messaging" toward Max users before the crackdown intensifies in 2025 and 2026, WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734364-warner-bros-discovery-inc-wbd-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript">said</a>.</p>
<p>Wiedenfels admitted that on their own, password crackdowns are “a form of price rises.” <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/password-crackdown-leads-to-more-income-for-netflix/">Netflix</a> kicked off this form of price hike in the US in May 2023, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/hulu-disney-password-crackdown-kills-account-sharing-on-march-14/">other streaming services</a> have followed. That means Max is behind some rivals when it comes to implementing this restriction. Further, Max has been discussing its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/max-confirms-2024-password-crackdown-explores-adding-transactional-ads/">password crackdown since March</a>, so subscribers could take some comfort in not seeing the restrictions launch sooner.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/11/why-you-can-expect-higher-prices-more-ads-from-max-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Republican who is likely to lead the Federal Communications Commission under President-elect Donald Trump detailed how he would run the agency when he wrote a chapter for the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025. Carr, a longtime opponent of net neutrality rules and other broadband regulations, has also made his views clear numerous times when opposing rulemakings initiated by the current Democratic majority.</p>
<p>If Trump makes Carr the next FCC chairman after his inauguration, the FCC is likely to ditch consumer protection initiatives, like a recently announced inquiry into data caps, and attempt to regulate Big Tech companies while reducing regulation of Internet service providers. That could include forcing Big Tech companies to pay into a fund that subsidizes ISPs' broadband network construction.</p>
<p>A Carr-led FCC could also try to punish news organizations that are perceived to be anti-Trump. Just before the election, Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1852887210330341693">alleged</a> that NBC putting Kamala Harris on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> was "a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule," and that the FCC should <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-rips-nbc-over-harris-last-minute-snl-appearance-plainly-designed-evade-rules">consider issuing penalties</a>. Despite Carr's claim, NBC did provide equal time to the Trump campaign.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trumps-likely-fcc-chair-wrote-project-2025-chapter-on-how-hed-run-the-agency/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Sega has put dozens of its Master System, Genesis, Saturn, and other console titles onto modern game stores over the years. But, like that Dreamcast controller stashed in your childhood garage, they're about to disappear—and getting them back will cost you a nostalgia tax.</p>
<p>Those who have purchased any of <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-gb/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBDWT9PXWHVDPMSZB9EB90">the more than 60 games listed by Sega</a> from Steam, Xbox, Nintendo's Switch store, and the PlayStation store will still have them after 11:59 pm Pacific time on Dec. 26. But after that, for reasons that Sega does not make explicit, they will be "delisted and unavailable." Titles <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sega-genesis-nintendo-switch-online-switch/">specific to the Nintendo Switch Online "Expansion Pack" subscription</a> will remain.</p>
<p>As PC Gamer has suggested, and which makes the most sense, this looks like Sega is getting ready to offer up new "classics" collections on these storefronts. Sega previously rearranged its store shelves to pull Sonic games from online stores and then offer up <em>Sonic Origins. </em>The title <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/review-sega-we-need-to-talk-about-how-you-messed-up-sonic-origins/">underwhelmed Ars at the time</a> and managed to pack in some DLC pitches.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/sega-is-delisting-60-classic-games-from-steam-so-nows-the-time-to-grab-them/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One frustrated customer wants to force Intel to pay untold millions in damages, claiming the company deceptively marketed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/intel-has-finally-tracked-down-the-problem-making-13th-and-14th-gen-cpus-crash/">faulty 13th- and 14th-generation CPUs</a> as "enabling amazing experiences to happen on the PC," when instead products were prone to crashes and blue screens.</p>
<p>In a proposed <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Vanvalkenburgh-v-Intel-Complaint-11-5-24.pdf">class action</a>, a New York man, Mark Vanvalkenburgh, said that he regretted falling for Intel's marketing of its 13th-gen CPU as "the world’s fastest desktop processor" capable of delivering "the best gaming, streaming and recording experience" available today.</p>
<p>He and possibly millions of others "reasonably" believed both the 13th- and 14th-gen CPUs would "perform as advertised"—only to discover they'd purchased a reliably "unstable" product triggering "random screen blackouts and random computer restarts" that <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/intels-raptor-lake-desktop-cpu-bug-what-to-know-what-to-do-now">PC Mag warned</a> perhaps caused "permanent" CPU damage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/man-sick-of-crashes-sues-intel-for-allegedly-hiding-cpu-defects/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you've been wanting an electric car but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/think-evs-are-too-expensive-here-are-11-for-under-40k/">everything seems too expensive</a>, there's some good news on the horizon. A whole lot of EV leases are due to expire in 2026, which should lead to something of a glut, according to data analyzed by JD Power.</p>
<p>We have the revised IRS clean vehicle tax credit to thank. This was revamped under the Inflation Reduction Act, and while tough new battery sourcing rules and a requirement for final assembly in North America have meant many fewer EVs are eligible for the tax credit when bought new, a loophole that considers a leased vehicle to be a commercial sale means any leased EV is eligible for the $7,500 incentive, which can now be subtracted from the price of the EV at the time of sale or leasing.</p>
<p>Since there's also no price cap on the EV or income cap on the buyer, leasing is often a better idea than purchasing outright when it comes to new EVs, particularly for people who are worried about long-term battery degradation. (In fact, this is an overblown fear that is not backed up by data from older EVs, other than the early Nissan Leaf, which does not have active battery cooling.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/second-hand-evs-will-flood-the-market-in-2026-jd-power-says/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[It has just the right mix of spreadability, stickiness, and friction to give pitchers a better grip on the ball.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Since the 1940s, baseball players have been spreading a special kind of "magic mud" on new baseballs to reduce the slick, glossy shine and give pitchers a firmer grip. Now, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania have identified just what gives that magic mud its special properties, according to a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2413514121">new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Before magic mud came along, baseballs were treated with a mix of water and soil from the infield or, alternatively, tobacco juice or shoe polish. But these substances stained and scratched up the ball's leather surface. Lena Blackburne was a third-base coach for the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1930s when an umpire complained about that, so he hunted for a better mud. Blackburne found that mud in a still-secret location purportedly near Palmyra, New Jersey, and a baseball dynasty was born: Lena Blackburne Baseball Rubbing Mud. Once harvested, the mud is strained, skimmed of excess water, rinsed with tap water, and then subjected to a secret "proprietary treatment" before being allowed to settle.</p>
<p>Yet there hasn't been much scientific research on the magic mud apart from one<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-022-00317-4"> 2022 study</a>. We do know quite a bit about the complex behavior of soil in general, including mud. Per the authors, mud is essentially "a dense suspension of predominantly clay and silt particles in water," sometimes with a bit of sand in the mix, although this has little effect on how mud behaves under shearing forces (rheology). Technically, it falls into the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/this-stretchy-electronic-material-hardens-upon-impact-just-like-oobleck/">non-Newtonian fluid</a> category, in which the viscosity changes (either thickening or thinning) in response to an applied strain or shearing force, thereby straddling the boundary between liquid and solid behavior.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/what-makes-baseballs-magic-mud-so-special/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ars Technica descended in force last week upon our nation's capital, setting up shop in the International Spy Museum for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/join-ars-in-dc-for-infrastructure-cocktails-and-spycraft-on-october-29/">a three-panel discussion</a> on artificial intelligence, infrastructure, security, and how compliance with policy changes over the next decade or so might shape the future of business computing in all its forms. Much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/ars-in-san-jose-recap-infrastructure-sustainability-ai-cocktails/">our San Jose event last month</a>, the venue was packed to the rafters with Ars readers eager for knowledge (and perhaps some free drinks, which is definitely why I was there!). A bit over 200 people were eventually herded into one of the conference spaces in the venue's upper floors, and Ars Editor-in-Chief Ken Fisher hopped on stage to take us in.</p>

And from what I'm reading online, many folks are starting to have this dream that generative AI is going to lead them into a world where they can replace a lot of SaaS services where they can make a pivot to first-party data."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/recap-ars-in-dc/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Mercedes-Benz is hard at work putting the finishing touches on the next generation of its sleek CLA sedan. Due to be officially introduced next year, it will feature the latest and greatest in Mercedes' powertrain technology and software, and ahead of that formal reveal, the automaker sent out some images of a camouflaged CLA being driven around its test track in southern Germany by company CEO Ola Källenius.</p>
<p>The next CLA will be the first Mercedes to use the new MB.OS as its underlying operating system, a Linux-based system that also runs QNX in a hypervisor for the safety-critical stuff like the dashboard display. CEO Källenius <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/mercedes-ceo-tells-ars-about-its-new-operating-system/">gave Ars a run-through</a> of MB.UX in 2023, explaining that while it will still work with third parties, it remains in charge.</p>
<p>"We are the full architects of the stack. That doesn't mean we need to program every line of code. It doesn’t make technological sense, and it doesn’t make economic sense," he told Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/mercedes-benz-previews-next-cla-breaks-ev-distance-record-in-testing/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1854238332534108188">merely tweeted</a> "chat.com," announcing that the company had acquired the short domain name, which now points to the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> AI assistant when visited in a web browser. As of Thursday morning, "chatgpt.com" still hosts the chatbot, with the new domain serving as a redirect.</p>
<p>The new domain name comes with an interesting backstory that reveals a multimillion-dollar transaction. HubSpot founder and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharmesh">Dharmesh Shah</a> purchased chat.com for $15.5 million in early 2023, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289768/openai-chat-chatgpt-sam-altman-hubspot">reports</a>. Shah sold the domain to OpenAI for an undisclosed amount, though he <a href="https://x.com/dharmesh/status/1854307883304792294">confirmed on X</a> that he "doesn't like profiting off of people he considers friends" and that he received payment in company shares by revealing he is "<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">now an investor in OpenAI.</span>"</p>
<p>As The Verge's Kylie Robison points out, Shah originally bought the domain to promote conversational interfaces. "The reason I bought chat.com is simple: I think Chat-based UX (#ChatUX) is the next big thing in software. Communicating with computers/software through a natural language interface is much more intuitive. This is made possible by Generative A.I.," Shah <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230401190954/https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dharmesh_chatux-ai-chatux-activity-7046856167502848001-Rmxa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">wrote</a> in a LinkedIn post during his brief ownership.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/multimillion-dollar-domain-chat-com-now-points-to-chatgpt/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Clouds form when water vapor—an invisible gas in the atmosphere—sticks to tiny floating particles, such as dust, and <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/">turns into liquid water droplets or ice crystals</a>. In a newly published study, we show that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestair.4c00146">microplastic particles can have the same effects</a>, producing ice crystals at temperatures 5° to 10° Celsius (9° to 18° Fahrenheit) warmer than droplets without microplastics.</p>
<p>This suggests that microplastics in the air may affect weather and climate by producing clouds in conditions where they would not form otherwise.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=-XRtlGEAAAAJ">atmospheric</a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&amp;user=t-_jCPkAAAAJ">chemists</a> who study how different types of particles form ice when they come into contact with liquid water. This process, which occurs constantly in the atmosphere, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nucleation">is called nucleation</a>.</p>
<p>Clouds in the atmosphere can be made up of <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/clouds">liquid water droplets, ice particles, or a mixture</a> of the two. In clouds in the mid- to upper atmosphere where temperatures are between 32° and minus 36° F (0° to minus 38° C), ice crystals normally form around mineral dust particles from dry soils or biological particles, such as pollen or bacteria.</p>
<p>Microplastics are less than 5 millimeters wide—about the size of a pencil eraser. Some are microscopic. Scientists have found them in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c03441">Antarctic deep seas</a>, the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet">summit of Mount Everest,</a> and <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/in-a-first-microplastics-are-found-in-fresh-antarctic-snow-180980264/">fresh Antarctic snow</a>. Because these fragments are so small, they can be easily <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/Scientists-race-study-microplastic-pollution/100/i7">transported in the air</a>.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZEETyzql0Q?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>Ice in clouds has important effects on weather and climate because most precipitation typically <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/precipitation/#">starts as ice particles</a>.</p>
<p>Many cloud tops in nontropical zones around the world extend high enough into the atmosphere that cold air causes some of their moisture to freeze. Then, once ice forms, it <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/clouds/cloud_development/clouds.htm">draws water vapor</a> from the liquid droplets around it, and the crystals grow heavy enough to fall. If ice doesn’t develop, clouds tend to evaporate rather than causing rain or snowfall.</p>
<p>While children learn in grade school that water freezes at 32° F (0° C), that’s not always true. Without something to nucleate onto, such as dust particles, water <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/clouds/cloud_development/clouds.htm">can be supercooled</a> to temperatures as low as minus 36° F (minus 38° C) before it freezes.</p>
<p>For freezing to occur at warmer temperatures, some kind of material that won’t dissolve in water needs to be present in the droplet. This particle provides a surface where the first ice crystal can form. If microplastics are present, they could cause ice crystals to form, potentially increasing rain or snowfall.</p>
<p>Clouds also <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-climate/">affect weather and climate</a> in several ways. They reflect incoming sunlight away from Earth’s surface, which has a cooling effect, and absorb some radiation that is emitted from Earth’s surface, which has a warming effect.</p>
<p>The amount of sunlight reflected depends on <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Clouds/clouds.php">how much liquid water vs. ice a cloud contains</a>. If microplastics increase the presence of ice particles in clouds compared with liquid water droplets, this shifting ratio could change clouds’ effect on Earth’s energy balance.</p>

<h2>How we did our work</h2>
<p>To see whether microplastic fragments could serve as nuclei for water droplets, we used four of the most prevalent types of plastics in the atmosphere: low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polyethylene terephthalate. Each was tested both in a pristine state and after exposure to ultraviolet light, ozone, and acids. All of these are present in the atmosphere and could affect the composition of the microplastics.</p>
<p>We suspended the microplastics in small water droplets and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZoDeNnTAz-Y">slowly cooled the droplets to observe when they froze</a>. We also analyzed the plastic fragments’ surfaces to determine their molecular structure, since ice nucleation could depend on the microplastics’ surface chemistry.</p>
<p>For most of the plastics we studied, 50 percent of the droplets were frozen by the time they cooled to minus 8° F (minus 22° C). These results parallel those from another recent study by Canadian scientists, who also found that some types of microplastics <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c02639">nucleate ice at warmer temperatures</a> than droplets without microplastics.</p>
<p>Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, ozone, and acids tended to decrease ice nucleation activity on the particles. This suggests that ice nucleation is sensitive to small chemical changes on the surface of microplastic particles. However, these plastics still nucleated ice, so they could still affect the amount of ice in clouds.</p>
<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>
<p>To understand how microplastics affect weather and climate, we need to know their concentrations at the altitudes where clouds form. We also need to understand the concentration of microplastics compared with other particles that could nucleate ice, such as mineral dust and biological particles, to see whether microplastics are present at comparable levels. These measurements would allow us to model the impact of microplastics on cloud formation.</p>
<p>Plastic fragments come in many sizes and compositions. In future research, we plan to work with plastics that contain additives, such as plasticizers and colorants, as well as with smaller plastic particles.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Mac mini will celebrate its 20th birthday in January. And I think the M4 version of the Mac mini is far and away the most appealing one the company has ever made.</p>
<p>When it was introduced during the white plastic heyday of peak iPod-era Apple, the Mac mini was pitched as the cheapest way to buy into the Mac ecosystem. It was $499. And despite some fluctuation (as high as $799 for the entry-level 2018 mini, $599 for this year's refresh), the Mac mini has stayed the cheapest entry-level Mac ever since.</p>
<p>But the <em>entry-level</em> models always left a lot to be desired. The first Mac mini launched with just 256MB of RAM, a pretty anemic amount even by the standards of the day. The first Intel Mac mini in 2006 came with a single-core Core Solo processor, literally the last single-core Mac Apple ever released and the only single-core Intel Mac. The 2018 Mac mini's Core i3 processor left a lot to be desired for the price. The 8GB of RAM included in the basic M1 and M2 Mac minis was fine for many things but left very little headroom for future growth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/review-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-are-probably-apples-best-mac-minis-ever/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The M4 iMac is a nice computer.</p>
<p>Apple's addition of 16GB RAM to the basic $1,299 model makes it a whole lot more appealing for the vast majority of people who just want to take the computer out of the box and plunk it on a desk and be done. New USB-C accessories eliminate some of the last few Lightning ports still skulking around in Apple's lineup. The color options continue to be eye-catching in a way that evokes the original multicolored plastic ones without departing too far from the modern aluminum-and-glass Apple aesthetic. The $200 nano-texture display option, included in the review loaner that Apple sent us, is lovely, though I lightly resent having to pay more for a matte screen.</p>

<p>This is all I <em>really</em> have to say about this iMac, because it's externally nearly identical to the M1 and M3 versions of the same machine that Apple has been selling for three years now. The M4 isn't record-setting fast, but it is quick enough for the kinds of browsing and emailing and office stuff that most people will want to use it for—the fully enabled 10-core version is usually around as fast as a recent Intel Core i5/Core Ultra 5 or an AMD Ryzen 5 desktop CPU, though using just a fraction of the power, and with a respectable integrated GPU that's faster than anything Intel or AMD is shipping in that department.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/thoughts-on-the-m4-imac-and-making-peace-with-the-death-of-the-27-inch-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>From its halo-like orbit nearly a million miles from Earth, the James Webb Space Telescope is seeing farther than human eyes have ever seen.</p>
<p>In May, astronomers announced that Webb detected the most distant galaxy found so far, a fuzzy blob of red light that we see as it existed just 290 million years after the Big Bang. Light from this galaxy, several hundreds of millions of times the mass of the Sun, traveled more than 13 billion years until photons fell onto Webb's gold-coated mirror.</p>
<p>A few months later, in July, scientists released an image Webb captured of a planet circling a star slightly cooler than the Sun nearly 12 light-years from Earth. The alien world is several times the mass of Jupiter and the closest exoplanet to ever be directly imaged. One of Webb's science instruments has a coronagraph to blot out bright starlight, allowing the telescope to resolve the faint signature of a nearby planet and use spectroscopy to measure its chemical composition.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/more-and-more-astronomers-are-eager-to-use-the-james-webb-space-telescope/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Kids and teens can make some pretty hairbrained choices sometimes. But when a kid's choice is to engage in a TikTok challenge that threatens their life, psychiatrists can struggle to understand if it was just an exasperating poor choice born out of impulsivity and immaturity or something darker—an actual suicide attempt.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2825421">a Viewpoint published today in JAMA Psychiatry</a>, two psychiatrists from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center at Memphis raise the alarm about the dangers and complexities of TikTok challenges. They're an "emerging public health concern" for kids, the psychiatrists write, and they're blurring the lines between unintentional injuries and suicide attempts in children and teens.</p>
<p>The child and adolescent psychiatrists Onomeasike Ataga and Valerie Arnold say that their psychiatry team first saw injuries from TikTok challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the trend has continued since the pandemic eased. Over recent years, they've seen children and teens hospitalized from a variety of challenges, including the "blackout challenge," in which participants attempt to choke themselves until they pass out; the "Benadryl challenge," in which participants ingest a large amount of the allergy medicine to get high and hallucinate; and the "fire challenge," in which participants pour a flammable liquid on their body and light it on fire. In these cases, the psychiatry team is sometimes called in to help assess whether the children and teens had an intent to self-harm. It's often hard to determine—and thus hard to decide on treatment recommendations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/for-fame-or-a-death-wish-kids-tiktok-challenge-injuries-stump-psychiatrists/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A few weeks before the US presidential election, Donald Trump suggested that a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/googles-ai-deals-could-hurt-its-search-monopoly-appeal-expert-says/">breakup of Google's search business</a> may not be an appropriate remedy to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/all-the-possible-ways-to-destroy-googles-monopoly-in-search/">destroy the tech giant's search monopoly</a>.</p>
<p>"Right now, China is afraid of Google," Trump said at <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?539131-1/president-trump-interview-economic-club-chicago">a Chicago event</a>. If that threat were dismantled, Trump suggested, China could become a greater threat to the US, because the US needs to have "great companies" to compete.</p>
<p>Trump's comments came about a week after the US Department of Justice proposed remedies in the Google monopoly trial, including mulling a breakup.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/fate-of-googles-search-empire-could-rest-in-trumps-hands/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Early Wednesday morning, Donald Trump became the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/trump-wins-presidency.html">presumptive winner</a> of the 2024 US presidential election, setting the stage for dramatic changes to federal AI policy when he takes office early next year. Among them, Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/trump-allies-want-to-make-america-first-in-ai-with-sweeping-executive-order/">has stated</a> he plans to dismantle President Biden's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/biden-ai-executive-order-requires-safety-testing-for-ai-that-poses-serious-risk/">AI Executive Order</a> from October 2023 immediately upon taking office.</p>
<p>Biden's order established wide-ranging oversight of AI development. Among its core provisions, the order established the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/feds-appoint-ai-doomer-to-run-us-ai-safety-institute/">US AI Safety Institute</a> (AISI) and lays out requirements for companies to submit reports about AI training methodologies and security measures, including vulnerability testing data. The order also directed the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop guidance to help companies identify and fix flaws in their AI models.</p>
<p>Trump supporters in the US government have criticized the measures, as TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/what-trumps-victory-could-mean-for-ai-regulation/">points out</a>. In March, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) warned that reporting requirements could discourage innovation and prevent developments like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>. And Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) characterized NIST's AI safety standards as an attempt to control speech through "woke" safety requirements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/trump-victory-signals-major-shakeup-for-us-ai-regulations/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Whew—the big event is finally behind us. I'm talking, of course, about the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/welcome-to-our-latest-design-update-ars-9-0/">Ars Technica version 9 redesign</a>, which we rolled out last month in response to your survey feedback and which we have iterated on extensively in the weeks since. The site is now fully responsive and optimized for mobile browsing, with a sleek new look and great user options.</p>
<p>In response to your comments, our tireless tech and design team of Jason and Aurich have spent the last few weeks adding a font size selector, tweaking the default font and headline layout, and adding the option for orange hyperlinks. Plus, they rolled out an all-new, subscriber-only "wide mode" for Ars superfans who need 100+ character line lengths in their lives. Not enough? Jason and Aurich also tweaked the overall information density (especially on mobile), added next/previous story buttons to articles, and made the nav bar "sticky" on mobile, all in response to your feedback. (Read more about our two post-launch rounds of updates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-9-0-1-redesign-is-now-live-with-density-tweaks-and-visited-link-colors/">here</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/the-ars-redesign-9-0-2-brings-the-text-options-youve-requested/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>If that's <em>still</em> not enough site goodness, Jason and Aurich are currently locked in their laboratory, cooking up a brand-new "true light" theme and big improvements to commenting and comment voting.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/11/the-ars-redesign-is-out-experience-its-ad-free-glory-for-just-25-year/">Read full article</a></p>
