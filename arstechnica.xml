<p>Given its recent manufacturing troubles, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/amds-ryzen-ai-300-series-laptop-cpus-are-its-first-for-new-copilot-pcs/">resurgent AMD</a>, an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/">incursion from Qualcomm</a>, and Apple’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/review-apples-efficient-m3-macbook-airs-are-just-about-as-good-as-laptops-get/">shift from customer to competitor</a>, it’s been a rough few years for Intel’s processors. Computer buyers have more viable options than they have in many years, and in many ways the company’s Meteor Lake architecture was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/intels-meteor-lake-cpus-bring-a-much-faster-gpu-radically-new-chip-design/">more interesting as a technical achievement</a> than it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/intel-intros-first-meteor-lake-chips-with-faster-gpus-and-worse-single-core-speed/">as an upgrade</a> for previous-generation Raptor Lake processors.</p>
<p>But even given all of that, Intel still provides the vast majority of PC CPUs—nearly four-fifths of all computer CPUs sold are Intel’s, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7173194948257808385/">recent analyst estimates from Canalys</a>. The company still casts a long shadow, and what it does still helps set the pace for the rest of the industry.</p>

<p>Enter its next-generation CPU architecture, codenamed Lunar Lake. We’ve known about Lunar Lake for a while—Intel reminded everyone it was coming when Qualcomm upstaged it during Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC reveal—but this month at Computex the company is going into more detail ahead of availability sometime in Q3 of 2024.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028454#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028454&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cloud storage provider Snowflake said that accounts belonging to multiple customers have been hacked after threat actors obtained credentials through info-stealing malware or by purchasing them on online crime forums.</p>
<p>Ticketmaster parent Live Nation—which <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1335258/000133525824000081/lyv-20240520.htm?=7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343">disclosed Friday</a> that hackers gained access to data it stored through an unnamed third-party provider—<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/live-nation-confirms-ticketmaster-was-hacked-says-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/">told TechCrunch</a> the provider was Snowflake. The live-event ticket broker said it identified the hack on May 20, and a week later, a “criminal threat actor offered what it alleged to be Company user data for sale via the dark web.”</p>
<p>Ticketmaster is one of six Snowflake customers to be hit in the hacking campaign, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/112538305342479437">said</a> independent security researcher Kevin Beaumont, citing conversations with people inside the affected companies. Australia’s Signal Directorate <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/112538305342479437">said Saturday</a> it knew of “successful compromises of several companies utilizing Snowflake environments.” Researchers with security firm Hudson Rock said in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240531140540/https://hudsonrock.com/blog/snowflake-massive-breach-access-through-infostealer-infection">now-deleted post</a> that Santander, Spain’s biggest bank, was also hacked in the campaign. The researchers cited online text conversations with the threat actor. Last month, Santander <a href="https://www.santander.com/en/stories/statement">disclosed</a> a data breach affecting customers in Chile, Spain, and Uruguay.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028710#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028710&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Kids and teens with a high body mass index (BMI) were 29 times more likely to have a high fat mass index compared with youths who had lower BMIs, making the controversial metric a "very good screening tool," according to <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-065960/197382/Screening-Accuracy-of-BMI-for-Adiposity-Among-8-to">a study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics</a>.</p>
<p>The study adds to the long-standing debate about the use of BMI, which has always been an imperfect proxy for assessing a person's body fat, aka adiposity. Last year, the American Medical Association adopted a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/american-medical-assoc-blasts-bmi-for-historical-harm-racist-exclusion/">strongly worded policy</a> calling out the calculation's "significant limitations" and "historical harms," including "racist exclusion," because its use is largely based on white populations. But other experts have pushed back, arguing that the maligned metric is still a quick, low-cost, tool for assessing the health and risks of patients.</p>
<p>BMI, calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared, has long been used as a shorthand way of assessing a person's adiposity. In children, high BMIs are associated with cardiovascular disease risks later in life. But, the metric can also be misleading. Because it is based solely on weight and height, it does not distinguish between fat and lean mass. As such, athletes with relatively large amounts of lean muscle mass can easily have BMIs that put them in the categories of having overweight or obesity, while those with little lean mass but high fat mass can still have BMIs in a normal range. BMI also does not tell clinicians anything about body fat distribution, which can be important for health risks. And research has found that the relationship between BMI and adiposity can differ by race and ethnicity. For instance, at the same BMI, Black children tend to have less adiposity than white children.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028705#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028705&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It doesn't seem like PlayStation VR2 is having quite the same success as its predecessor, which was a runaway hit at a moment when public curiosity and investment in VR were at an all-time high. Nonetheless, it's one of the most advanced VR headsets available—tied to a tiny library on the PS5.</p>
<p>That's about to change, as Sony has confirmed its plans to launch a PC adapter for the headset on August 7. It will cost $60, and it will, at a minimum, let PSVR2 owners play a large library of SteamVR titles, provided their PCs meet the minimum specifications.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">Sony's blog post</a> about the adapter says players will need a Steam account, so it's unclear how or whether you can use the headset to dive into PC VR experiences through various channels besides Steam.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028680#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028680&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>China landed a spacecraft on the Moon this weekend for the fourth time, successfully placing its Chang’e 6 lander in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the far side of the Moon.</p>
<p>After the landing on Saturday evening (United States time), the autonomous spacecraft will spend about 48 hours collecting samples. It will do so by two different means, drilling to collect material from beneath the ground, as well as using a robotic arm to gather regolith from the surface.</p>
<p>Then a part of the spacecraft is due to blast off from the surface of the Moon—likely on Monday evening, US time—before making a return flight to China. If successful, this would be the first time samples have been returned to Earth from the far side of the Moon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028564#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028564&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In August 1926, American champion swimmer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Ederle">Gertrude "Trudy" Ederle</a> became the first woman to swim the English Channel, completing the 21-mile feat in 14 hours and 34 minutes—a record that would stand until 1950. She was just a few months shy of her 21st birthday. It's the kind of classic sports story tailor-made for the silver screen, and Disney has obliged with its new biopic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Woman_and_the_Sea"><em>The Young Woman and the Sea</em></a>, starring Daisy Ridley as Ederle.</p>
<p>The daughter of a butcher in Manhattan, Ederle learned to swim in New Jersey and joined the Women's Swimming Association (WSA) at the age of 12. She quickly excelled at the American crawl stroke, setting the world record in the 880-yard freestyle that same year—the youngest swimmer to do so. She would go on to hold 29 US national and world records between 1921 and 1925. She competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics, winning gold in the 4x100 meter relay and bronze medals in two other individual races.</p>
<p>After her Olympic triumph, Ederle became a professional swimmer, completing the 22 miles between Battery Park to Sandy Hook in 7 hours and 11 minutes in 1925. Her nephew would later describe it as a "warm-up" for swimming the English Channel. The WSA sponsored Ederle's first attempt that same year, but her trainer, Jabez Wolffe, ordered her pulled from the water, disqualifying the attempt. Ederle was angry about that decision and found a new coach in Bill Burgess for her second attempt. This time she succeeded and was rewarded with a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan with some 2 million people cheering her on.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027358#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027358&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

For most of us, the question of search rankings is just "are my web results good or bad," but the SEO community is both thrilled to get a peek behind the curtain and up in arms since the docs apparently contradict some of what Google has told them in the past. Most of the commentary on the leak is from SEO experts <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/">Rand Fishkin</a> and <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">Mike King</a>.</p>
<p>Google confirmed the authenticity of the documents to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167407/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-confirmation">The Verge</a>, saying, “We would caution against making inaccurate assumptions about Search based on out-of-context, outdated, or incomplete information. We’ve shared extensive information about how Search works and the types of factors that our systems weigh, while also working to protect the integrity of our results from manipulation.”</p>
<p>The fun thing about accidentally publishing to the GoogleAPI GitHub is that, while these are sensitive internal documents, Google technically released them under an Apache 2.0 license. That means anyone who stumbled across the documents was granted a "perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license" to them, so these are freely available online now, like <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/api-reference.html">here</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028484#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028484&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After keeping Spotify Premium subscription pricing flat since debuting it in 2011, Spotify increased monthly pricing in July 2023 and will do so again in July 2024, it announced today.</p>
<p>Individual monthly subscriptions will increase from $11 per month to $12/month. Family plans, which support up to six members, will go from $17/month to $20/month. Duo plans, for two accounts, are rising from $15/month to $17/month. Spotify didn’t announce pricing changes for its Student ($6/month) or free plans.</p>
<p>Spotify said it's increasing prices so that it can “continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028575#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028575&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If there is any reason to head into your garage or attic and dig out that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/09/playstation-move-1/">PlayStation Move controller</a>, it's <em>Johann Sebastian Joust. </em>Actually, there's a second good reason: that game, and three others with the same spirit, are all free now on Steam for PlayStation, Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<p><em></em>The reason and timing are unfortunate, as Die Gute Fabrik, the Danish developer collective behind <em>Sportsfriends</em>, can no longer support or update the 10-year-old game. But the group is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/277850/discussions/0/4356745862494842519/">doing the right thing</a>, making the game free on all platforms, including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/277850/Sportsfriends/">Steam</a>, transferring ownership of the game to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/chromes-autoplay-video-blocker-is-accidentally-killing-web-based-games/">Bennett Foddy</a> (<em>Getting Over It</em>), and working to open-source a version of the<em> JS Joust</em> game for Linux so that perhaps it can be fit to work with other motion-sensitive controllers or through some other scheme.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Sunday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reached beyond <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Blackwell</a> and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/computex-2024-jensen-huang/">revealed</a> the company's next-generation AI-accelerating GPU platform during his keynote at Computex 2024 in Taiwan. Huang also detailed plans for an annual <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchips-designed-for-accelerated-generative-ai-enter-full-production">tick-tock</a>-style upgrade cycle of its AI acceleration platforms, mentioning an upcoming Blackwell Ultra chip slated for 2025 and a subsequent platform called "Rubin" set for 2026.</p>

<p>Nvidia's data center GPUs currently power a large majority of cloud-based AI models, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, in both development (training) and deployment (inference) phases, and investors are keeping a close watch on the company, with expectations to keep that run going.</p>
<p>During the keynote, Huang seemed somewhat hesitant to make the Rubin announcement, perhaps wary of invoking the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect">Osborne effect</a>, whereby a company's premature announcement of the next iteration of a tech product eats into the current iteration's sales. "This is the very first time that this next click as been made," Huang said, holding up his presentation remote just before the Rubin announcement. "And I'm not sure yet whether I'm going to regret this or not."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028431#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028431&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>New cars have gotten pretty expensive, and it feels like electric cars are especially pricey. The average sale price of a new car has dropped a couple of thousand dollars since it peaked in early 2023, but at more than $47,400 in April, sticker shock is understandable, particularly as interest rates have doubled over the course of the past two years. Based on reader feedback, that impression is particularly pronounced when it comes to new electric vehicles. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/ev-prices-drop-up-to-20-as-new-and-used-inventory-surges/">But EV prices have actually been falling</a>, and inventory is growing. So we put together a list of all the new EVs on sale today for less than the average transaction price of a new car. You can buy 17 different EVs for less than the average price of a new car, and 11 are available for less than $40,000.</p>
<h2>Nissan Leaf</h2>
<div class="image shortcode-img center"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Nissan-Leaf-2.jpg"><img alt="The Leaf is the cheapest new EV on sale today." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Nissan-Leaf-2-980x653.jpg"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Nissan-Leaf-2.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">The Leaf is the cheapest new EV on sale today.</a> (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)</p></div>
<p>First on the list is the Nissan Leaf, which starts at just $28,140 for the version with a 40 kWh battery pack. Nissan was an early EV pioneer, and the current Leaf is the second generation to wear the name. But it hasn't always been on the cutting edge, and some of the Leaf's specs that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/12/the-all-new-2018-nissan-leaf-driven/">felt a little outdated in 2017</a> may feel more so in 2024. The Leaf is eligible for a $3,750 IRS clean vehicle tax credit.</p>
<h2>Mini SE</h2>
<div class="image shortcode-img center"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2020-Mini-Cooper-SE-15.jpg"><img alt="There's an old joke where I come from. &quot;How do you get to Wales in a Mini,&quot; it asks, except instead of &quot;to Wales&quot; the country, the joke is &quot;two whales,&quot; and the answer is &quot;one in the front, one in the back.&quot; Such jokes are unlikely to be repeated about the new battery electric Mini Cooper SE, but if they are, the answer will probably be &quot;slowly, because you have to stop and charge it a lot.&quot; " src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2020-Mini-Cooper-SE-15-980x735.jpg"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2020-Mini-Cooper-SE-15.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">There's an old joke where I come from. "How do you get to Wales in a Mini," it asks, except instead of "to Wales" the country, the joke is "two whales," and the answer is "one in the front, one in the back." Such jokes are unlikely to be repeated about the new battery electric Mini Cooper SE, but if they are, the answer will probably be "slowly, because you have to stop and charge it a lot." </a> (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)</p></div>
<p>With new tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, no one is entirely sure when the next electric Mini Cooper will go on sale in the US. But right now, you can buy the current Mini Cooper SE for a starting price of $30,900. Although the suspension can feel stiffer than a supercar's, if you live in a city and don't need mega-miles of range, the Mini <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/05/the-electric-2020-mini-cooper-se-big-driving-fun-little-driving-range/">fits the bill quite effectively</a> and is much more of a hoot to drive (and much cheaper) than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/the-2021-mini-john-cooper-works-gp-bonkers-but-too-little-fun/">the John Cooper Works GP mini</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028494#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028494&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Much like the invigorating passage of a strong cold front, major changes are afoot in the weather forecasting community. And the end game is nothing short of revolutionary: an entirely new way to forecast weather based on artificial intelligence that can run on a desktop computer.</p>
<p>Today's artificial intelligence systems require one resource more than any other to operate—data. For example, large language models such as ChatGPT voraciously consume data to improve answers to queries. The more and higher quality data, the better their training, and the sharper the results.</p>

          <p>
            AMD is announcing Ryzen 9000 and Zen 5, the second CPU architecture for its AM5 platform.                          [credit:

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>


<p>It’s been almost two years since AMD introduced its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/ryzen-7600x-and-7950x-review-zen-4-starts-off-expensive-but-impressive/">Ryzen 7000 series desktop CPUs</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-zen-4-socket-am5-and-amds-newest-chipsets/">Zen 4 CPU architecture</a>. Today, AMD is announcing the first concrete details about their successors. The Ryzen 9000 CPUs begin shipping in July.</p>
<p>At a high level, the Ryzen 9000 series and Zen 5 architecture offer mostly incremental improvements over Ryzen 7000 (Ryzen 8000 on the desktop is used exclusively for Zen 4-based G-series CPUs with more powerful integrated GPUs). AMD says that Zen 5 is roughly 16 percent faster than Zen 4 at the same clock speeds, depending on the workload—certainly not nothing, and there are some workloads that perform much better. But that number is far short of the 29 percent jump between Zen 3 and Zen 4.</p>
<p>AMD and Intel have both compensated for mild single-core performance improvements in the past by adding more cores, but Ryzen 9000 doesn’t do that. From the 9600X to the 9950X, the chips offer between 6 and 16 full-size Zen 5 cores, the same as every desktop lineup since Zen 2 and the Ryzen 3000 series. De-lidded shots of the processors indicate that they're still using a total of two or three separate chiplets: one or two CPU chiplets with up to 8 cores each, and a separate I/O die to handle connectivity. The CPU chiplets are manufactured on a TSMC N4 process, an upgrade from the 5nm process used for Ryzen 7000, while the I/O die is still made with a 6nm TSMC process.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028305#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028305&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Less than two years ago, AMD <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/amd-is-making-laptop-cpu-model-numbers-simultaneously-less-and-more-confusing/">announced</a> that it was overhauling its numbering scheme for laptop processors. Each digit in its four-digit CPU model numbers picked up a new meaning, which, with the help of a detailed reference sheet, promised to inform buyers of exactly what it was they were buying.</p>

<p>One potential issue with this, as we pointed out at the time, was that this allowed AMD to change over the first and most important of those four digits every single year that it decided to re-release a processor, regardless of whether that chip actually included substantive improvements or not. Thus a “Ryzen 7730U” from 2023 would look two generations newer than a Ryzen 5800U from 2021, despite being essentially identical.</p>
<p>AMD is partially correcting this today by abandoning the self-described “decoder ring” naming system and resetting it to something more conventional.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027786#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027786&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            AMD's Ryzen AI 300 series is its next-gen laptop platform, and the first to support Copilot+ PC features.                          [credit:

<p>AMD’s next-generation laptop processors are coming later this year, joining new Ryzen 9000 desktop processors and ushering in yet another revamp to the way AMD does laptop CPU model numbers.</p>
<p>But the big thing the company wants to push is the new chips’ performance in generative AI and machine-learning workloads—it’s putting “Ryzen AI” right in the name and emphasizing the presence of an improved neural processing unit (NPU) that meets and exceeds Microsoft’s performance requirements for Copilot+ PCs. The new Ryzen AI 300-series, codenamed Strix Point, succeeds the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/amds-new-ryzen-8040-laptop-chips-look-a-lot-like-the-ryzen-7040-cpus/">Ryzen 8040 chips from earlier this year</a>, which were themselves a relatively mild refresh for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/amd-is-ready-to-launch-its-twice-delayed-ryzen-7000-chips-for-lightweight-laptops/">Ryzen 7040 processors</a> less than a year before.</p>
<p>AMD promises performance of up to 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS) with its new third-generation NPU, a significant boost from the 10 to 16 TOPS offered by Ryzen 7000 and 8000 processors with NPUs. This would make it faster than the 45 TOPS offered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus in the first wave of Copilot+ compatible PCs, and also Intel’s projected performance for its next-generation Core Ultra chips, codenamed Lunar Lake. All exceed Microsoft’s Copilot+ requirement of 40 TOPS, which enables some Windows 11 features that aren’t normally available on typical PCs. Copilot+ PCs can do more AI processing locally on device rather than relying on the cloud, potentially improving performance and giving users more privacy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028308#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028308&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You’re driving somewhere, eyes on the road, when you start to feel a tingling sensation in your lower abdomen. That extra-large Coke you drank an hour ago has made its way through your kidneys into your bladder. “Time to pull over,” you think, scanning for an exit ramp.</p>
<p>To most people, pulling into a highway rest stop is a profoundly mundane experience. But not to neuroscientist Rita Valentino, who has studied how the brain senses, interprets, and acts on the bladder’s signals. She’s fascinated by the brain’s ability to take in sensations from the bladder, combine them with signals from outside of the body, like the sights and sounds of the road, then use that information to act—in this scenario, to find a safe, socially appropriate place to pee. “To me, it’s really an example of one of the beautiful things that the brain does,” she says.</p>
<p>Scientists used to think that our bladders were ruled by a relatively straightforward reflex—an “on-off” switch between storing urine and letting it go. “Now we realize it’s much more complex than that,” says <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/organization/divisions/division-neuroscience-behavior-dnb/office-director-od">Valentino</a>, now director of the division of neuroscience and behavior at the National Institute of Drug Abuse. An intricate network of brain regions that contribute to functions like decision-making, social interactions, and awareness of our body’s internal state, also called <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2022/vital-crosstalk-between-breath-brain">interoception</a>, participates in making the call.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028330#p3">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028330&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Did the massive scale of death in the Americas following colonial contact in the 1500s affect atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels? That’s a question scientists have debated over the last 30 years, ever since <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/95jd03410">they noticed a sharp drop in CO<sub>2</sub></a> around the year 1610 in air preserved in Antarctic ice.</p>
<p>That drop in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels is the only significant decline in recent millennia, and scientists <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:CLIM.0000004577.17928.fa">suggested</a> that it was caused by reforestation in the Americas, which resulted from their depopulation via pandemics unleashed by early European contact. It is so distinct that it was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14258">proposed as a candidate</a> for the marker of the beginning of a new geological epoch—the “Anthropocene.”</p>
<p>But the record from that ice core, taken at Law Dome in East Antarctica, shows that CO<sub>2</sub> starts declining a bit late to match European contact, and it plummets over just 90 years, which is too drastic for feasible rates of vegetation regrowth. A different ice core, drilled in the West Antarctic, showed a more gradual decline starting earlier, but lacked the fine detail of the Law Dome ice.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028113#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028113&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A computer controlling the Atlas V rocket's countdown triggered an automatic hold less than four minutes prior to liftoff of Boeing's commercial Starliner spacecraft Saturday, keeping the crew test flight on the ground at least a few more days.</p>
<p>NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already aboard the spacecraft when the countdown stopped due to a problem with a ground computer. "Hold. Hold. Hold," a member of Atlas V launch team called out on an audio feed.</p>
<p>With the hold, the mission missed an instantaneous launch opportunity at 12:25 pm EDT (16:25 UTC), and later Saturday, NASA announced teams will forego a launch opportunity Sunday. The next chance to send Starliner into orbit will be 10:52 am EDT (14:52 UTC) Wednesday. The mission has one launch opportunity every one-to-two days, when the International Space Station's orbital track moves back into proper alignment with the Atlas V rocket's launch pad in Florida.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028368#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028368&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
