                            <![CDATA[<p>For many species, producing an embryo is a bit of a contest between males and females. Males want as many offspring as possible, and want the females to devote as many resources as possible to each of them. Females do better by keeping their options open and distributing resources in a way to maximize the number of offspring they can produce over the course of their lives.</p>
<p>In mammals, this plays out through the chemical modification of DNA, a process called imprinting. Males imprint their DNA by adding methyl modifications to it in a way that alters the activity of genes in order to promote the growth of embryos. Females do similar things chemically but focus on shutting down genes that promote embryonic growth. In a handful of key regions of the genome, having only the modifications specific to one sex is lethal, as the embryo can't grow to match its stage of development.</p>
<p>One consequence of this is that you normally can't produce embryos using only the DNA from eggs or from sperm. But over the last few years, researchers have gradually worked around the need for imprinted sites to have one copy from each parent. Now, in a very sophisticated demonstration, researchers have used targeted editing of methylation to produce mice from the DNA of two sperm.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/researchers-get-viable-mice-by-editing-dna-from-two-sperm/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It has been just over 130 days since <em>Civilization VII</em> launched to mostly positive reviews—but quite a bit of disappointment for series traditionalists. At first, developer Firaxis was releasing primarily bug, balance, and UI fixes, but today saw the release of version 1.2.2—possibly the biggest yet in terms of adding features to the game.</p>
<p>Available for all platforms except Switch and Switch 2—which will get it later—the update adds several tweaks that allow the game's players to customize games in a more granular way, with a particular emphasis on the ability to disable controversial new additions that a subset of players felt took things too far from the traditional Civ experience.</p>
<p>Many of the new options are available in the advanced settings menu during game setup, though one of the major additions is in the standard setup screen: large and huge map sizes. (Both of these new sizes have a default civilization/player count of 10.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/civilization-vii-patch-lets-you-turn-off-some-controversial-new-features/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Republican proposal to penalize states that regulate artificial intelligence can move forward without requiring approval from 60 senators, the Senate parliamentarian decided on Saturday. But the moratorium on state AI laws did not have unanimous Republican support and has reportedly been watered down in an effort to push it toward passage.</p>
<p>In early June, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/ted-cruz-bill-states-that-regulate-ai-will-be-cut-out-of-42b-broadband-fund/">proposed</a> enforcing a 10-year moratorium on AI regulation by making states ineligible for broadband funding if they try to impose any limits on development of artificial intelligence. While the House previously <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text">approved</a> a version of the so-called "One Big Beautiful Bill" with an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">outright 10-year ban on state AI regulation</a>, Cruz took a different approach because of the Senate rule that limits inclusion of "extraneous matter" in budget reconciliation legislation.</p>
<p>Under the Senate's <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RL30862">Byrd rule</a>, a senator can object to a potentially extraneous budget provision. A motion to waive the Byrd rule requires a vote of 60 percent of the Senate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/ted-cruz-cant-get-all-republicans-to-back-his-fight-against-state-ai-laws/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As with any operating system that ushers in a major new look and feel, this year's Apple operating systems and their new Liquid Glass aesthetic will likely merit some extra attention from power users who want to see all the new stuff and developers who suddenly need to acclimate to a new design language. Apple put out one early beta build of all of its new operating systems after its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote a couple of weeks ago—these updates are the first to standardize on year-based version numbering, making them all version 26—and today the company has formally released the second developer betas of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">iOS 26</a>, iPadOS 26, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-26-release-notes">macOS 26</a>, and most of its other updates.</p>
<p>For those who don't normally dabble in Apple's beta programs, the company offers two tracks: a developer beta and a public beta. The developer beta builds are offered earlier but tend to be buggier and less stable, and they change more from release to release. The public betas, which typically hit in mid- to late-July, are usually roughly the same code as the third or fourth developer beta and represent a nearer-to-final, more stable experience. Once the public betas begin, both developer and public beta builds are usually updated more or less in lockstep, though the developer betas are still usually available slightly earlier.</p>
<p>Apple used to gate its developer betas behind a $99-per-year developer program paywall. While app developers who want to distribute apps on Apple's App Stores still need to pay that fee, two years ago Apple began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/how-to-install-ios-17-and-macos-14-developer-betas-now-that-anyone-can-do-it/">making developer betas available</a> to anyone who signed up for a free <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">developer account</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apple-releases-new-beta-builds-of-all-its-flashy-new-liquid-glass-ified-os-updates/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“The Cyber Centre is aware of malicious cyber activities currently targeting Canadian telecommunications companies,” officials for the center, the Canadian government’s primary cybersecurity agency, said in a <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-threat-bulletin-prc-cyber-actors-target-telecommunications-companies-global-cyberespionage-campaign">statement</a>. “The responsible actors are almost certainly PRC state-sponsored actors, specifically Salt Typhoon.” The FBI issued its own nearly <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2025/250620.pdf">identical statement</a>.</p>
<h2>A major security lapse</h2>
<p>Salt Typhoon is the name researchers and government officials use to track one of several discreet groups known to hack nations all over the world on behalf of the People's Republic of China. In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/actively-exploited-cisco-0-day-with-maximum-10-severity-gives-full-network-control/">October 2023</a>, researchers disclosed that hackers had backdoored more than 10,000 Cisco devices by exploiting CVE-2023-20198, a vulnerability with a maximum severity rating of 10.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/suspected-china-state-hackers-exploited-patched-flaw-to-breach-canadian-telecom/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-confronts-user-panic-over-court-ordered-retention-of-chatgpt-logs/">court ordered OpenAI to "indefinitely" retain all ChatGPT logs</a>, including deleted chats, of millions of users, two panicked users tried and failed to intervene. The order sought to preserve potential evidence in a copyright infringement lawsuit raised by news organizations.</p>
<p>In May, Judge Ona Wang, who drafted the order, rejected the first user's <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Motion-to-Intervene-5-19-25.pdf">request</a> on behalf of his company simply because the company should have hired a lawyer to draft the filing. But more recently, Wang <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Order-6-20-25.pdf">rejected</a> a second claim from another ChatGPT user, and that order went into greater detail, revealing how the judge is considering opposition to the order ahead of oral arguments this week, which were urgently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-says-court-forcing-it-to-save-all-chatgpt-logs-is-a-privacy-nightmare/">requested by OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p>The second <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Motion-to-Intervene-6-6-25.pdf">request</a> to intervene came from a ChatGPT user named Aidan Hunt, who said that he uses ChatGPT "from time to time," occasionally sending OpenAI "highly sensitive personal and commercial information in the course of using the service."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-rejects-claim-that-forcing-openai-to-keep-chatgpt-logs-is-mass-surveillance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://omgubuntu.co.uk/2025/01/microsoft-edit-cli-text-editor-ubuntu">released</a> a modern remake of its classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor">MS-DOS Editor</a>, bringing back a piece of computing history that first appeared in <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/ms-dos/50">MS-DOS 5.0</a> back in 1991. The new open source tool, built with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and simply called "Edit," works on Windows, macOS, and—in a twist that would have seemed unlikely three decades ago—Linux.</p>
<p>The cross-platform availability has delighted longtime users who never expected to see Microsoft's text editor running on their preferred operating system. "30 years of waiting, and I can use MS Edit on Linux," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/1kqmjd1/30_years_of_waiting_and_i_can_use_ms_edit_on_linux/">wrote</a> one Reddit user, capturing the nostalgic appeal of running a genuinely useful version of a Microsoft DOS utility on a Unix-like system.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the second time in two months, United Launch Alliance sent a batch of 27 broadband Internet satellites into orbit for Amazon on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Just like the last flight on April 28, an Atlas V rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and delivered Amazon's satellites into an on-target orbit roughly 280 miles (450 kilometers) above Earth. This was the second launch of a full load of operational satellites for Amazon's Project Kuiper, a network envisioned to become a competitor to SpaceX's Starlink.</p>
<p>The Atlas V launched at 6:54 am EDT (10:54 UTC) on Monday, a week after ULA scrubbed the mission's first countdown to address a problem with the rocket's Russian-made RD-180 main engine. With that issue resolved, ULA's launch team gave a "go" for Monday morning's sunrise liftoff.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/crunch-time-well-soon-find-out-if-amazons-launch-providers-are-up-to-the-job/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google hasn't been talking about Chromebooks as much since AI became its all-consuming focus, but that's changing today with a bounty of new AI features for Google-powered laptops. Newer, more powerful Chromebooks will soon have image generation, text summarization, and more built into the OS. There's also a new Lenovo Chromebook with a few exclusive AI goodies that only work thanks to its overpowered hardware.</p>
<p>If you have a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/chromebook-plus-laptops-debut-with-hardware-requirements-exclusive-features/">Chromebook Plus</a> device, which requires a modern CPU and at least 8GB of RAM, your machine will soon get a collection of features you may recognize from other Google products. For example, Lens is expanding on Chrome OS, allowing you to long-press the launcher icon to select any area of the screen to perform a visual search. Lens also includes text capture and integration with Google Calendar and Docs.</p>
<p>Gemini models are also playing a role here, <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14/">according to Google</a>. The Quick Insert key, which debuted last year, is gaining a new visual element. It could already insert photos or emoji with ease, but it can now also help you generate a new image on demand with AI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/06/google-brings-new-gemini-features-to-chromebooks-debuts-first-on-device-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla’s robotaxi service, touted by Elon Musk as the future of his flagging electric-car maker, launched in the company’s home city of Austin, Texas, on Sunday with about 10 vehicles and a human safety driver on board amid regulatory scrutiny of its self-driving technology.</p>
<p>Shares in Tesla have risen about 50 percent from this year’s low in early April, with investors hopeful the autonomous ride-hailing service will help revive a company that has suffered declining sales and a consumer backlash against Musk’s political activism.</p>
<p>Despite the hype surrounding Tesla’s robotaxi, the launch—with a company employee seated in the passenger side for safety while leaving the driver’s seat empty—was low-key, and the initial service was open only to a select group of social media influencers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/tesla-launches-robotaxi-service-in-austin/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>If you want to learn more about how and where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age">Vikings sailed</a>, making the journey through the fjords yourself in replica boats is a practical, hands-on approach to achieving that end. Greer Jarrett, an archaeologist at Lund University in Sweden, has spent the last three years doing just that, sailing more than 5,000 kilometers along known Viking trade routes in open, spare-rigged clinker boats similar to those used by the Vikings.</p>
<p>Not only has Jarrett learned a great deal about the boats themselves, he also identified four possible havens along the Norwegian coast, part of what may have been a decentralized network that played a crucial role in trade and travel during that period. And those ports are located farther out to sea than other major ports and hubs known to date, according to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-025-09708-6">a paper</a> he published in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory.</p>
<p>It's just the latest intriguing discovery enabled by the growing field of experimental archaeology, whereby researchers seek to reverse-engineer all manner of ancient technologies. Experimental archaeologists have, for instance, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/these-scientists-built-their-own-stone-age-tools-to-figure-out-how-they-were-used/">built their own versions</a> of Early Upper Paleolithic adzes, axes, and chisels. The resulting fractures and wear enabled them to develop new criteria for identifying the likely functions of ancient tools. Others have tried to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/hand-me-that-flint-flake-archaeologists-butcher-cook-fowl-like-a-neanderthal/">cook like</a> the Neanderthals, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-archaeology/articles/10.3389/fearc.2024.1411853/full">concluding that</a> flint flakes were surprisingly effective for butchering birds, and that roasting the birds damages the bones to such an extent that it's unlikely they would be preserved in the archaeological record.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/this-archaeologist-built-a-replica-boat-to-sail-like-the-vikings/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Large Hadron Collider is one of the biggest experiments in history, but it’s also one of the hardest to interpret. Unlike seeing an image of a star in a telescope, saying anything at all about the data that comes out of the LHC requires careful statistical modeling.</p>
<p>“If you gave me a theory [that] the Higgs boson is this way or that way, I think people imagine, 'Hey, you built the experiment, you should be able to tell me what you're going to see under various hypotheses!’” said Daniel Whiteson, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. “But we don't.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/how-a-grad-student-got-lhc-data-to-play-nice-with-quantum-interference/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The $1.4 billion Psyche mission, built to explore an asteroid with the same name, has four electric thrusters fueled by xenon gas. Psyche's solar-electric propulsion system is more fuel-efficient than conventional rocket thrusters, and it works by flowing xenon through an electromagnetic field, which ionizes the gas and expels the ions at high speed to produce thrust.</p>
<p>The plasma engines generate lower thrust than chemical rocket engines, but they can accumulate years of run time over the course of a mission, enabling a spacecraft to make significant changes in its velocity to steer its way through space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/psyche-keeps-its-date-with-an-asteroid-but-now-its-running-in-backup-mode/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Legend has it that physicist Ernest Rutherford once dismissed all sciences other than physics as mere "stamp collecting." (Whether he actually said it is a matter of some debate.) But we now live in the information age, and scientists have found tremendous value in amassing giant databases of information for large-scale analysis, enabling them to explore different kinds of questions.</p>
<p>The latest addition is the Marine Organismal Body Size (MOBS) database, an open-access resource that—as its name implies—has collected body size data for more than 85,000 marine animal species and counting, ranging from microscopic creatures like zooplankton to the largest whales. MOBS is already enabling new research on the ocean's biodiversity and global ecosystem, according to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.70062">a paper</a> published in the journal Global Ecology and Biogeography. The database is <a href="https://github.com/crmcclain/MOBS_OPEN">now available through GitHub</a> and currently covers 40 percent of all described marine animal species, with a goal of achieving 75 percent coverage.</p>
<p>"We've really lacked that broader perspective for a lot of ocean life," marine ecologist Craig McClain of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette told Ars. McClain is the lead creator of MOBS. "We know about evolution and ecology for mammals and birds especially, and to a lesser extent reptiles and amphibians. We just haven't had these big collated body size data sets for the marine groups, especially the invertebrates." The MOBS project is basically constructing a "library of [marine] life."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/new-body-size-database-for-marine-animals-is-a-library-of-life/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>John Belizaire says he has a secret hiding in plain sight. But before revealing it, the CEO of Soluna, a green data center development firm headquartered in Albany, New York, asks people to picture the last time they drove through a gusty stretch of countryside and saw wind turbines in the distance. But when they zoom into that frame, he asks, did they notice that not all of those turbines were spinning despite it being windy?</p>
<p>It’s not typically because they’re broken, Belizaire said. It’s because they’ve been turned off.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/how-a-data-center-company-uses-stranded-renewable-energy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Today marks the 50th anniversary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)"><em>Jaws</em></a>, Steven Spielberg's blockbuster horror movie based on the bestselling novel by Peter Benchley. We're marking the occasion with a tribute to this classic film and its enduring impact on the popular perception of sharks, shark conservation efforts, and our culture at large.</p>
<p><strong>(Many spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Jaws</em> tells the story of Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), the new police chief for Amity Island, a New England beach town and prime summer tourist attraction. But that thriving industry is threatened by a series of shark attacks, although the local mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), initially dismisses the possibility, ridiculing the findings of visiting marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). The attacks keep escalating and the body count grows, until the town hires a grizzled shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt down and kill the great white shark, with the help of Brody and Hooper.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-shark-scientist-reflects-on-jaws-at-50/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Microsoft's Azure Quantum group announced that it has settled on a plan for getting error correction on quantum computers. While the company pursues <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/microsoft-builds-its-first-qubits-lays-out-roadmap-for-quantum-computing/">its own hardware efforts</a>, the Azure team is a platform provider that currently gives access to several distinct types of hardware qubits. So it has chosen a scheme that is suitable for several different quantum computing technologies (notably excluding its own). The company estimates that the system it has settled on can take hardware qubits with an error rate of about 1 in 1,000 and use them to build logical qubits where errors are instead 1 in 1 million.</p>
<p>While it's describing the scheme in terms of mathematical proofs and simulations, it hasn't shown that it works using actual hardware yet. But one of its partners, Atom Computing, is accompanying the announcement with a description of how its machine is capable of performing all the operations that will be needed.</p>
<h2>Arbitrary connections</h2>
<p>There are similarities and differences between what the company is talking about today and IBM's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ibm-is-now-detailing-what-its-first-quantum-compute-system-will-look-like/">recent update of its roadmap</a>, which described another path to error-resistant quantum computing. In IBM's case, it makes both the software stack that will perform the error correction and the hardware needed to implement it. It uses chip-based hardware, with the connections among qubits mediated by wiring that's laid out when the chip is fabricated. Since error correction schemes require a very specific layout of connections among qubits, once IBM decides on a quantum error correction scheme, it can design chips with the wiring needed to implement that scheme.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/microsoft-lays-out-its-path-to-useful-quantum-computing/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>MIT graduate student Alex Kachkine once spent nine months meticulously restoring a damaged baroque Italian painting, which left him plenty of time to wonder if technology could speed things up. Last week, MIT News <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/restoring-damaged-paintings-using-ai-generated-mask-0611">announced</a> his solution: a technique that uses AI-generated polymer films to physically restore damaged paintings in hours rather than months. The research <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09045-4">appears</a> in Nature.</p>
<p>Kachkine's method works by printing a transparent "mask" containing thousands of precisely color-matched regions that conservators can apply directly to an original artwork. Unlike traditional restoration, which permanently alters the painting, these masks can reportedly be removed whenever needed. So it's a reversible process that does not permanently change a painting.</p>
<p>"Because there's a digital record of what mask was used, in 100 years, the next time someone is working with this, they'll have an extremely clear understanding of what was done to the painting," Kachkine told MIT News. "And that's never really been possible in conservation before."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/mit-student-prints-ai-polymer-masks-to-restore-paintings-in-hours/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>About two months after receiving a donated kidney, a 61-year-old man ended up back in the hospital. He was tired, nauseous, and vomiting. He was also excessively thirsty and producing too much urine. Over the next 10 days, things only got worse. The oxygen levels in his blood began to fall. His lungs filled with fluid. He kept vomiting. He couldn't eat. Doctors inserted a feeding tube. His oxygen levels and blood pressure kept falling. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation. Still, things kept getting worse.</p>
<p>At that point, he was transferred to the ICU of Massachusetts General Hospital, where he had received the transplant. He was in acute respiratory failure and shock.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510">a case report in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, doctors at Mass General explained how they determined what was wrong with the man. Their first steps were collecting more information about the man's symptoms from his wife, reviewing his family medical history, and contacting the regional organ-procurement organization that provided the kidney.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/mans-health-crashes-after-getting-donated-kidney-it-was-riddled-with-worms/">Read full article</a></p>
