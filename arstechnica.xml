                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the world’s premier security organizations has canceled the results of its annual leadership election after an official lost an encryption key needed to unlock results stored in a verifiable and privacy-preserving voting system.</p>
<p>The International Association of Cryptologic Research (IACR) <a href="https://www.iacr.org/news/item/27138">said Friday</a> that the votes were submitted and tallied using <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/about">Helios</a>, an open source voting system that uses peer-reviewed cryptography to cast and count votes in a verifiable, confidential, and privacy-preserving way. Helios encrypts each vote in a way that assures each ballot is secret. Other cryptography used by Helios allows each voter to confirm their ballot was counted fairly.</p>
<h2>An “honest but unfortunate human mistake”</h2>
<p>Per the association’s bylaws, three members of the election committee act as independent trustees. To prevent two of them from colluding to cook the results, each trustee holds a third of the cryptographic key material needed to decrypt results.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/cryptography-group-cancels-election-results-after-official-loses-secret-key/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A man in Ireland earned the unpleasant distinction of developing an exceedingly rare infection on his penis—one that has a puzzling origin, but may be connected to his work with dead animals.</p>
<p>According to an article published in<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/asmcr.00141-25"> ASM Case Reports</a> on Thursday, the 57-year-old man went to a hospital in Dublin after his penis became red, swollen, and painful over the course of a week. He also had a fever. Doctors promptly admitted him to the hospital and noted that he had received a kidney transplant 15 years prior. As such, he was on immunosuppressive drugs, which keep his body from rejecting the organ, but could also allow infections to run amok.</p>
<p>Initial blood work found hints of an infection, and the doctors initially suspected a bacterial skin infection (cellulitis) had taken hold in his nether region. So, they put him on some standard antibiotics for that. But his penis only got worse, redder, and more swollen. This prompted consultation with infectious disease doctors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/why-you-dont-want-to-get-tuberculosis-on-your-penis/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We all know streaming services’ usual tricks for making more money: get more subscribers, charge those subscribers more money, and sell ads. But science streaming service Curiosity Stream is taking a new route that could reshape how streaming companies, especially <a href="2.%09https:/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/these-are-the-best-streaming-services-you-arent-watching/">niche options</a>, try to survive.</p>
<p>Discovery Channel founder John Hendricks launched Curiosity Stream in 2015. The streaming service costs $40 per year, and it doesn’t have commercials.</p>
<p>The streaming business has grown to also include the Curiosity Channel TV channel. CuriosityStream Inc. also makes money through original programming and its Curiosity University educational programming. The firm turned its first positive net income in its fiscal Q1 2025, after about a decade of business.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/curiosity-stream-expects-to-make-most-of-its-money-from-ai-deals-by-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the past couple of weeks, friends and colleagues have made me aware of multiple ingeniously implemented, browser-based ways to play classic MS-DOS and Windows games with other people on basically any hardware.</p>
<p>The late 1990s and early 2000s were the peak of multiplayer gaming for me. It was the era of real-time strategy games and boomer shooters, and not only did I attend many LAN parties, but I also played online with friends.</p>
<p>That’s still possible today with several old-school games; there are Discord servers that arrange scheduled matches of <em>Starsiege Tribes</em>, for example. But oftentimes, it’s not exactly trivial to get those games running in modern Windows, and as in the old days, you might have some annoying network configuration work ahead of you—to say nothing of the fact that many folks who were on Windows back in those days are now on macOS or Linux instead.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/return-to-the-year-2000-with-classic-multiplayer-dos-games-in-your-browser/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Asus routers have been hacked and are under the control of a suspected China-state group that has yet to reveal its intentions for the mass compromise, researchers said.</p>
<p>The hacking spree is either primarily or exclusively targeting seven models of Asus routers, all of which are no longer supported by the manufacturer, meaning they no longer receive security patches, researchers from SecurityScorecard <a href="https://securityscorecard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/STRIKE_Asus_WrtHug-Report_V6.pdf">said</a>. So far, it’s unclear what the attackers do after gaining control of the devices. SecurityScorecard has named the operation WrtHug.</p>
<h2>Staying off the radar</h2>
<p>SecurityScorecard said it suspects the compromised devices are being used similarly to those found in ORB (operational relay box) networks, which hackers primarily use to conduct espionage to conceal their identity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/thousands-of-hacked-asus-routers-are-under-control-of-suspected-china-state-hackers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While AI bubble talk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/were-in-an-llm-bubble-hugging-face-ceo-says-but-not-an-ai-one/">fills the air</a> these days, with fears of overinvestment that could <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ars-live-recap-is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-pop-ed-zitron-weighs-in/">pop</a> at any time, something of a contradiction is brewing on the ground: Companies like Google and OpenAI can barely build infrastructure fast enough to fill their AI needs.</p>
<p>During an all-hands meeting earlier this month, Google’s AI infrastructure head Amin Vahdat told employees that the company must double its serving capacity every six months to meet demand for artificial intelligence services, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/google-must-double-ai-serving-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-demand.html">reports</a> CNBC. Vahdat, a vice president at Google Cloud, presented slides showing the company needs to scale “the next 1000x in 4-5 years.”</p>
<p>While a thousandfold increase in compute capacity sounds ambitious by itself, Vahdat noted some key constraints: Google needs to be able to deliver this increase in capability, compute, and storage networking “for essentially the same cost and increasingly, the same power, the same energy level,” he told employees during the meeting. “It won’t be easy but through collaboration and co-design, we’re going to get there.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/google-tells-employees-it-must-double-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-ai-demand/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AI systems have recently had a lot of success in one key aspect of biology: the relationship between a protein’s structure and its function. These efforts have included the ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/google-details-its-protein-folding-software-academics-offer-an-alternative/">predict the structure</a> of most proteins and to design proteins structured so that they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/polyurethane-is-the-latest-polymer-broken-down-by-designer-enzymes/">perform useful functions</a>. But all of these efforts are focused on the proteins and amino acids that build them.</p>
<p>But biology doesn’t generate new proteins at that level. Instead, changes have to take place at the nucleic acid level before eventually making their presence felt at the protein level. And the DNA level is fairly removed from proteins, with lots of critical non-coding sequences, redundancy, and a fair degree of flexibility. It’s not necessarily obvious that learning the organization of a genome would help an AI system figure out how to make functional proteins.</p>
<p>But it now seems like using bacterial genomes for the training can help develop a system that can predict proteins, some of which don’t look like anything we’ve ever seen before.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/generative-ai-meets-the-genome/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US crackdown on chip exports to China has continued with the arrests of four people accused of a conspiracy to illegally export Nvidia chips. Two US citizens and two nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), all of whom live in the US, were charged in an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.450248/gov.uscourts.flmd.450248.1.0.pdf">indictment</a> unsealed on Wednesday in US District Court for the Middle District of Florida.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges a scheme to send Nvidia “GPUs to China by falsifying paperwork, creating fake contracts, and misleading US authorities,” John Eisenberg, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-citizens-and-chinese-nationals-arrested-exporting-artificial-intelligence-technology">press release</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>The four arrestees are Hon Ning Ho (aka Mathew Ho), a US citizen who was born in Hong Kong and lives in Tampa, Florida; Brian Curtis Raymond, a US citizen who lives in Huntsville, Alabama; Cham Li (aka Tony Li), a PRC national who lives in San Leandro, California; and Jing Chen (aka Harry Chen), a PRC national who lives in Tampa on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/tech-company-cto-and-others-indicted-for-exporting-nvidia-chips-to-china/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>LAS VEGAS—A Formula 1 car runs on soon-to-be-synthetic gasoline, but an F1 team runs on data. It’s always been an engineering-driven sport, and while you can make decisions based on a hunch, the kinds of people who become good engineers prefer something a little more convincing. And the volumes of data just continue to get bigger and bigger each season. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/06/citrix-isnt-just-for-telecommuting-red-bull-racing-uses-it-at-the-track/">few years ago,</a> we spoke to Red Bull Racing about how it stayed on top of the task, but a lot has changed in F1 since 2017, as we found out at this year’s Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p>
<p>It’s hugely popular now, for one thing, even in the United States: a 200 mph soap opera now with 24 episodes a season. Superficially, the cars look the same—exposed wheels, front and rear wings, the driver in between some side pods. And the hybrid powertrains that make the cars move are still the same format: 1.6 L turbocharged V6 engines that recover energy from the rear wheels under braking as well as the turbine as it gets spun by hot exhaust gases.</p>
<p>But the cars are actually fundamentally different, particularly the way they generate their aerodynamic grip mostly via ground effect generated by the specially sculpted underside of their floors rather than the front and rear wings. A bigger change lurks in everyone’s accounts. The days when teams were free to spend as much money as they could find are gone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/data-driven-sport-how-red-bull-and-att-move-terabytes-of-f1-info/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For months, the Trump administration has warned that semiconductor tariffs are coming soon, leaving the tech industry on pins and needles after a chaotic year of unpredictable tariff regimes collectively cost firms billions.</p>
<p>The semiconductor tariffs are key to Donald Trump’s economic agenda, which is intended to force more manufacturing into the US by making it more expensive to import materials and products. He <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/china-aims-to-recruit-top-us-scientists-as-trump-tries-to-kill-the-chips-act/">campaigned on axing the CHIPS Act</a>—which provided subsidies to companies investing in manufacturing chips in the US—complaining that it was a “horrible, horrible thing” to “give hundreds of billions of dollars” away when the US could achieve the same objective by instead taxing companies and “use whatever is left over” of CHIPS funding to “reduce debt.” However, as 2025 winds down, the US president faces pressure on all sides to delay semiconductor tariffs, insiders <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trumps-semiconductor-tariff-plan-likely-delayed-officials-say-2025-11-19/">told Reuters</a>, and it appears that he is considering caving.</p>
<p>According to “two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations,” US officials have privately told industry and government stakeholders that semiconductor tariffs will likely be delayed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/keep-your-receipts-tech-firms-told-to-prepare-for-possible-tariff-refunds/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Millions of people around the world are living with the harsh reality of Alzheimer’s disease, which also significantly impacts family members. Nobody is immune, as A-list actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth">Chris Hemsworth</a> discovered when his own father was recently diagnosed. The revelation inspired Hemsworth to embark on a trip down memory lane with his father, which took them to Australia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory">Northern Territory</a>. The experience was captured on film for <em>A Road Trip to Remember,</em> a new documentary film from National Geographic.</p>
<p>Director Tom Barbor-Might had worked with Hemsworth on the latter’s documentary series <a href="https://www.natgeotv.com/za/shows/natgeo/limitless-with-chris-hemsworth"><em>Limitless</em>,</a> also for National Geographic. Each episode of <em>Limitless</em> follows Hemsworth on a unique challenge to push himself to the limits, augmented with interviews with scientific experts on such practices as fasting, extreme temperatures, brain-boosting, and regulating one’s stress response. Barbor-Might directed the season 1 finale, “Acceptance,” which was very different in tone, dealing with the inevitability of death and the need to confront one’s own mortality.</p>
<p>“It was really interesting to see Chris in that more intimate personal space, and he was great at it,” Barbor-Might told Ars. “He was charming, emotional, and vulnerable, and it was really moving. It felt like there was more work to be done there.” When Craig Hemsworth received his Alzheimer’s diagnosis, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore that personal element further.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/chris-hemsworth-and-dad-fight-alzheimers-with-a-trip-down-memory-lane/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Today all that’s left of the ancient city of Semiyarka are a few low earthen mounds and some scattered artifacts, nearly hidden beneath the waving grasses of the Kazakh Steppe, a vast swath of grassland that stretches across northern Kazakhstan and into Russia. But recent surveys and excavations reveal that 3,500 years ago, this empty plain was a bustling city with a thriving metalworking industry, where nomadic herders and traders might have mingled with settled metalworkers and merchants.</p>

<h2>Welcome to the City of Seven Ravines</h2>
<p>University College of London archaeologist Miljana Radivojevic and her colleagues recently mapped the site with drones and geophysical surveys (like ground-penetrating radar, for example), tracing the layout of a 140-hectare city on the steppe in what’s now Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The Bronze Age city once boasted rows of houses built on earthworks, a large central building, and a neighborhood of workshops where artisans smelted and cast bronze. From its windswept promontory, it held a commanding view of a narrow point in the Irtysh River valley, a strategic location that may have offered the city “control over movement along the river and valley bottom,” according to Radivojevic and her colleagues. That view inspired archaeologists’ name for the city: Semiyarka, or City of Seven Ravines.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/archaeologists-find-ruins-of-a-bronze-age-city-on-the-kazakh-steppe/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.20 of the Rocket Report! For the second week in a row, Blue Origin dominated the headlines with news about its New Glenn rocket. After a stunning success November 13 with the launch and landing of the second New Glenn rocket, Jeff Bezos’ space company revealed a roadmap this week showing how engineers will supercharge the vehicle with more engines. Meanwhile, in South Texas, SpaceX took a step toward the first flight of the next-generation Starship rocket. There will be no Rocket Report next week due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. We look forward to resuming delivery of all the news in space lift the first week of December.</p>

<p><b>Northrop’s Pegasus rocket wins a rare contract. </b>A startup named Katalyst Space Technologies won a $30 million contract from NASA in August to build a robotic rescue mission for the agency’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in low-Earth orbit. Swift, in space since 2004, is a unique instrument designed to study gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful explosions in the Universe. The spacecraft lacks a propulsion system and its orbit is subject to atmospheric drag, and NASA says it is “racing against the clock” to boost Swift’s orbit and extend its lifetime before it falls back to Earth. On Wednesday, Katalyst announced it <a href="https://www.katalystspace.com/post/katalyst-selects-northrop-grumman-pegasus-rocket-for-robotic-rescue-mission">selected Northrop Grumman’s air-launched Pegasus XL rocket</a> to send the rescue craft into orbit next year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/rocket-report-spacexs-next-gen-booster-fails-pegasus-will-fly-again/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“Based on our real-world experience with existing age assurance laws, we strongly support the initiative to protect minors online,” reads the letter sent by Anthony Penhale, chief legal officer for Aylo, which owns Pornhub, Brazzers, Redtube, and YouPorn. “However, we have found site-based age assurance approaches to be fundamentally flawed and counterproductive.”</p>
<p>The letter adds that site-based age verification methods have “failed to achieve their primary objective: protecting minors from accessing age-inappropriate material online.” Aylo says device-based authentication is a better solution for this issue because once a viewer’s age is determined via phone or tablet, their age signal can be shared over its application programming interface (API) with adult sites.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/pornhub-is-urging-tech-giants-to-enact-device-based-age-verification/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>During the pre-dawn hours in South Texas on Friday morning, SpaceX’s next-generation Starship first stage suffered some sort of major damage during pre-launch testing.</p>

Yet as captivating as the vista might be for an aspiring rocket magnate like Andy Lapsa, it also had to be a little intimidating.</p>
<p>To his right, at Launch Complex 13 next door, a recently returned Falcon 9 booster stood on a landing pad. SpaceX has landed more than 500 large orbital rockets. And next to SpaceX sprawled the launch site operated by Blue Origin. Its massive New Glenn rocket is also reusable, and founder Jeff Bezos has invested tens of billions of dollars into the venture.</p>
<p>Looking to the left, Lapsa saw a graveyard of sorts for commercial startups. Launch Complex 15 was leased to a promising startup, ABL Space, two years ago. After two failed launches, ABL Space pivoted away from commercial launch. Just beyond lies Launch Complex 16, where Relativity Space aims to launch from. The company has already burned through $1.7 billion in its efforts to reach orbit. Had billionaire Eric Schmidt not stepped in earlier this year, Relativity would have gone bankrupt.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/for-stoke-space-nothing-else-matters-but-full-and-rapid-rocket-reuse/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Astronomical events such as eclipses were central to Maya culture, reflected in the care the Maya took to keep accurate calendars to aid in celestial predictions. Among the few surviving Maya texts is the so-called Dresden Codex, which includes a table of eclipses. Researchers have concluded that this table was repurposed from earlier lunar month tables, rather than being created solely for eclipse prediction, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt9039">paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances. They also figured out the mechanism by which the Maya ensured that table would be accurate over a very long time period.</p>
<p>The Maya used three primary calendars: a count of days, known as the Long Count; a 260-day astrological calendar called the Tzolk’in; and a 365-day year called the Haab’. Previous scholars have speculated on how awe-inspiring solar or lunar eclipses must have seemed to the Maya, but our understanding of their astronomical knowledge is limited. Most Maya books were burned by Spanish conquistadors and Catholic priests. Only four hieroglyphic codices survive: the Dresden Codex, the Madrid Codex, the Paris Codex, and the Grolier Codex.</p>
<p>The Dresden Codex dates back to the 11th or 12th century and likely originated near Chichen Itza. It can be folded accordion-style and is 12 feet long in its unfolded state. The text was deciphered in the early 20th century and describes local history as well as astronomical lunar and Venus tables.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/study-how-the-maya-created-such-accurate-eclipse-tables/">Read full article</a></p>
