            <![CDATA[A look back at GPT-4's legacy as OpenAI pulls the pioneering 2023 AI model from ChatGPT.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>One of the most influential—and by some counts, notorious—AI models yet released will soon fade into history. OpenAI <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">announced</a> on April 10 that GPT-4 will be "fully replaced" by GPT-4o in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> at the end of April, bringing a public-facing end to the model that accelerated a global AI race when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">launched</a> in March 2023.</p>
<p>"Effective April 30, 2025, GPT-4 will be retired from ChatGPT and fully replaced by GPT-4o," OpenAI wrote in its April 10 <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">changelog</a> for ChatGPT. While ChatGPT users will no longer be able to chat with the older AI model, the company added that "GPT-4 will still be available in the API," providing some reassurance to developers who might still be using the older model for various tasks.</p>
<p>The retirement marks the end of an era that began on <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-research/">March 14, 2023,</a> when GPT-4 demonstrated capabilities that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">shocked some observers</a>: reportedly scoring at the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam, acing AP tests, and solving complex reasoning problems that stumped previous models. Its release created a wave of immense hype—and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/fearing-loss-of-control-ai-critics-call-for-6-month-pause-in-ai-development/">existential panic</a>—about AI's ability to imitate human communication and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/nyc-schools-block-chatgpt-fearing-negative-impact-on-learning/">composition</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/the-ai-that-sparked-tech-panic-and-scared-world-leaders-heads-to-retirement/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Back in the mid-1990s, when <em>The Net</em> was among the top box office draws and Americans were just starting to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/1995/10/16/americans-going-online-explosive-growth-uncertain-destinations/">flock online in droves</a>, kids had to swipe their parents' credit cards or find a fraudulent number online to access adult content on the web. But today's kids—even in states with the strictest age verification laws—know they can just use Google.</p>
<p>Last month, a <a href="https://osf.io/z83ev">study</a> analyzing the relative popularity of Google search terms found that age verification laws shift users' search behavior. It's impossible to tell if the shift represents young users attempting to circumvent the child-focused law or adult users who aren't the actual target of the laws. But overall, enforcement causes nearly half of users to stop searching for popular adult sites complying with laws and instead search for a noncompliant rival (48 percent) or virtual private network (VPN) services (34 percent), which are used to mask a location and circumvent age checks on preferred sites, the study found.</p>
<p>"Individuals adapt primarily by moving to content providers that do not require age verification," the study concluded.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/redditor-accidentally-reinvents-discarded-90s-tool-to-escape-todays-age-gates/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Intel's oddball Core Ultra 200V laptop chips—codenamed Lunar Lake—will apparently be a one-off experiment, not to be replicated in future Intel laptop chips. They're Intel's only processors with memory integrated onto the CPU package; the only ones with a neural processing unit that meets Microsoft's Copilot+ performance requirements; and the only ones with Intel's best-performing integrated GPUs, the Intel Arc 130V and 140V.</p>
<p>Today, Intel <a href="https://game.intel.com/us/stories/performance-update-for-intel-arc-140v-and-130v-built-in-gpus/">announced</a> some updates to its graphics driver that specifically benefit those integrated GPUs, welcome news for anyone who bought one and is trying to get by with it as an entry-level gaming system. Intel says that version 32.0.101.6734 of its graphics driver can speed up average frame rates in some games by around 10 percent, and can speed up "1 percent low FPS" (that is, for any given frames per second measurement, whatever your frame rate is the slowest 1 percent of the time) by as much as 25 percent. This should, in theory, make games run better in general and ease some of the stuttering you notice when your game's performance dips down to that 1 percent level.</p>

<p>Intel's performance comparisons were made using an MSI Claw 7 AI+ using an Arc 140V GPU, and they compare the performance of driver version 32.0.101.6732 (released April 2) to version 32.0.101.6734 (released April 8). The two additional driver packages Intel has released since then will contain the improvements, too.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT users have become frustrated with the AI model's tone, and OpenAI is taking action. After widespread mockery of the robot's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/annoyed-chatgpt-users-complain-about-bots-relentlessly-positive-tone/">relentlessly positive and complimentary output</a> recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirms the company will roll back the latest update to GPT-4o. So get ready for a more reserved and less sycophantic chatbot, at least for now.</p>
<p>GPT-4o is not a new model—OpenAI released it almost a year ago, and it remains the default when you access ChatGPT, but the company occasionally releases revised versions of existing models. As people interact with the chatbot, OpenAI gathers data on the responses people like more. Then, engineers revise the production model using a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).</p>
<p>Recently, however, that reinforcement learning went off the rails. The AI went from generally positive to the world's biggest suck-up. Users could present ChatGPT with completely terrible ideas or misguided claims, and it might respond, "Wow, you're a genius," and "This is on a whole different level."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-rolls-back-update-that-made-chatgpt-a-sycophantic-mess/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[A partial defense of (some of) AI Overview's fanciful idiomatic explanations.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last week, the phrase "You can't lick a badger twice" <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gregjenner.bsky.social/post/3lnhxkdywzc2m">unexpectedly went viral</a> on social media. The nonsense sentence—which was likely never uttered by a human before last week—<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-overviews-meaning/">had become the poster child</a> for the newly discovered way <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/googles-ai-overviews-misunderstand-why-people-use-google/">Google search's AI Overviews</a> makes up plausible-sounding explanations for made-up idioms (though the concept <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crabman.bsky.social/post/3ln2vu7ulrk2a">seems to predate that specific viral post</a> by at least a few days).</p>
<p>Google users quickly discovered that typing any concocted phrase into the search bar with the word "meaning" attached at the end would generate an AI Overview with a purported explanation of its idiomatic meaning. Even the most nonsensical attempts at new proverbs resulted in a confident explanation from Google's AI Overview, created right there on the spot.</p>
<p>In the wake of the "lick a badger" post, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/elainelow.bsky.social/post/3lnvw6yucds2a">countless users</a> flocked to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/diff55.bsky.social/post/3lnuzqcawys2t">social media</a> to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcconnell.bsky.social/post/3lnlraaysnc2z">share Google's AI interpretations</a> of <a href="https://x.com/woodgnomology/status/1915021766746947766">their own made-up idioms</a>, often expressing horror or disbelief at Google's take on their nonsense. Those posts often highlight the overconfident way the AI Overview frames its idiomatic explanations and occasional problems with the model confabulating sources that don't exist.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/google-searchs-made-up-ai-explanations-for-sayings-no-one-ever-said-explained/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is urging two federal appeals courts to disregard a 5th Circuit ruling that guts the agency's ability to issue financial penalties.</p>
<p>On April 17, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/24/24-60223-CV0.pdf">granted an AT&amp;T request</a> to wipe out a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-fines-big-three-carriers-196m-for-selling-users-real-time-location-data/">$57 million fine</a> for selling customer location data without consent. The conservative 5th Circuit court said the FCC "acted as prosecutor, jury, and judge," violating AT&amp;T's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>
<p>The ruling wasn't a major surprise. The 5th Circuit said it was guided by the Supreme Court's June 2024 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-859_1924.pdf">ruling</a> in <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy</em>, which held that "when the SEC seeks civil penalties against a defendant for securities fraud, the Seventh Amendment entitles the defendant to a jury trial." After the Supreme Court's <em>Jarkesy</em> ruling, FCC Republican Nathan Simington <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-88A4.pdf">vowed</a> to vote against any fine imposed by the commission until its legal powers are clear.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/att-court-win-over-fcc-could-make-it-impossible-for-agency-to-fine-carriers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Firefly Aerospace launched its two-stage Alpha rocket from California early Tuesday, but something went wrong about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight, rendering the rocket unable to deploy an experimental satellite into orbit for Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>The Alpha rocket took off from Vandenberg Space Force Base about 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles at 6:37 am PDT (9:37 am EDT; 13:37 UTC), one day after Firefly called off a launch attempt due to a technical problem with ground support equipment.</p>
<p>Everything appeared to go well with the rocket's first-stage booster, powered by four kerosene-fueled Reaver engines, as the launcher ascended through fog and arced on a southerly trajectory over the Pacific Ocean. The booster stage jettisoned from Alpha's upper stage two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, and that's when things went awry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/fireflys-rocket-suffers-one-of-the-strangest-launch-failures-weve-ever-seen/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>This morning, Punchbowl News <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/amazon-display-tariff-costs/">reported</a> that Amazon was considering listing the cost of tariffs as a separate line item on its site, citing "a person familiar with the plan." Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-response-to-white-house-tariffs">later acknowledged</a> that there had been internal discussions to that effect but only for its import-focused Amazon Haul sub-store and that the company didn't plan to actually list tariff prices for any items.</p>
<p>"This was never approved and is not going to happen," reads Amazon's two-sentence statement.</p>
<p>Amazon issued such a specific and forceful on-the-record denial in part because it had drawn the ire of the Trump administration. In a press briefing early this morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked a question about the report, which the administration responded to as though Amazon had made a formal announcement about the policy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/amazon-denies-it-will-start-listing-cost-of-tariffs-as-other-sites-start-doing-it/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In the wake of a high-profile court decision that upended the state of Montana’s climate policy, Republican lawmakers in the state are pushing a suite of bills that could gut the state’s ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The full-court legislative press targets the state’s environmental analysis, air quality regulation, and judicial system. It stems from the <em>Held v. Montana</em> case in which 16 young people sued the state over its contributions to climate change, claiming its fossil fuel-centric approach to energy violated the state constitution’s guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment.” The plaintiffs won, and in December 2024, the Montana Supreme Court upheld their victory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/montanas-republican-legislators-fight-back-after-successful-youth-climate-lawsuit/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last year was big for zero-day exploits, security threats that appear in the wild before vendors have a chance to develop patches. Through its sprawling network of services and research initiatives, Google is the first to spot many of these threats. In a new report from the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), the company reveals it detected 75 zero-day <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/google-patches-its-fifth-zero-day-vulnerability-of-the-year-in-chrome/">exploits in 2024</a>, which is a bit lower than the previous year. Unsurprisingly, a sizable chunk of them was the work of state-sponsored hackers.</p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2024-zero-day-trends">According to Google</a>, zero-day exploits are becoming increasingly easy for threat actors to develop and procure, which has led to more sophisticated attacks. While end-user devices are still regularly targeted, GTIG notes that the trend over the past few years has been for these vulnerabilities to target enterprise systems and security infrastructure. There were 98 zero-days detected in 2023 versus 75 in 2024, but Google says the overall trend in enterprise threats is increasing.</p>
<p>That's not to say the products you use every day are safe from sneaky hacks—a slim majority of GTIG's 2024 zero-day threats still targeted users. In fact, Google says hackers were even more interested in certain platforms last year compared to the year before.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/google-governments-are-using-zero-day-hacks-more-than-ever/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump is set to ease up slightly on the automotive industry this week. After being warned that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/">his trade war</a> will result in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/how-automakers-like-ford-vw-stellantis-are-reacting-to-trumps-25-tariff/">hiked prices</a> and fewer vehicles being built, government officials over the past two days have signaled that Trump will sign an executive order today that will mitigate some of the pain the 25 percent import tariffs will inflict.</p>
<p>Trump's approach to tariffs has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/09/trump-backs-down-on-tariffs/">nothing if not inconsistent</a>. In this case, the White House is not dropping the 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles, but the other tariffs imposed by the Trump administration—like the 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum that went into effect in February—won't stack up on top.</p>
<p>The potential for multiple tariffs to have an additive effect on prices could have seen new car prices soar in the coming weeks; now, they are likely to just rise a lot instead. According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/trump-tariffs-autos-exceptions-fc634efd">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the move will be retroactive, and automakers who have (for example) paid aluminum or steel tariffs on top of the car import tariff can seek a refund for the former.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/trump-gives-the-auto-industry-small-break-on-tariffs-for-cars-car-parts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nobody does pasta quite like the Italians, as anyone who has tasted an authentic "pasta alla cacio e pepe" can attest. It's a simple dish: just tonnarelli pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. But its simplicity is deceptive. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacio_e_pepe">Cacio e pepe</a> ("cheese and pepper") is notoriously challenging to make because it's so easy for the sauce to form unappetizing clumps with a texture more akin to stringy mozzarella rather than being smooth and creamy.</p>
<p>A team of Italian physicists has come to the rescue with a foolproof recipe based on their many scientific experiments, according to a new paper published in the journal Physics of Fluids. The trick: using corn starch for the cheese and pepper sauce instead of relying on however much starch leaches into the boiling water as the pasta is cooked.</p>
<p class="p1">"A true Italian grandmother or a skilled home chef from Rome would never need a scientific recipe for cacio e pepe, relying instead on instinct and years of experience," the authors wrote. "For everyone else, this guide offers a practical way to master the dish. Preparing cacio e pepe successfully depends on getting the balance just right, particularly the ratio of starch to cheese. The concentration of starch plays a crucial role in keeping the sauce creamy and smooth, without clumps or separation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/physics-of-the-perfect-cacio-e-pepe-sauce/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As part of the Global Change Research Act of 1990, <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/24670/chapter/9">Congress mandated</a> that every four years, the government must produce a National Climate Assessment. This document is intended to provide an overview of the changing state of our knowledge about the process itself and its impact on our environment. Past versions have been comprehensive and involved the work of hundreds of scientists, all coordinated by the US's Global Change Research Program.</p>
<p>It's not clear what the next report will look like. Two weeks after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/climate/trump-national-climate-assessment.html">cutting </a><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/climate/trump-national-climate-assessment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding</a> for the organization that coordinates the report's production</span>, the Trump administration has apparently informed all the authors working on it that their services are no longer needed.</p>
<p>The National Climate Assessment has typically been like a somewhat smaller-scale version of the IPCC reports, with a greater focus on impacts in the US. It is a very detailed look at the state of climate science, the impacts warming is having on the US, and our efforts to limit warming and deal with those impacts. Various agencies and local governments have used it to help plan for the expected impacts of our warming climate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-admin-may-be-trying-to-sabotage-the-national-climate-assessment/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The first 27 operational satellites for Amazon's Kuiper broadband network lifted off from Florida's Space Coast on Monday evening, the opening salvo in a challenge to SpaceX's dominant Starlink global Internet service.</p>
<p>Amazon's Project Kuiper, <a href="https://www.quiltyspace.com/quilty-quicktakes/assessing-kuipers-satellite-manufacturing-delays">costing up to $20 billion</a>, will beam high-speed, low-latency broadband signals to consumers around the world. Monday's milestone launch kicks off a test campaign in low-Earth orbit to verify the functionality and performance of Amazon's satellites. In a statement earlier this month, Amazon said it planned to begin providing service to customers later this year.</p>
<p>These initial services are likely to have limited reach. Amazon needs more than 80 launches to complete the first-generation Kuiper network, and this will probably take several years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/a-rocket-launch-monday-night-may-finally-jumpstart-amazons-answer-to-starlink/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>China's BYD doesn't mess around. It began life as a battery company that eventually realized it could branch out into electrified cars. And so it did. Today, BYD is outselling rival giants and has cars on the road almost everywhere, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/us-to-ban-chinese-connected-car-software-and-hardware-citing-security-risks/">except the US</a>. Its eyes are firmly set on conquering the electric vehicle sector, but it will sell you a hybrid if you're not quite ready to take on life with a battery EV full-time.</p>
<p>Being a thoroughly modern car company, BYD will sell you cars in various shapes and sizes and across a wide price range, though the bigger you go, the higher the price tag becomes. With popular sentiment starting to turn against this second gilded age, the super-lux stuff won't suit everyone. That's where BYD's smallest car, the Dolphin, comes into play.</p>
<p>Small is, of course, a relative term. An original <a href="https://www.automotivehalloffame.org/honoree/alec-issigonis/">Issigonis</a> Mini it is not, but it makes a Range Rover Evoque look big. It's tall, but it's narrow enough that it will fit in a European parking space with room to open the doors. You won't miss it in a parking lot, either.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/a-small-cheap-ev-you-cant-buy-in-the-us-we-test-the-byd-dolphin/">Read full article</a></p>

During his latest mission, his third long-duration on the International Space Station, Pettit brought his brand of wonderment to the assignment.</p>
<p>During his time in microgravity, Pettit, an inveterate tinkerer, said he likes to spend his free time either doing experiments in microgravity he cannot do on Earth or taking images to bring the experience back home. At a news conference Monday, Pettit was asked why he took so many images—670,000!—during his most recent stay on the space station.</p>
<p>"When I'm looking out the window, just enjoying the view, it's like, 'Oh, wow, a meteor. Look at that. Man, there's a flash there. What's that? Oh, look at that volcano going off. Okay, where's my camera? I gotta record that.' And part of this drive for me is when your mission is over, it's photographs and memories. When you want to share the experience with people, you can share the memories through verbal communication, like we're doing now, but the photographs are just another dimension of sharing what it's like. It's an experience where most people on Earth right now can't share, and I can try to give them a glimpse through my imagery."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/tuesday-telescope-yes-you-can-see-stars-in-space-and-theyre-spectacular/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AI-generated computer code is rife with references to non-existent third-party libraries, creating a golden opportunity for supply-chain attacks that poison legitimate programs with malicious packages that can steal data, plant backdoors, and carry out other nefarious actions, newly published research shows.</p>
<p>The study, which used 16 of the most widely used large language models to generate 576,000 code samples, found that 440,000 of the package dependencies they contained were “hallucinated,” meaning they were non-existent. Open source models hallucinated the most, with 21 percent of the dependencies linking to non-existent libraries. A dependency is an essential code component that a separate piece of code requires to work properly. Dependencies save developers the hassle of rewriting code and are an essential part of the modern software supply chain.</p>
<h2>Package hallucination flashbacks</h2>
<p>These non-existent dependencies represent a threat to the software supply chain by exacerbating so-called dependency confusion attacks. These attacks work by causing a software package to access the wrong component dependency, for instance by publishing a malicious package and giving it the same name as the legitimate one but with a later version stamp. Software that depends on the package will, in some cases, choose the malicious version rather than the legitimate one because the former appears to be more recent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/ai-generated-code-could-be-a-disaster-for-the-software-supply-chain-heres-why/">Read full article</a></p>

This absurdist masterpiece sending up Arthurian legend turns 50 (!) this year.</p>
<p>It was partly Python member Terry Jones' passion for the Middle Ages and Arthurian legend that inspired <em>Holy Grail</em> and its approach to comedy. (Jones even went on to direct a 2004 documentary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Jones%27_Medieval_Lives"><em>Medieval Lives</em></a>.) The troupe members wrote several drafts beginning in 1973, and Jones and Terry Gilliam were co-directors—the first full-length feature for each, so filming was one long learning process. Reviews were mixed when <em>Holy Grail</em> was first released—much like they were for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Frankenstein"><em>Young Frankenstein</em></a> (1974), another comedic masterpiece—but audiences begged to differ. It was the top-grossing British film screened in the US in 1975. And its reputation has only grown over the ensuing decades.</p>
<p>The film's broad cultural influence extends beyond the entertainment industry. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>Holy Grail</em> has been the subject of <a href="https://www.medievalists.net/2025/04/ten-articles-about-monty-python-and-the-holy-grail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple scholarly papers</a> examining such topics as its <a href="https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/flor/article/view/12509/13435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectiveness</a> at teaching Arthurian literature or <a href="https://ohiomathjournal.org/index.php/OJSM/article/view/6401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geometric thought and logic,</a> the <a href="https://faculty.winthrop.edu/kosterj/engl510/Readings/dayHolyGrail.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comedic techniques</a> employed, and why <a href="https://usurj.journals.usask.ca/article/view/491" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the depiction</a> of a killer rabbit is so fitting (killer rabbits frequently appear drawn in the margins of Gothic manuscripts).</span> My personal favorite was a <a href="https://scispace.com/pdf/could-the-black-knight-have-survived-to-bite-king-arthur-s-3erffwsqaw.pdf">2018 tongue-in-cheek paper</a> on whether the Black Knight could have survived long enough to make good on his threat to bite King Arthur's legs off (tl;dr: no).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-turns-50/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Under President Trump, the Food and Drug Administration may no longer approve seasonal COVID-19 vaccines updated for the virus variants circulating that year, according to recent statements by Trump administration officials.</p>
<p>Since the acute phase of the pandemic, vaccine manufacturers have been subtly updating COVID-19 shots annually to precisely target the molecular signatures of the newest virus variants, which continually evolve to evade our immune responses. So far, the FDA has treated these tweaked vaccines the same way it treats seasonal flu shots, which have long been updated annually to match currently circulating strains of flu viruses.</p>
<p>The FDA does not consider seasonal flu shots brand-new vaccines. Rather, they're just slightly altered versions of the approved vaccines. As such, the regulator does not require companies to conduct lengthy, expensive vaccine trials to prove that each slightly changed version is safe and effective. If they did, generating annual vaccines would be virtually impossible. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/its-good-time-get-your-flu-vaccine">Each year, from late February to early March</a>, the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization direct flu shot makers on what tweaks they should make to shots for the upcoming flu season. That gives manufacturers just enough time to develop tweaks and start manufacturing massive supplies of doses in time for the start of the flu season.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/under-trump-the-fda-may-no-longer-approve-seasonal-covid-shots/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Since the Iberian Peninsula <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/massive-power-outage-in-spain-portugal-leaves-millions-in-dark/">lost power in a massive blackout</a>, grid operators are in the process of trying to restore power to millions of customers and businesses. As you might imagine, the process—termed a "black start"—is quite a bit more challenging than flicking on a switch. However, the challenge is made considerably more difficult because nearly everything about the system—from the management hardware that remotely controls the performance of the grid to the power plants themselves—needs power to operate.</p>
<h2>Restarting the grid</h2>
<p>You might think that a power plant could easily start generating power, but in reality, only a limited number of facilities have everything they need to handle a black start. That's because it takes power to make power. Facilities that boil water have lots of powered pumps and valves, coal plants need to pulverize the fuel and move it to where it's burned, etc. In most cases, black-start-rated plants have a diesel generator present to supply enough power to get the plant operating. These tend to be smaller plants, since they require proportionally smaller diesel generators.</p>
<p>The initial output of these black start facilities is then used to provide power to all the plants that need an external power source to operate. This has to be managed in a way that ensures that only other power plants get the first electrons to start moving on the grid, otherwise the normal demand would immediately overwhelm the limited number of small plants that are operating. Again, this has to be handled by facilities that need power in order to control the flow of energy across the grid. This is why managing the grid will never be as simple as "put the hardware on the Internet and control it remotely," given that the Internet also needs power to operate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/why-restarting-a-power-grid-is-so-hard/">Read full article</a></p>
