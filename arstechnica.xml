              <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo's Switch 2 presentation gave us <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">pricing for the console</a> ($449 to start) and Nintendo's product pages have given us <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/">pricing information for accessories</a> ($80 for a Pro Controller, $90 for another pair of Joy-Cons, and $110 for a replacement dock, sheesh). But what Nintendo didn't mention during the presentation was game pricing, either for standalone Switch 2 titles or the Switch 2 Edition upgrades for existing Switch games.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced via its website after the presentation that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, the console's flagship launch title, will cost $50 when you buy a digital copy as part of a Switch 2 bundle. But the game will cost $80 when you buy it on its own, $30 more than the pack-in version and $20 more than the usual $60 price for first-party Switch games.</p>
<p>Pre-order listings at US retailers that have gone live since this morning also list several $80 games—<a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/switch-2-hardware-and-software/0/0/?_refineresult=true&amp;_be_shelf_id=7433688&amp;search_sort=100&amp;facet=shelf_id%3A7433688&amp;povid=ets_switch2_pov">we'll use Wal-Mart's</a> as an example. The upgraded Switch 2 Editions for a trio of Switch games—2024's <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, 2023's <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and 2022's <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>—are all going for $80, the same as <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last week, Health Secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the Trump administration would hack off nearly a quarter of employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees critical agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>
<p>The downsizing includes pushing out about 10,000 full-time employees through early retirements, deferred resignations, and other efforts. Another 10,000 will be laid off in a brutal restructuring, bringing the total HHS workforce from 82,000 to 62,000.</p>
<p>"This will be a painful period," Kennedy said in a video announcement last week. Early yesterday morning, the pain began.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-bloodbath-at-hhs-blowback-grows-as-losses-become-clearer/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Paramount+ has dropped a tantalizing one-minute teaser for the upcoming third season of <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>., and it looks like the latest adventures of the starship <em>Enterprise</em> will bring romance, comedy, mystery, and even a bit of analog tech, not to mention a brand new villain.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for S2 below)</strong></p>
<p>We haven't seen much from the third season to date<em>. </em>There was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/star-treks-comic-con-panel-debuts-teaser-for-lower-decks-final-season/">an exclusive clip</a> during San Diego Comic Con last summer—a callback to the S2 episode "Charades," in which a higher-dimensional race, the Kerkohvians, accidentally reconfigured Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan physiology to that of a full-blooded human, just before Spock was supposed to meet his Vulcan fiancee's parents. The S3 clip had the situation reversed: The human crew had to make themselves Vulcan to succeed on a new mission but weren't able to change back.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/genres-are-bustin-out-all-over-in-strange-new-worlds-s3-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) are tremendously fond of fermented foodstuffs. Technically, it's the yeast they crave, produced by yummy rotting fruit, but they can consume quite a lot of ethanol as a result of that fruity diet. Yes, fruit flies have ultra-fast metabolisms, the better to burn off the booze, but they can still get falling-down drunk—so much so, that randy inebriated male fruit flies have been known to court other males by mistake and fail to mate successfully.</p>
<p>Then again, apparently adding alcohol to their food increases the production of sex pheromones in male fruit flies, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That, in turn, makes them more attractive to the females of the species.</p>
<p>"We show a direct and positive effect of alcohol consumption on the mating success of male flies," <a href="https://www.ice.mpg.de/493119/PR_Keesey">said co-author Ian Keesey</a> of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. "The effect is caused by the fact that alcohol, especially methanol, increases the production of sex pheromones. This in turn makes alcoholic males more attractive to females and ensures a higher mating success rate, whereas the success of drunken male humans with females is likely to be questionable."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/do-ya-think-im-sexy-male-fruit-flies-more-attractive-when-drunk/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On the heels of releasing its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">most capable AI model yet</a>, Google is making some changes to the Gemini team. A <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/02/2025/google-gemini-shakes-up-ai-leadership-sissie-hsiao-steps-down-replaced-by-josh-woodward">new report</a> from Semafor reveals that longtime Googler Sissie Hsiao will step down from her role leading the Gemini team effective immediately. In her place, Google is appointing Josh Woodward, who currently leads Google Labs.</p>
<p>According to a memo from DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, this change is designed to "sharpen our focus on the next evolution of the Gemini app." This new responsibility won't take Woodward away from his role at Google Labs—he will remain in charge of that division while leading the Gemini team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hsiao says in a message to employees that she is happy with "Chapter 1" of the Bard story and is optimistic for Woodward's "Chapter 2." Hsiao won't be involved in Google's AI efforts for now—she's opted to take some time off before returning to Google in a new role.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-shakes-up-gemini-leadership-google-labs-head-taking-the-reins/">Read full article</a></p>

Not just "playable" on the Switch 2, but exclusive to it. But there it was, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niKHDEKQ7xA"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, debuting its dread horror action just a few minutes before the luminously pink and puffy <em>Kirby Air Ride 2. </em></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Europol has shut down one of the largest dark web pedophile networks in the world, prompting dozens of arrests worldwide and threatening that more are to follow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2021, KidFlix allowed users to join for free to preview low-quality videos depicting child sex abuse materials (CSAM). To see higher-resolution videos, users had to earn credits by sending cryptocurrency payments, uploading CSAM, or "verifying video titles and descriptions and assigning categories to videos."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Europol seized the servers and found a total of 91,000 unique videos depicting child abuse, "many of which were previously unknown to law enforcement," the agency said in a <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/global-crackdown-kidflix-major-child-sexual-exploitation-platform-almost-two-million-users">press release</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/vast-pedophile-network-shut-down-in-europols-largest-csam-operation/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Automated AI bots seeking training data threaten Wikipedia project stability, foundation says.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the Wikimedia Foundation <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/">announced</a> that relentless AI scraping is putting strain on Wikipedia's servers. Automated bots seeking AI model training data for LLMs have been vacuuming up terabytes of data, growing the foundation's bandwidth used for downloading multimedia content by 50 percent since January 2024. It’s a scenario familiar across the free and open source software (FOSS) community, as we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/">previously detailed</a>.</p>
<p>The Foundation hosts not only Wikipedia but also platforms like <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a>, which offers 144 million media files under open licenses. For decades, this content has powered everything from search results to school projects. But since early 2024, AI companies have dramatically increased automated scraping through direct crawling, APIs, and bulk downloads to feed their hungry AI models. This exponential growth in non-human traffic has imposed steep technical and financial costs—often without the attribution that helps sustain Wikimedia’s volunteer ecosystem.</p>
<p>The impact isn’t theoretical. The foundation says that when former US President Jimmy Carter died in December 2024, his Wikipedia page predictably drew millions of views. But the real stress came when users simultaneously streamed a 1.5-hour video of a 1980 debate from Wikimedia Commons. The surge doubled Wikimedia’s normal network traffic, temporarily maxing out several of its Internet connections. Wikimedia engineers quickly rerouted traffic to reduce congestion, but the event revealed a deeper problem: The baseline bandwidth had already been consumed largely by bots scraping media at scale.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/ai-bots-strain-wikimedia-as-bandwidth-surges-50/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A SpaceX and X engineer, Christopher Stanley—currently serving as a senior advisor in the Deputy Attorney General's office at the Department of Justice (DOJ)—was reportedly caught bragging about hacking and distributing pirated e-books, bootleg software, and game cheats.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The boasts appeared on archived versions of websites, of which several, once flagged, were quickly deleted, Reuters <a href="ttps://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/doge-official-doj-bragged-about-hacking-distributing-pirated-software-2025-04-02/">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley was assigned to the DOJ by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While Musk claims that DOGE operates transparently, not much is known about who the staffers are or what their government roles entail. It remains unclear what Stanley does at DOJ, but Reuters noted that the Deputy Attorney General’s office is in charge of investigations into various crimes, "including hacking and other malicious cyber activity." Declining to comment further, the DOJ did confirm that as a "special government employee," like Musk, Stanley does not draw a government salary.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/i-no-longer-hack-paypals-doge-staffers-hacker-past-raises-red-flags/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[It's slow and inefficient, but the semiconductor is only one molecule thick.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, a team of researchers from China used a paper published in Nature to describe a 32-bit RISC-V processor built using molybdenum disulfide instead of silicon as the semiconductor. For those not up on their chemistry, molybdenum disulfide is a bit like graphene: a single molecule of MoS<sub>2</sub> is a sheet that is only a bit over a single atom thick, due to the angles between its chemical bonds. But unlike graphene, molybdenum disulfide is a semiconductor.</p>
<p>The material has been used in a variety of demonstration electronics, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/flash-memory-chip-built-out-of-single-atom-thick-components/">flash storage</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/researchers-build-a-working-camera-out-of-atomically-thin-semiconductors/">image sensors</a>. But we've recently figured out how to generate wafer-scale sheets of MoS<sub>2</sub> on a sapphire substrate, and the team took advantage of that to build the processor, which they call RV32-WUJI. It can only add single bits at a time and is limited to kilohertz clock speeds, but it is capable of executing the full RISC-V 32-bit instruction set thanks to nearly 6,000 individual transistors.</p>
<h2>Going flat</h2>
<p>We've identified a wide range of what are termed 2D materials. These all form repeated chemical bonds in more or less a single plane. In the case of graphene, which consists only of carbon, the bonds are all in the same plane, meaning the molecule is as thick as a carbon atom. Molybdenum disulfide is slightly different, as the angle of the chemical bonds is out of plane, resulting in a zig-zag pattern. This means the sheet is slightly thicker than its component atoms.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/researchers-build-a-risc-v-processor-using-a-2d-semiconductor/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We've known for a few months now that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support backward compatibility for older Nintendo Switch games, and as of today's presentation, we also know that some Switch games will get special <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendo-hints-at-enhanced-switch-2-edition-games-for-new-console/">Switch 2 Editions</a> that add new features and support higher resolutions and other features.</p>
<p>Nintendo's product pages for the Switch add more details, including the status of backward-compatibility testing for original Switch games and a small handful of first-party Switch games that will get "free updates" to enhance them for Switch 2.</p>
<p>First, some good news. There will be a second tier of updates for original Switch games that Nintendo says "may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games." These won't include the extra features or higher resolutions of Switch 2 Edition games, but they'll be available for free, and they ought to improve playability. Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">lists</a> a dozen first-party Switch games that will benefit from free Switch 2 updates:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/some-original-switch-games-will-run-better-on-switch-2-some-wont-run-at-all/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Actor Val Kilmer—star of <em>Top Gun, The Doors</em>, and <em>Batman Forever</em>, among other roles—<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/val-kilmer-dead-1236356842/">has died</a> at the age of 65 of pneumonia, Deadline Hollywood reports.</p>
<p>Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2015 and while chemotherapy and two tracheotomies helped him defeat it, the procedures destroyed his voice. He spoke in a rasp or used an electric voice box for the remainder of his life and largely left acting. (He made a brief cameo in 2022's <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, for which his voice was digitally altered.) The 2021 documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_(film)"><em>Val</em></a>, narrated by his son Jack Kilmer, followed his life and health struggles.</p>
<p>Kilmer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/movies/val-kilmer-dead.html">had a reputation</a> for being eccentric and difficult to work with, but he also had his champions, and his talent was undeniable. “While working with Val on <em>Heat</em>, I always marveled at the range, the brilliant variability within the powerful current of Val’s possessing and expressing character," Michael Mann, who directed the actor in 1995's <em>Heat</em>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/val-kilmer-remembered-by-michael-mann-heat-director-1236356976/">told Deadline</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>In early 2024, the bird influenza that had been spreading across the globe for nearly three decades did something wholly unexpected: It showed up in dairy cows in the Texas Panhandle.</p>
<p>A dangerous bird flu, in other words, was suddenly circulating in mammals—mammals with which people have ongoing, extensive contact. “Holy cow,” says Thomas Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “This is how pandemics start.”</p>
<p>This bird flu, which scientists call highly pathogenic avian influenza, or H5N1, is already at panzootic—animal pandemic—status, killing birds in every continent except for Australia. Around the world, it has also affected diverse mammals including cats, goats, mink, tigers, seals, and dolphins. Thus far, the United States is the only nation with H5N1 in cows; it’s shown up in dairies in <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">at least 17 states</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-bird-flu/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Tesla posted its production and sales numbers for the first quarter of 2025 this morning, and they continue the bad news streak for the electric automaker. Tesla produced 362,615 vehicles in total between January and the end of March, a 16.3 percent decrease from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-deliveries-drop-8-5-percent-year-over-year-in-first-decline-since-2020/">same period in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>The drop in sales was a little less bad; unlike this time last year, Tesla was able to more closely match production with demand. As a result, the company delivered 336,681 EVs in Q1, a drop of 12.9 percent compared to Q1 2024.</p>
<p>The Models 3 and Y make up the vast majority of Tesla's business—it built 345,454 of them in Q1 2025, a 16.2 percent reduction compared to the same period last year. Despite a recent refresh for the Model Y, which comprised the majority of these two EVs, sales declined by 12.4 percent year over year, with just 323,800 being sold, compared to 369,783 deliveries for Q1 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/tesla-sales-and-production-slumped-heavily-in-q1-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

Complaining feels great. That feeling of beleaguered, I-against-the-world self-righteousness? Highly underrated.</p>
<p>But a little righteous complaint goes a long, long, loooong way. (Just ask my wife.) Too much can be corrosive, it can make you insufferable to others, and it can leave you jaded, as many people, myself included, have become about technology.</p>
<p>I had three recent experiences, however, that were each quite small in their way but which reminded me that not everything in the tech world has fallen victim to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/as-internet-enshittification-marches-on-here-are-some-of-the-worst-offenders/">forces of "enshittification."</a> Once in a while, technology still feels easy and—dare I co-opt the world from Apple's marketing department?—even magical.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/unshittification-3-tech-companies-that-recently-made-my-life-better/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The presentation led off with an extended look at a new exclusive launch title, <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which features 24 racers at once on "various regions across the globe" where "you can drive off the race track and go virtually anywhere" in a new "free roam" mode. Characters were shown doing jumps off of walls and wearing multiple different costumes. A new level themed after the original <em>Donkey Kong</em> featured prominently, as did one reminiscent of the Hyrule Castle level of <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>You can also go on "scenic drives with friends" and take photos with them in a new photo mode.</p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington to Las Vegas and accommodation so Ars could drive the RS e-tron GT. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>LAS VEGAS—Audi's sleek four-door electric sedan, the e-tron GT, has just received its midlife refresh. Usually, a midlife refresh is mostly cosmetic, intended to prevent the model from feeling too stale in the marketplace. But this time Audi has kept the visual changes to a minimum. There are new wheels and a new interior, as well as redesigned front and rear fascias, although the changes are quite subtle. Instead, there's been a comprehensive reengineering effort under the skin.</p>
<p>Perhaps not quite as comprehensive as the Polestar 2 refresh—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/now-rear-wheel-drive-the-single-motor-polestar-2-is-better-than-ever/">which swapped front-wheel drive for rear</a>—but there are now new motors and a new battery pack, which bring with them increased range, a reduced 0–60 mph time, and even faster fast-charging. Audi says it has also worked on the driving dynamics, including adding the same active suspension system we recently experienced in the Porsche Panamera.</p>
<p>As before, the e-tron GT comes in two specifications, but now the base model is the $125,500 S e-tron GT. This now offers 670 hp (500 kW), a 148 hp (110 kW) improvement on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/the-2022-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-shows-badge-engineering-is-nothing-to-fear/">last year's model</a>. That drops the 0–60 mph time from 4 seconds down to 3.3, but the 51-mile ( 82 km) increase to its range—now 300 miles (482 km) on a single charge—is probably going to be the most enticing improvement for potential buyers. That's courtesy of a new 105 kWh (gross, 97 kWh usable) battery.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-more-range-more-power-still-drives-like-an-audi/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Honda's motorsport division must be doing some spring cleaning. Today, the Honda Racing Corporation announced that it's getting into the memorabilia business, offering up parts and even whole vehicles for fans and collectors. And to kick things off, it's going to auction some components from the RA100E V10 engines that powered the McLaren Honda MP4/5Bs of Ayrton Senna and Gerhard Berger to both F1 titles in 1990.</p>
<p>"We aim to make this a valuable business that allows fans who love F1, MotoGP and various other races to share in the history of Honda's challenges in racing since the 1950s," said Koi Watanabe, president of HRC, "including our fans to own a part of Honda's racing history is not intended to be a one-time endeavor, but rather a continuous business that we will nurture and grow."</p>
<p>The bits from Senna's and Berger's V10s will go up for auction at Monterey Car Week later this year, and the lots will include some of the parts seen in the photo above: cam covers, camshafts, pistons, and conrods, with a certificate of authenticity and a display case. And HRC is going through its collections to see what else it might part with, including "heritage machines and parts" from IndyCar, and "significant racing motorcycles."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/honda-will-sell-off-historic-racing-parts-including-bits-of-sennas-v10/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There are a remarkable number of commercial fusion power startups, considering that it's a technology that's built a reputation for being perpetually beyond the horizon. Many of them focus on radically new technologies for heating and compressing plasmas, or fusing unusual combinations of isotopes. These technologies are often difficult to evaluate—they can clearly generate hot plasmas, but it's tough to determine whether they can get hot enough, often enough to produce usable amounts of power.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum are a handful of companies that are trying to commercialize designs that have been extensively studied in the academic world. And there have been some interesting signs of progress here. Recently, Commonwealth Fusion, which is building a demonstration tokamak in Massachussets, started construction of the cooling system that will keep its magnets superconducting. And two companies that are hoping to build a stellarator did some important validation of their concepts.</p>
<h2>Doing donuts</h2>
<p>A tokamak is a donut-shaped fusion chamber that relies on intense magnetic fields to compress and control the plasma within it. A number of tokamaks have been built over the years, but the big one that is expected to produce more energy than required to run it, <a href="https://www.iter.org/">ITER</a>, has faced many delays and now isn't expected to achieve its potential <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/iters-timeline-for-fusion-stretched-out-even-further/">until the 2040s</a>. Back in 2015, however, some physicists calculated that high-temperature superconductors would allow ITER-style performance in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/small-modular-nuke-plant-proposed-this-time-for-fusion/">far smaller and easier-to-build</a> package. That idea was commercialized as <a href="https://cfs.energy">Commonwealth Fusion</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/commercial-fusion-power-companies-moving-toward-test-systems/">Read full article</a></p>
