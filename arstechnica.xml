<p>Welcome to Edition 7.01 of the Rocket Report! We're compiling this week's report a day later than usual due to the Independence Day holiday. Ars is beginning its seventh year publishing this weekly roundup of rocket news, and there's a lot of it this week despite the holiday here in the United States. Worldwide, there were 122 launches that flew into Earth orbit or beyond in the first half of 2024, up from 91 in the same period last year.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>Firefly launches its fifth Alpha flight. </b>Firefly Aerospace placed eight CubeSats into orbit on a mission funded by NASA on the first flight of the company’s Alpha rocket since an upper stage malfunction more than half a year ago, <a href="https://spacenews.com/firefly-aerospace-launches-nasa-sponsored-cubesats/">Space News reports</a>. The two-stage Alpha rocket lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California late Wednesday, two days after an issue with ground equipment aborted liftoff just before engine ignition. The eight CubeSats come from NASA centers and universities for a range of educational, research, and technology demonstration missions. This was the fifth flight of Firefly's Alpha rocket, capable of placing about a metric ton of payload into low-Earth orbit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035341#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035341&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One person may have died from eating Diamond Shruumz microdosing candies, which were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/microdosing-candies-linked-to-seizures-intubation-finally-recalled/">recalled last week</a> amid a rash of severe illnesses involving <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/people-are-seizing-being-intubated-after-eating-microdose-chocolates/">seizures, intubation, and intensive care stays</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024">an update this week from the Food and Drug Administration</a>, the cluster of cases continues to increase across the country. To date, 48 people across 24 states have fallen ill after eating the candies, which include chocolate bars, gummies, and candy cones that were sold online and in retail locations, such as smoke and vape shops. Of the 48 people sickened, 46 were ill enough to seek medical care, and 27 were admitted to a hospital.</p>
<p>For now, the death noted in the FDA's latest update is only "potentially associated" with the candies and is still under investigation. No other information is yet available.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035387#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035387&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, the people managing the ITER experimental fusion reactor <a href="https://www.iter.org/doc/www/content/com/Lists/Stories/Attachments/4056/Baseline_Press_Conference_Summary_July-2024_b.pdf">announced</a> that a combination of delays and altered priorities meant that its first-of-its-kind hardware wouldn't see plasma until 2036, with the full-energy deuterium-tritium fusion pushed back to 2039. The latter represents a four-year delay relative to the previous roadmap. While the former is also a delay, it's due in part to changing priorities.</p>
<h2>COVID and construction delays</h2>
<p>ITER is an attempt to build a fusion reactor that's capable of sustaining plasmas that allow it to operate well beyond the break-even point, where the energy released by fusion reactions significantly exceeds the energy required to create the conditions that enable those reactions. It's meant to hit that milestone by scaling up a well-understood design called a tokamak.</p>
<p>But the problem has been plagued by delays and cost overruns nearly from its start. At early stages, many of these stemmed from changes in designs necessitated by a better and improved understanding of plasmas held at extreme pressures and temperatures due to better modeling capabilities and a better understanding of the behavior of plasmas in smaller reactions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035383#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035383&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI announced its Mac desktop app for ChatGPT with a lot of fanfare a few weeks ago, but it turns out it had a rather serious security issue: user chats were stored in plain text, where any bad actor could find them if they gained access to your machine.</p>
<p>As Threads user Pedro José Pereira Vieito <a href="https://www.threads.net/@pvieito/post/C85NVV6hvF6?xmt=AQGz0o3JtBOwk1nfUgk8lvxQoIV8E92xz1vK1IP8VC6zhA">noted earlier this week</a>, "the OpenAI ChatGPT app on macOS is not sandboxed and stores all the conversations in plain-text in a non-protected location," meaning "any other running app / process / malware can read all your ChatGPT conversations without any permission prompt."</p>

<p>Just before the Fourth of July holiday, Elon Musk <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Oklahoma-Firefighters-Pension-v-Musk-Motion-to-Dismiss-7-3-2024.pdf">moved</a> to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that he intentionally misled Twitter investors in 2022 by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/judge-rejects-elon-musks-claim-that-sec-subpoena-is-abuse/">failing to disclose his growing stake in Twitter</a> while tweeting about potentially starting his own social network in the weeks ahead of announcing his plan to buy Twitter.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Musk devised this fraudulent scheme to reduce the Twitter purchase price by $200 million, a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OK-Firefighters-Pension-v-Musk-First-Amended-Complaint-5-28-2024.pdf">proposed class action</a> filed by an Oklahoma Firefighters pension fund on behalf of all Twitter investors allegedly harmed claimed. But in another <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Oklahoma-Firefighters-Pension-v-Musk-Request-for-Oral-Argument-7-3-2024.pdf">court filing</a> this week, Musk insisted that "all indications"—including those referenced in the firefighters' complaint—"point to mistake," not fraud.</p>
<p>According to Musk, evidence showed that he simply misunderstood the Securities Exchange Act when he delayed filing a Rule 13 disclosure of his nearly 10 percent ownership stake in Twitter in March 2022. Musk argued that he believed he was required to disclose this stake at the end of the year, rather than within 10 days after the month in which he amassed a 5 percent stake. He said that previously he'd only filed Rule 13 disclosures as the owner of a company—not as someone suddenly acquiring 5 percent stake.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035344#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035344&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>United Launch Alliance and Blue Origin are worried about SpaceX's plans to launch its enormous Starship rocket from Florida.</p>
<p>In documents submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration last month, ULA and Blue Origin raised concerns about the impact of Starship launch operations on their own activities on Florida's Space Coast. Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company, urged the federal government to consider capping the number of Starship launches and landings, test-firings, and other operations, and limiting SpaceX's activities to particular times.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, called Blue Origin's filing with the FAA "an obviously disingenuous response. Not cool of them to try (for the third time) to impede SpaceX’s progress by lawfare." We'll get to that in a moment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035078#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035078&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon is bricking all Astro for Business robots on September 25. It first released the robot about eight months ago as a security device for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) for $2,350, but the device will soon be a pricey new addition to Amazon's failed products list.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/amazons-astro-robot-is-straight-out-of-the-jetsons/">announced Astro</a> in September 2021 as a home robot; that version of the device is still only available as a $1,600, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078NSDFSB/?tag=arstech20-20">invite-only preview</a>.</p>
<p>In November, Amazon pivoted Astro to SMBs. But as first reported by <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/amazon-discontinues-astro-for-business-robot-security-guard-to-focus-on-astro-home-robot/">GeekWire</a>, Amazon on Wednesday sent emails to employees working on Astro for Business and customers telling them that the devices will stop working on September 25. At the time, Amazon's email to customers said: "Your personal data will be deleted from the device. Any patrol or investigation videos recorded by Astro will still be available in your Ring app until your video storage time expires or your Ring Protect subscription ends." According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24190410/amazon-astro-business-robot-discontinued-refunds">The Verge</a>, the email adds:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035237#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035237&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's important to try to approach a review car with an open mind, but I'll admit my preconceptions were stacked against the Lincoln Nautilus. It's on the larger end of the midsize SUV segment, bigger than I like them, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/lincoln-corsair-phev-review-nice-design-but-too-many-rattles-and-squeaks/">my last encounter with a Lincoln</a> wasn't entirely positive. And then there's the whole giant screen. Not to be outdone by Cadillac and its 33-inch display, Nautilus has a 48-inch screen that stretches between the A pillars, which sounds like a recipe for distraction. And yet, this hybrid SUV won me over rapidly.</p>
<p>We tested the hybrid Nautilus, a $1,500 option for a model that starts at $50,415. The hybrid system combines a 2.0 L turbocharged four-cylinder direct-injection engine with an electric motor in parallel, sending torque to all four wheels via a continuously variable transmission. Total output is 310 hp (231 kW), with a maximum output of 300 hp (223 kW) from the internal combustion engine, or 134 hp (100 kW) from the electric motor.</p>
<p>It's quite efficient, too. The EPA rates the hybrid Nautilus at a combined 30 mpg (7.84 L/100 km), although a combination of 22-inch wheels and oppressive Washington, DC, summer temperatures meant that I averaged a little bit less than that.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035255#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035255&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2BdNDTlWbo">short video released Thursday</a>, possibly to celebrate the US Fourth of July holiday with the biggest rocket's red glare of them all, SpaceX provided new footage of the most recent test of its Starship launch vehicle.</p>
<p>This test, the fourth of the experimental rocket that NASA is counting on to land its astronauts on the Moon, and which one day may launch humans to Mars, took place on June 6. During the flight, the first stage of the rocket performed well during ascent and, after separating from the upper stage, made a controlled reentry into the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship upper stage appeared to make a nominal flight through space before making a controlled—if fiery—landing in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The new video focuses mostly on the "Super Heavy" booster stage and its entry into the Gulf. There is new footage from a camera on top of the 71-meter-tall first stage as well as a nearby buoy at water level. The video from the buoy, in particular, shows the first stage making an upright landing into the ocean.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035253#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035253&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thousands of anime fans were shocked Thursday when the popular piracy site Animeflix voluntarily shut down without explaining why, TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/popular-pirate-site-animeflix-shuts-down-voluntarily-240705/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>"It is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of Animeflix," the site's operators told users in a Discord with 35,000 members. "After careful consideration, we have decided to shut down our service effective immediately. We deeply appreciate your support and enthusiasm over the years."</p>
<p>Prior to its shutdown, Animeflix attracted millions of monthly visits, TorrentFreak reported. It was preferred by some anime fans for its clean interface, with one fan on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/comments/1dvaggn/what_happened_to_animeflix/">describing</a> Animeflix as the "Netflix of anime."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035247#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035247&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A US judge ruled against the Federal Trade Commission in a challenge to its rule banning noncompete agreements, saying the FTC lacks "substantive" rulemaking authority.</p>
<p>The preliminary ruling only blocks enforcement of the noncompete ban against the plaintiff and other groups that intervened in the case, but it signals that the judge believes the FTC cannot enforce the rule. The case is in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, so appeals would be heard in the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit—which is generally regarded as one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country.</p>
<p>In April, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/ftc-bans-noncompete-clauses-declares-vast-majority-unenforceable/">FTC issued a rule</a> that would render the vast majority of current noncompete clauses unenforceable and ban future ones. The agency said that noncompete clauses are "an unfair method of competition and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act," calling them "a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing contractual conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting a new business."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035241#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035241&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For many artists, it's a precarious time to post art online. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/a-crazy-update-midjourney-v6-upgrade-heaps-on-ai-generated-detail/">AI image generators keep getting better</a> at cheaply replicating a wider range of unique styles, and basically every popular platform is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/technology/terms-service-ai-training.html">rushing to update user terms</a> to seize permissions to scrape as much data as possible for AI training.</p>
<p>Defenses against AI training exist—like Glaze, a tool that adds a small amount of imperceptible-to-humans noise to images to stop image generators from copying artists' styles. But they don't provide a permanent solution at a time when tech companies appear determined to chase profits by building ever-more-sophisticated AI models that increasingly threaten to dilute artists' brands and replace them in the market.</p>
<p>In one high-profile example just last month, the estate of Ansel Adams condemned Adobe for selling AI images stealing the famous photographer's style, Smithsonian <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ansel-adams-estate-condemns-adobe-for-selling-ai-generated-images-mimicking-the-photographers-style-180984473/">reported</a>. Adobe quickly responded and removed the AI copycats. But it's not just famous artists who risk being ripped off, and lesser-known artists may struggle to prove AI models are referencing their works. In this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/rapid-growth-of-ai-systems-prompts-us-copyright-office-to-seek-public-input/">largely lawless world</a>, every image uploaded risks contributing to an artist's downfall, potentially watering down demand for their own work each time they promote new pieces online.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034684#p3">Read 56 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034684&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Supermassive black holes are ravenous. Clumps of dust and gas are prone to being disrupted by the turbulence and radiation when they are pulled too close. So why are some of them orbiting on the edge of the Milky Way’s own supermassive monster, Sgr A*? Maybe these mystery blobs are hiding something.</p>
<p>After analyzing observations of the dusty objects, an international team of researchers, led by astrophysicist Florian Peißker of the University of Cologne, have identified these clumps as potentially harboring young stellar objects (YSOs) shrouded by a haze of gas and dust. Even stranger is that these infant stars are younger than an unusually young and bright cluster of stars that are already known to orbit Sgr A*, known as the S-stars.</p>
<p>Finding both of these groups orbiting so close is unusual because stars that orbit supermassive black holes are expected to be dim and much more ancient. Peißker and his colleagues “discard the en vogue idea to classify [these] objects as coreless clouds in the high energetic radiation field of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*,” as they said in a <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/06/aa49729-24/aa49729-24.html">study</a> recently published in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035208#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035208&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you were to envision the kind of accident that would cause a person’s bowels to explode out of their body, you might imagine some sort of gruesome stabbing or grisly car accident. You’d probably never imagine that something as commonplace and harmless as a sneeze would cause this kind of ghastly injury—but that’s <a href="https://pubs.sciepub.com/ajmcr/12/6/1/index.html">exactly what happened</a> to a Florida man earlier this month.</p>
<p>The man had recently had abdominal surgery and was suffering from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551712/">wound dehiscence</a>—where his surgical scar wasn’t healing properly. While eating breakfast, the man first sneezed, then began coughing. He noticed pain and a wet sensation on his lower abdomen—only to discover several loops of his bowel had burst through his unhealed wound.</p>
<p>The man was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery where his bowels were returned to his abdomen.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035167#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035167&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More than 384,000 websites are linking to a site that was caught last week performing a supply-chain attack that redirected visitors to malicious sites, researchers said.</p>
<p>For years, the JavaScript code, hosted at polyfill[.]com, was a legitimate open source project that allowed older browsers to handle advanced functions that weren’t natively supported. By linking to cdn.polyfill[.]io, websites could ensure that devices using legacy browsers could render content in newer formats. The free service was popular among websites because all they had to do was embed the link in their sites. The code hosted on the polyfill site did the rest.</p>
<h2>The power of supply-chain attacks</h2>
<p>In February, China-based company Funnull acquired the domain and the GitHub account that hosted the JavaScript code. On June 25, researchers from security firm Sansec <a href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">reported</a> that code hosted on the polyfill domain had been changed to redirect users to adult- and gambling-themed websites. The code was deliberately designed to mask the redirections by performing them only at certain times of the day and only against visitors who met specific criteria.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035216#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035216&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For well over a century, we had the opportunity to study Neanderthals—their bones, the items they left behind, their distribution across Eurasia. So, when we finally obtained the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2006/11/6005/">sequence of their genome</a> and discovered that we share a genetic legacy with them, it was easy to place the discoveries into context. By contrast, we had no idea <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan">Denisovans</a> existed until <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/12/another-case-of-early-human-interbreeding-confirmed-in-siberia/">sequencing DNA from a small finger bone</a> revealed that yet another relative of modern humans had roamed Asia in the recent past.</p>
<p>Since then, we've learned little more. The frequency of their DNA in modern human populations suggests that they were likely concentrated in East Asia. But we've only discovered fragments of bone and a few teeth since then, so we can't even make very informed guesses as to what they might have looked like. On Wednesday, an international group of researchers described finds from a cave on the Tibetan Plateau that had been occupied by Denisovans, which tell us a bit more about these relatives: what they ate. And that appears to be anything they could get their hands on.</p>
<h2>The Baishiya Karst Cave</h2>
<p>The finds come from a site called the Baishiya Karst Cave, which is perched on a cliff on the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau. It's located at a high altitude (over 3,000 meters or nearly 11,000 feet) but borders a high open plain, as you can see in the picture below.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035203#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035203&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Outside a 100-year-old house on the edge of the Peak District in northern England, a <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/heat-pumps/">heat pump’s</a> fan blades are swiftly spinning. They’re drawing outdoor air over coils of refrigerant, harvesting warmth from that air. All air-source heat pumps do this—and they can glean heat <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/myth-heat-pumps-cold-weather-freezing-subzero/">even on cold days</a>. But this heat pump is special. It is one of the most efficient installations of its kind in the country.</p>
<p>“I’m number two on there,” fizzes owner Rob Ritchie, a retired chemistry teacher, referring to the system’s position <a class="external-link" href="https://heatpumpmonitor.org/#mode=topofthescops" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://heatpumpmonitor.org/#mode=topofthescops" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://heatpumpmonitor.org/#mode=topofthescops"}'>on HeatPumpMonitor.org</a>, a kind of online leaderboard for heat pumps around the UK and beyond. “I should say it isn’t important—but it is. It’s nice being there.” </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>
<p>At the time of writing, real-time data suggests that for every kilowatt-hour of electricity Ritchie’s heat pump consumes, it delivers 5.5 kilowatt-hours of heat—a coefficient of performance, or COP, of 5.5. Achieving a COP of 5 or above is “absolutely incredible,” says Emma-Louise Bennett, active transition support lead at <a class="external-link" href="https://www.viessmann.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.viessmann.co.uk/" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.viessmann.co.uk/"}'>Viessmann</a>, the company that made Ritchie’s heat pump.

<p>A California-based credit union with over 450,000 members said it suffered a ransomware attack that is disrupting account services and could take weeks to recover from.</p>
<p>"The next few days—and coming weeks—may present challenges for our members, as we continue to navigate around the limited functionality we are experiencing due to this incident," Patelco Credit Union CEO Erin Mendez told members in a <a href="https://www.patelco.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-1-CEO-Update.pdf">July 1 message</a> that said the security problem was caused by a ransomware attack. Online banking and several other services are unavailable, while several other services and types of transactions have limited functionality.</p>
<p>Patelco Credit Union was hit by the attack on June 29 and has been posting updates on <a href="https://www.patelco.org/securityupdate">this page</a>, which says the credit union "proactively shut down some of our day-to-day banking systems to contain and remediate the issue... As a result of our proactive measures, transactions, transfers, payments, and deposits are unavailable at this time. Debit and credit cards are working with limited functionality."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035180#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035180&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>About two years after the country’s digital minister publicly <a href="https://x.com/konotaromp/status/1564767072554745856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1564767072554745856%7Ctwgr%5E067bb0ed1dd744b2bf2d78b4b36796cb16d7338c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Finformation-technology%2F2022%2F08%2Fjapan-declares-war-on-floppy-disks-for-government-use%2F">declared</a> a “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/japan-declares-war-on-floppy-disks-for-government-use/">war on floppy discs</a>,” Japan reportedly stopped using floppy disks in governmental systems as of June 28.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-declares-victory-effort-end-government-use-floppy-disks-2024-07-03/">Reuters</a> report on Wednesday, Japan's government "eliminated the use of floppy disks in all its systems." The report notes that by mid-June, Japan's Digital Agency (a body set up during the COVID-19 pandemic and aimed at updating government technology) had "scrapped all 1,034 regulations governing their use, except for one environmental stricture related to vehicle recycling.” That suggests that there's up to one government use that could still turn to floppy disks, though more details weren't available.</p>
<p>Digital Minister Taro Kono, the politician behind the modernization of the Japanese government's tech, has made his distaste for floppy disks and other old office tech, like fax machines, quite public. Kono, who's <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/election/20240627-194994/">reportedly</a> considering a second presidential run, told Reuters in a statement today:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035152#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035152&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
