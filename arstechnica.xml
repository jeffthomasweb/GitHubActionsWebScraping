              <![CDATA[<p>NASA's Psyche spacecraft, located nearly 150 million miles from Earth on the way to an unexplored metal asteroid, has stopped firing its engines after detecting a problem in its propulsion system.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/psyche/2025/04/29/nasas-psyche-mission-looking-into-propulsion-system/">published an update Tuesday</a> revealing that the robotic spacecraft shut off its plasma thrusters earlier this month. The news wasn't widely shared until Wednesday, when NASA science chief <a href="https://x.com/NASAScienceAA/status/1917609893927772384">Nicky Fox posted it on X</a>.</p>
<p>"Engineers with NASA’s Psyche mission are working to determine what caused a recent decrease in fuel pressure in the spacecraft’s propulsion system," the agency said. The spacecraft detected the drop in pressure April 1 inside the line that feeds xenon fuel to the spacecraft's four plasma thrusters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/engineers-probe-pressure-drop-in-psyche-spacecrafts-propulsion-system/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Judge refers Apple for criminal contempt over hiding its attempt to thwart a 2021 injunction.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said in a Zoom call with press Wednesday night that the company is "going to do everything we can to bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the iOS App Store next week." That decision comes after a federal district court <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Contempt-order.pdf">found late Wednesday</a> that Apple was in "willful violation" of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/">a 2021 injunction</a> designed to allow iOS developers to steer customers to alternate payment processors for in-app purchases.</p>
<p>That 2021 injunction wound its way through years of appellate review until January 2024, when the Supreme Court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/supreme-court-denies-epic-v-apple-petitions-opening-up-ios-payment-options/">declined to hear a final attempt by Apple</a> to overturn it. Since then, the District Court for Northern California has been holding a series of evidentiary hearings examining the internal development of Apple's so-called "compliance plan" for the injunction.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Contempt-order.pdf">a scathing Wednesday night order</a>, District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers determined that Apple had engaged in a plan to "thwart the injunction's goals," and then engaged in an "obvious cover-up" to prevent that plan from being revealed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-after-court-slams-apples-obvious-cover-up/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Color E Ink in its current state requires a whole lot of compromises, as we've found when reviewing devices like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/new-color-e-ink-remarkable-tablet-tries-to-catch-up-with-and-leapfrog-kindle-scribe/">reMarkable's Paper Pro</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/">Amazon's Kindle Colorsoft</a>, including washed-out color, low refresh rates, and a grainy look that you don't get with regular black-and-white E Ink. But that isn't stopping device manufacturers from exploring the technology, and today, Onyx International has announced that it has a $1,900 color E Ink monitor that you can connect to your PC or Mac.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/mira">Boox Mira Pro</a> is a 25.3-inch monitor with a 3200×1800 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio, and it builds on the company's previous black-and-white Mira Pro monitors. The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658705/boox-mira-pro-color-e-ink-desktop-monitor">reports</a> that the screen uses E Ink Kaleido 3 technology, which can display up to 4,096 colors. Both image quality and refresh rate will vary based on which of the monitor's four presets you use (the site isn't specific about the exact refresh rate, but does note that "E Ink monitors' refresh speed is not as high as conventional monitors', and increased speed will result in more ghosting.")</p>
<p>The monitor's ports include one full-size HDMI port, a mini HDMI port, a USB-C port, and a DisplayPort. Its default stand is more than a little reminiscent of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/studio-display-review-an-apple-monitor-where-5k-doesnt-describe-the-price/">Apple's Studio Display</a>, but it also supports VESA mounting.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/e-ink-android-tablet-maker-onyx-boox-is-making-a-1900-color-e-ink-monitor/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A thousand years ago, the people living in Chaco Canyon were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_Bonito">building massive structures</a> of intricate masonry and trading with locations as far away as Mexico. Within a century, however, the area would be largely abandoned, with little indication that the same culture was re-established elsewhere. If the people of Chaco Canyon migrated to new homes, it's unclear where they ended up.</p>
<p>Around the same time that construction expanded in Chaco Canyon, far smaller pueblos began appearing in the northern Rio Grande Valley hundreds of kilometers away. These have remained occupied to the present day in New Mexico; although their populations shrank dramatically after European contact, their relationship to the Chaco culture has remained ambiguous. Until now, that is. People from one of these communities, Picuris Pueblo, worked with ancient DNA specialists to show that they are the closest relatives of the Chaco people yet discovered, confirming aspects of the pueblo's oral traditions.</p>
<h2>A pueblo-driven study</h2>
<p>The list of authors of the new paper describing this genetic connection includes members of the Pueblo government, including its present governor. That's because the study was initiated by the members of the Pueblo, who worked with archeologists to get in contact with DNA specialists at the Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen. In a press conference, members of the Pueblo said they'd been aware of the power of DNA studies via their use in criminal cases and ancestry services. The leaders of Picuris Pueblo felt that it could help them understand their origin and the nature of some of their oral history, which linked them to the wider Pueblo-building peoples.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/dna-links-modern-pueblo-dwellers-to-chaco-canyon-people/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Getting the hang of through-hole soldering is tricky for those of us tinkering at home with our irons, spools, flux, and, sometimes, braids. It's almost reassuring, then, to learn that through-hole soldering was also a pain for a firm that has made more than 60 million products with it.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi boards have a combination of surface-mount devices (SMDs) and through-hole bits. SMDs allow for far more tiny chips, resistors, and other bits to be attached to boards by their tiny pins, flat contacts, solder balls, or other connections. For those things that are bigger, or subject to rough forces like clumsy human hands, through-hole soldering is still required, with leads poked through a connective hole and solder applied to connect and join them securely.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi board has a 40-pin GPIO header on it that needs through-hole soldering, along with bits like the Ethernet and USB ports. These require robust solder joints, which can't be done the same way as with SMT (surface-mount technology) tools. "In the early days of Raspberry Pi, these parts were inserted by hand, and later by robotic placement," writes Roger Thornton, director of applications for Raspberry Pi, in <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/sustainable-solutions-with-raspberry-pi-how-intrusive-reflow-soldering-boosted-our-efficiency-and-cut-our-carbon-footprint/">a blog post</a>.

April's list includes new research on tattooed tardigrades, the first live image of a colossal baby squid, the digital unfolding of a recently discovered Merlin manuscript, and an ancient Roman gladiator whose skeleton shows signs of being gnawed by a lion.</p>
<h2>Gladiator vs. lion?</h2>

<p>Popular depictions of Roman gladiators in combat invariably include battling not just human adversaries but wild animals. We know from surviving texts, imagery, and artifacts that such battles likely took place. But hard physical evidence is much more limited. Archaeologists have now found the first direct osteological evidence: the skeleton of a Roman gladiator who encountered a wild animal in the arena, most likely a lion, based on bite marks evident on the pelvic bone, according to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319847">paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE.</p>
<p>The skeleton in question was that of a young man, age 26 to 35, buried between 200–300 CE near what is now York, England, formerly the Roman city of Eboracum. It's one of several such skeletons, mostly young men whose remains showed signs of trauma—hence the suggestion that it could be a gladiator burial site. "We used a method called structured light scanning [to study the skeleton]," co-author Tim Thompson of Maynooth University told Ars. "It's a method of creating a 3D model using grids of light. It's not like X-ray or CT, in that it only records the surface (not internal) features, but since it uses light and not X-rays etc, it is much safer, cheaper, and more portable. We have published a fair bit on this and shown its use in both archaeological and forensic contexts."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/research-roundup-tattooed-tardigrades-and-splash-free-urinals/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) rested its case in Google's search remedy trial earlier this week, giving Google a chance to push back on the government's attempt to break up the search giant. Today is arguably Google's best chance to make the case that it should not be harshly penalized in the ongoing search antitrust case, with CEO Sundar Pichai taking the stand.</p>
<p>Pichai attempted to explain why Google isn't abusing its market position and why the DOJ's proposed remedies are too extreme. The issue of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">Chrome divestment</a> came up, but Google's team also focused intensely on the potential effects of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/report-doj-wants-to-force-google-chrome-sale-android-de-bundling/">DOJ's data remedies</a>, which could force Google to share its search index and technology with other firms.</p>
<h2>A de facto spin-off</h2>
<p>Pichai, who chose to stand while giving testimony, took issue with the government's proposal to force Google to license search technology to other companies. The DOJ claims that Google's status as a monopolist has resulted in it accumulating a huge volume of user data on search behavior. Plus, its significant technological lead means its index of the web is much more robust than competing services.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/sundar-pichai-says-doj-demands-are-a-de-facto-spin-off-of-google-search/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>From the department of head scratches comes this counterintuitive news: Microsoft says it has no plans to change a remote login protocol in Windows that allows people to log in to machines using passwords that have been revoked.</p>
<p>Password changes are among the first steps people should take in the event that a password has been leaked or an account has been compromised. People expect that once they've taken this step, none of the devices that relied on the password can be accessed.</p>
<h2>Not just a bug</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">Remote Desktop Protocol</a>—the proprietary mechanism built into Windows for allowing a remote user to log in to and control a machine as if they were directly in front of it—however, will in many cases continue trusting a password even after a user has changed it. Microsoft says the behavior is a design decision to ensure users never get locked out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/windows-rdp-lets-you-log-in-using-revoked-passwords-microsoft-is-ok-with-that/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>With the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., brain worms have gotten a bad rap.</p>
<p>A year ago, the long-time anti-vaccine advocate and current US health secretary famously told The New York Times that a parasitic worm "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html">got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died</a>." The startling revelation is now frequently referenced whenever Kennedy says something outlandish, false, or offensive—which is often. For those who have followed his anti-vaccine advocacy, it's frightfully clear that, worm-infested or not, Kennedy's brain is marinated in wild conspiracy theories and dangerous misinformation.</p>
<p>While it's certainly possible that worm remnants could impair brain function, it remains unknown if the worm is to blame for Kennedy's cognitive oddities. For one thing, he was also diagnosed with mercury poisoning, which can cause brain damage, too. As prominent infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said last June <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-585-dr-anthony-fauci/id1043593599?i=1000660407241">in a conversation</a> with political analyst David Axelrod: "I don't know what's going on in [Kennedy's] head, but it's not good."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-stance-is-rooted-in-a-disbelief-in-germ-theory/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Apple’s AirPlay feature enables <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/iphone-buying-guide/">iPhones</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/which-macbook-should-you-buy/">MacBooks</a> to seamlessly play music or show photos and videos on other Apple devices or third-party speakers and TVs that integrate the protocol. Now newly uncovered security flaws in AirPlay mean that those same wireless connections could allow hackers to move within a network just as easily, spreading malicious code from one infected device to another. Apple products are known for regularly receiving fixes, but given how rarely some smart-home devices are patched, it’s likely that these wirelessly enabled footholds for malware, across many of the hundreds of models of AirPlay-enabled devices, will persist for years to come.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, researchers from the cybersecurity firm Oligo revealed what they’re calling AirBorne, a collection of vulnerabilities affecting AirPlay, Apple’s proprietary radio-based protocol for local wireless communication. Bugs in Apple’s AirPlay software development kit (SDK) for third-party devices would allow hackers to hijack gadgets like speakers, receivers, set-top boxes, or smart TVs if they’re on the same Wi-Fi network as the hacker’s machine. Another set of AirBorne vulnerabilities would have allowed hackers to exploit AirPlay-enabled Apple devices too, Apple told Oligo, though these bugs have been patched in updates over the last several months, and Apple tells WIRED that those bugs could have only been exploited when users changed default AirPlay settings.</p>
<p>Those Apple devices aside, Oligo’s chief technology officer and cofounder, Gal Elbaz, estimates that potentially vulnerable third-party AirPlay-enabled devices number in the tens of millions. “Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch—or they will never be patched,” Elbaz says. “And it's all because of vulnerabilities in one piece of software that affects everything.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/millions-of-apple-airplay-enabled-devices-can-be-hacked-via-wi-fi/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, ground teams at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida removed one of the four main engines from the Space Launch System rocket slated to send four astronauts on a voyage around the Moon next year.</p>
<p>NASA officials ordered the removal of one of the massive rocket's RS-25 main engines after discovering a hydraulic leak on the engine's main oxidizer valve actuator, which controls the flow of super-cold liquid oxygen propellant into the engine's main combustion chamber, an agency spokesperson told Ars.</p>
<p>In its place, technicians installed another RS-25 engine from NASA's inventory to the bottom of the rocket's core stage, which is standing vertical on its mobile launch platform inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy. Teams began integrating the replacement engine with the rocket last Friday and are in the process of firmly securing it in the Engine 4 position on the core stage, the NASA spokesperson said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/nasa-just-swapped-a-10-year-old-artemis-ii-engine-with-one-nearly-twice-its-age/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>CBS owner Paramount is reportedly nearing a settlement with President Donald Trump over his claim that <em>60 Minutes</em> "deceptively manipulated" a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Trump's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.396451/gov.uscourts.txnd.396451.36.0_3.pdf">complaint</a>, filed against Paramount and CBS in a federal court in Texas, seeks at least $20 billion in damages. The lawsuit has been widely described as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/media/trump-cbs-lawsuit-harris-60-minutes-interview/index.html">frivolous</a>, but it appears that Paramount is motivated to settle the case while it seeks the Trump administration's approval for a merger with Skydance.</p>
<p>Reports published yesterday by the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-04-29/trump-paramount-enter-mediation-on-60-minutes-lawsuit">Los Angeles Times</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/business/media/paramount-cbs-60-minutes-trump-lawsuit.html">New York Times</a> say that Paramount is ready to settle. "In an April 18 meeting, the Paramount board outlined acceptable financial terms for a potential settlement with the president, according to three people with knowledge of the internal discussions," the NYT wrote. "The exact dollar amounts remain unclear, but the board's move clears a path for an out-of-court resolution."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/cbs-owner-ready-to-settle-trump-lawsuit-in-apparent-bid-to-get-merger-approved/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In advance of the Switch 2's planned June launch, Nintendo has <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current">released a system update</a> for the original Switch that, among other things, activates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">the company's new Virtual Game Card system</a> for sharing digital downloads. But Switch owners are finding that this new sharing system is a bit more limiting when it comes to sharing a single digital purchase for online play across multiple consoles.</p>
<p>For those who missed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">Nintendo's March announcement of the Virtual Game Card system</a>, the new setup allows players to easily "unload" a digital game license from one Switch (or Switch 2) console and "load" it onto another console connected to the same Nintendo Account (or <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28815/~/what-is-a-nintendo-account-family-group%3F">one in the same family group</a>). An Internet connection is required for the initial loading and unloading process, but after that, the system with the Virtual Game Card can play the downloaded game completely offline.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to constantly load and unload their virtual games between systems, Nintendo also offers an "Online License" feature deep in the Switch's system menu. When this feature is turned on, if you load a digital game without a Virtual Game Card present, the Switch will perform an online check to confirm that your Nintendo Account actually has access to that game. Nintendo recommends this feature for players who want to share games across three or more Switch units.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-imposes-new-limits-on-sharing-for-digital-switch-games/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday advanced the nomination of private astronaut and businessman Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of NASA to the Senate floor, setting up the final step before he is confirmed.</p>
<p>The vote was not unanimous, at 19–9, with all of the nay votes coming from senators on the Democratic side of the aisle.</p>
<p>However, some key Democrats voted in favor of Isaacman, including the ranking member of the committee, Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. Before the vote, Cantwell said she appreciated that a candidate like Isaacman, with his background in business and private spaceflight, could bring new ideas and energy to the space agency.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/after-his-support-for-artemis-senate-committee-advances-isaacman-nomination/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Pushing to dismiss a lawsuit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/chatbots-posed-as-therapist-and-adult-lover-in-teen-suicide-case-lawsuit-says/">alleging that its chatbots caused a teen's suicide</a>, Character Technologies is arguing that chatbot outputs should be considered "pure speech" deserving of the highest degree of protection under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Garcia-v-Character-Technologies-Motion-to-Dismiss-1-24-25.pdf">motion to dismiss</a>, the developers of Character.AI (C.AI) argued that it doesn't matter who the speaker is—whether it's a video game character spouting scripted dialogue, a foreign propagandist circulating misinformation, or a chatbot churning out AI-generated responses to prompting—courts protect listeners' rights to access that speech. Accusing the mother of the departed teen, Megan Garcia, of attempting to "insert this Court into the conversations of millions of C.AI users" and supposedly endeavoring to "shut down" C.AI, the chatbot maker argued that the First Amendment bars all of her claims.</p>
<p>"The Court need not wrestle with the novel questions of who should be deemed the speaker of the allegedly harmful content here and whether that speaker has First Amendment rights," Character Technologies argued, "because the First Amendment protects the public’s 'right to receive information and ideas.'"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/are-chatbot-outputs-protected-speech-court-pressured-to-clarify/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, DC—The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will meet today to discuss its proposed budget legislation, and there's a doozy in there for drivers of electric vehicles and hybrids. As part of the Republican Party's ongoing war against <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/nsf-director-resigns-amid-55-budget-cut-mass-layoffs-from-trump-admin/">science</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-admin-may-be-trying-to-sabotage-the-national-climate-assessment/">the environment</a> under President Trump, committee chairperson Sam Graves (R-Mo.) has included some new annual fees that will cost all drivers some, but some drivers more.</p>
<p>Republicans plan to use the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation">budget reconciliation process</a> to pass this legislation, which is an expedited process that removes some of the US Senate's ability to stall. They're proposing a new annual federal motor vehicle registration fee, which state DMVs would have to collect and pass back to the federal government.</p>
<p>If it passes, all battery EVs would be subject to a new $200 tax. Hybrids—defined as vehicles that are propelled by both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine or other power source (which would include fuel cell EVs)—will pay $100. But someone who commutes 90 miles a day in a particulate-belching Ford F-350 Duramax diesel pickup truck gets away with a mere $20 a year, and only from October 1, 2030; until then they get to drive for free.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/republicans-want-to-tax-ev-drivers-200-year-in-new-transport-bill/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the most influential—and by some counts, notorious—AI models yet released will soon fade into history. OpenAI <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">announced</a> on April 10 that GPT-4 will be "fully replaced" by GPT-4o in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> at the end of April, bringing a public-facing end to the model that accelerated a global AI race when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">launched</a> in March 2023.</p>
<p>"Effective April 30, 2025, GPT-4 will be retired from ChatGPT and fully replaced by GPT-4o," OpenAI wrote in its April 10 <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">changelog</a> for ChatGPT. While ChatGPT users will no longer be able to chat with the older AI model, the company added that "GPT-4 will still be available in the API," providing some reassurance to developers who might still be using the older model for various tasks.</p>
<p>The retirement marks the end of an era that began on <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-research/">March 14, 2023,</a> when GPT-4 demonstrated capabilities that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">shocked some observers</a>: reportedly scoring at the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam, acing AP tests, and solving complex reasoning problems that stumped previous models. Its release created a wave of immense hype—and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/fearing-loss-of-control-ai-critics-call-for-6-month-pause-in-ai-development/">existential panic</a>—about AI's ability to imitate human communication and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/nyc-schools-block-chatgpt-fearing-negative-impact-on-learning/">composition</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/the-ai-that-sparked-tech-panic-and-scared-world-leaders-heads-to-retirement/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Back in the mid-1990s, when <em>The Net</em> was among the top box office draws and Americans were just starting to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/1995/10/16/americans-going-online-explosive-growth-uncertain-destinations/">flock online in droves</a>, kids had to swipe their parents' credit cards or find a fraudulent number online to access adult content on the web. But today's kids—even in states with the strictest age verification laws—know they can just use Google.</p>
<p>Last month, a <a href="https://osf.io/z83ev">study</a> analyzing the relative popularity of Google search terms found that age verification laws shift users' search behavior. It's impossible to tell if the shift represents young users attempting to circumvent the child-focused law or adult users who aren't the actual target of the laws. But overall, enforcement causes nearly half of users to stop searching for popular adult sites complying with laws and instead search for a noncompliant rival (48 percent) or virtual private network (VPN) services (34 percent), which are used to mask a location and circumvent age checks on preferred sites, the study found.</p>
<p>"Individuals adapt primarily by moving to content providers that do not require age verification," the study concluded.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/redditor-accidentally-reinvents-discarded-90s-tool-to-escape-todays-age-gates/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Intel's oddball Core Ultra 200V laptop chips—codenamed Lunar Lake—will apparently be a one-off experiment, not to be replicated in future Intel laptop chips. They're Intel's only processors with memory integrated onto the CPU package; the only ones with a neural processing unit that meets Microsoft's Copilot+ performance requirements; and the only ones with Intel's best-performing integrated GPUs, the Intel Arc 130V and 140V.</p>
<p>Today, Intel <a href="https://game.intel.com/us/stories/performance-update-for-intel-arc-140v-and-130v-built-in-gpus/">announced</a> some updates to its graphics driver that specifically benefit those integrated GPUs, welcome news for anyone who bought one and is trying to get by with it as an entry-level gaming system. Intel says that version 32.0.101.6734 of its graphics driver can speed up average frame rates in some games by around 10 percent and can speed up "1 percent low FPS" (that is, for any given frames-per-second measurement, whatever your frame rate is the slowest 1 percent of the time) by as much as 25 percent. This should, in theory, make games run better in general and ease some of the stuttering you notice when your game's performance dips down to that 1 percent level.</p>

<p>Intel's performance comparisons were made using an MSI Claw 7 AI+ using an Arc 140V GPU, and they compare the performance of driver version 32.0.101.6732 (released April 2) to version 32.0.101.6734 (released April 8). The two additional driver packages Intel has released since then will contain the improvements, too.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT users have become frustrated with the AI model's tone, and OpenAI is taking action. After widespread mockery of the robot's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/annoyed-chatgpt-users-complain-about-bots-relentlessly-positive-tone/">relentlessly positive and complimentary output</a> recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirms the company will roll back the latest update to GPT-4o. So get ready for a more reserved and less sycophantic chatbot, at least for now.</p>
<p>GPT-4o is not a new model—OpenAI released it almost a year ago, and it remains the default when you access ChatGPT, but the company occasionally releases revised versions of existing models. As people interact with the chatbot, OpenAI gathers data on the responses people like more. Then, engineers revise the production model using a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).</p>
<p>Recently, however, that reinforcement learning went off the rails. The AI went from generally positive to the world's biggest suck-up. Users could present ChatGPT with completely terrible ideas or misguided claims, and it might respond, "Wow, you're a genius," and "This is on a whole different level."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-rolls-back-update-that-made-chatgpt-a-sycophantic-mess/">Read full article</a></p>
