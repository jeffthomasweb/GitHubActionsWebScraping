                            <![CDATA[<p>Technology companies spent part of the 2010s trying to convince us that we would want an 8K display one day.</p>
<p>In 2012, Sharp brought the first 8K TV prototype to the CES trade show in Las Vegas. In 2015, the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-15-8k-sharp-japan.html"> first 8K TVs</a> started selling in Japan for 16 million yen (about $133,034 at the time), and in 2018, Samsung released the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/samsung-85q900fn-preview/">first 8K TVs in the US</a>, starting at a more reasonable $3,500. By 2016, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) had a specification for supporting 8K (Display Port1.4), and the HDMI Forum followed suit (with HDMI 2.1). By 2017, Dell had an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/dell-8k-monitor-review/">8K computer monitor</a>. In 2019, LG released the first 8K OLED TV, further pushing the<a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/the-future-of-viewing-qled-8k"> industry's claim</a> that 8K TVs were "<a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/the-future-of-viewing-qled-8k">the future</a>."</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758.98.0.pdf">declaration</a> filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Cleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she "observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents" and "maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions."</p>
<p>Cleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of "concern about a local apartment building being raided." She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until "the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle," she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/ice-protester-says-her-global-entry-was-revoked-after-agent-scanned-her-face/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration is delaying the release of TrumpRx, an online platform that lets people buy prescription drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies at a discount, <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2026/01/trumprx-launch-delayed-00755638">according to Politico</a>. While the reason for the delay is unclear, it comes as Democratic senators raise questions about how the platform will work—and whether it will be legal.</p>
<p>Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) sent <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/durbin_hhs_oig_letter_on_trumprx.pdf">a letter</a> to the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday seeking answers on how the OIG will oversee the direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform and, specifically, how it will apply the anti-kickback statute.</p>
<p>"Legitimate concerns about inappropriate prescribing, conflicts of interest, and inadequate care have been raised about the exact types of DTC platforms to which TrumpRx would route patients," the senators write.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/trumprx-delayed-as-senators-question-if-its-a-giant-scam-with-big-pharma/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There's another battle unfolding between the Federal Communications Commission and California over the state's distribution of federal Lifeline money. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr is proposing new nationwide eligibility rules to counter what he calls California's practice of giving benefits to dead people.</p>
<p>California officials say the FCC allegations are overblown, and that there is simply "lag time between a death and account closure" rather than widespread failures in its Lifeline enrollment process. Meanwhile, the only Democratic commissioner on the FCC alleges that Carr's plan to change eligibility rules uses "cruel and punitive eligibility standards" that will raise prices on many people who are still very much alive and eligible for the program.</p>
<p>Carr's office <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-418244A1.pdf">said this week</a> that the FCC will vote next month on rule changes to ensure that Lifeline money goes to "only living and lawful Americans" who meet low-income eligibility guidelines. Lifeline spends nearly $1 billion a year and gives eligible households up to $9.25 per month toward phone and Internet bills, or up to $34.25 per month in tribal areas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fcc-chair-fights-calif-governor-over-alleged-lifeline-benefits-for-dead-people/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Software developers have spent the past two years watching AI coding tools evolve from advanced autocomplete into something that can, in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/">some cases</a>, build entire applications from a text prompt. Tools like Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex can now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">work</a> on software projects for hours at a time, writing code, running tests, and, with human supervision, fixing bugs. OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">says</a> it now uses Codex to build Codex itself, and the company recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/openai-spills-technical-details-about-how-its-ai-coding-agent-works/">published</a> technical details about how the tool works under the hood. It has caused many to wonder: Is this just more AI industry hype, or are things actually different this time?</p>
<p>To find out, Ars reached out to several professional developers on Bluesky to ask how they feel about these tools in practice, and the responses revealed a workforce that largely agrees the technology works, but remains divided on whether that's entirely good news. It's a small sample size that was self-selected by those who wanted to participate, but their views are still instructive as working professionals in the space.</p>
<p>David Hagerty, a developer who works on point-of-sale systems, told Ars Technica up front that he is skeptical of the marketing. "All of the AI companies are hyping up the capabilities so much," he said. "Don't get me wrong—LLMs are revolutionary and will have an immense impact, but don't expect them to ever write the next great American novel or anything. It's not how they work."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/developers-say-ai-coding-tools-work-and-thats-precisely-what-worries-them/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Joseph Thacker's neighbor mentioned to him that she'd preordered a couple of stuffed dinosaur toys for her children. She'd chosen the toys, called Bondus, because they offered an <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/chatbots/">AI chat</a> feature that lets children talk to the toy like a kind of machine-learning-enabled imaginary friend. But she knew Thacker, a security researcher, had done work on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/human-misuse-will-make-artificial-intelligence-more-dangerous/">AI risks</a> for kids, and she was curious about his thoughts.</p>
<p>So Thacker looked into it. With just a few minutes of work, he and a web security researcher friend named Joel Margolis made a startling discovery: Bondu’s web-based portal, intended to allow parents to check on their children's conversations and for Bondu’s staff to monitor the products’ use and performance, also let anyone with a <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/gmail">Gmail</a> account access transcripts of virtually every conversation Bondu's child users have ever had with the toy.</p>
<p>Without carrying out any actual hacking, simply by logging in with an arbitrary Google account, the two researchers immediately found themselves looking at children's private conversations, the pet names kids had given their Bondu, the likes and dislikes of the toys' toddler owners, their favorite snacks and dance moves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/web-portal-leaves-kids-chats-with-ai-toy-open-to-anyone-with-gmail-account/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>I've been thinking about used electric vehicles lately. It's not news that EVs depreciate faster than gasoline-powered cars. All the incentives like tax credits and OEM rebates that entice the first owner to sign the paperwork are factored in by whoever wants to be the second owner. There are widespread—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/heres-one-way-we-know-that-an-evs-battery-will-last-the-cars-lifetime/">if mostly ill-founded</a>—worries about battery longevity and having to shell out for expensive replacement packs. Technology keeps improving, which means older models will date faster. Plus, there are the usual concerns about EVs, like charging infrastructure and winter performance.</p>
<p>So depreciate they do, and that's good news for the three-quarters of US car buyers who buy used vehicles. It means that some very expensive EVs can now be had for quite little, but we'll explore that more at a later date. Today, I want to focus on what you can get for peanuts. What if you wanted to only spend $5,000—or less—on an EV?</p>
<p>As it turns out, there are options even at this end of the market. Just don't expect that much in the way of range: We're still a while away from a $5,000 EV <em>also</em> being an EV a sane person would want to road trip. At the same time, most of us don't drive more than 40 miles a day, and EVs are great at sitting in traffic because there's no engine to idle. If you're not commuting long distances and don't live an hour from the nearest town, a cheap EV could make sense as a runabout. Especially as they're cheaper to run than a gas-powered car.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/how-far-does-5000-go-when-you-want-an-electric-car/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A consequential debate that has been simmering behind closed doors at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, must soon come to a head. It concerns the selection of the next spacecraft the agency will fly to Mars, and it could set the tone for the next decade of exploration of the red planet.</p>
<p>What everyone agrees on is that NASA needs a new spacecraft capable of relaying communications from Mars to Earth. This issue has become especially acute with the recent loss of NASA's MAVEN spacecraft. NASA's best communications relay remains the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has now been there for 20 years.</p>
<p>Congress cared enough about this issue to add $700 million in funding for a "Mars Telecommunications Orbiter" in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/amendment/119th-congress/senate-amendment/2531/text">supplemental funding for NASA</a> provided by the "One Big Beautiful Bill" passed by the US Congress last year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasa-faces-a-crucial-choice-on-a-mars-spacecraft-and-it-must-decide-soon/">Read full article</a></p>

If all goes well this weekend, NASA will complete a wet dress rehearsal test of the Space Launch System rocket in Florida. This is the final key test, in which the rocket is fueled and brought to within seconds of engine ignition, before the liftoff of the Artemis II mission. This is set to occur no earlier than February 6. Ars will have full coverage of the test this weekend.</p>

This represents a reversal from early 2025, when the United Kingdom appeared prepared to back Orbex as a means of using British rockets to launch British satellites into space. Now the government is prepared to walk away. So what happened?

                            <![CDATA[<p>It took Android devicemakers a very long time to commit to long-term update support. Samsung and Google have only recently decided to offer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/the-google-pixel-8-is-official-with-7-years-of-updates/">seven years of updates</a> for their flagship Android devices, but a decade ago, you were lucky to get more than one or two updates on even the most expensive Android phones and tablets. How is it, then, that an Android-powered set-top box from 2015 is still going strong?</p>
<p>Nvidia released the first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/nvidia-shield-android-tv-review-a-powerful-do-it-all-box-that-lacks-content/">Shield Android TV in 2015</a>, and according to the company's senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, supporting these devices has been a labor of love. And the team at Nvidia still loves the Shield. Bell assures us that Nvidia has never given up, even when it looked like support for the Shield was waning, and it doesn't plan to stop any time soon.</p>
<h2>The soul of Shield</h2>
<p>Gaming has been central to Nvidia since its start, and that focus gave rise to the Shield. "Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console," said Bell, who has worked at the company for 25 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/inside-nvidias-10-year-effort-to-make-the-shield-tv-the-most-updated-android-device-ever/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2844474">A new study in JAMA Network Open</a> found that people who faced those high out-of-pocket costs as well as a cancer diagnosis had worse overall survival and cancer-specific survival than those with more standard health plans.</p>
<p>The findings, while perhaps not surprising, are a stark reminder of the fraught decisions Americans face as the price of health care only continues to rise and more people try to offset costs by accepting insurance plans with higher deductibles—that is, higher out-of-pocket costs they have to pay before their health insurance provider starts paying its share.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/having-that-high-deductible-health-plan-might-kill-you-literally/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Despite the negativity surrounding the current version of Windows, it remains the most widely used operating system on the world's desktop and laptop computers, and people usually prefer to stick to what they're used to. As a result, Windows 11 has just cleared a big milestone—Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company's most recent earnings call (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869889/microsoft-windows-11-1-billion-users">via The Verge</a>) that Windows 11 now has over 1 billion users worldwide.</p>
<p>Windows 11 also reached that milestone just a few months quicker than Windows 10 did—1,576 days after its initial public launch on October 5, 2021. Windows 10 took 1,692 days to reach the same milestone, based on its July 29, 2015, general availability date and Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support">announcement</a> on March 16, 2020.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/windows-11-has-hit-1-billion-users-just-a-hair-faster-than-windows-10-did/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At this point, we've all heard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/with-ai-chatbots-big-tech-is-moving-fast-and-breaking-people/">plenty of stories</a> about AI chatbots leading users to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/openai-says-dead-teen-violated-tos-when-he-used-chatgpt-to-plan-suicide/">harmful actions</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/ai-therapy-bots-fuel-delusions-and-give-dangerous-advice-stanford-study-finds/">harmful beliefs</a>, or simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-search-engines-give-incorrect-answers-at-an-alarming-60-rate-study-says/">incorrect information</a>. Despite the prevalence of these stories, though, it's hard to know just how often users are being manipulated. Are these tales of AI harms anecdotal outliers or signs of a frighteningly common problem?</p>
<p>Anthropic took a stab at answering that question this week, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/disempowerment-patterns">releasing a paper</a> studying the potential for what it calls "disempowering patterns" across 1.5 million anonymized real-world conversations with its Claude AI model. While the results show that these kinds of manipulative patterns are relatively rare as a percentage of all AI conversations, they still represent a potentially large problem on an absolute basis.</p>
<h2>A rare but growing problem</h2>
<p>In the newly published paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19062">"Who’s in Charge? Disempowerment Patterns in Real-World LLM Usage,"</a> researchers from Anthropic and the University of Toronto try to quantify the potential for a specific set of "user disempowering" harms by identifying three primary ways that a chatbot can negatively impact a user's thoughts or actions:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/how-often-do-ai-chatbots-lead-users-down-a-harmful-path/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/deepmind-reveals-genie-3-world-model-that-creates-real-time-interactive-simulations/">showed off Genie 3</a>, an updated version of its AI world model with impressive long-term memory that allowed it to create interactive worlds from a simple text prompt. At the time, Google only provided Genie to a small group of trusted testers. Now, it's available more widely as Project Genie, but only for those paying for Google's most expensive AI subscription.</p>
<p>World models are exactly what they sound like—an AI that generates a dynamic environment on the fly. They're not technically 3D worlds, though. World models like Genie 3 create a video that responds to your control inputs, allowing you to explore the simulation as if it were a real virtual world. Genie 3 was a breakthrough in world models because it could remember details of the world it was creating for a much longer time. But in this context, a "long time" is a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Project Genie is essentially a cleaned-up version of Genie 3, which plugs into updated AI models like Nano Banana Pro and Gemini 3. Google has a number of pre-built worlds available in Project Genie, but it's the ability to create new things that makes it interesting. You can provide an image for reference or simply tell Genie what you want from the environment and the character.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-project-genie-lets-you-create-interactive-worlds-from-a-photo-or-prompt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In April 2025, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh bemoaned that the company's cable broadband division was "not winning in the marketplace” amid increased competition from fiber and fixed wireless Internet service providers.</p>
<p>Cavanagh <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/after-losing-customers-comcast-admits-prices-are-too-confusing-and-unpredictable/">identified some problems</a> that had been obvious to Comcast customers for many years: Its prices aren’t transparent enough and rise too frequently, and dealing with the company is too difficult. Comcast sought to fix the problems with a five-year price guarantee, one year of free Xfinity Mobile service for home Internet customers, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/stung-by-customer-losses-comcast-says-all-its-new-plans-have-unlimited-data/">plans with unlimited data</a> instead of punitive data caps. But the company is still losing broadband customers at a higher-than-expected rate.</p>
<p>In Q4 2025 earnings <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/static-files/2445b35f-2af9-4ec0-adfa-6f5a89582bc0">announced today</a>, Comcast reported a net loss of 181,000 residential and business broadband customers in the US. The loss consists of 178,000 residential Internet customers and 3,000 business customers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/comcast-keeps-losing-customers-despite-price-guarantee-and-unlimited-data/">Read full article</a></p>

Those competitions can also tell scientists something about how social cues influence how we make foraging decisions, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aee3786">new paper</a> published in the journal Science.</p>
<p>Humans are natural foragers in even the most extreme habitats, digging up tubers in the tropics, gathering mushrooms, picking berries, hunting seals in the Arctic, and fishing to meet our dietary needs. Human foraging is sufficiently complex that scientists believe that meeting so many diverse challenges helped our species develop memory, navigational abilities, social learning skills, and similar advanced cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Researchers are interested in this question not just because it could help refine existing theories of social decision-making, but also could improve predictions about how different groups of humans might respond and adapt to changes in their environment. Per the authors, prior research in this area has tended to focus on solitary foragers operating in a social vacuum. And even when studying social foraging decisions, it's typically done using computational modeling and/or in the laboratory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/what-ice-fishing-can-teach-us-about-making-foraging-decisions/">Read full article</a></p>
