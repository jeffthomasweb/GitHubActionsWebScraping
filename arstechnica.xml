              <![CDATA[<p><em>It's </em>Half-Life 2<em> week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of </em>Half-Life 2<em>—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>“Well, I just hate the idea that our games might waste people’s time. Why spend four years of your life building something that isn't innovative and is basically pointless?”</p>
<p>Valve software founder Gabe Newell is quoted by Geoff Keighley—yes, the Game Awards guy, back then a GameSpot writer—as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/"><span class="s2">saying this in June 1999</span></a>, six months after the original <i>Half-Life</i> launched. Newell gave his team no real budget or deadline, only the assignment to “follow up the best PC game of all time” and redefine the genre.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/these-are-the-lasting-things-that-half-life-2-gave-us-besides-headcrabs-and-crowbars/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX's Starlink Internet satellites are responsible for more and more public reports of unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAPs), but most recent cases remain unsolved, according to a US government report released Thursday.</p>
<p>Starlinks often move across the sky in "trains" that appear like gleaming gems in the blackness of space. They are particularly visible to the naked eye shortly after each Starlink launch.</p>
<p>In recent years, leaks and disclosures from government officials have revitalized open discussion about mysterious lights and objects, some of which move in, to put it bluntly, unquestionably weird ways. Some of these images, particularly those from sophisticated instruments on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tic-tac-ufo-sighting-uap-video-dave-fravor-alex-dietrich-navy-fighter-pilots-house-testimony/">military fighter jets</a>, have made their way into the national discourse. The New Yorker, Ars' sister publication, has a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/10/how-the-pentagon-started-taking-ufos-seriously">thorough report</a> on how UAPs—you might know them better as UFOs—became mainstream.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/a-lot-of-people-are-mistaking-elon-musks-starlink-satellites-for-uaps/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A 7-year-old launch company that has yet to have a rocket successfully lift off announced a radical pivot on Thursday. Its new plan? Focusing on missile defense.</p>
<p>The founder and president of ABL Space Systems, Dan Piemont, announced the decision <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7263027934611812352/">on LinkedIn</a>, adding, "We're consolidating our operational footprint and parting ways with some talented members of our team." He said companies interested in hiring great people in Los Angeles or Mojave, California, should reach out.</p>
<h2>A bright beginning</h2>
<p>With a background in economics and physics, Piemont founded ABL in 2017 with the aim of developing a ship-and-shoot rocket. The idea was to set up mobile ground systems in remote locations on short notice and launch on demand for the US military and other customers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/citing-decreasing-launch-opportunities-abl-space-will-pivot-to-missile-defense/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to launch an investigation into anti-competitive practices at Microsoft’s cloud computing business, as the US regulator continues to pursue Big Tech in the final weeks of Joe Biden’s presidency.</p>
<p>The FTC is examining allegations that Microsoft is abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to competitors’ platforms, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>Tactics being examined include substantially increasing subscription fees for those that leave, charging steep exit fees, and allegedly making its Office 365 products incompatible with rival clouds, they added.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ftc-to-launch-investigation-into-microsofts-cloud-business/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>It's </em>Half-Life 2<em> week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of </em>Half-Life 2<em>—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>The time has finally come to close one of the most notable gaps in my gaming history. Despite more than a decade of writing about video games and even more years enjoying them, I never got around to playing <em>Half-Life 2</em>.</p>
<p>Not only have I not played it, but I've managed to keep myself in the dark about pretty much everything to do with it. I always assumed that one day I would get around to playing this classic, and I wanted the experience to be as close as possible to it would have been back in 2004. So my only knowledge about <em>Half-Life 2</em> before starting this project was 1) the game is set in the same universe as <em>Portal</em>, a game I love, 2) the protagonist is named Gordon Freeman, and he looks uncannily like a silent, spectacled young Hugh Laurie, and 3) there's something called the Gravity Gun.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/i-played-half-life-2-for-the-first-time-this-year-heres-how-it-went/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Since ChatGPT became an instant hit roughly two years ago, tech companies around the world have rushed to release AI products while the public is still in awe of AI's seemingly radical potential to enhance their daily lives.</p>
<p>But at the same time, governments globally have warned it can be hard to predict how rapidly popularizing AI can harm society. Novel uses could suddenly debut and displace workers, fuel disinformation, stifle competition, or threaten national security—and those are just some of the obvious potential harms.</p>
<p>While governments scramble to establish systems to detect harmful applications—ideally before AI models are deployed—some of the earliest lawsuits over ChatGPT show just how hard it is for the public to crack open an AI model and find evidence of harms once a model is released into the wild. That task is seemingly only made harder by an increasingly thirsty AI industry intent on shielding models from competitors to maximize profits from emerging capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/openai-accused-of-trying-to-profit-off-ai-model-inspection-in-court/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I've never particularly loved Amazon, either as a retail behemoth or as a hardware and software company, but despite that I still probably get more excited about new Kindle releases than I do about most other gadgets at this point.</p>
<p>Some of that is because I rely on my Kindle for distraction-free reading and because I'm constantly highlighting things and taking notes, so even minor improvements have a major impact on my day-to-day experience. And some of it is because the Kindle's relatively limited tech has left it without a lot of headroom to shove additional ads or other paid add-ons; they include lockscreen ads and "special offers," but they can be permanently turned off with a nominal $20 fee, and even when you <em>don't</em> turn them off, they don't degrade the device's performance or intrude on the actual reading experience. This isn't to say that Kindles are perfect, just that it's rare that I am roughly the same amount of annoyed by a software platform's ads and tracking than I was a decade ago.</p>
<p>Enter the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P">12th-generation $160 Kindle Paperwhite</a>, which like most Paperwhites is the Kindle that most people should buy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/review-amazons-2024-kindle-paperwhite-makes-the-best-e-reader-a-little-better/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson, I have a garage. The door on that garage is opened and closed by a device made by a company that, as with Lee's, offers you a way to open and close it with a smartphone app. But that app doesn't work with my preferred home automation system, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, and also looks and works like an app made by a garage door company.</p>
<p>I had looked into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/i-home-automated-my-garage-door-finally-with-a-ratgdo/">the ratgdo Lee installed, and raved about</a>, but hooking it up to my particular Genie/Aladdin system would have <a href="https://paulwieland.github.io/ratgdo/03_wiring.html">required installing limit switches</a>. So I instead installed <a href="https://opengarage.io/">an OpenGarage unit</a> ($50 plus shipping). My garage opener now works with Home Assistant (and thereby pretty much anything else), it's not subject to the whims of API access, and I've got a few ideas how to make it even better. Allow me to walk you through what I did, why I did it, and what I might do next.</p>
<h2>Thanks, I’ll take it from here, Genie</h2>
<p>Genie, maker of my Wi-Fi-capable garage door opener (sold as an "Aladdin Connect" system), is not in the same boat as the Chamberlain/myQ setup that inspired Lee's project. There was <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">a working Aladdin Connect integration</a> in Home Assistant, until the company changed its API in January 2024. Genie said it would release its own official Home Assistant integration in June, and it did, but then it was quickly pulled back, <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/make-aladdin-connect-garage-integration-compatible-working-again/748076/5">seemingly for licensing issues</a>. Since then, no updates on the matter. (I have emailed Genie for comment and will update this post if I receive reply.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/i-too-installed-an-open-source-garage-door-opener-and-am-loving-it/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Some electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are set to get less affordable from next year, it seems. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/">As expected</a>, the incoming Trump administration has set its sights on killing off the IRS clean vehicle tax credit, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/">a report in Reuters</a> this afternoon.</p>
<p>The clean vehicle tax credit was overhauled as part of President Joe Biden's signature climate legislation. Until then, the size of a plug-in vehicle's tax credit was based on its battery capacity, with a credit of up to $7,500 available. But from 2023 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-ev-tax-credit-for-2023/">the rules changed</a>, requiring a certain amount of domestic production to qualify, as well as adding price and income caps to address criticism that the tax credit mostly subsidized the already-wealthy.</p>
<p>Far fewer vehicles are now eligible for the rebate at time of purchase, particularly after the US Treasury Department <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/its-a-new-year-and-these-are-now-the-only-evs-that-get-a-tax-credit/">got tougher about Chinese content</a>, although a loophole means that none of these conditions apply to leased EVs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/trump-team-puts-ev-tax-credit-on-the-block-tesla-is-on-board-report/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For some PC buyers, doing a clean install of Windows right out of the box is part of the setup ritual. But for Arm-based PCs, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">the Copilot+ PCs</a> with Snapdragon X Plus and Elite chips in them, it hasn't been possible in the same way. Microsoft (mostly) hasn't offered generic install media that can be used to reinstall Windows on an Arm PC from scratch.</p>
<p>Microsoft is fixing that today—the company finally has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11arm64">a download page</a> for the official Arm release of Windows 11, linked to but separate from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11">the ISOs for the x86 versions of Windows</a>. These are useful not just for because-I-feel-like-it clean installs, but for reinstalling Windows after you've upgraded your SSD and setting up Windows virtual machines on Arm-based PCs and Macs.</p>
<p>Previously, Microsoft did offer install media for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso">some Windows Insider Preview Arm builds</a>, though these are for beta versions of Windows that may or may not be feature-complete or stable. Various apps, scripts, and websites also exist to grab files from Microsoft's servers and build "unofficial" ISOs for the Arm version of Windows, though obviously this is more complicated than just downloading a single file directly.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-makes-it-easier-to-do-a-clean-windows-install-on-arm-based-pcs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Without question, inactivity is bad for us. Prolonged sitting is <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2793521">consistently linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and death</a>. The obvious response to this frightful fate is to not sit— move. Even <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069820">a few moments of exercise</a> can have benefits, <a href="https://exerciseismedicine.gr/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Breaking_Up_Prolonged_Sitting.pdf">studies suggest</a>. But in our modern times, sitting is hard to avoid, especially at the office. This has led to a range of strategies to get ourselves up, including the rise of standing desks. If you have to be tethered to a desk, at least you can do it while on your feet, the thinking goes.</p>
<p>However, studies on whether standing desks are beneficial have been sparse and sometimes inconclusive. Further, prolonged standing can have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076480/">its own risks,</a> and data on work-related sitting has also been mixed. While the final verdict on standing desks is still unclear, two studies out this year offer some of the most nuanced evidence yet about the potential benefits and risks of working on your feet.</p>
<h2>Take a seat</h2>
<p>For years, studies have pointed to standing desks improving markers for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33813968/">cardiovascular and metabolic health</a>, such as lipid levels, insulin resistance, and arterial flow-mediated dilation (the ability of arteries to widen in response to increased blood flow). But it's unclear how significant those improvements are to averting bad health outcomes, such as heart attacks. One 2018 analysis <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7749276/">suggested the benefits might be minor</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/a-standing-desk-wont-improve-your-heart-health-but-it-wont-hurt-it-either/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 2017, eight machine-learning researchers at Google released a groundbreaking research paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"><em>Attention Is All You Need</em></a>, which introduced the <a href="https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding/">Transformer</a> AI architecture that underpins almost all of today's high-profile generative AI models.</p>
<p>The Transformer has made a key component of the modern AI boom possible by translating (or transforming, if you will) input chunks of data called "tokens" into another desired form of output using a neural network.

              <![CDATA[<p>Meta has been fined nearly 800 million euros ($844.6 million) by Brussels after regulators accused Facebook’s parent company of stifling competition by “tying” its free Marketplace services with the social network.</p>
<p>Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s outgoing competition chief, said on Thursday that by linking Facebook with its classified ads service Meta had “imposed unfair trading conditions” on other providers.</p>
<p>She added: “It did so to benefit its own service Facebook Marketplace, thereby giving it advantages that [others] could not match. This is illegal.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/eu-fines-meta-e800-million-for-breaking-law-with-marketplace/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The launch of the first-ever <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-new-kindle-colorsoft-kindle-paperwhite-kindle-scribe-2024/">color Kindle</a> isn't going so great. Amazon's <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/kindle-colorsoft/">Colorsoft</a> began shipping on October 30, but shipments were paused after some customers complained about a yellow bar at the bottom of the screen and discoloration around the edges. Amazon is working on a fix and is offering a replacement or refund.</p>
<p>That's where another problem comes in. Leading up to the launch, Amazon ran a promotion advertising that its customers could trade in their old Kindle for a 20 percent discount on the Colorsoft. And some of those customers are now returning their new Colorsoft due to the yellow bar defect—leaving them without an e-reader altogether. Amazon has yet to provide any concrete information on when the fix will be ready for the Colorsoft and when it will resume shipping. It's a mess.</p>
<p>It started with an advertisement for a limited-time discount on the Colorsoft via Amazon's <a href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6WnbuGMnBi62tSK9b8oR7uNhrHV4j3k9iATSKivYVBSW5vrF6WM2kmYUub5NPUSzucdp3bW9PCx9uQUFWP6Uz6AxD2wj97bLFKEAfoCbzYRfk9W6e42c8nBwgXFCP3MH1H53g7VHkJU7W5DbepVHHRKwnjrfhGZPBaSZJUiciDZnr18QPQoBnt7ibQiGpU?xid=fr1731593242757ggf">trade-in program</a>. If the <a href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6hMwZ5F1cAhMhWTh1Cy9zckK5s32FHG2g9LbXqGHtPEfJcKwfBBSdkEHD7Any28cJBGrKE1bXSXS7TAkEBmTPdzJNaMx59kLtVUwtybgWwYFEYJrPxb9Z2QVonYS7gZJ4tnfaC?xid=fr1731593242758jjb">device was eligible</a>, you had to answer a few questions about its condition and then ship it off. Once Amazon appraises it, the trade-in value appears in the form of an Amazon gift card. Amazon also offered an additional 20 percent off the Colorsoft along with the trade-in credit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/faulty-colorsofts-have-left-some-kindle-owners-without-an-e-reader/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>It's Half-Life 2 week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of Half-Life 2—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day leading up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>When millions of eager gamers first installed <i>Half-Life 2</i> 20 years ago, many, if not most, of them found they needed to install another piece of software alongside it. Few at the time could imagine that piece of companion software–with the pithy name Steam–would eventually become the key distribution point and social networking center for the entire PC gaming ecosystem, making the idea of physical PC games an anachronism in the process.</p>
<p>While <i>Half-Life 2</i> wasn’t the first Valve game released on Steam, it was the first high-profile title to require the platform, even for players installing the game from physical retail discs. That requirement gave Valve access to millions of gamers with new Steam accounts and helped the company bypass traditional retail publishers of the day by directly marketing and selling its games (and, eventually, games from other developers). But 2004-era Steam also faced a vociferous backlash from players who saw the software as a piece of nuisance DRM (digital rights management) that did little to justify its existence at the time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The holiday season is fast approaching, and with it, all manner of uncomfortable conversations with relatives who think they know a lot about a lot but are in fact just walking examples of Dunning-Kruger in action. Not going home is always an option—there's no reason you should spend your free time with people you can't stand, after all. But if you are headed home and are not looking forward to having to converse with your uncle or parent over heaped plates of turkey and potatoes, we put together some talking points to debunk their more nonsensical claims about electric vehicles.</p>
<h2>Charging an EV takes too long</h2>
<p>The No. 1 complaint from people with no experience with driving or living with an electric car, cited as a reason for why they will never get an EV, is that it takes too long to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/">recharge them</a>. On the one hand, this attitude is understandable. For more than a century, humans have become accustomed to vehicles that can be refueled in minutes, using very energy-dense liquids that can be pumped into a fuel tank at a rate of up to 10 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>By contrast, batteries are not at all fast to recharge, particularly if you plug into an AC charger. Even the fastest fast-charging EVs connected to a fast DC fast charger will still need between 18–20 minutes to go from 10 to 80 percent state of charge, and that, apparently, is more time than some curmudgeons are prepared to wait as they drive from coast to coast as fast as they possibly can.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/heres-how-to-survive-your-relatives-ignorant-anti-ev-rant-this-thanksgiving/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Having two displays in a single device is a growing trend that appeals to people with limited desk space or who need extra pixels to work with when on the go. But often, dual-screen devices, like laptops, are loaded with trade-offs that detract from the convenience two screens should provide.</p>
<p>I've tried using dual-screen laptops as my primary display/computing device before. But if I were to buy a dual-screen gadget today, it would be a dual-screen portable monitor. After spending the last month using a dual-screen portable monitor as my main work display, I believe that laptops should leave the dual-display thing to portable monitors. At least for now.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>BioWare’s reputation as a AAA game development studio is built on three pillars: world-building, storytelling, and character development. <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Codex">In-game codices</a> offer textual support for fan theories, replays are kept fresh by systems that encourage experimenting with alternative quest resolutions, and players get so attached to their characters that an entire fan-built ecosystem of player-generated fiction and artwork has sprung up over the years.</p>
<p>After two very publicly disappointing releases with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/early-review-mass-effect-andromeda-is-dragon-age-inquisition-in-space/"><i>Mass Effect: Andromeda</i></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/"><i>Anthem</i></a>, BioWare pivoted back to the formula that brought it success, but I’m wrapping up the first third of <i>The Veilguard</i>, and it feels like there’s an ingredient missing from the special sauce. Where are the quests that really let me agonize over the potential repercussions of my choices?</p>
<p>I love <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Thedas">Thedas</a>, and I love the ragtag group of friends my hero has to assemble anew in each game, but what really gets me going as a roleplayer are the morally ambiguous questions that make me squirm: the dreadful and delicious BioWare decisions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-the-choices-you-make-while-saving-the-world/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Incremental improvements across the hardware and software stacks add up.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>There's a general consensus that we won't be able to consistently perform sophisticated quantum calculations without the development of error-corrected quantum computing, which is unlikely to arrive until the end of the decade. It's still an open question, however, whether we could perform limited but useful calculations at an earlier point. IBM is one of the companies that's betting the answer is yes, and on Wednesday, it announced a series of developments aimed at making that possible.</p>
<p>On their own, none of the changes being announced are revolutionary. But collectively, changes across the hardware and software stacks have produced much more efficient and less error-prone operations. The net result is a system that supports the most complicated calculations yet on IBM's hardware, leaving the company optimistic that its users will find some calculations where quantum hardware provides an advantage.</p>
<h2>Better hardware and software</h2>
<p>IBM's early efforts in the quantum computing space saw it ramp up the qubit count rapidly, being one of the first companies to reach the 1,000 qubit count. However, each of those qubits had an error rate that ensured that any algorithms that tried to use all of these qubits in a single calculation would inevitably trigger one. Since then, the company's focus has been on improving the performance of smaller processors. Wednesday's announcement was based on the introduction of the second version of its Heron processor, which has 156 qubits (up from an earlier 133 in Revision 1). That's still beyond the capability of simulations on classical computers, should it be able to operate with sufficiently low errors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/ibm-boosts-the-amount-of-computation-you-can-get-done-on-quantum-hardware/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon is shutting down Freevee, its free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) service, as it heightens focus on selling ads on its Prime Video subscription service.</p>
<p>Amazon, which has owned IMDb since 1998, launched Freevee as IMDb Freedive in 2019. The service let people watch movies and shows, including Freevee originals, on demand without a subscription fee. Amazon's streaming offering was also previously known as IMDb TV and rebranded to Amazon Freevee in 2022.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/freevee-shut-down-amazon-prime-video-1236172644/">Deadline</a> this week, Freevee is being “phased out over the coming weeks,” but a firm closing date hasn’t been shared publicly.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/amazon-ends-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-after-prime-video-with-ads-debuts/">Read full article</a></p>
