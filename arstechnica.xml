                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft Research introduced <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/Magma/">Magma</a>, an integrated AI foundation model that combines visual and language processing to control software interfaces and robotic systems. If the results hold up outside of Microsoft's internal testing, it could mark a meaningful step forward for an all-purpose multimodal AI that can operate interactively in both real and digital spaces.</p>
<p>Microsoft claims that Magma is the first AI model that not only processes multimodal data (like text, images, and video) but can also natively act upon it—whether that’s navigating a user interface or manipulating physical objects. The project is a collaboration between researchers at Microsoft, <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a>, the University of Maryland, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Washington.</p>
<p>We've seen other large language model-based robotics projects like Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/embodied-ai-googles-palm-e-allows-robot-control-with-natural-commands/">PALM-E</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/googles-rt-2-ai-model-brings-us-one-step-closer-to-wall-e/">RT-2</a> or Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/robots-let-chatgpt-touch-the-real-world-thanks-to-microsoft/">ChatGPT for Robotics</a> that utilize LLMs for an interface. However, unlike many prior multimodal AI systems that require separate models for perception and control, Magma integrates these abilities into a single foundation model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/microsofts-new-ai-agent-can-control-software-and-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Garbage truck fires are never ideal, but they are usually not catastrophic. When a fire broke out on December 6 in the back of a garbage truck making its Friday rounds through the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, the fire department responded within five minutes. Firefighters saw flames shooting five feet into the air out the back of the truck, and they prepared to put the fire out using hoses and water. Four minutes after their arrival on scene, however, the garbage truck exploded in rather spectacular fashion, injuring several firefighters and police officers, damaging several homes in the vicinity, and scattering debris through the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The truck, it turned out, was powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_natural_gas">compressed natural gas</a> (CNG), stored in five carbon-fiber-wrapped cylinders on the roof. The cylinders had pressure relief valves installed that should have opened when they reached a temperature between 212° and 220° Fahrenheit (100°–140° Celsius). This would vent (flammable) methane gas into the atmosphere, often creating a powerful flamethrower but keeping the tanks from exploding under the rising pressure caused by the heat. In this case, however, all the pressure relief devices failed—and the CNG tanks exploded.</p>
<p>Fire officials now believe that the whole incident began when a resident improperly disposed of a lithium-ion battery by placing it in a recycling bin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/see-a-garbage-trucks-cng-cylinders-explode-after-lithium-ion-battery-fire/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission today <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/02/federal-trade-commission-launches-inquiry-tech-censorship">announced</a> a public inquiry into alleged censorship online, saying it wants "to better understand how technology platforms deny or degrade users' access to services based on the content of their speech or affiliations, and how this conduct may have violated the law."</p>
<p>"Tech firms should not be bullying their users," said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who was chosen by President Trump to lead the commission. "This inquiry will help the FTC better understand how these firms may have violated the law by silencing and intimidating Americans for speaking their minds."</p>
<p>The FTC announcement said that "censorship by technology platforms is not just un-American, it is potentially illegal." Tech platforms' actions "may harm consumers, affect competition, may have resulted from a lack of competition, or may have been the product of anti-competitive conduct," the FTC said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/ftc-investigates-tech-censorship-says-its-un-american-and-may-be-illegal/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia's RTX 50-series makes its first foray below the $1,000 mark starting this week, with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti—at least in theory.</p>
<p>The third-fastest card in the Blackwell GPU lineup, the 5070 Ti is still far from "reasonably priced" by historical standards (the 3070 Ti was $599 at launch). But it's also $50 cheaper and a fair bit faster than the outgoing 4070 Ti Super and the older 4070 Ti. These are steps in the right direction, if small ones.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about its performance shortly, but at a high level, the 5070 Ti's performance falls in the same general range as the 4080 Super and the original RTX 4080, a card <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/">that launched for $1,199</a> just over two years ago. And it's probably your floor for consistently playable native 4K gaming for those of you out there who don't want to rely on DLSS or 4K upscaling to hit that resolution (it's also probably all the GPU that most people will need for high-FPS 1440p, if that's more your speed).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-an-rtx-4080-for-749-at-least-in-theory/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Crafty cuttlefish employ several different camouflaging displays while hunting their prey, according to a <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.70021">new paper</a> published in the journal Ecology, including mimicking benign ocean objects like a leaf or coral, or flashing dark stripes down their bodies. And individual cuttlefish seem to choose different preferred hunting displays for different environments.</p>
<p>It's well-known that cuttlefish and several other cephalopods can rapidly shift the colors in their skin thanks to that skin's unique structure. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/squid-skin-inspires-novel-liquid-windows-for-greater-energy-savings/">previously reported,</a> squid skin is translucent and features an outer layer of pigment cells called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore" data-uri="0b999c97c8f9dd1fe1bb06b1a0d5452f">chromatophores</a> that control light absorption. Each chromatophore is attached to muscle fibers that line the skin's surface, and those fibers, in turn, are connected to a nerve fiber. It's a simple matter to stimulate those nerves with electrical pulses, causing the muscles to contract. And because the muscles are pulling in different directions, the cell expands, along with the pigmented areas, changing the color. When the cell shrinks, so do the pigmented areas.</p>
<p>Underneath the chromatophores, there is a separate layer of iridophores. Unlike the chromatophores, the iridophores aren't pigment-based but are an example of structural color, similar to the crystals in the wings of a butterfly, except a squid's iridophores are dynamic rather than static. They can be tuned to reflect different wavelengths of light. A <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.1374" data-uri="8e05b3aac9793acf63975c5155ddd014">2012 paper</a> suggested that this dynamically tunable structural color of the iridophores is linked to a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. The two layers work together to generate the unique optical properties of squid skin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/crafty-cuttlefish-vary-their-camouflage/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Engineers who work for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">Elon Musk’s</a> SpaceX have been brought on as senior advisers to the acting administrator of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/washington-dc-plane-crash-everything-we-know-so-far-black-hawk-faa-potomac-american-airlines-psa/">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA), sources tell WIRED.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Sean Duffy, secretary of the Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA, <a href="https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1891310401800872114">announced</a> in a post on X that SpaceX engineers would be visiting the Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Virginia to take what he positioned as a tour. “The safety of air travel is a nonpartisan matter,” Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891312807896907807">replied</a>. “SpaceX engineers will help make air travel safer.”</p>
<p>By the time these posts were made, though, according to sources who were granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, SpaceX engineers were already being onboarded at the agency under Schedule A, a <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/hiring/">special authority</a> that allows government managers to “hire persons with disabilities without requiring them to compete for the job,” <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/hiring/">according</a> to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/spacex-engineers-brought-on-at-faa-after-probationary-employees-were-fired/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Just because Meta admitted to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">torrenting a dataset of pirated books for AI training</a> purposes, that doesn't necessarily mean that Meta seeded the file after downloading it, the social media company claimed in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-Reply-In-Support-of-Motion-to-Dismiss-2-20-25.pdf">court filing</a> this week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence instead shows that Meta "took precautions not to 'seed' any downloaded files," Meta's filing said. Seeding refers to sharing a torrented file after the download completes, and because there's allegedly no proof of such "seeding," Meta insisted that authors cannot prove Meta shared the pirated books with anyone during the torrenting process.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not Meta actually seeded the pirated books could make a difference in a copyright lawsuit from book authors including Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Ta-Nehisi Coates. Authors had previously alleged that Meta unlawfully copied and distributed their works through AI outputs—an increasingly common complaint that so far has barely been litigated. But Meta's admission to torrenting appears to add a more straightforward claim of unlawful distribution of copyrighted works through illegal torrenting, which has long been considered established case-law.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-defends-its-vast-book-torrenting-were-just-a-leech-no-proof-of-seeding/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you know <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/oled-explained-incredible-tech-but-what-about-cost-and-content/">how OLED displays work</a>, you know about one of their greatest strengths: Individual pixels can be shut off, offering deeper blacks and power savings. Dark modes, now available on most operating systems, aim to save power by making most backgrounds very dark or black, while also gratifying those who just prefer the look.</p>
<p>But what about on the older but still dominant screen technology, LCDs? The BBC is out with <a href="https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/LOCO2024_paper_12.pdf">a small, interesting study</a> comparing the light and dark modes of one of its website pages on an older laptop. Faced with a dark mode version, most people turned up the brightness a notable amount, sometimes drawing more power than on light mode.</p>
<p>It's not a surprise that dark modes don't do anything to reduce LCD power draw. However, the study—not peer-reviewed but published as part of the <a href="https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/loco/loco2024/">International Workshop on Low Carbon Computing</a>—suggests that claims about dark mode's efficiency may be overstated in real-world scenarios, with non-cutting-edge hardware and humans at the controls.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/small-study-suggests-dark-mode-doesnt-save-much-power-for-very-human-reasons/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Apple and Lenovo had the lowest laptop repairability scores in an analysis of recently released devices from consumer advocacy group US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund. While Apple's low marks are partially due the difficulty involved in disassembling MacBooks, Lenovo appears to be withholding information from shoppers deemed critical to right-to-repair legislation and accessibility.</p>
<p>The report, US PIRG's fourth annual “Failing the Fix” [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FY25-Failing-the-Fix.pdf">PDF</a>], calculated repairability scores for PCs and smartphones from popular brands in the US. <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/failing-the-fix/">The report</a> examines "the top 10 most recent devices from each brand that were available for sale directly from manufacturers in January 2025." If a brand's website didn't allow people to sort by newest release, US PIRG picked devices by sorting "by 'Bestselling' or something similar," per the report's methodology section.</p>
<p>US PIRG's analysis included finding each device's French Repairability Index scores on PC makers' French websites and on third-party retailer sites. US PIRG calculated PC makers' grades by averaging "the total French score and the isolated disassembly score from each device." It weighed disassembly scores more heavily because it believes "this better reflects what consumers think a repairability score indicates." Next, the group subtracted half a point each for membership in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/report-reveals-the-influence-big-tech-lobbyists-had-on-new-yorks-repair-bill/">TechNet</a> or the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/apple-is-lobbying-against-your-right-to-repair-iphones-new-york-state-records-confirm/">Consumer Technology Association</a> (CTA), industry groups that oppose right-to-repair legislation, and added a quarter point "for each piece of Right to Repair legislation supported by the testimony of the manufacturer in the last year."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/macbooks-lagging-behind-pc-rivals-when-it-comes-to-repairability-report/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Popular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/amazon-not-google-reportedly-buying-twitch-for-1-billion/">Amazon-owned</a> game streaming platform Twitch <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announced Wednesday</a> that it will be imposing a 100-hour limit on the archived video highlights users can preserve permanently on the site. And while Twitch says that only 0.5 percent of users will be affected by these new limits, gamers are warning that the move threatens to eradicate large swaths of recent gaming history from the Internet.</p>
<p>Highlights, in Twitch's own words, are a way for Twitch streamers to "show off your best moments to new viewers who land on your channel page." Unlike VOD recordings of full Twitch broadcasts—which are deleted automatically after seven days (or 60 days for Twitch partners)—these highlights provide a more permanent way to maintain an archive of important moments for many Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>That seeming permanence is set to end on April 29, though, when Twitch says it will start to delete content from channels with more than 100 hours of highlights, starting with the least-viewed highlights.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/history-evaporating-before-our-eyes-gamers-lament-twitchs-new-video-storage-limits/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After 14 years of trying and failing to gain a smartphone foothold, Amazon has announced it will discontinue its app store. Anyone who has content in Amazon's store will be able to access it for now, but all bets are off beginning on August 20, 2025. As part of the pull-back, the company is also discontinuing the Amazon Coins digital currency.</p>
<p>The Amazon Appstore made waves when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/03/hands-on-amazon-appstore-for-android-surpasses-google-in-places/">launched in 2011</a>, offering an alternative to what at the time was known as the Android Market. Amazon even scored some early exclusives and gave away a plethora of premium content and Coins to anyone willing to do the legwork of installing the storefront on their Android phone.</p>
<p>That level of attention didn't last, though, and the Appstore today has hardly evolved from its humble beginnings, lacking most of the content and features people have come to expect from a mobile app store. If you want to check out the store on your phone before it goes away, you'll have to sideload the client by downloading an APK from Amazon. This process isn't hard, but it proved to be a significant barrier to entry for getting people into the Amazon ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazon-remembers-it-has-an-android-app-store-kills-it/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We are effectively living in a post-horsepower world. As the roster of production cars offering quadruple-digit output figures continues to expand and a growing number of garden-variety vehicles now offer straight-line acceleration that would have been exclusively supercar territory a decade ago, serious thrust is quickly becoming an expectation rather than a rarefied experience.</p>
<p>This trend might seem like an existential dilemma for an automaker with a legacy built on face-melting performance, but Lamborghini has never really been the type to obsess over the numbers. Sure, the Aventador SVJ set a production car <a href="https://www.lamborghini.com/fr-en/nouvelles/aventador-svj-sets-nurburgring-lap-record-ahead-its-unveiling">lap record at the Nürburgring Nordschleife</a> in 2018, but the company has always championed emotional impact above all else.</p>
<p>At the press launch for the Aventador SVJ, Maurizio Reggiani—Lamborghini's chief technical officer at the time—made a point of telling the assembled journalists that despite increasing headwinds from emissions regulations, Lamborghini would continue to produce a supercar with a naturally aspirated V12 for as long as it possibly could. "I will fight it to the end!" he declared to boisterous applause.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/three-electric-motors-a-v12-and-1001-hp-driving-the-lamborghini-revuelto/">Read full article</a></p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy terminated the city's congestion charge, which made drivers pay for going below 60th Street.</p>
<p>Duffy claimed that it's unfair that drivers should have to pay to use roads since there are already tolls on bridges into Manhattan and claimed there are no alternatives, ignoring the buses and subway trains operated by the Metropolitan Transit Authority.</p>
<p>Further, the city is being unfair against people who live far away, Duffy said. "The toll program leaves drivers without any free highway alternative and instead takes more money from working people to pay for a transit system and not highways. It’s backwards and unfair," he said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/trump-rescinds-dot-approval-for-nyc-congestion-toll-condemns-city-to-pollution/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Signal, as an encrypted messaging app and protocol, remains relatively secure. But Signal's growing popularity as a tool to circumvent surveillance has led agents affiliated with Russia to try to manipulate the app's users into surreptitiously linking their devices, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger/">according to Google's Threat Intelligence Group</a>.</p>
<p>While Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine is likely driving the country's desire to work around Signal's encryption, "We anticipate the tactics and methods used to target Signal will grow in prevalence in the near-term and proliferate to additional threat actors and regions outside the Ukrainian theater of war," writes Dan Black at Google's Threat Intelligence blog.</p>
<p>There was no mention of a Signal vulnerability in the report. Nearly all secure platforms can be overcome by some form of social engineering. Microsoft 365 accounts were recently revealed to be the target of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">"device code flow" OAuth phishing</a> by Russia-related threat actors. Google notes that <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059212-How-do-I-ensure-Signal-is-up-to-date">the latest versions of Signal</a> include features designed to protect against these phishing campaigns.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russia-aligned-hackers-are-targeting-signal-users-with-device-linking-qr-codes/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, the Trump administration fired several frontline responders to the ongoing H5N1 bird flu outbreak—then quickly backpedaled, rescinding those terminations and attempting to reinstate the critical staff.</p>
<p>The termination letters went out to employees at the US Department of Agriculture, one of the agencies leading the federal response to the outbreak that continues to plague US dairy farms and ravage poultry operations, affecting over 160 million birds and sending egg prices soaring. As the virus continues to spread, infectious disease experts fear it could evolve to spread among humans and cause more severe disease. So far, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html">68 cases in humans</a>, one of which was fatal.</p>
<p>Prior to Trump taking office, health experts had criticized the country's response to H5N1 for lack of transparency at times, sluggishness, inadequate testing, and its inability to halt transmission among dairy farms, which was once considered containable. To date, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">972 herds across 17 states</a> have been infected since last March, including 36 herds in the last 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/trump-admin-fires-usda-staff-working-on-bird-flu-immediately-backpedals/">Read full article</a></p>

      Scientists can now explain the prevailing unpredictability of contact electrification, unveiling order from what has long been considered chaos.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity">Static electricity</a>—specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboelectric_effect">triboelectric effect</a>, aka contact electrification—is ubiquitous in our daily lives, found in such things as a balloon rubbed against one's hair or styrofoam packing peanuts sticking to a cat's fur (as well as human skin, glass tabletops, and just about anywhere you don't want packing peanuts to be). The most basic physics is well understood, but long-standing mysteries remain, most notably how different materials exchange positive and negative charges—sometimes ordering themselves into a predictable series, but sometimes appearing completely random.</p>
<p>Now scientists at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) have identified a critical factor explaining that inherent unpredictability: It's the contact history of given materials that controls how they exchange charges in contact electrification. They described their findings in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08530-6">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature.</p>
<p>Johan Carl Wilcke published the first so-called "triboelectric series" in 1757 to describe the tendency of different materials to self-order based on how they develop a positive or negative charge. A material toward the bottom of the list, like hair, will acquire a more negative charge when it comes into contact with a material near the top of the list, like a rubber balloon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/scientists-unlock-vital-clue-to-strange-quirk-of-static-electricity/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, Google has embarked on a quest to jam generative AI into every product and initiative possible. Google has robots summarizing search results, interacting with your apps, and analyzing the data on your phone. And sometimes, the output of generative AI systems can be surprisingly good despite lacking any real knowledge. But can they do science?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Research is now angling to turn AI into a scientist—well, a "co-scientist." The company has a new multi-agent AI system based on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Gemini 2.0</a> aimed at biomedical researchers that can supposedly point the way toward new hypotheses and areas of biomedical research. However, Google's AI co-scientist boils down to a fancy chatbot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A flesh-and-blood scientist using Google's co-scientist would input their research goals, ideas, and references to past research, allowing the robot to generate possible avenues of research. The AI co-scientist contains multiple interconnected models that churn through the input data and access Internet resources to refine the output. Inside the tool, the different agents challenge each other to create a "self-improving loop," which is similar to the new raft of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">reasoning AI models</a> like Gemini Flash Thinking and OpenAI o3.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/googles-new-ai-generates-hypotheses-for-researchers/">Read full article</a></p>
