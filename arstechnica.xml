<p>For many people, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee is the start of a great day. But <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/caffeine-connection-between-coffee-and-headaches">caffeine can cause headaches and jitters</a> in others. That’s why many people reach for a decaffeinated cup instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/michael-crowder.html">I’m a chemistry professor</a> who has taught lectures on why chemicals dissolve in some liquids but not in others. The processes of decaffeination offer great real-life examples of these chemistry concepts. Even the best decaffeination method, however, <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/Decaffeinated-Coffee">does not remove all of the caffeine</a>—about 7 milligrams of caffeine usually remain in an 8-ounce cup.</p>
<p>Producers decaffeinating their coffee want to remove the caffeine while retaining all—or at least most—of the other chemical aroma and flavor compounds. Decaffeination <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee">has a rich history</a>, and now almost all coffee producers use <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/">one of three common methods</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039127#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039127&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In June, Runway debuted a new text-to-video synthesis model called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/runways-latest-ai-video-generator-brings-giant-cotton-candy-monsters-to-life/">Gen-3 Alpha</a>. It converts written descriptions called "prompts" into HD video clips without sound. We've since had a chance to use it and wanted to share our results. Our tests show that careful prompting isn't as important as matching concepts likely found in the training data, and that achieving amusing results likely requires many generations and selective cherry-picking.</p>

<p>An enduring theme of all generative AI models we've seen since 2022 is that they can be excellent at mixing concepts found in training data but are typically very poor at generalizing (applying learned "knowledge" to new situations the model has not explicitly been trained on). That means they can excel at stylistic and thematic novelty but struggle at fundamental structural novelty that goes beyond the training data.</p>
<p>What does all that mean? In the case of Runway Gen-3, lack of generalization means you might ask for a sailing ship in a swirling cup of coffee, and provided that Gen-3's training data includes video examples of sailing ships and swirling coffee, that's an "easy" novel combination for the model to make fairly convincingly. But if you ask for a cat drinking a can of beer (in a beer commercial), it will generally fail because there aren't likely many videos of photorealistic cats drinking human beverages in the training data. Instead, the model will pull from what it has learned about videos of cats and videos of beer commercials and combine them. The result is a cat with human hands pounding back a brewsky.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036379#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036379&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA launched the Chandra X-ray Observatory 25 years ago this week, opening a new eye on the Universe and giving astronomers vision into unimaginably violent cosmic environments like exploding stars and black holes. But Chandra's mission may soon end as NASA's science division faces a nearly billion-dollar budget shortfall.</p>
<p>NASA says it can no longer afford to fund Chandra at the levels it has since the telescope launched in 1999. The agency has a diminished budget for science missions this year, and the reductions may continue next year due to government spending caps in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/29/us/politics/debt-ceiling-agreement.html">deal reached between Congress and the Biden administration</a> last year to suspend the federal debt ceiling.</p>
<p>Congress and the White House have prioritized funding for NASA's human spaceflight programs, primarily the rockets, spacecraft, landers, spacesuits, and rovers needed for the Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon. Meanwhile, the funding level for NASA's science mission directorate has dropped.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038738#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038738&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Authorities have identified a second death that may have been caused by Diamond Shruumz microdosing candies, which are under investigation for causing a nationwide rash of severe illnesses involving <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/people-are-seizing-being-intubated-after-eating-microdose-chocolates/">seizures, and the need for intubation and intensive care</a>.</p>

Of the 74 people sickened, 62 sought medical care, and 38 were admitted to a hospital. There are two potentially associated deaths that are now under investigation. The counts are up from 69 cases and 36 hospitalizations, with one potentially linked death reported in an update last week.</p>
<p>The FDA announced its investigation into Diamond Shruumz products on June 7, when there had been just eight cases reported from four states. The federal investigation—led by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with help from America’s Poison Centers and state and local partners—followed warnings from Arizona poison control officials.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039080#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039080&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>KnowBe4, a US-based security vendor, revealed that it unwittingly hired a North Korean hacker who attempted to load malware into the company's network. KnowBe4 CEO and founder Stu Sjouwerman described the incident in a <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/how-a-north-korean-fake-it-worker-tried-to-infiltrate-us">blog post</a> yesterday, calling it a cautionary tale that was fortunately detected before causing any major problems.</p>
<p>"First of all: No illegal access was gained, and no data was lost, compromised, or exfiltrated on any KnowBe4 systems," Sjouwerman wrote. "This is not a data breach notification, there was none. See it as an organizational learning moment I am sharing with you. If it can happen to us, it can happen to almost anyone. Don't let it happen to you."</p>
<p>KnowBe4 said it was looking for a software engineer for its internal IT AI team. The firm hired a person who, it turns out, was from North Korea and was "using a valid but stolen US-based identity" and a photo that was "enhanced" by artificial intelligence. There is now an active FBI investigation amid suspicion that the worker is what KnowBe4's blog post called "an Insider Threat/Nation State Actor."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039069#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039069&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On July 22, the New Zealand women's football (soccer) team was training in Saint-Étienne, France, for its upcoming Olympics matchup against Canada when team officials noticed a drone hovering near the practice pitch. Suspecting skullduggery, the New Zealand squad called the local police, and <em>gendarmes</em> located and then detained the nearby drone operator. He turned out to be one Joseph Lombardi, an "unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer"—and he was apparently spying on the New Zealand practice and relaying information to a Canadian assistant coach.</p>
<p>On July 23, the New Zealand Olympic Committee <a href="https://olympic.org.nz/news/nzoc-statement">put out a statement</a> saying it was "deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident, which occurred just three days before the sides are due to face each other in their opening game of Paris 2024." It also complained to the official International Olympic Committee integrity unit.</p>
<p>Early today, July 24, the Canadian side issued its own <a href="https://olympic.ca/press/coc-statement-on-canada-soccer/">statement</a> saying that it "stands for fair-play and we are shocked and disappointed. We offer our heartfelt apologies to New Zealand Football, to all the players affected, and to the New Zealand Olympic Committee."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039027#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039027&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>We have a couple of techniques that allow us to infer the presence of an exoplanet based on its effects on the light coming from its host star. But there's an alternative approach that sometimes works: image them directly. It's much more limited, since the planet has to be pretty big and orbiting far away enough from its star to avoid having light coming from the planet swamped by the far more intense starlight.</p>
<p>Still, it <a href="Still,%20it%20has%20been%20done">has been done</a>. Massive exoplanets have been captured relatively shortly after their formation, when the heat generated by the collapse of material into the planet causes them to glow in the infrared. But the Webb telescope is far more sensitive than any infrared observatory we've ever built, and it has managed to image a relatively nearby exoplanet that's roughly as old as the ones in our Solar System.</p>
<h2>Looking directly at a planet</h2>
<p>What do you need to directly image a planet that's orbiting a star light-years away? The first thing is a bit of hardware called a coronagraph attached to your telescope. This is responsible for blocking the light from the star the planet is orbiting; without it, that light will swamp any other sources in the exosolar system. Even with a good coronagraph, you need the planets to be orbiting at a significant distance from the star so that they're cleanly separated from the signal being blocked by the coronagraph.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039031#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039031&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>AMD had planned to launch its first round of Ryzen 9000-series desktop processors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/amds-next-gen-ryzen-9000-desktop-chips-and-the-zen-5-architecture-arrive-in-july/">by the end of July</a>, but those plans have changed thanks to a very non-specific problem found with the first batch of processors that AMD sent out to its partners. The six- and eight-core Ryzen 9600X and 9700X are now slated to launch on August 8, and the 12- and 16-core Ryzen 9900X and 9950X will launch on August 15.</p>
<p>AMD's full statement is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>We appreciate the excitement around Ryzen 9000 series processors. During final checks, we found the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations. Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units. As a result, there will be a short delay in retail availability. The Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X processors will now go on sale on August 8th and the Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X processors will go on-sale on August 15th. We pride ourselves in providing a high-quality experience for every Ryzen user, and we look forward to our fans having a great experience with the new Ryzen 9000 series.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked for details about the specific problem and what the fix was, AMD Public Relations Manager Matthew Hurwitz told Ars that AMD had implemented additional screening for the Ryzen 9000 CPUs but couldn't share specifics about what AMD is screening for.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039003#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039003&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/elon-musks-x-scrambles-to-keep-court-case-against-media-matters-in-texas/">fight against Media Matters for America</a> (MMFA)—a watchdog organization that he largely blames for an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/stop-comparing-xs-dismal-ad-sales-to-twitters-past-success-x-exec-says/">ad boycott that tanked Twitter/X's revenue</a>—has raised an interesting question about whether any judge owning Tesla stock might reasonably be considered biased when weighing any lawsuit centered on the tech billionaire.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MMFA-Reply-ISO-Motion-to-Compel-Corrected-Certificate-of-Interested-Persons.pdf">court filing</a> Monday, MMFA lawyers argued that "undisputed facts—including statements from Musk and Tesla—lay bare the interest Tesla shareholders have in this case." According to the watchdog, any outcome in the litigation will likely impact Tesla's finances, and that's a problem because there's a possibility that the judge in the case, Reed O'Connor, owns Tesla stock.</p>
<p>"X cannot dispute the public association between Musk—his persona, business practices, and public remarks—and the Tesla brand," MMFA argued. "That association would lead a reasonable observer to 'harbor doubts' about whether a judge with a financial interest in Musk could impartially adjudicate this case."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038996#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038996&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Angry T-Mobile customers have filed a class action lawsuit over the carrier's decision to raise prices on plans that were advertised as having a lifetime price guarantee.</p>
<p>"Based upon T-Mobile's representations that the rates offered with respect to certain plans were guaranteed to last for life or as long as the customer wanted to remain with that plan, each Plaintiff and the Class Members agreed to these plans for wireless cellphone service from T-Mobile," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.551616/gov.uscourts.njd.551616.1.0.pdf">complaint</a> filed in US District Court for the District of New Jersey. "However, in May 2024, T-Mobile unilaterally did away with these legacy phone plans and switched Plaintiffs and the Class to more expensive plans without their consent."</p>
<p>The complaint, filed on July 12, has four named plaintiffs who live in New Jersey, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. They are seeking to represent a class of all US residents "who entered into a T-Mobile One Plan, Simple Choice plan, Magenta, Magenta Max, Magenta 55+, Magenta Amplified or Magenta Military Plan with T-Mobile which included a promised lifetime price guarantee but had their price increased without their consent and in violation of the promises made by T-Mobile and relied upon by Plaintiffs and the proposed class."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038978#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038978&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Security firm CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/">has posted a preliminary post-incident report</a> about the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">botched update</a> to its Falcon security software that caused <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/microsoft-says-8-5m-systems-hit-by-crowdstrike-bsod-releases-usb-recovery-tool/">as many as 8.5 million Windows PCs</a> to crash over the weekend, delaying flights, disrupting emergency response systems, and generally wreaking havoc.</p>

<p>The detailed post explains exactly what happened: At just after midnight Eastern time, CrowdStrike deployed "a content configuration update" to allow its software to "gather telemetry on possible novel threat techniques." CrowdStrike says that these Rapid Response Content updates are tested before being deployed, and one of the steps involves checking updates using something called the Content Validator. In this case, "a bug in the Content Validator" failed to detect "problematic content data" in the update responsible for the crashing systems.</p>
<p>CrowdStrike says it is making changes to its testing and deployment processes to prevent something like this from happening again. The company is specifically including "additional validation checks to the Content Validator" and adding more layers of testing to its process.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038917#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038917&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google Play is a lot of things—perhaps too many things for those who just want to install some apps. If that's how you feel, you might find "Google Play's next chapter" a bit bewildering, as Google hopes to make it "more than a store." Or you might start thinking about how to turn Play Points into a future Pixel phone.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z68coQCh2KE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Google Play's "new way to Play." </p></div>
<p>In a blog post about "<a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-play-july-2024-new-updates/">How we're evolving Google Play</a>," VP and General Manager of Google Play Sam Bright outlines the big changes to Google Play:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.google/howplayworks/the-latest/?section=latest-drawer&amp;content=latest-2024-q1">AI-generated</a> app reviews and summaries, along with app comparisons</li>
<li>"Curated spaces" for interests, showing content from apps related to one thing (like <a href="https://play.google/howplayworks/the-latest/?section=latest-drawer&amp;content=latest-2024-q1#:~:text=Cricket%20takeover%3A%20Experimenting%20with%20immersive%20content">cricket</a>, and Japanese comics)</li>
<li>Game recommendations based on genres and features you select.</li>
<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/google-play-games-beta-now-on-windows-desktops-if-thats-your-thing/">Google Play Games on PC</a> can pick up where you left off in games played on mobile and can soon play multiple titles at the same time on desktop.</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/points">Play Points</a> enthusiasts who are in the Diamond, Platinum, or Gold levels can win Pixel devices, Razer gaming products, and other gear, along with other game and access perks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the upgrades to existing Play features. The big new thing is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial?id=mc_apps_us_cubes_fcp_acquisition_install_cta_generic&amp;hl=en">Collections</a>, which, like the "curated spaces," takes content from apps you already have installed and organizes them around broad categories. I spotted "Watch," "Listen," "Read," "Games," "Social," "Shop," and "Food" in Google's animated example. You can toggle individual apps feeding into the Collections in the settings.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038915#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038915&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815325410667749760">announced</a> the start of training for what he calls "the world's most powerful AI training cluster" at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/musk-announces-new-ai-company-that-seeks-to-understand-the-universe/">xAI's</a> new supercomputer facility in Memphis, Tennessee. The billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of multiple tech companies took to X (formerly Twitter) to share that the so-called "Memphis Supercluster" began operations at approximately 4:20 am local time that day.</p>

<p>Musk's xAI team, in collaboration with X and Nvidia, launched the supercomputer cluster featuring 100,000 liquid-cooled <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/hopper-time-nvidias-most-powerful-ai-chip-yet-ships-in-october/">H100</a> GPUs on a single <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/exadata/hardware/rdmanetwork/">RDMA fabric</a>. This setup, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815341263102804072">according to Musk</a>, gives xAI "a significant advantage in training the world's most powerful AI by every metric by December this year."</p>
<p>Given issues with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/elon-musks-grok-keeps-making-up-fake-news-based-on-x-users-jokes/">xAI's Grok</a> chatbot throughout the year, skeptics would be justified in questioning whether those claims will match reality, especially given Musk's tendency for grandiose, off-the-cuff remarks on the social media platform he runs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038885#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038885&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"She's cured!"</p>
<p>Health officials in Washington state are celebrating the clean bill of health for one particularly notable resident: the woman <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/us-woman-has-walked-around-with-untreated-tb-for-over-a-year-now-faces-jail/">who refused to isolate and get treatment</a> for her active case of infectious tuberculosis for over a year. She even spent around three months on the lam, dodging police as they tried to execute a civil arrest warrant. During her time as a fugitive, police memorably reported that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/woman-with-untreated-tb-is-on-the-lam-took-city-bus-to-casino/">she took a city bus to go to a casino</a>.</p>
<p>The woman, identified only as V.N. in court documents, had court orders to get treatment for her tuberculosis infection beginning in January of 2022. She refused to comply as the court renewed the orders on a monthly basis and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/us-woman-headed-to-jail-for-refusing-tb-treatment-for-over-a-year/">held at least 17 hearings</a> on the matter. The judge in her case issued an arrest warrant in March of 2023, but V.N. evaded law enforcement. She was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/woman-with-untreated-tb-finally-in-custody-held-in-negative-pressure-room/">finally arrested in June</a> of last year and spent 23 days getting court-ordered treatment behind bars before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/woman-who-went-on-the-lam-with-untreated-tb-is-now-out-of-the-slammer/">being released with conditions</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038901#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038901&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After years of rumors and speculation, Apple is moving ahead to produce its first foldable iPhone, according to two anonymous sources who spoke with tech publication <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone">The Information</a>.</p>
<p>The sources say that Apple has begun discussing specific component requirements with suppliers and offered several new details about both the foldable device and the upcoming iPhone 16, iPhone 17, and revamped iPhone SE.</p>
<p>The foldable phone would arrive no sooner than 2026, as it takes about two years to go through the process of manufacturing a new iPhone model. It's also still possible that Apple will abandon its plans in the future.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038865#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038865&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google is a company in transformation—but "from what<em>"</em> and "to what<em>"</em> are not always clear. To catalog and examine Google's moves in this new era of generative AI, Ars Technica is hiring a Senior Technology Reporter to focus on Google, AI, Android, and search. While attention to so-called "consumer products" will be important, this role will be more focused on Google's big moves as a technology and infrastructure company, moves often made to counter perceived threats from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Perplexity. Informed skepticism is the rule around here, so we're looking for someone with the chops to bring a critical eye to some deep technical and business issues.</p>
<p>As this is a senior role owning an important beat, it is not an entry-level position. We're looking for someone who can primarily self-direct when it comes to their reporting and someone who is comfortable working remotely within a similarly remote team. We'd also like someone who can bring to the table deep and intelligent analyses on broader Google topics while also hitting smaller daily news stories.</p>
<p>This is a full-time union job with benefits.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038555#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038555&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, will invest another $5 billion over the next few years in its autonomous driving operation, Waymo. Alphabet CTO Ruth Porat announced the news during the company's quarterly financial results call with investors on Tuesday evening. "This is consistent with enabling Waymo to build the world's leading self-driving technology," Porat said.</p>
<p>Waymo has been developing its autonomous vehicle tech for over a decade now. Originally the Google self-driving car project, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2008/09/future-of-driving-part-1/">its roots lie in Stanford's entries</a> in the 2005 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/11/robotic-urban-warriors-pass-darpas-grand-challenge/">2007</a> DARPA Grand Challenges. At first, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/04/googles-self-driving-cars-hit-700000-miles-learn-city-navigation/">Google project used</a> modified Toyota Priuses and Lexus SUVs, but the company planned to deploy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/05/google-builds-a-prototype-self-driving-car-sans-steering-wheel/">cute pod cars with two seats and no steering wheel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/google-spins-out-self-driving-car-unit-now-called-waymo/">In 2016</a>, Alphabet spun Waymo off as a standalone company under the Alphabet umbrella. The following year, the pod car—<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/13/waymo-self-driving-car-replaces-firefly-bubble-design-adapted-chrysler-alphabet">called Firefly</a>—was no more; instead, Waymo placed big orders for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/waymo-races-gm-to-deploy-self-driving-cars-orders-thousands-of-minivans/">hybrid Chrysler Pacifica minivans</a> and fully electric <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/a-cab-ride-in-a-jaguar-waymo-will-go-classy-for-20000-electric-robotaxis/">Jaguar I-Paces</a>, kitting out those production models with their own sensors and autonomous driving hardware. The company is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/the-waymo-zeekr-robotaxi-has-come-to-san-francisco/">starting to test its tech with an EV created by Zeekr</a> (a Geely brand alongside Polestar and Lynk &amp; Co).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038867#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038867&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As Russia has tested <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robots-are-fighting-robots-in-russias-war-in-ukraine/">every</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ukraine-power-war-crimes/">form</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-ukraine-third-blackout-cyberattack/">of attack</a> on Ukraine's civilians over the past decade, both digital and physical, it's often used winter as one of its weapons—launching cyberattacks on electric utilities to trigger December blackouts and ruthlessly bombing heating infrastructure. Now it appears Russia-based hackers last January tried yet another approach to leave Ukrainians in the cold: a specimen of malicious software that, for the first time, allowed hackers to reach directly into a Ukrainian heating utility, switching off heat and hot water to hundreds of buildings in the midst of a winter freeze.</p>
<p>Industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos on Tuesday revealed a newly discovered sample of Russia-linked malware that it believes was used in a cyberattack in late January to target a heating utility in Lviv, Ukraine, disabling service to 600 buildings for around 48 hours. The attack, in which the malware altered temperature readings to trick control systems into cooling the hot water running through buildings' pipes, marks the first confirmed case in which hackers have directly sabotaged a heating utility. </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Archaeologists seeking to learn more about how Neanderthals prepared and cooked their food conducted a series of hands-on experiments with small fowl using flint flakes for butchering. They found that the flint flakes were surprisingly effective for butchering the birds, according to their <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-archaeology/articles/10.3389/fearc.2024.1411853/full">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Archaeology. They also concluded that roasting the birds damages the bones to such an extent that it's unlikely they would be preserved in the archaeological record.</p>
<p>According to the authors, Neanderthals were able to thrive for over 200,000 years across a broad range of geographical regions, so naturally archaeologists are interested in how they sustained themselves. There has been research into their killing and hunting of large game. Neanderthals were expert hunters known to kill bears and other carnivores. A pair of lion fibula from the Middle Paleolithic found in eastern Iberia with cut marks indicates the lion was butchered, while other lion bones found in Southwestern France from the same period had cut marks indicative of skinning.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/10/this-may-be-the-earliest-evidence-that-neanderthals-hunted-cave-lions/">as we reported</a> just last year, researchers found evidence of what might be the earliest example of lion hunting yet known, based on a close forensic analysis of a cave lion skeleton showing evidence of injury by a wooden spear some 48,000 years ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038699#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038699&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Tesla <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q2-2024-Update.pdf">posted</a> its second-quarter financial results ahead of an investor call this afternoon. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/tesla-production-fell-by-15-percent-in-q2-2024-as-sales-continue-to-decline/">Earlier this month</a>, it released its Q2 2024 production and delivery numbers, which showed a 14.4 percent year-over-year reduction in the number of cars it built and a 4.8 percent reduction in sales compared to the same three months in 2023. Now, we can see the effect that a shrinking average sales price has had on the automaker's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Automotive revenues dropped a little more than deliveries, down 7 percent year over year to $19.9 billion—Tesla's price cuts since last year will have contributed to that. The good news for Tesla is that it doubled its sales of batteries and solar, deploying 9.4 GWh of batteries in Q2, which brought in $3 billion in revenue.</p>
<h2>Lots more carbon credits</h2>
<p>Tesla also saw a healthy increase in regulatory credits, where other automakers pay the company in order to count some of its EVs toward their own fleets. This exchange allows other companies to continue polluting rather than selling more efficient vehicles. The credits more than tripled compared to 2023—Tesla raked in $890 million in credits for Q2 2024.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038810#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038810&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
