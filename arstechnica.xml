<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apart from the much-ballyhooed (and delayed) Apple Intelligence, a big change to home screen customization and app icon placement is one of iOS 18’s flagship features, alongside an overhauled Control Center.</p>
<p>With the public launch of iOS 18 this week, we’ll be delving into those flagship features one by one, and I’m starting with the home screen because I have often criticized the iPhone’s home screen experience in the past. iOS 18 promises the biggest update to home screen customization since, well, ever.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through how to use the new features, explore how they work, and try to answer the most important question: does the iPhone finally offer the kind of home screen flexibility that users have been asking for?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050070#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050070&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Space is more accessible than ever thanks to the proliferation of small satellites and more affordable launch prices, which opened the door to bespoke applications like global pollution monitoring, crop observations, and new ways of collecting weather and climate data.</p>
<p>Now you can add wildfire detection to the list. Satellites have observed wildfires from space for decades, but a new initiative partially funded by Google's philanthropic arm aims to deploy more than 50 small satellites in low-Earth orbit to pinpoint flare-ups as small as a classroom anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The FireSat constellation, managed by a nonprofit called Earth Fire Alliance (EFA), will be the first satellite fleet dedicated to detecting and tracking wildfires. Google announced a fresh investment of $13 million in the FireSat constellation Monday, building on the tech giant's previous contributions to support the development of custom infrared sensors for the FireSat satellites.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050160#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050160&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>OpenAI truly does not want you to know what its latest AI model is "thinking." Since the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">launched</a> its "Strawberry" AI model family last week, touting so-called reasoning abilities with o1-preview and o1-mini, OpenAI has been sending out warning emails and threats of bans to any user who tries to probe into how the model works.</p>

<p>Unlike previous AI models from OpenAI, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>, the company trained o1 specifically to work through a step-by-step problem-solving process before generating an answer. When users ask an "o1" model a question in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, users have the option of seeing this chain-of-thought process written out in the ChatGPT interface. However, by design, OpenAI hides the raw chain of thought from users, instead presenting a filtered interpretation created by a second AI model.</p>
<p>Nothing is more enticing to enthusiasts than information obscured, so the race has been on among hackers and red-teamers to try to uncover o1's raw chain of thought using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/sob-story-about-dead-grandma-tricks-microsoft-ai-into-solving-captcha/">jailbreaking</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/twitter-pranksters-derail-gpt-3-bot-with-newly-discovered-prompt-injection-hack/">prompt injection</a> techniques that attempt to trick the model into spilling its secrets. There have been early reports of some successes, but nothing has yet been strongly confirmed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049959#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049959&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>An ancient board game known as <em>Hounds and Jackals</em> has long been believed to have originated in Egypt. However, according to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-archaeology/article/herding-with-the-hounds-the-game-of-fiftyeight-holes-in-the-abseron-peninsula/3D308A06C1EED64BF5BB185B9DCCFBA1">a paper</a> published in the European Journal of Archaeology, a version of the game board found in present-day Azerbaijan might date back even earlier, suggesting that the game originated in Asia.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/archaeologists-discovered-a-4000-year-old-board-game-at-a-dig-in-oman/">previously reported</a>, there is archaeological evidence for various kinds of <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/best-board-games-ancient-world-180974094/" data-uri="25d3ccdcfdc9814858bdc615020464eb">board games from all over the world</a> dating back millennia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senet" data-uri="ac357d4f07f12a0683f0712c046285e9">Senet</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehen_(game)" data-uri="c13883dd8963d560867421355d332c64">Mehen</a> in ancient Egypt, for example, or a strategy game called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludus_latrunculorum" data-uri="b910570c895f5c8783b113bd1e12dc92">ludus latrunculorum</a></em> ("game of mercenaries") favored by Roman legions. A 4,000-year-old board discovered last year at an archaeological site in Oman's Qumayrah Valley might be a precursor to an ancient Middle Eastern game known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur" data-uri="1e71b13ff94e04052cb76bf5cb418628"><em>Royal Game of Ur</em></a> (or the <em>Game of Twenty Squares</em>), a two-player game that may have been one of the precursors to backgammon (or was replaced in popularity by backgammon). Like backgammon, it's essentially a race game in which players compete to see who can move all their pieces along the board before their opponent.</p>
<p>Last year, archaeologists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/archaeologists-find-500-year-old-board-game-carved-in-ruins-of-polish-castle/">discovered</a> a 500-year-old game board in the ruins of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86miel%C3%B3w_Castle">Ćmielów Castle</a> in Poland. It was a two-person strategy board game called <em>Mill</em>, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris"><em>Nine Men's Morris</em></a>, <em>Merels</em>, or "cowboy checkers" in North America. The earliest-known <em>Mill</em> game board was found carved into the roofing slabs of an Egyptian temple at Kurna, which likely predates the Common Era. Historians believe it was well-known to the Romans, who may have learned of the game through trade routes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048621#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048621&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A supply chain failure that compromises Secure Boot protections on computing devices from across the device-making industry extends to a much larger number of models than previously known, including those used in ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, and voting machines.</p>
<p>The debacle was the result of non-production test platform keys used in hundreds of device models for more than a decade. These cryptographic keys form the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The test production keys—stamped with phrases such as “DO NOT TRUST” in the certificates—were never intended to be used in production systems. A who's-who list of device makers—including Acer, Dell, Gigabyte, Intel, Supermicro, Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo—used them anyway.</p>
<h2>Medical devices, gaming consoles, ATMs, POS terminals</h2>
<p>Platform keys provide the root-of-trust anchor in the form of a cryptographic key embedded into the system firmware. They establish the trust between the platform hardware and the firmware that runs on it. This, in turn, provides the foundation for Secure Boot, an industry standard for cryptographically enforcing security in the pre-boot environment of a device. Built into the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), Secure Boot uses public-key cryptography to block the loading of any code that isn’t signed with a pre-approved digital signature.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050182#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050182&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Boar's Head deli-meat plant at the epicenter of a nationwide <em>Listeria </em>outbreak that killed nine people so far harbored the deadly germ in a common area of the facility deemed "low risk" for <em>Listeria.</em> Further, it had no written plans to prevent cross-contamination of the dangerous bacteria to other products and areas. That's according to a<a href="https://boarshead.com/pdf/Boars-Head-NOS-July-2024_view.pdf"> federal document newly released by Boar's Head</a>.</p>
<p>On Friday, the company announced that it is <a href="https://boarshead.com/products-recall-2024">indefinitely closing that Jarratt, Virginia-based plant</a> and will never again produce liverwurst—the product that Maryland health investigators first identified as the source of the outbreak strain of <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>. The finding led to the recall of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/">more than 7 million pounds of Boar's Head meat</a>. The Jarratt plant, where the company's liverwurst is made, has been shuttered since late July amid the investigation into how the outbreak occurred.</p>

<p>The fight to keep TikTok operating unchanged in the US reached an appeals court Monday, where TikTok and US-based creators teamed up to defend one of the world's most popular apps from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-if-chinese-owner-bytedance-doesnt-sell/">a potential US ban</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok lawyer Andrew Pincus kicked things off by warning a three-judge panel that a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521">law</a> targeting foreign adversaries that requires TikTok to divest from its allegedly China-controlled owner, ByteDance, is "unprecedented" and could have "staggering" effects on "the speech of 170 million Americans."</p>
<p>Pincus argued that the US government was "for the first time in history" attempting to ban speech by a specific US speaker—namely, TikTok US, the US-based entity that allegedly curates the content that Americans see on the app.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050155#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050155&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/apples-iphone-16-pro-boasts-bigger-screens-and-a-better-camera-zoom/">Apple's newest iPhones</a> and Apple Watches don't come out until later this week, but the rumor mill is already indicating that Apple is planning a product announcement for October to refresh some of the products that didn't get a mention at the iPhone event. Apple scheduled its release calendar similarly last year, when it announced and released new iPhones in September and then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/scary-fast-apple-will-stream-a-new-product-event-on-october-30/">launched the first wave of M3 Macs around Halloween</a>.</p>

<p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-15/apple-s-hearing-aid-sleep-apnea-saved-iphone-16-event-m4-mac-launch-details-m13kkabb">believes</a> that the event will mainly focus on the first wave of Macs with M4 processors, following the standard M4's introduction in the iPad Pro earlier this year. As he has reported previously, he expects new MacBook Pro models with the M4 and "pro-level M4 chip options," presumably the M4 Pro and M4 Max. He also expects an M4 version of the 24-inch iMac.</p>
<p>But the most interesting of the new Macs will still be the redesigned Mac mini, which hasn't gotten an M3 update at all and has been using the same basic external design since 2010. This Mac mini is said to be closer in size to the Apple TV than the current mini, but still uses an internal power supply so that owners won't have to wrangle a power brick. At least some of the current device's ports will be replaced by USB-C and/or Thunderbolt ports, something that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports-leak/">MacRumors apparently confirmed earlier today</a> when they found a reference to an "Apple silicon Mac mini (5 ports)" in an Apple software update (some of those ports are reportedly on the front of the device, a nice Mac Studio design upgrade that I'd like to see on a new Mac mini).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050106#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050106&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brazil seized about $2 million from a Starlink bank account and another $1.3 million from X to collect on fines issued to Elon Musk's social network, the country's Supreme Court <a href="https://noticias.stf.jus.br/postsnoticias/stf-determina-transferencia-de-r-1835-milhoes-bloqueados-da-x-e-da-starlink-para-conta-da-uniao/">announced Friday</a>.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes previously froze the accounts of both companies, treating them as the same <em>de facto</em> economic group because both are controlled by Musk. The Starlink and X bank accounts were unfrozen last week after the money transfers ordered by de Moraes.</p>
<p>Two banks carried out orders to transfer the money from Starlink and X to Brazil's government. "After the payment of the full amount that was owed, the justice (de Moraes) considered there was no need to keep the bank accounts frozen and ordered the immediate unfreezing of bank accounts/financial assets," the court said, as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/starling-supreme-court-brazil-afb5262691e02736deda08b8db752718">quoted by The Associated Press</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050108#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050108&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The future of inter-OS mobile messaging is here, it's just unevenly distributed.</p>
<p>With iOS 18, Apple has made it possible for non-Apple phones to message with iPhones through Rich Communication Services (RCS). This grants upgrades from standard SMS text messages, like read receipts, easier and higher-quality media sending, typing indicators, and emoji/response compatibility. More than that, it allows for messaging while on Wi-Fi without cellular services and makes group messages far less painful to navigate and leave. Notably, RCS messages between iPhones and non-iPhones will not be encrypted, like Apple's private iMessage service available exclusively between Apple devices.</p>
<p>iOS 18 makes these RCS upgrades possible, but certainly not guaranteed, at least as of today. Lots of people have already been enjoying cross-platform RCS messaging when texting with iOS 18 beta users. And iPhones on the big carriers' plans can now trade RCS with Android users. But some iPhone users, particularly on mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)—typically pre-paid services that do not own network hardware but resell major carrier access—do not have an RCS option available to them yet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049951#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049951&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Arguably, some of Lexus' greatest innovations have been in its product strategy as much as any technology to emerge from its R&amp;D labs. When it launched in 1989, it was with the idea that a car could combine Japanese reliability with the luxury and power expected from a big German sedan. A few years later the RX basically invented the crossover category with SUV-like looks but with fewer of the handling compromises.</p>
<p>I'll be frank—I haven't always jelled with those crossovers. During the last couple of years we tested both the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/not-sporty-enough-not-efficient-enough-the-2023-lexus-rx-500h-f-sport/">RX 500h F Sport</a>, which I didn't find that sporty or particularly efficient, and the battery-electric <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/lexus-2023-rz-450e-disappoints-offering-poor-ev-range-and-a-bumpy-ride/">RZ 450e</a>, which left me very cold. Third time is evidently the charm, because I got on much better with the topic of today's review, the RX 450h+ Luxury, to give it its full name.</p>
<p>This is Lexus' plug-in hybrid version—the 500h carries a much smaller battery that only recharges as the car drives. In fact, it's the same plug-in hybrid powertrain as that found in the smaller, cheaper NX crossover, combining a 2.5 L four-cylinder gasoline engine and a pair of electric motors fed by an 18.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. Total power output is 304 hp (227 kW), but Lexus has declined to publish a combined torque figure or any outputs for the electric motors.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050059#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050059&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

If you've spent any time with retro gaming emulators, you're likely familiar with the joy of browsing through a long list of (legally obtained) ROMs and feeling overwhelmed at a wide range of titles you've never even heard of. Picking randomly through such a game list is like wandering through a foreign country, searching for hidden jewels among all the shovelware in the bewildering and wildly imaginative early video game history.
<p><em>UFO 50</em> captures that feeling perfectly, combining the freewheeling inventiveness of old-school game design with modern refinements and more consistent baseline quality bred over the ensuing decades. The result is an extremely playable love letter to the gaming history that will charm even the most jaded retro game fan.</p>
<h2>A loving homage</h2>
<p><em>UFO 50</em> presents itself as a collection of 50 dusty game cartridges made by UFO Soft, a fictional developer that operated from 1982 to 1989. Working through the company's catalog, you'll see evolution in graphics, music, and gameplay design that mirror the ever-changing gaming market of the real-world '80s. You'll also see the same characters, motifs, and credited "developers" appearing over and over again, building a convincing world behind the games themselves.</p>
<p>The individual games in <em>UFO 50</em> definitely wear their influences on their sleeves, with countless, almost overt homages to specific '80s arcade and console games. But there isn't a single title here that I'd consider a simple clone or knock-off of an old gaming concept; each sub-game brings its own twist or novel idea that makes it feel new.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049997#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049997&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today is the official release date for the public versions of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15 Sequoia, and a scad of other Apple software updates, the foundation that Apple will use for Apple Intelligence and whatever other features it wants to add between now and next year's Worldwide Developers Conference in June. But for those who value stability and reliability over new features, you may not be excited to update to a new operating system with a version number ending in "0."</p>
<p>For those of you who prefer to wait for a couple of bugfix updates before installing new stuff, Apple is also releasing security-only updates for a bunch of its (now) last-generation operating systems today. The iOS 17.7, iPadOS 17.7, and macOS 14.7 updates are either available now or should be shortly, along with a security update for 2022's macOS 13 Ventura. An updated version of Safari 18 that runs on both macOS 13 and 14 should be available soon, though as of this writing is doesn't appear to be available yet.</p>
<p>Apple has historically been pretty good about providing security updates to older macOS releases—you can expect them for about two years after the operating system is replaced by a newer version.

<p>The macOS 15 Sequoia update will inevitably be known as "the AI one" in retrospect, introducing, as it does, the first wave of "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/">Apple Intelligence</a>" features.</p>
<p>That's funny because none of that stuff is actually ready for the 15.0 release that's coming out today. A lot of it is coming "later this fall" in the 15.1 update, which Apple has been testing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/you-can-now-try-apple-intelligence-in-the-ios-macos-developer-beta/">entirely separately</a> from the 15.0 betas for weeks now. Some of it won't be ready until after <em>that</em>—rumors say image generation won't be ready until the end of the year—but in any case, none of it is ready for public consumption yet.</p>

<p>But the AI-free 15.0 release does give us a chance to evaluate all of the non-AI additions to macOS this year. Apple Intelligence is sucking up a lot of the media oxygen, but in most other ways, this is a typical 2020s-era macOS release, with one or two headliners, several quality-of-life tweaks, and some sparsely documented under-the-hood stuff that will subtly change how you experience the operating system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048298#p3">Read 214 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048298&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One key challenge in medical imaging is to look past skin and other tissue that are opaque to see internal organs and structures. This is the reason we need things like ultrasonography, magnetic resonance, or X-rays. There are chemical clearing agents that can make tissue transparent, like acrylamide or tetrahydrofuran, but they are almost never used in living organisms because they’re either highly toxic or can dissolve away essential biomolecules.</p>
<p>But now, a team of Stanford University scientists has finally found an agent that can reversibly make skin transparent without damaging it. This agent was tartrazine, a popular yellow-orange food dye called FD&amp;C Yellow 5 that is notably used for coloring Doritos.</p>
<h2>Playing with light</h2>
<p>We can’t see through the skin because it is a complex tissue comprising aqueous-based components such as cell interiors and other fluids, as well as protein and lipids. The refractive index is a value that indicates how much light slows down (on average, of course) while going through a material compared to going through a vacuum. The refractive index of those aqueous components is low, while the refractive index of the proteins and lipids is high. As a result, light traveling through skin constantly bends as it endlessly crosses the boundary between high and low refractive index materials.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049741#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049741&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>DirecTV and Disney agreed to a new distribution contract on Saturday, ending a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/tv-viewers-get-screwed-again-as-disney-channels-are-blacked-out-on-directv/">two-week blackout</a> during which DirecTV subscribers lost access to ABC, ESPN, and other Disney-owned channels. A <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/directv-disney-reach-agreement-in-principle/">joint announcement</a> said the companies reached an agreement in principle and that "Disney's full linear suite of networks has been restored to DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and U-verse customers while both parties work to finalize a new, multi-year contract."</p>
<p>While Disney previously accused DirecTV of "undervaluing" its content, DirecTV said during the blackout that it was seeking flexibility to sell slimmed-down channel packages that don't force customers to buy channels they don't want. The joint announcement of the resolution said the new deal "provides greater choice, value, and flexibility to [the companies'] mutual customers."</p>
<p>The deal includes ABC and ESPN networks, Disney-branded channels, Freeform, FX networks, and National Geographic channels. DirecTV will be able to "offer multiple genre-specific options—sports, entertainment, kids &amp; family—inclusive of Disney's linear networks along with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+," the companies said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049969#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049969&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison <a href="https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/?bcid=6361899206112">shared his vision</a> for an AI-powered surveillance future during a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/">company financial meeting</a>, reports <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-ellison-ai-surveillance-keep-citizens-on-their-best-behavior-2024-9">Business Insider</a>. During an investor Q&amp;A, Ellison described a world where artificial intelligence systems would constantly monitor citizens through an extensive network of cameras and drones, stating this would ensure both police and citizens don't break the law.</p>

<p>Ellison, who <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/money-report/oracles-larry-ellison-briefly-tops-jeff-bezos-to-become-worlds-second-richest-person/3645168/">briefly became</a> the world's second-wealthiest person last week when his net worth surpassed Jeff Bezos' for a short time, outlined a scenario where AI models would analyze footage from security cameras, police body cams, doorbell cameras, and vehicle dash cams.</p>
<p>"Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on," Ellison <a href="https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1835140086549324017">said</a>, describing what he sees as the benefits from automated oversight from AI and automated alerts for when crime takes place. "We're going to have supervision," he continued. "Every police officer is going to be supervised at all times, and if there's a problem, AI will report the problem and report it to the appropriate person."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049906#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049906&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A white spacecraft, lightly toasted like a marshmallow and smelling of singed metal, fell out of the night sky early on Sunday morning and splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico not all that far from Key West.</p>
<p>The darkened waters there were carefully chosen from among dozens of potential landing spots near Florida. This is because the wind and seas were predicted to be especially calm and serene as the Crew Dragon spacecraft named <em>Resilience</em> floated down to the sea and bobbed gently, awaiting the arrival of a recovery ship.</p>
<p>Inside waited a crew of four—Commander Jared Isaacman, a billionaire who funded the mission and had just completed his second private spaceflight; SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, who were the company's first employees to fly into orbit; and Pilot Kidd Poteet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049841#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049841&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earthquake scientists detected an unusual signal on monitoring stations used to detect seismic activity during September 2023. We saw it on sensors everywhere, from the Arctic to Antarctica.</p>
<p>We were baffled—the signal was unlike any previously recorded. Instead of the frequency-rich rumble typical of earthquakes, this was a monotonous hum, containing only a single vibration frequency. Even more puzzling was that the signal kept going for nine days.</p>
<p>Initially classified as a “USO”—an unidentified seismic object—the source of the signal was eventually traced back to a massive landslide in Greenland’s remote Dickson Fjord. A staggering volume of rock and ice, enough to fill 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, plunged into the fjord, triggering a 200-meter-high mega-tsunami and a phenomenon known as a seiche: a wave in the icy fjord that continued to slosh back and forth, some 10,000 times over nine days.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049682#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049682&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For many creatures, having a limb caught in a predator’s mouth is usually a death sentence. Not starfish, though—they can detach the limb and leave the predator something to chew on while they crawl away. But how can they pull this off?</p>
<p>Starfish and some other animals (including lizards and salamanders) are capable of autonomy (shedding a limb when attacked). The biology behind this phenomenon in starfish was largely unknown until now. An international team of researchers led by Maurice Elphick, professor of Animal Physiology and Neuroscience at Queen Mary University of London, have found that a neurohormone released by starfish is largely responsible for detaching limbs that end up in a predator’s jaws.</p>
<p>So how does this neurohormone (specifically a neuropeptide) let the starfish get away? When a starfish is under stress from a predatory attack, this hormone is secreted, stimulating a muscle at the base of the animal’s arm that allows the arm to break off.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049715#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049715&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
