<p>The European Space Agency has awarded initial contracts to a German-based startup and one of the continent's established aerospace companies to develop spacecraft to ferry cargo to and from space stations in low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>ESA announced the two 25 million euro ($27 million) contracts May 22. The Exploration Company, co-located in France and Germany, and Thales Alenia Space of Italy beat out four other companies in the competition for ESA funding through the LEO Cargo Return Service program.</p>
<p>These contracts will run for two years, until June 2026. In this first phase of the program, The Exploration Company and Thales Alenia Space will refine their concepts, mature technologies, and focus on requirements for their cargo vehicles. ESA plans to award contracts for the second phase of the LEO Cargo Return Service program in 2026, eyeing a round-trip demonstration flight to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2028.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027315#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027315&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yesterday, Amazon failed to convince a US district court to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit targeting the tech giant's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-sues-amazon-over-4-page-6-click-15-option-prime-cancellation-process/">alleged history of tricking people into signing up for Prime</a>.</p>
<p>The FTC has alleged that Amazon "tricked, coerced, and manipulated consumers into subscribing to Amazon Prime," a court order said, failing to get informed consent by designing a murky sign-up process. And to keep subscriptions high, Amazon also "did not provide simple mechanisms for these subscribers to cancel their Prime memberships," the FTC alleged. Instead, Amazon forced "consumers intending to cancel to navigate a four-page, six-click, fifteen-option cancellation process."</p>
<p>In their motion to dismiss, Amazon outright disputed these characterizations of its business, insisting its enrollment process was clear, its cancellation process was simple, and none of its executives could be held responsible for failing to fix these processes when "accidental" sign-ups became widespread. Amazon defended its current practices, arguing that some of its Prime disclosures "align with practices that the FTC encourages in its guidance documents."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027607#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027607&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After nearly 28 years in operation, messaging service ICQ will cease operations on June 26, <a href="https://icq.com/desktop/en?#mac">according to its current owners</a>.</p>
<p>You'd be forgiven for not realizing it still existed; the proto-IM service hasn't been in the mainstream since the 2000s. But in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it simultaneously laid the groundwork for direct messaging and social networking as we came to know it in the post-Facebook era.</p>
<h3>28 years of history</h3>
<p>ICQ was something of an accident, as popular as it became. Created by four Israeli computer geeks, it wasn't even meant to be the original idea.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027215#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027215&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When used to generate power or move vehicles, fossil fuels kill people. Particulates and ozone resulting from fossil fuel burning cause direct health impacts, while climate change will act indirectly. Regardless of the immediacy, premature deaths and illness prior to death are felt through lost productivity and the cost of treatments.</p>
<p>Typically, you see the financial impacts quantified when the EPA issues new regulations, as the health benefits of limiting pollution typically dwarf the costs of meeting new standards. But some researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab have now done similar calculations—but focusing on the impact of renewable energy. Wind and solar, by displacing fossil fuel use, are acting as a form of pollution control and so should produce similar economic benefits.</p>
<p>Do they ever. The researchers find that, in the US, wind and solar have health and climate benefits of over $100 for every Megawatt-hour produced, for a total of a quarter-trillion dollars in just the last four years. This dwarfs the cost of the electricity they generate and the total of the subsidies they received.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027584#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027584&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>I traded in my <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/apple-watch-series-5-hands-on-software-is-king/">Series 5 Apple Watch</a> last week to Apple after the battery couldn't make it through most evenings. There wasn't much resale incentive on the open market, because the screen was far from pristine and the battery was nearly 5 years old. You can <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Apple+Watch+Series+5+Battery+Replacement/136871">replace the battery yourself</a>, but, already having a lot of fix projects on the shelf, I opted to send it off, take a gift card, and move on.</p>
<p>If I get a chance, though, I'm going to ask Apple for that watch back. Apple can keep its estimated $90. I am cautiously but earnestly optimistic that the <a href="https://thetinypod.com/">tinyPod</a> can give me more value than a gift card number I plow into some future iPhone upgrade. In fact, the tinyPod, according to its creator, should go on sale for around that $90 mark after a more detailed reveal in June.</p>

<h2>No electronics, just a lefty-oriented Apple Watch case</h2>
<p>The tinyPod is essentially an iPod-like case, complete with circular-scrolling clickwheel, into which a strapless Apple Watch can be snapped in. Once inside the case, the scroll wheel function is "entirely analog and physically rotates the watch crown," according to tinyPod founder <a href="https://x.com/sentry">Newar</a>, better known as "Sentry" on X (formerly Twitter) and in jailbreaking circles. The crown-moving mechanism and general case enhancements to the Watch are patent-pending, Newar wrote by email. More on the scroll wheel will be shown next month, he wrote, at a "proper launch."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027388#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027388&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The launch of a new electric vehicle these days is invariably met with a chorus of "this car is too expensive"—and rightfully so. But for used EVs, it's quite another story, particularly used Teslas, thanks to a glut of <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-loses-another-fleet-customer-due-to-price-cuts-sap/">former fleet</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/hertz-is-selling-20000-used-evs-due-to-high-repair-costs/">rental cars</a> that are now ready for their second owner.</p>
<p>"Due to a variety of reasons, Tesla resale values have plummeted, making many Tesla models very affordable now. Plus, for some consumers, an additional $4,000 Federal tax credit on used EVs may apply, sweetening the deal even further. Buying a used Tesla can be a great deal for the savvy shopper, but there are significant things to look out for," says Ed Kim, president and chief analyst at AutoPacific.</p>
<p>Indeed, a quick search on the topic easily reveals <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/who-wants-to-buy-30-000-used-teslas-from-hertz.html">some horror stories of ex-rental Teslas</a>, so here are some things to consider if you're in search of a cheap Model 3 or Model Y.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027552#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027552&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Four backyard alpacas in southern Idaho have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, marking the first time bird flu has been detected in members of the fleecy camelid family, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals/highly-pathogenic-avian">according to the US Department of Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the USDA announced that the agency's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the infection on a farm in Jerome County on May 16. While the infections are a first for the spitting llama relatives, the USDA said they weren't particularly surprising. The alpacas were in close contact with HPAI-infected poultry on the farm, which were "depopulated" this month. Of 18 alpacas on the affected farm, only four were found to be infected.

            Whether you want to call it "Google Business Messaging" or "Google Business Profile Chat," the chat buttons in Google Maps and Search are going away.                          [credit:

<p>Google is killing off a messaging service! This one is the odd "Google Business Messaging" service—basically an instant messaging client that is built into Google Maps. If you looked up a participating business in Google Maps or Google Search on a phone, the main row of buttons in the place card would read something like "Call," "Chat," "Directions," and "Website." That "Chat" button is the service we're talking about. It would launch a full messaging interface inside the Google Maps app, and businesses were expected to use it for customer service purposes. Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/">deeply dysfunctional</a> messaging strategy might lead people to joke about a theoretical "Google Maps Messaging" service, but it already exists and has existed for years, and now it's being shut down.</p>

On July 15, 2024, the ability to start a new chat will be disabled, and on July 31, 2024, both services will be shut down.

<p>Google's Maps messaging service was Google Messaging Service No. 16 in our giant <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/7/#h3">History of Google Messaging</a> article.

The Google Maps Messaging button launched in <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/message-google-my-business-24140.html">2017</a>, when it would have been called "Google My Business Chat." This wasn't quite its own service yet—the messaging button would either launch your SMS app or boot into another dead Google messaging product, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/6/#h2">Google Allo</a>!</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027430#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027430&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google needs to pump the brakes when it comes to tracking sensitive information shared with DMV sites, a new <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wilson-v-Google-Complaint-5-24-2024.pdf">lawsuit</a> suggests.</p>
<p>Filing a proposed class-action suit in California, Katherine Wilson has accused Google of using Google Analytics and DoubleClick trackers on the California DMV site to unlawfully obtain information about her personal disability without her consent.</p>
<p>This, Wilson argued, violated the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), as well as the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and impacted perhaps millions of drivers who had no way of knowing Google was collecting sensitive information shared only for DMV purposes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027492#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027492&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>8BitDo is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/8bitdo-appeals-to-the-salarymen-with-the-ibm-edition-of-its-keyboard/">releasing</a> an IBM-inspired look for its $100 wireless mechanical keyboard. Keyboard enthusiasts love regaling normies with tales of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-keyboards-mechanical-membrane-and-buckling-springs/6/#h1">IBM’s buckling spring keyboards</a> and the precedent they set for today's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-mechanical-keyboards/">mechanical keyboards</a>. But 8BitDo's Retro Mechanical Keyboard M Edition doesn't adopt very much from IBM's iconic designs.</p>
<p>8BitDo’s Retro mechanical keyboards come in different looks that each pay tribute to classic tech. The tributes are subtle enough to avoid copyright issues. Similar to 8BitDo's ‘80s Nintendo Entertainment System (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/nes-nostalgia-at-your-fingertips-100-mechanical-keyboard-honors-80s-console/">NES</a>) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/8bitdos-100-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-is-a-tribute-to-commodore-64/">Commodore 64</a> designs, the M Edition doesn’t have any official IBM logos. However, the M Edition's color scheme, chunkier build, and typeface selection, including on the Tab key with arrows and elsewhere, are nods to IBM’s Model M, which first succeeded the Model F in 1985.</p>
<p>Of course, the keyboard’s naming, and the IBM behemoth and floppy disks strategically placed in marketing images, are notes of that, too:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027463#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027463&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX began launching operational Starlink satellites five years ago this month. Since then, the company has been rapidly developing its constellation of broadband satellites in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX has now launched about 6,000 satellites with its Falcon 9 rocket and has delivered on its promise to provide fast Internet around the world. Today, the company is the largest satellite operator in the world by a factor of 10.</p>
<p>But is this massive enterprise to deliver Internet from space profitable?</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/just-5-years-after-its-first-launch-the-starlink-constellation-is-profitable/">new report by Quilty Space</a>, the answer is <em>yes</em>. Quilty built a model to assess Starlink's profitability. First, the researchers assessed revenue. The firm estimates this will grow to $6.6 billion in 2024, up from essentially zero just four years ago. In addition to rapidly growing its subscriber base of about 3 million, SpaceX has also managed to control costs. Based upon its model, therefore, Quilty estimates that Starlink's free cash flow from the business will be about $600 million this year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027115#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027115&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Sony has taken down an interview with Naughty Dog Studio Head Neil Druckmann (<em>Uncharted</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>) that the company now says contains "several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values." The surprising move comes after Druckmann took the extreme measure of publicly questioning a portion of the PR interview by <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837">posting a lengthy transcript</a> that conflicted with the heavily edited version Sony posted online.</p>
<p>The odd media saga began last Thursday, when Sony published the interview (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240525155202/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">archive here</a>) under the heading "The Evolution of Storytelling Across Mediums." The piece was part of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/">the Creative Entertainment Vision section</a> of Sony's corporate site, a PR-driven concept exploring how Sony will "seamlessly connect multi-layered worlds where physical and virtual realities overlap to deliver limitless Kanto—through creativity and technology—working with creators." Whatever that means.</p>
<p>Druckmann's short interview started <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423">attracting</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann-says-ai-will-revolutionize-how-content-is-being-created">attention</a> almost immediately, primarily due to Druckmann's apparent promotion of using AI tools in game development. Such tools "will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities," Druckmann is quoted as saying. "AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027457#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027457&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Earlier this month, Cadillac showed off the all-new, all-electric 2025 Optiq to select media in downtown Los Angeles. The Optiq will slot in below the larger <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/">Lyriq</a>, Celestiq, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/cadillac-reveals-the-2025-escalade-iq-one-excessive-ev/">Escalade IQ</a> SUVs but is still based on GM's steadily proliferating Ultium electric vehicle architecture.</p>
<p>Having driven no fewer than five different Ultium-based vehicles in the past year, I visited the Optiq preview, hoping to learn how Cadillac can differentiate this compact crossover from other offerings in an increasingly competitive segment. I also wanted to see whether GM has effectively made the case for EV converts who are looking at entry-level options versus a lower price point for the similarly specced Chevrolet Equinox EV.</p>
<p>In person, the Optiq's exterior styling continues the language established by Lyriq and Celestiq, if toned down to a slightly less-aggressive futuristic level. Straked patterns on the angular, faded quarter panels make for a nice touch, though the details looked two-dimensional, as if they were stickers, until I got up close enough to inspect the use of real glass layering.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027188#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027188&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a recent interview on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4r127XapFv7JZr0OPzRDaI">"The Ted AI Show" podcast</a>, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner said the OpenAI board was unaware of the existence of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">ChatGPT</a> until they saw it on Twitter. She also revealed details about the company's internal dynamics and the events surrounding CEO Sam Altman's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/11/openai-fires-ceo-sam-altman-citing-less-than-candid-communications/">surprise firing</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/sam-altman-officially-back-as-openai-ceo-we-didnt-lose-a-single-employee/">subsequent rehiring</a> last November.</p>

<p>OpenAI released ChatGPT publicly on November 30, 2022, and its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/">massive surprise popularity</a> set OpenAI on a new trajectory, shifting focus from being an AI research lab to a more consumer-facing tech company.</p>
<p>"When ChatGPT came out in November 2022, the board was not informed in advance about that. We learned about ChatGPT on Twitter," Toner said on the podcast.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027357#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027357&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two years ago when “Michael,” an owner of cryptocurrency, contacted Joe Grand to help recover access to about $2 million worth of bitcoin he stored in encrypted format on his computer, Grand turned him down.</p>
<p>Michael, who is based in Europe and asked to remain anonymous, stored the cryptocurrency in a password-protected digital wallet. He generated a password using the RoboForm password manager and stored that password in a file encrypted with a tool called TrueCrypt. At some point, that file got corrupted, and Michael lost access to the 20-character password he had generated to secure his 43.6 BTC (worth a total of about 4,000 euros, or $5,300, in 2013). Michael used the RoboForm password manager to generate the password but did not store it in his manager. He worried that someone would hack his computer and obtain the password.</p>
<p>“At [that] time, I was really paranoid with my security,” he laughs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027419#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027419&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The families of multiple victims of the 2022 mass shooting at Uvalde's Robb Elementary School are suing Activision in a California civil court, alleging that the company's <em>Call of Duty</em> games act as a "training camp for mass shooters."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/736998045/Activision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon">The lawsuit</a> (as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit">obtained by Polygon</a>) compares Activision's <em>Call of Duty</em> marketing to the cigarette industry's use of <a href="https://tobacco.stanford.edu/cigarettes/cartoons/joe-camel-cartoons/">now-barred spokescartoon Joe Camel</a>, putting the gaming company "in the wildly lucrative business of training adolescents to become gunmen." The <em>Call of Duty</em> games "are chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters," the lawsuit alleges, and in Uvalde, the games "knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him how to use it."</p>
<p>Meta platforms is also a party to the lawsuit for "explicit, aggressive marketing" of firearms to minors via Instagram.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027266#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027266&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>JAXA, the Japanese space agency, <a href="https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/topics/003749.html">confirmed Wednesday</a> that it has lost communication with its Akatsuki spacecraft in orbit around Venus.</p>
<p>In its update, the space agency said it failed to establish communications in late April after the spacecraft had difficulty maintaining its attitude. This likely means there is some sort of thruster issue on the spacecraft that is preventing it from being able to orient itself back toward Earth.</p>
<p>"Since then, we have implemented various measures to restore service, but communication has not yet been restored," the agency stated. "We are currently working on restoring communication." JAXA added that it will announce further actions, if any, as soon as they've been decided upon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027316#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027316&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Good morning. It's May 29, and today's photo comes from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is, you guessed it, in orbit around Mars.</p>
<p>The image shows an area of sand dunes on Mars in the springtime, when carbon dioxide frost is sublimating into the air. <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA26330">According to NASA</a>, the pattern of dark spots is due to the fact that the sublimation process is not uniform.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027284#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027284&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been 300 years since Galileo and Isaac Newton started fiddling around with lenses and parabolic mirrors to get a better look at the heavens. But if you look at many of the best amateur telescopes today, you'd be forgiven for thinking they haven't progressed much since.</p>
<p>Though components have certainly improved, the basic combination of mirrors and lenses is more or less the same. Even the most advanced "smart" mounts that hold them rely on technology that hasn't progressed in 30 years.</p>
<p>Compared to the radical reinvention that even the humble telephone has received, it's sad that telescope tech has largely been left behind. But that is finally changing. Companies like Unistellar and Vaonis are pioneering a new generation of scopes that throw classic astronomy norms and concepts out the window in favor of a seamless setup and remarkable image quality.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026083#p3">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026083&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Treasury Department has sanctioned three Chinese nationals for their involvement in a VPN-powered botnet with more than 19 million residential IP addresses they rented out to cybercriminals to obfuscate their illegal activities, including COVID-19 aid scams and bomb threats.</p>
<p>The criminal enterprise, the Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2375">said Tuesday</a>, was a residential proxy service known as 911 S5. Such services provide a bank of IP addresses belonging to everyday home users for customers to route Internet connections through. When accessing a website or other Internet service, the connection appears to originate with the home user.</p>
<p>In 2022, researchers at the University of Sherbrooke <a href="https://gric.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/rpaas/">profiled</a> 911[.]re, a service that appears to be an earlier version of 911 S5. At the time, its infrastructure comprised 120,000 residential IP addresses. This pool was created using one of two free VPNs—MaskVPN and DewVPN—marketed to end users. Besides acting as a legitimate VPN, the software also operated as a botnet that covertly turned users’ devices into a proxy server. The complex structure was designed with the intent of making the botnet hard to reverse engineer.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027288#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027288&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
