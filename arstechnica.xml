                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, Microsoft announced that it would no longer use China-based engineering teams to support the Defense Department’s cloud computing systems, following <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-digital-escorts-pentagon-defense-department-china-hackers">ProPublica’s investigation of the practice</a>, which cybersecurity experts said could expose the government to hacking and espionage.</p>
<p>But it turns out the Pentagon was not the only part of the government facing such a threat. For years, Microsoft has also used its global workforce, including China-based personnel, to maintain the cloud systems of other federal departments, including parts of Justice, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/foia/ig/spder/pgld-10-0724-0018-public.pdf">Treasury</a> and <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/opog/OSCSP_OS-071_PTA_FY21.pdf">Commerce</a>, ProPublica has found.</p>
<p>This work has taken place in what’s known as the Government Community Cloud, which is intended for information that is not classified but is nonetheless sensitive. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, the US government’s cloud accreditation organization, has approved GCC to handle “moderate” impact information “where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effect on an agency’s operations, assets, or individuals.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/microsoft-to-stop-using-china-based-teams-to-support-department-of-defense/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earth <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth#:~:text=About%2071%20percent%20of%20the,in%20you%20and%20your%20dog.">is about 71 percent water</a>. An overwhelming 97 percent of that water is found in the oceans, leaving us with only 3 percent in the form of freshwater—and much of that is frozen in the form of glaciers. That leaves just 0.3 percent of that freshwater on the surface in lakes, swamps, springs, and <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/earths-fresh-water/#:~:text=Only%20about%20three%20percent%20of,buried%20deep%20in%20the%20ground">our main sources</a> of drinking water, rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Despite our planet’s famously blue appearance from space, thirsty aliens would be disappointed. Drinkable water is actually pretty scarce.</p>
<p>As if that doesn’t already sound unsettling, what little water we have is also threatened by climate change, urbanization, pollution, and a global population that continues to expand. Over 2 billion people live in regions where their only source of drinking water is <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water#:~:text=Climate%20change%2C%20increasing%20water%20scarcity,climate%20change%20and%20population%20growth">contaminated</a>. Pathogenic microbes in the water can cause cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, polio, and typhoid, which could be fatal in areas without access to vaccines or medical treatment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/this-aerogel-and-some-sun-could-make-saltwater-drinkable/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hot on the heels of a major ransomware group being taken down through an international law enforcement operation comes a new development that highlights the whack-a-mole nature of such actions: A new group, likely comprised of some of the same members, has already taken its place.</p>
<p>The new group calls itself Chaos, in recognition of the .chaos name extension its ransomware stamps on files it has encrypted and the “readme.chaos[.]txt” name given to ransom notes sent to victims. Researchers at Cisco’s Talos Security Group <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/new-chaos-ransomware/">said Thursday</a> that since Chaos emerged in February, it has engaged in “big-game hunting”—meaning attacks designed to extract hefty payments—that have mainly targeted organizations in the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK, New Zealand, and India. Talos said it recently observed the group demanding a ransom of about $300,000.</p>
<h2>Walking in your footsteps</h2>
<p>In exchange for paying the demanded ransom, victims get a pinky swear that they’ll receive a decryptor and a detailed report of the vulnerabilities the group members found in the victim’s network and that the group will delete all the data in its possession. Victims who refuse to pay face the threat of never getting their data unlocked, having data publicly disclosed, and being subjected to distributed denial-of-service attacks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/after-blacksuit-is-taken-down-new-ransomware-group-chaos-emerges/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Christina Chapman, a 50-year-old Arizona woman, has just been sentenced to 102 months in prison for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/arizona-woman-accused-of-helping-north-koreans-get-remote-it-jobs-at-300-companies/">helping North Korean hackers steal US identities</a> in order to get "remote" IT jobs with more than 300 American companies, including Nike. The scheme funneled millions of dollars to the North Korean state.</p>
<p>Why did Chapman do it? In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.268378/gov.uscourts.dcd.268378.41.1.pdf">letter</a> sent this week to the judge, Chapman said that she was "looking for a job that was Monday through Friday that would allow me to be present for my mom" who was battling cancer. (Her mother died in 2023.) But "the area where we lived didn't provide for a lot of job opportunities that fit what I needed. I also thought that the job was allowing me to help others."</p>
<p>She offered her "deepest and sincerest apologies to any person who was harmed by my actions," thanked the FBI for busting her, and said that when she gets out of prison, she hopes to "pursue the books that I have been working on writing and starting my own underwear company."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/north-korean-hackers-ran-us-based-laptop-farm-from-arizona-womans-home/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In December 2010, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.1197258">a study</a> led by a NASA astrobiology fellow claimed to have found an alien-like microbe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Lake">a salty, alkaline lake in California</a>. This extraordinary bacterium could reportedly thrive using the toxic element arsenic in place of phosphorus—otherwise thought essential for life on Earth. It even incorporated arsenic, instead of phosphorus, into the backbone of its DNA, according to the study, which was published online by the prestigious journal Science.</p>
<p>If true, the claims were groundbreaking. And NASA's press team only hyped the potential significance. In press materials, the agency claimed the finding "<a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/get-your-biology-textbook-and-an-eraser/">begs a rewrite of biology textbooks</a>" and "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101130025600/http:/www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/nov/HQ_M10-167_Astrobiology.html">will impact the search for evidence of extraterrestrial life</a>." In a subsequent <a href="https://youtu.be/JVSJLUIQrA0?t=539">press conference</a>, the lead author, Felisa Wolfe-Simon, didn't hold back, either, saying, "We've cracked open the door to what's possible for life elsewhere in the universe and that's profound."</p>
<h2>Backlash</h2>
<p>But upon that very splashy debut, outside scientists quickly identified flaws and problems in the study. When the study finally appeared in the June 3, 2011, print issue of Science, it was accompanied by eight "technical comments" blasting the study claims.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/widely-panned-arsenic-life-paper-gets-retracted-15-years-after-brouhaha/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A firmware update has killed key functionality for Echelon smart home gym equipment that isn't connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>As explained in a Tuesday <a href="https://robertoviola.cloud/2025/07/22/how-i-built-qz-and-how-echelon-is-now-breaking-it/">blog post</a> by Roberto Viola, who develops the "QZ (qdomyos-zwift)" <a href="https://www.qzfitness.com/">app </a>that connects Echelon machines to third-party fitness platforms, like Peloton, Strava, and Apple HealthKit, the firmware update forces Echelon machines to connect to Echelon’s servers in order to work properly. A user online <a href="https://github.com/cagnulein/qdomyos-zwift/issues/3552#issuecomment-3092440733">reported</a> that as a result of updating his machine, it is no longer syncing with apps like QZ, and he is unable to view his machine's exercise metrics in the Echelon app without an Internet connection.</p>
<p>Affected Echelon machines reportedly only have full functionality, including the ability to share real-time metrics, if a user has the Echelon app active and if the machine is able to reach Echelon’s servers.

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad">reported</a> that OpenAI is preparing to launch GPT-5 as early as August, according to sources familiar with the company's plans. The report comes five months after CEO Sam Altman first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/sam-altman-lays-out-roadmap-for-openais-long-awaited-gpt-5-model/">laid out</a> a roadmap for the next-generation AI model that would unify the company's various AI capabilities. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1946569252296929727">revealed</a> in a post on X last week that the company plans to release GPT-5 "soon."</p>
<p>According to The Verge's Tom Warren, Microsoft engineers began preparing server capacity for GPT-5 as early as late May, but testing and development challenges pushed the timeline back. During an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYn8VKW6vXA">appearance</a> on Theo Von's podcast this week, Altman demonstrated the model's capabilities by having it answer a question he couldn't. "I put it in the model, this is GPT-5, and it answered it perfectly," Altman said, saying it gave him a "weird feeling" to see the AI model answer a question that he couldn't.</p>
<p>GPT-5 has been a highly anticipated release since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">launch of GPT-4</a> in March 2023. In fact, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/openais-gpt-5-may-launch-this-summer-upgrading-chatgpt-along-the-way/">first wrote</a> about rumors of GPT-5's launch in March 2024, but it appears that GPT-5 did not materialize last year because the company saved the "GPT-5" name for a future release.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/openais-most-capable-ai-model-gpt-5-may-be-coming-in-august/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>I maintain a to-do list of story ideas to write at Ars, and for about a year "monthly column on DOS games I love" has been near the top of the list. When we spoke with the team at GOG, it felt less like an obligation and more like a way to add another cool angle to what I was already planning to do.</p>
<p>I'm going to start with the PC game I played most in high school and the one that introduced me to the very idea of online play. That game is <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdescent"><em>Descent</em></a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can recall, <em>Descent</em> was the first shooter to be fully 3D with six degrees of freedom. It's not often in today's gaming world that you get something completely and totally new, but that's exactly what <em>Descent</em> was 30 years ago in 1995.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/remembering-descent-the-once-popular-fully-3d-6dof-shooter/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://casar.house.gov/media/press-releases/news-congressman-greg-casar-introduces-new-stop-ai-price-gouging-and-wage">press release</a>, Reps. Greg Casar (D-Texas) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) announced the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HQoQhvfVv8p0XmOdDIiWTnmd2YM_za07/view">Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act</a>. The law directly bans companies from using "surveillance-based" price or wage setting to increase their profit margins.</p>
<p>If passed, the law would allow anyone to sue companies found unfairly using AI, lawmakers explained in what's called a "<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xJ3K-8L23-00XRTrFS-zUlBHiCo8feD5/view">one-sheet</a>." That could mean charging customers higher prices—based on "how desperate a customer is for a product and the maximum amount a customer is willing to pay"—or paying employees lower wages—based on "their financial status, personal associations, and demographics."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/deltas-ai-spying-to-jack-up-prices-must-be-banned-lawmakers-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Despite concerns over the environmental impacts of AI models, it's surprisingly hard to find precise, reliable data on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and water use for many major large language models. French model-maker Mistral is seeking to fix that this week, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/our-contribution-to-a-global-environmental-standard-for-ai">releasing details</a> from what it calls a first-of-its-kind environmental audit "to quantify the environmental impacts of our LLMs."</p>
<p>The results, which are broadly in line with estimates from previous scholarly work, suggest the environmental harm of any single AI query is relatively small compared to many other common Internet tasks. But with billions of AI prompts taxing GPUs every year, even those small individual impacts can lead to significant environmental effects in aggregate.</p>
<h2>Is AI really destroying the planet?</h2>
<p>To generate a life-cycle analysis of its "Large 2" model after just under 18 months of existence, Mistral partnered with sustainability consultancy <a href="https://www.carbone4.com/en">Carbone 4</a> and the <a href="https://www.ademe.fr/en/frontpage/">French Agency for Ecological Transition</a>. Following the French government's <a href="https://frugalai.org/">Frugal AI guidelines</a> for measuring overall environmental impact, Mistral says its peer-reviewed study looked at three categories: greenhouse gas (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, water consumption, and materials consumption (i.e., "the depletion of non-renewable resources," mostly through wear and tear on AI server GPUs). Mistral's audit found that the vast majority of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and water consumption (85.5 percent and 91 percent, respectively) occurred during model training and inference, rather than from sources like data center construction and energy used by end-user equipment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/mistrals-new-environmental-audit-shows-how-much-ai-is-hurting-the-planet/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The sport of off-roading suffers from a fundamental discordance: The desire to get out into nature and the irreparable harm inherent in the process of off-roading. That harm comes not only from damage to the land itself, but from an environment polluted with both fumes and noise.</p>
<p>Off-roading in an EV isn't exactly a panacea, but it goes a long way toward at least solving those last two concerns. Over the years, I've been lucky enough to off-road in quite a few extremely capable EVs, but none more so than the new Stark Varg EX. This thing is an all-terrain monster, a diminutive 264 lb (120 kg) motorcycle with twice the torque of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/01/weight-saving-and-aero-optimization-feature-in-the-2025-porsche-911-gt3/">Porsche 911 GT3</a>, enough capability to cross nearly anything you care to run it over, and just enough civility to be street-legal.</p>

<p>The latest target, <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/toptal-s-github-organization-hijacked-10-malicious-packages-published">according to</a> security firm Socket, is JavaScript code available on repository npm. A total of 10 packages available from the npm page belonging to global talent agency Toptal contained malware and were downloaded by roughly 5,000 users before the supply-chain attack was detected. The packages have since been removed. This was the third supply-chain attack Socket has observed on npm in the past week.</p>
<h2>Poisoning the well</h2>
<p>The hackers behind the attack pulled it off by first compromising Toptal’s GitHub Organization and from there using that access to publish the malicious packages on npm.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/open-source-repositories-are-seeing-a-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Xuewu Liu, a Chinese inventor who has no medical training or credentials of any kind, is charging cancer patients $20,000 for access to an AI-driven but entirely unproven treatment that includes injecting a highly concentrated dose of chlorine dioxide, a toxic bleach solution, directly into cancerous tumors.</p>
<p>One patient tells WIRED her tumor has grown faster since the procedure and that she suspects it may have caused her cancer to spread—a claim Liu disputes—while experts allege his marketing of the treatment has likely put him on the wrong side of US regulations. Nonetheless, while Liu currently only offers the treatment informally in China and at a German clinic, he is now working with a Texas-based former pharmaceutical executive to bring his treatment to America. They believe that the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as US health secretary will help “open doors” to get the untested treatment—in which at least one clinic in California appears to have interest—approved in the US.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement is embracing alternative medicines and the idea of giving patients the freedom to try unproven treatments. While the health secretary did not respond to a request for comment about Liu’s treatment, he did mention chlorine dioxide when questioned about President Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed during his Senate confirmation hearing in February, and the Food and Drug Administration recently <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chlorine-dioxide-bleach-mms-autism-rfk-fda-warning/">removed a warning about the substance from its website</a>. The agency says the removal was part of a routine process of archiving old pages on its site, but it has had the effect of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chlorine-dioxide-bleach-mms-autism-rfk-fda-warning/">emboldening the bleacher community</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/inventor-claims-bleach-injections-will-destroy-cancer-tumors/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>But the agency's approval drew fiery <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/gomez-paramount-transaction">dissent</a> from the only Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, after requiring written commitments from Skydance that allow the government to influence editorial decisions at CBS. Gomez accused the FCC of "imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law."</p>
<p>Under the agreement, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr explained that Skydance has given assurances that all of the new company’s programming will embody "a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum." Carr claimed that the requirements were necessary to restore Americans' trust in mainstream media, backing conservatives' claims that media is biased against Trump and appointing an ombudsman for two years to ensure that CBS's reporting "will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based." Any complaints of bias that the ombudsman receives will be reviewed by the president of New Paramount, the FCC confirmed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/skydance-deal-allows-trumps-fcc-to-censor-speech-and-silence-dissent-on-cbs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In combining a belt drive with a gravel bike, Priority Bicycles has put a smart idea into action with the <a href="https://www.prioritybicycles.com/products/priority-Gemini">Priority Gemini Smart.Shift</a>. The execution is mostly there, although the Gemini is perhaps best described as a fantastic commuter bike with a solid gravel upside—as long as the road isn't too rough.</p>
<p>The Priority Gemini comes in both aluminum and titanium frames. I tested the $3,499 aluminum model; the titanium version retails for $5,499. The aluminum version weighs in at 24 lb (10.9 kg), about a half-pound more than the titanium version, and comes with 40 mm WTB tires, WTB i23 ST tubeless-ready wheels (our test bike had inner tubes), and semi-hydraulic disc brakes. Both models use the Priority Smart.Shift hub and Gates Carbon Drive Belt.</p>
<h2>No mess, no fuss</h2>
<p>At first glance, a belt drive and internal gear hub seem the perfect match for a gravel bike. But implementation is key, and Priority has largely nailed it. Regular gravel grinding means regularly washing your bike and lubricating the chain. While the Gemini got dirty and needed to be hosed off, there were no gloves or chain lube involved. There were also no worries about dirt and dust making their way into a derailleur or coating the cassette. Belt drives are also dead quiet and have an excellent reputation for longevity, lasting up to three times longer than a chain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/going-chain-free-with-the-priority-apollo-gravel-bike/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>First offered in a passenger car by Mercedes-Benz back in 1974, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/audi-sports-rs3-and-tt-rs-the-same-engine-but-very-different-cars/">the five-cylinder engine</a> has always been a bit of an automotive oddball. The unconventional configuration eventually gained a foothold in the 1980s with manufacturers who needed a transversely mounted motor that was narrower than a V6 but wanted something smoother and more powerful than an inline-four.</p>
<p>For a time, the engine, with its distinctive exhaust warble, became closely associated with Audi’s lineup, aided in no small part by the motorsport successes of five-cylinder rally cars like the <a href="https://press.audi.co.uk/models/audi-sport-quattro-s1-e2--1985-UK-Heritage-Fleet">Sport Quattro S1 E2</a>. But as technology progressed and turbocharging became more prevalent, the need for a straight-five layout dwindled. Today, the $63,400 RS 3 is the final five-cylinder holdout—not just for Audi, but for production cars in general.</p>
<p>In an era increasingly focused on electrification and modularity, the improbable introduction of the second-generation RS 3 in 2022 seemed like fan service—an apparition that would likely vanish after a handful of diehards got their fill. But despite the headwinds that traditional performance cars have faced in recent years, the RS 3 not only lives on, it has actually been refreshed for 2025. While the tweaks are more evolutionary than revolutionary, they make what was already a highly entertaining sports sedan even more compelling. Well, for the most part anyway.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/the-2025-audi-rs-3-is-a-five-cylinder-firecracker/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.04 of the Rocket Report! The Pentagon's Golden Dome missile defense shield will be a lot of things. Along with new sensors, command and control systems, and satellites, Golden Dome will require a lot of rockets. The pieces of the Golden Dome architecture operating in orbit will ride to space on commercial launch vehicles. And Golden Dome's space-based interceptors will essentially be designed as flying fuel tanks with rocket engines. This shouldn't be overlooked, and that's why we include a couple of entries discussing Golden Dome in this week's Rocket Report.</p>

<p><b>Space-based interceptors are a real challenge. </b>The newly installed head of the Pentagon's Golden Dome missile defense shield knows the clock is ticking to show President Donald Trump some results before the end of his term in the White House, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/what-exactly-is-golden-dome-this-space-force-general-owes-trump-an-answer/">Ars reports</a>. Gen. Michael Guetlein identified command-and-control and the development of space-based interceptors as two of the most pressing technical challenges for Golden Dome. He believes the command-and-control problem can be "overcome in pretty short order." The space-based interceptor piece of the architecture is a different story.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/rocket-report-channeling-the-future-at-wallops-spacex-recovers-rocket-wreckage/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Spending bills making their way through both houses of Congress reject the White House's plan to wind down the SLS rocket after two more launches, but the text of a draft budget recently released by the House Appropriations Committee suggests an openness to making some major changes to the program.</p>
<p>The next SLS flight, called Artemis II, is scheduled to lift off early next year to send a crew of four astronauts around the far side of the Moon. Artemis III will follow a few years later on a mission to attempt a crew lunar landing at the Moon's south pole. These missions follow Artemis I, a successful unpiloted test flight in 2022.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/lawmakers-writing-nasas-budget-want-a-cheaper-upper-stage-for-the-sls-rocket/">Read full article</a></p>

In one case, Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-is-bringing-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-gemini-cli/">Gemini CLI</a> destroyed user files while attempting to reorganize them. In another, Replit's AI coding service deleted a production database despite explicit instructions not to modify code.</p>
<p>The Gemini CLI incident <a href="https://anuraag2601.github.io/gemini_cli_disaster.html">unfolded</a> when a product manager experimenting with Google's command-line tool watched the AI model execute file operations that destroyed data while attempting to reorganize folders. The destruction occurred through a series of move commands targeting a directory that never existed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/ai-coding-assistants-chase-phantoms-destroy-real-user-data/">Read full article</a></p>
