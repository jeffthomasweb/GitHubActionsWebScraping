                            <![CDATA[<p>We live in the era of the electric car—lightning that can't be put back in its bottle. This is important to keep in mind when we talk about new cars like the Aston Martin Vanquish Volante, because on paper, it seems hard to justify its half-million-dollar price tag and 800-plus horsepower twin-turbo V12 when things like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/rivians-new-quad-motor-r1t-and-r1s-beat-the-competition-in-any-conditions/">Rivian's Quad-motor R1</a> vehicles and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/lucid-is-making-a-triple-motor-air-to-rival-teslas-model-s-plaid/">Lucid's Air</a> can top its numbers for half the price. I say this not to suck the air out of the room but to put things in perspective, as this was on my mind when I slid into the driver's seat of Aston's latest ultra-luxury option.</p>
<p>What I was quickly reminded of, however, is that this is decadence, which, by its nature, does not need to be justified. Nobody needs an Aston Martin; you want one. You don't simply drive it, either; you indulge in it.</p>
<h2>Layer cake</h2>
<p>Aston Martin's current state of affairs is a strong one. Thanks to the efforts of Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll course-correcting the wayward ship of Aston Martin Lagonda—nobody remembers the Lagonda part, <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/concept/concepts-time-forgot-aston-martin-lagonda-vignale">not even AML</a>—the brand's portfolio contains four core vehicles, with several derivatives like the Vantage S on their way. This also includes the Volante, or convertible versions, such as this one, which is the fastest and most powerful mainline Aston Martin convertible ever made.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-aston-martin-vanquish-volante-a-ms-ultimate-gt-goes-topless/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A popular account on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sylvaniandrama">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sylvaniandrama">Instagram</a> stopped posting suddenly at the end of last year, hit by a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Epoch-Company-Ltd-v-Von-Engelbrechten-Complaint-4-7-25.pdf">lawsuit</a> after garnering millions of views on funny videos it made using adorable children's Calico Critter dolls to act out dark, cringe-y adult storylines.</p>
<p>While millions of followers mourn the so-called "Sylvanian Drama" account's demise, experts told Ars that the creator may have a decent chance at beating the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The "Sylvanian Drama" account derived its name from "Sylvanian Families," a brand name used by Epoch Company Ltd., the maker of Calico Critters, for its iconic fuzzy animal dolls in some markets outside the US. Despite these videos referencing murder, drugs, and hookups, the toy company apparently had no problem, until the account, managed by Ireland-based Thea Von Engelbrechten, started accepting big brand partnerships and making sponsored content featuring the dolls.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/tiktok-parody-account-sylvanian-drama-may-survive-sponsored-content-lawsuit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In May 2020, Sacramento, California, resident Alfonso Nguyen was alarmed to find two Sacramento County Sheriff’s deputies at his door, accusing him of illegally growing cannabis and demanding entry into his home. When Nguyen refused the search and denied the allegation, one deputy allegedly called him a liar and threatened to arrest him.</p>
<p>That same year, deputies from the same department, with their guns drawn and bullhorns and sirens sounding, fanned out around the home of Brian Decker, another Sacramento resident. The officers forced Decker to walk backward out of his home in only his underwear around 7 am while his neighbors watched. The deputies said that he, too, was under suspicion of illegally growing cannabis.</p>
<h2>Invasion of the privacy snatchers</h2>
<p>According to a motion the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed in Sacramento Superior Court last week, Nguyen and Decker are only two of more than 33,000 Sacramento-area people who have been flagged to the sheriff’s department by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the electricity provider for the region. SMUD called the customers out for using what it and department investigators said were suspiciously high amounts of electricity indicative of illegal cannabis farming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/eff-moves-to-stop-power-utility-reporting-suspected-pot-growers-to-cops/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple has released the fourth developer betas of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and its other next-generation software updates today. And along with their other changes and fixes, the new builds are bringing back Apple Intelligence notification summaries for news apps.</p>
<p>Apple disabled news notification summaries as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/01/ios-18-3-beta-disables-news-notification-summaries-after-high-stakes-errors/">the iOS 18.3 update in January</a>. Incorrect summaries circulating on social media prompted news organizations <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno">to complain to Apple</a>, particularly after one summary said that Luigi Mangione, alleged murderer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died by suicide (he had not and has not).</p>
<p>Upon installing the new update, users of Apple Intelligence-compatible devices will be asked to enable or disable three broad categories of notifications: those for "News &amp; Entertainment" apps, for "Communication &amp; Social" apps, and for all other apps. The operating systems will list sample apps based on what you currently have installed on your device.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/07/apple-intelligence-news-summaries-are-back-with-a-big-red-disclaimer/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Gordon Pennycook: "It might be one of the biggest false consensus effects that's been observed."]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Belief in conspiracy theories is often attributed to some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning">motivated reasoning</a>: People want to believe a conspiracy because it reinforces their worldview, for example, or doing so meets some deep psychological need, like wanting to feel unique. However, it might also be driven by overconfidence in their own cognitive abilities, according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672251338358">a paper</a> published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. The authors were surprised to discover that not only are conspiracy theorists overconfident, they also don't realize their beliefs are on the fringe, massively overestimating by as much as a factor of four how much other people agree with them.</p>
<p>"I was expecting the overconfidence finding," co-author <a href="https://psychology.cornell.edu/gordon-pennycook">Gordon Pennycook</a>, a psychologist at Cornell University, told Ars. "If you've talked to someone who believes conspiracies, it's self-evident. I did not expect them to be so ready to state that people agree with them. I thought that they would overestimate, but I didn't think that there'd be such a strong sense that they are in the majority. It might be one of the biggest false consensus effects that's been observed."</p>
<p>In 2015, Pennycook made headlines when he <a href="http://littlesvr.ca/grumble/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bullshit-detection.pdf">co-authored a paper</a> demonstrating how certain people interpret "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/abstract-art-with-pseudo-profound-bs-titles-seen-as-more-meaningful/">pseudo-profound bullshit</a>" as deep observations. Pennycook <em>et al</em>. were interested in identifying individual differences between those who are susceptible to pseudo-profound BS and those who are not and thus looked at conspiracy beliefs, their degree of analytical thinking, religious beliefs, and so forth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/conspiracy-theorists-think-their-views-are-mainstream/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Everybody aboard the Research Vessel <em>Garvin</em> had come to Miami for the sharks—to catch them, sample them, and tag them, all in the name of science. People who once wanted to be marine biologists, actual marine biologists, shark enthusiasts, the man who literally wrote the book <a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12267/why-sharks-matter?srsltid=AfmBOor5KWozpDxG9zPVTJO07QfbKTXpz1sy1DNj845zkbuc3Iddx1yR"><em>Why Sharks Matter</em></a>, and various friends and family had spent much of the day sending fish heads set with hooks over the side of the <em>Garvin</em>. But each time the line was hauled back in, it came in slack, with nothing but half-eaten bait or an empty hook at the end.</p>

<p>Assemblymember Tasha Boerner <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/california-bill-would-force-isps-to-offer-100mbps-plans-for-15-a-month/">proposed the state law</a> a few months ago, modeling the bill on a law enforced by New York. It seemed that other states were free to impose cheap-broadband mandates because the Supreme Court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/isps-lose-yet-another-attempt-to-kill-new-yorks-15-broadband-mandate/">rejected</a> broadband industry challenges to the New York law twice.</p>
<p>Boerner, a Democrat who is chair of the Communications and Conveyance Committee, faced pressure from Internet service providers to change or drop the bill. She made some changes, for example lowering the $15 plan's required download speeds from 100Mbps to 50Mbps and the required upload speeds from 20Mbps to 10Mbps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/california-backs-down-to-trump-admin-wont-force-isps-to-offer-15-broadband/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's search results have undergone a seismic shift over the past year as AI fever has continued to escalate among the tech giants. Nowhere is this change more apparent than right at the top of Google's storied results page, which is now home to AI Overviews. Google contends these Gemini-based answers don't take traffic away from websites, but a new analysis from the Pew Research Center says otherwise. Its analysis shows that searches with AI summaries reduce clicks, and their prevalence is increasing.</p>
<p>Google began testing AI Overviews as the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-search-will-start-automatically-showing-a-chatbot-to-some-users/">search generative experience</a>" in May 2023, and just a year later, they were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">an official part of the search engine results page</a> (SERP). Many sites (including this one) have noticed changes to their traffic in the wake of this move, but Google has brushed off concerns about how this could affect the sites from which it collects all that data.</p>
<p>SEO experts have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/">disagreed with Google's stance</a> on how AI affects web traffic, and the newly released Pew study backs them up. The Pew Research Center analyzed <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2025/05/23/methodology-metered-data-ai/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=25-07-22%20LAB%20GENERAL%20Metered%20data%20SR%20(AI%20contacts)&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=16531&amp;lea=4482072&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=a0DQm000006lHBeMAM">data from 900 users</a> of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel collected in March 2025. The analysis shows that among the test group, users were much less likely to click on search results when the page included an AI Overview.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/research-shows-google-ai-overviews-reduce-website-clicks-by-almost-half/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>To shed light on this struggle, we invite you to join us for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/k0dGDVbeedc">Ars Live talk at 1 pm ET</a> on Thursday, July 24, with Consumer Technology Association (CTA) Vice President of International Trade Edward Brzytwa. We'll be discussing how tech firms are responding to tariffs so far and how looming chip tariffs could pose the biggest hurdle yet in sourcing alternative supply chains. And anyone joining will have an opportunity to ask their biggest questions about how tariffs could impact consumer tech.</p>
<p>Before Trump even took office, experts had warned that his global trade war—imposing tariffs on imports of various goods from various countries in a bid to strike more favorable trade deals for the US—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/laptop-smartphone-and-game-console-prices-could-soar-after-the-election/">risked spiking prices of popular tech products</a> like laptops, game consoles, and smartphones.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/ars-live-consumer-tech-firms-stuck-scrambling-ahead-of-looming-chip-tariffs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has gone all-in on Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X-series chips for its Surface PCs, including the less-expensive-but-more-compromised <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/review-microsofts-13-inch-surface-laptop-isnt-bad-but-it-is-a-step-down/">13-inch Surface Laptop</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsofts-12-inch-surface-pro-is-cheaper-but-unfixes-a-decade-old-design-problem/">12-inch Surface Pro</a> from this spring. But the company still hasn't quite given up on businesses and individuals who still want or require a traditional Intel or AMD-based x86 PC.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the lineup is the "<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/?p=263729https://blogs.windows.com/devices/?p=263729">Surface Laptop 5G</a>," an updated version of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-laptop-intel-7th-edition">the Intel-based 13.8-inch Surface Laptop</a> with built-in 5G cellular connectivity. The system looks largely identical to the non-5G version, but Microsoft says it has been redesigned internally with "a dynamic antenna system" and "a custom multi-layered laminate," which improve signal strength.</p>
<p>The Surface Laptop 5G uses the same Core Ultra Series 2 chips (codenamed Lunar Lake) as the PCs Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/microsoft-updates-intel-based-surface-pcs-but-regular-people-still-cant-buy-them/">released in January</a>.

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration is considering slashing rules meant to protect the environment and the public during commercial rocket launches, changes that companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX have long sought.</p>
<p>A draft executive order being circulated among federal agencies, and viewed by ProPublica, directs Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy to “use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite” environmental reviews for launch licenses. It could also, in time, require states to allow more launches or even more launch sites—known as spaceports—along their coastlines.</p>
<p>The order is a step toward the rollback of federal oversight that Musk, who has fought bitterly with the Federal Aviation Administration over his space operations, and others have pushed for. Commercial rocket launches have grown exponentially more frequent in recent years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/environmental-protection-rules-for-rocket-launches-targeted-by-trump-administration/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the quirkier cultural gems in Los Angeles is the <a href="https://mjt.org/themainpage/main2.html">Museum of Jurassic Technology</a> (MJT), featuring an eclectic collection of exhibits (of varying authenticity) inspired by historical Renaissance "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities">cabinets of curiosities</a>" (<em>wunderkammers</em>). It hasn't been broadly reported, but earlier this month, a fire broke out late at night, gutting the museum's gift shop and inflicting smoke damage on several exhibits, with lost revenues estimated to be around $75,000 until the doors reopen sometime next month.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Jurassic_Technology">museum</a> was founded in 1988 by David Hildebrand Wilson and Diana Drake Wilson, "<a href="https://mjt.org/intro/genborch.htm">dedicated</a> to the advancement of knowledge and the public appreciation of the Lower Jurassic." The collections don't actually have much to do with that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Jurassic">geologic epoch</a>, channeling instead the private natural history collections that became common in the 16th century and the later emergence of public museums in the 19th century. Since 2005, there has also been a Russian tea room, a mini-reconstruction of Tsar Nicholas II's study at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
<p>There are more than 30 permanent exhibits, including one devoted to the life and exploits of the <a href="https://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2011/05/happy-birthday-athanasius-kircher.html">German polymath</a> and Jesuit priest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasius_Kircher">Athanasius Kircher</a>. There is also an exhibit called "The Garden of Eden on Wheels," about LA-area trailer parks; another celebrating the micro-miniature sculptures of Hagop Sandaldjian, carved from a single hair and displayed in the eye of a needle; a collection of stereographic radiographs of flowers; a collection of decomposing antique dice once owned by magician Ricky Jay; 19th-century microscopic mosaics made from butterfly wing scales; and a collection of crackpot letters sent to the Mount Wilson Observatory between 1915 and 1935.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/las-museum-of-jurassic-technology-damaged-by-fire/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla’s eroding popularity with Americans shows little sign of abating. Each month, the Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report surveys thousands of consumers to gauge attitudes on EV adoption, autonomous driving, and the automakers that are developing those technologies. Toyota, which only recently started selling enough EVs to be included in the survey, currently has the highest net-positive score and the highest “view intensity score”—the percentage of consumers who have a very positive view of a brand minus the ones who have a very negative view—despite selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/the-2023-toyota-bz4x-review-not-as-bad-as-the-horror-stories-have-it/">just a fairly lackluster EV</a> to date. Meanwhile, the brand that actually popularized the EV, moving it from compliance car and milk float to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2013/10/review-tesla-model-s/">something desirable</a>, has fallen even further into negative territory in July.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://ev-intelligence.com/evs-self-driving-cars-july2025/">26 percent</a> of survey participants still have a somewhat or very positive view of Tesla. But 39 percent have a somewhat or very negative view of the company, with just 14 percent being unfamiliar or having no opinion. That’s a net positive view of -13, but Tesla’s view intensity score is -16, meaning a lot more people really don’t like the company compared to the ones who really do. The problem is also growing over time: In April, Tesla still had a net positive view of -7.</p>
<p>Tesla remained at the bottom of the charts when EVIR looked more closely into demographic data. Tesla was the least-positively viewed car company regardless of income, although the effect was most pronounced among those with incomes less than $75,000, as were the results based on geography (although suburbanites held it in the most disdain) and age (where those over 65 have the most haters).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-is-the-least-trusted-car-brand-in-america-survey-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Dozens of xAI employees expressed concerns—and many objected—when asked to record videos of their facial expressions to help "give Grok a face," Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-grok-training-facial-expressions-skippy-employees-react-2025-7">reported</a>.</p>
<p>BI reviewed internal documents and Slack messages, finding that the so-called project "Skippy" was designed to help Grok learn what a face is and "interpret human emotions."</p>
<p>It's unclear from these documents if workers' facial data helped train controversial avatars that xAI released last week, including Ani—an anime companion that flirts and strips—and Rudi—a red panda with a "Bad" mode that encourages violence. But a recording of an xAI introductory meeting on "Skippy" showed a lead engineer confirming the company "might eventually use" the employees' facial data to build out "avatars of people," BI reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/xai-workers-balked-over-training-request-to-help-give-grok-a-face-docs-show/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You can add another name to the thousands of employees leaving NASA as the Trump administration primes the space agency for a 25 percent budget cut.</p>
<p>On Monday, NASA announced that Makenzie Lystrup will leave her post as director of the Goddard Space Flight Center on Friday, August 1. Lystrup has held the top job at Goddard since April 2023, overseeing a staff of more than 8,000 civil servants and contractor employees and a budget last year of about $4.7 billion.</p>
<p>These figures make Goddard the largest of NASA's 10 field centers primarily devoted to scientific research and development of robotic space missions, with a budget and workforce comparable to NASA's human spaceflight centers in Texas, Florida, and Alabama. Officials at Goddard manage the James Webb and Hubble telescopes in space, and Goddard engineers are assembling the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, another flagship observatory scheduled for launch late next year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/the-director-of-nasas-largest-science-center-is-leaving-government/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Mercedes-Benz provided flights from Detroit to Stuttgart, Germany, and accommodation so Ars could be briefed on the AMG.EA prototype as well as the GT XX that we covered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/mercedes-shows-off-new-electric-amg-concept-that-can-charge-at-850-kw/">last month</a>. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>First-generation high-performance electric vehicles, like the Tesla Model S Plaid, had a party trick that would wow first-timers: straight-line acceleration. Feeling your internal organs shift under the G forces of acceleration is cool the first few times but gets annoying after repeated launches. Why? Because a one-trick pony car isn't interesting or fun to enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Mercedes-AMG understands this now, and the company is attempting to make its most engaging, most interesting, and most technologically advanced high-performance EVs ever. Based on the AMG.EA architecture, at least two vehicles have been confirmed. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/mercedes-shows-off-new-electric-amg-concept-that-can-charge-at-850-kw/">the reveal of the concept GT XX and the AMG.EA architecture</a> in Affalterbach, the company took me for a ride in a future production version of the car.</p>
<p>You might think this car looks like a next-generation AMG GT four-door, but Mercedes won't confirm what it is other than that it's AMG.EA underneath. The purpose of this ride-along isn't to experience the power or performance but, rather, the feel of the car.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/mercedes-amg-gives-us-a-ride-in-its-next-high-performance-ev/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has an event next month to officially launch the Pixel 10 series, but the leaks have been coming fast and furious beforehand. There won't be much left to learn on August 20, particularly now that Google has revealed the phone. Over <a href="https://store.google.com/">on the Google Store</a>, there's a video revealing the Pixel 10's design, and it looks just a little familiar.</p>
<p>The video (which you can also see below) isn't very long, but it offers an unobscured look at the phone's physical design. The 13-second clip opens with the numeral "10" emerging from the shadows. The zero elongates and morphs into the trademark camera window on the back of the phone. The video zooms out to reveal the full phone from the back. The device is a muted blue-gray, which is probably the "frost" color listed in recent leaks.</p>
<p>The video is not accompanied by specs, pricing, or any other details; however, Google's new Tensor G5 processor is expected to be a marked improvement over past iterations. While the first four Tensor chips were manufactured in Samsung fabs, Tensor G5 is from TSMC. The dominant Taiwanese chip maker touts better semiconductor packaging technology, and the chip itself is believed to have more custom components that further separate it from the Samsung Exynos lineage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-reveals-the-pixel-10-and-yep-it-looks-like-the-pixel-9/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is ditching Biden-era standards for measuring progress toward the goal of universal broadband deployment.</p>
<p>The changes will make it easier for the FCC to give the broadband industry a passing grade in an annual progress report. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's proposal would give the industry a thumbs-up even if it falls short of 100 percent deployment, eliminate a long-term goal of gigabit broadband speeds, and abandon a new effort to track the affordability of broadband.</p>
<p>Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/1302">requires</a> the FCC to determine whether broadband is being deployed "on a reasonable and timely basis" to all Americans. If the answer is no, the US law says the FCC must "take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/fcc-to-eliminate-gigabit-speed-goal-and-scrap-analysis-of-broadband-prices/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Authorities and researchers are sounding the alarm over the active mass exploitation of a high-severity vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server that’s allowing attackers to make off with sensitive company data, including authentication tokens used to access systems inside networks. Researchers said anyone running an on-premises instance of SharePoint should assume their networks are breached.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-53770, carries a severity rating of 9.8 out of a possible 10. It gives unauthenticated remote access to SharePoint Servers exposed to the Internet. Starting Friday, researchers began warning of active exploitation of the vulnerability, which affects SharePoint Servers that infrastructure customers run in-house. Microsoft’s cloud-hosted SharePoint Online and Microsoft 365 are not affected.</p>
<h2>Not your typical webshell</h2>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/">confirmed</a> the attacks on the then-zero-day exploit on Saturday. A day later, the company updated the post to make available an emergency update patching the vulnerability, and a related one tracked as CVE-2025-53771, in SharePoint Subscription Edition and SharePoint 2019. Customers using either version should apply the updates immediately. SharePoint 2016 remained unpatched at the time this Ars post went live. Microsoft said that organizations using this version should install the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal">Antimalware Scan Interface</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/sharepoint-vulnerability-with-9-8-severity-rating-is-under-exploit-across-the-globe/">Read full article</a></p>
