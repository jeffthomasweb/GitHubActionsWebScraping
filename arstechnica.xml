                            <![CDATA[<p>You can add another name to the thousands of employees leaving NASA as the Trump administration primes the space agency for a 25 percent budget cut.</p>
<p>On Monday, NASA announced that Makenzie Lystrup will leave her post as director of the Goddard Space Flight Center on Friday, August 1. Lystrup has held the top job at Goddard since April 2023, overseeing a staff of more than 8,000 civil servants and contractor employees, and a budget last year of about $4.7 billion.</p>
<p>These figures make Goddard the largest of NASA's 10 field centers primarily devoted to scientific research and development of robotic space missions, with a budget and workforce comparable to NASA's human spaceflight centers in Texas, Florida, and Alabama. Officials at Goddard manage the James Webb and Hubble telescopes in space, and Goddard engineers are assembling the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, another flagship observatory scheduled for launch late next year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/the-director-of-nasas-largest-science-center-is-leaving-government/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Mercedes-Benz provided flights from Detroit to Stuttgart, Germany, and accommodation so Ars could be briefed on the AMG.EA prototype as well as the GT XX that we covered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/mercedes-shows-off-new-electric-amg-concept-that-can-charge-at-850-kw/">last month</a>. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>First-generation high-performance electric vehicles, like the Tesla Model S Plaid, had a party trick that would wow first-timers: straight-line acceleration. Feeling your internal organs shift under the G forces of acceleration is cool the first few times but gets annoying after repeated launches. Why? Because a one-trick pony car isn't interesting or fun to enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Mercedes-AMG understands this now, and the company is attempting to make its most engaging, most interesting, and most technologically advanced high-performance EVs ever. Based on the AMG.EA architecture, at least two vehicles have been confirmed. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/mercedes-shows-off-new-electric-amg-concept-that-can-charge-at-850-kw/">the reveal of the concept GT XX and the AMG.EA architecture</a> in Affalterbach, the company took me for a ride in a future production version of the car.</p>
<p>You might think this car looks like a next-generation AMG GT four-door, but Mercedes won't confirm what it is other than that it's AMG.EA underneath. The purpose of this ride-along isn't to experience the power or performance but, rather, the feel of the car.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/mercedes-amg-gives-us-a-ride-in-its-next-high-performance-ev/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has an event next month to officially launch the Pixel 10 series, but the leaks have been coming fast and furious beforehand. There won't be much left to learn on August 20, particularly now that Google has revealed the phone. Over <a href="https://store.google.com/">on the Google Store</a>, there's a video revealing the Pixel 10's design, and it looks just a little familiar.</p>
<p>The video (which you can also see below) isn't very long, but it offers an unobscured look at the phone's physical design. The 13-second clip opens with the numeral "10" emerging from the shadows. The zero elongates and morphs into the trademark camera window on the back of the phone. The video zooms out to reveal the full phone from the back. The device is a muted blue-gray, which is probably the "frost" color listed in recent leaks.</p>
<p>The video is not accompanied by specs, pricing, or any other details; however, Google's new Tensor G5 processor is expected to be a marked improvement over past iterations. While the first four Tensor chips were manufactured in Samsung fabs, Tensor G5 is from TSMC. The dominant Taiwanese chip maker touts better semiconductor packaging technology, and the chip itself is believed to have more custom components that further separate it from the Samsung Exynos lineage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-reveals-the-pixel-10-and-yep-it-looks-like-the-pixel-9/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is ditching Biden-era standards for measuring progress toward the goal of universal broadband deployment.</p>
<p>The changes will make it easier for the FCC to give the broadband industry a passing grade in an annual progress report. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's proposal would give the industry a thumbs-up even if it falls short of 100 percent deployment, eliminate a long-term goal of gigabit broadband speeds, and abandon a new effort to track the affordability of broadband.</p>
<p>Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/1302">requires</a> the FCC to determine whether broadband is being deployed "on a reasonable and timely basis" to all Americans. If the answer is no, the US law says the FCC must "take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/fcc-to-eliminate-gigabit-speed-goal-and-scrap-analysis-of-broadband-prices/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Authorities and researchers are sounding the alarm over the active mass exploitation of a high-severity vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server that’s allowing attackers to make off with sensitive company data, including authentication tokens used to access systems inside networks. Researchers said anyone running an on-premises instance of SharePoint should assume their networks are breached.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-53770, carries a severity rating of 9.8 out of a possible 10. It gives unauthenticated remote access to SharePoint Servers exposed to the Internet. Starting Friday, researchers began warning of active exploitation of the vulnerability, which affects SharePoint Servers that infrastructure customers run in-house. Microsoft’s cloud-hosted SharePoint Online and Microsoft 365 are not affected.</p>
<h2>Not your typical webshell</h2>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/">confirmed</a> the attacks on the then-zero-day exploit on Saturday. A day later, the company updated the post to make available an emergency update patching the vulnerability, and a related one tracked as CVE-2025-53771, in SharePoint Subscription Edition and SharePoint 2019. Customers using either version should apply the updates immediately. SharePoint 2016 remained unpatched at the time this Ars post went live. Microsoft said that organizations using this version should install the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal">Antimalware Scan Interface</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/sharepoint-vulnerability-with-9-8-severity-rating-is-under-exploit-across-the-globe/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The students participating in the annual International Math Olympiad (IMO) represent some of the most talented young computational minds in the world. This year, they faced down a newly enhanced array of powerful AI models, including Google's Gemini Deep Think. The company says it put its model to the test using the same rules as human participants, and it improved on an already solid showing from last year.</p>
<p>Google says its specially tuned math AI got five of the six questions correct, which is good enough for gold medal status. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/openai-jumps-gun-on-international-math-olympiad-gold-medal-announcement/?comments-page=1#comments">unlike OpenAI</a>, Google played by the rules set forth by the IMO.</p>
<h2>A new Gemini</h2>
<p>The Google DeepMind team participated in last year's IMO competition using an AI composed of the AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 models. This setup was able to get four of the six questions correct, earning silver medal status—only half of the human participants earn any medal at all.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/google-deepmind-earns-gold-in-international-math-olympiad-with-new-gemini-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Five years ago it was a lot easier to buy a car for less than $30,000. ]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/the-average-new-car-price-reached-49075-in-december/">affordability crisis</a> affecting the US automobile market shows little signs of abating. The average price of a new car continues to rise: In June the average new vehicle MSRP was $51,124, according to Kelly Blue Book, with average transaction prices a little lower at $48,907. While one might imagine this has had a dampening effect on car sales, the opposite is true—the first half of 2025 has seen a robust market with some months seeing extremely high volumes. But most signs point to a tightening of the market for the rest of 2025, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.carscommerce.inc/insights-report/#report">cars.com</a>.</p>
<p>The ongoing confusion caused by President Trump’s trade war is in part responsible for the surge of new car sales earlier this year. As tariffs on car imports and car parts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/">were announced</a>, but before they went into effect in April, dealerships filled their forecourts with as much stock as possible. New car sales rose nearly as much as inventory, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/how-automakers-like-ford-vw-stellantis-are-reacting-to-trumps-25-tariff/">helped by OEMs offering incentives to move metal</a>—this is why the average transaction price is several thousand dollars less than the average MSRP. But as pre-tariff inventory runs out, we can expect prices to rise and sales to slow.</p>
<p>As tariffs have started to bite, different parts of the market are being affected differently. And if the cynic in you thinks this means the low end is being squeezed, you’d be right. New cars costing less than $30,000 were just 13.9 percent of all car sales in the first half of this year; for the first six months of 2019—before the pandemic drove up new car prices by so much—they made up 38 percent of new car sales. <a href="http://Cars.com">Cars.com</a> notes that 92 percent of sub-$30,000 vehicles are built outside the US, and therefore highly exposed to the new tariffs; only the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic are built in the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/heres-why-there-are-so-few-new-cars-for-under-30000/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Intuitive Surgical, an American biotechnology company, introduced DaVinci surgical robots in the late 1990s, and they became groundbreaking teleoperation equipment. Expert surgeons could operate on patients remotely, manipulating the robotic arms and their surgical tools based on a video feed from DaVinci’s built-in cameras and endoscopes.</p>
<p>Now, John Hopkins University researchers put a ChatGPT-like AI in charge of a DaVinci robot and taught it to perform a gallbladder-removal surgery.</p>
<h2>Kuka surgeries</h2>
<p>The idea to put a computer behind the wheel of a surgical robot is not entirely new, but these had mostly relied on using pre-programmed actions. “The program told the robot exactly how to move and what to do. It worked like in these Kuka robotic arms, welding cars on factory floors,” says Ji Woong Kim, a robotics researcher who led the study on autonomous surgery. To improve on that, a team led by Axel Krieger, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at John Hopkins University, built STAR: the Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot. In 2022, it successfully performed a surgery on a live pig.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/experimental-surgery-performed-by-ai-driven-surgical-robot/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1947213316331282504">post</a> on Monday, X's Global Government Affairs account denied the allegations, insisting the French investigation "egregiously undermines X’s fundamental right to due process and threatens our users’ rights to privacy and free speech."</p>
<p>Preparing to fight the allegedly improper data grab, X accused a French politician, Eric Bothorel, of sparking the probe due to his supposed fears that X was manipulating its algorithm to influence French users' political views. Earlier this month, Politico <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/france-launches-criminal-investigation-into-x-over-algorithm-manipulation-00448273">reported</a> that French authorities suspected X of amplifying hateful, racist, and homophobic content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/researcher-threatens-x-with-lawsuit-after-falsely-linking-him-to-french-probe/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei <a href="https://x.com/alexwei_/status/1946477742855532918">announced</a> that a new AI language model the company is researching has achieved gold medal-level performance on the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> (IMO), matching a standard that fewer than 9 percent of human contestants reach each year. The announcement came despite an embargo request from IMO organizers asking AI companies to wait until July 28 to share their results.</p>
<p>The experimental model reportedly tackled the contest's <a href="https://github.com/aw31/openai-imo-2025-proofs/">six proof-based problems</a> under the same constraints as human competitors: 4.5 hours per session, with no Internet access or calculators allowed. However, several sources with inside knowledge of the process say that since OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/jfFxjfgLrmKRr/status/1947254739739070559">self-graded its IMO results</a>, the legitimacy of the company's claim <a href="https://x.com/Mihonarium/status/1946880931723194389">may be</a> in question. OpenAI plans to publish the proofs and grading rubrics for public review.</p>
<p>According to OpenAI, its achievement marks a departure from previous AI attempts at mathematical Olympiad problems, which relied on specialized theorem-proving systems that often exceeded human time limits. OpenAI says its model processed problems as plain text and generated natural-language proofs, operating like a standard language model rather than a purpose-built mathematical system.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/openai-jumps-gun-on-international-math-olympiad-gold-medal-announcement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sir Keir Starmer’s government is seeking a way out of a clash with the Trump administration over the UK’s demand that Apple provide it with access to secure customer data, two senior British officials have told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The officials both said the Home Office, which ordered the tech giant in January to grant access to its most secure cloud storage system, would probably have to retreat in the face of pressure from senior leaders in Washington, including Vice President JD Vance.</p>
<p>“This is something that the vice president is very annoyed about and which needs to be resolved,” said an official in the UK’s technology department. “The Home Office is basically going to have to back down.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/uk-backing-down-on-apple-encryption-backdoor-after-pressure-from-us/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Fueling nightmares that AI may soon decide legal battles, a Georgia court of appeals judge, Jeff Watkins, explained why a three-judge panel <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shahid-v-Esaam-Vacating-Order-6-30-25.pdf">vacated an order</a> last month that appears to be the first known ruling in which a judge sided with someone seemingly relying on fake AI-generated case citations to win a legal fight.</p>
<p>Now, experts are warning that judges overlooking AI hallucinations in court filings could easily become commonplace, especially in the typically overwhelmed lower courts. And so far, only two states have moved to force judges to sharpen their tech competencies and adapt so they can spot AI red flags and theoretically stop disruptions to the justice system at all levels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/its-frighteningly-likely-many-us-courts-will-overlook-ai-errors-expert-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Twenty-five years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film)"><em>X-Men</em></a> became a summer blockbuster and effectively re-energized a then-flagging market for superhero movies, which have dominated the industry (for better and worse) ever since. It's still a vastly entertaining film, with great characters, a zippy pace, and plenty of action. And its broader themes still strongly resonate with viewers today.</p>
<p><strong>(Many spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the popularity of the animated <em>X-Men</em> TV series caught the attention of 20th Century Fox (now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios">20th Century Studios</a>), which purchased the rights from a cash-strapped Marvel Comics and hired Bryan Singer (<em>The Usual Suspects</em>) to direct. At the time, the project was perceived by some as a bit risky, given waning Hollywood interest in the genre after 1997's disastrously campy <em>Batman and Robin</em>. But the gamble paid off: <em>X-Men</em> was a major hit, spawning its own franchise and ultimately the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/x-men-at-25-is-more-relevant-than-ever/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The drought in the Southwestern US is likely to last for the rest of the 21st century and potentially beyond as global warming shifts the distribution of heat in the Pacific Ocean, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01726-z">study</a> published last week led by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>Using sediment cores collected in the Rocky Mountains, paleoclimatology records and climate models, the researchers found warming driven by greenhouse gas emissions can alter patterns of atmospheric and marine heat in the North Pacific Ocean in a way resembling what’s known as the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), fluctuations in sea surface temperatures that result in decreased winter precipitation in the American Southwest. But in this case, the phenomenon can last far longer than the usual 30-year cycle of the PDO.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/southwestern-drought-likely-to-continue-through-2100-research-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This has been a good week for the US space agency in terms of the federal budget.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a committee in the US House of Representatives <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/congress-moves-to-reject-bulk-of-white-houses-proposed-nasa-cuts/">passed a $24.8 billion budget bill</a> for the coming fiscal year. Then, two days later a Senate committee <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/majority/senate-committee-approves-fy-2026-commerce-justice-and-science-appropriations-bill">passed a $24.9 billion budget</a> for NASA. Both of these measures would keep funding more or less at the level of the current fiscal year and, for the most part, keep the space agency's programs going on their current trajectories.</p>
<p>These bills are not final. Both must move through the full House and Senate and then be reconciled before going to President Trump for his signature. And time is running out, with fiscal year 2026 set to begin on October 1, just a little more than 10 weeks from now.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/a-huge-fight-looms-over-the-nasa-budget-this-fall/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Polish programmer running on fumes recently accomplished what may soon become impossible: beating an advanced AI model from OpenAI in a head-to-head coding competition. The 10-hour marathon left him "completely exhausted."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, programmer Przemysław Dębiak (known as "Psyho"), a former OpenAI employee, narrowly defeated the custom AI model in the <a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/awtf2025heuristic">AtCoder World Tour Finals 2025 Heuristic contest</a> in Tokyo. AtCoder, a Japanese platform that hosts competitive programming contests and maintains global rankings, held what may be the first contest where an AI model competed directly against top human programmers in a major onsite world championship. During the event, the maker of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> participated as a sponsor and entered an AI model in a <a href="https://atcoder.jp/posts/1516">special exhibition match</a> titled "Humans vs AI." Despite the tireless nature of silicon, the company walked away with second place.</p>
<p>"Humanity has prevailed (for now!)," <a href="https://x.com/FakePsyho/status/1945444118924272018">wrote</a> Dębiak on X, noting he had little sleep while competing in several competitions across three days.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers recently reported encountering a phishing attack in the wild that bypasses a multifactor authentication scheme based on FIDO (Fast Identity Online), the industry-wide standard being adopted by thousands of sites and enterprises.</p>
<p>If true, the attack, <a href="https://expel.com/blog/poisonseed-bypassing-fido-keys-to-fetch-user-accounts/">reported in a blog post Thursday</a> by security firm Expel, would be huge news, since FIDO is widely regarded as being immune to credential phishing attacks. After analyzing the Expel write-up, I’m confident that the attack doesn’t bypass FIDO protections, at least not in the sense that the word “bypass” is commonly used in security circles. Rather, the attack downgrades the MFA process to a weaker, non-FIDO-based process. As such, the attack is better described as a FIDO downgrade attack. More about that shortly. For now, let’s describe what Expel researchers reported.</p>
<h2>Abusing cross-device sign-ins</h2>
<p>Expel said the “novel attack technique” begins with an email that links to a fake login page from Okta, a widely used authentication provider. It prompts visitors to enter their valid user name and password. People who take the bait have now helped the attack group, which Expel said is named PoisonSeed, clear the first big hurdle in gaining unauthorized access to the Okta account.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/no-phishers-are-not-bypassing-fido-mfa-at-least-not-yet-heres-why/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Netflix used generative AI in an original, scripted series that debuted this year, it revealed this week. Producers used the technology to create a scene in which a building collapses, hinting at the growing use of generative AI in entertainment.</p>
<p>During a call with investors yesterday, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that Netflix's Argentine show <em>The Eternaut</em>, which premiered in April, is "the very first GenAI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix, Inc. original series or film.” Sarandos further explained, per <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/07/17/netflix-nflx-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/">a transcript</a> of the call, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The creators wanted to show a building collapsing in Buenos Aires. So our iLine team, [which is the production innovation group inside the visual effects house at Netflix effects studio Scanline], partnered with their creative team using AI-powered tools. ... And in fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with visual, traditional VFX tools and workflows. And, also, the cost of it would just not have been feasible for a show in that budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarandos claimed that viewers have been "thrilled with the results"; although that likely has much to do with how the rest of the series, based on a comic, plays out, not just one, AI-crafted scene.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/netflixs-first-show-with-generative-ai-is-a-sign-of-whats-to-come-in-tv-film/">Read full article</a></p>
