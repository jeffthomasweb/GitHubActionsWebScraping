Much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work">large language models</a> (LLMs) in AI, HLMs have the ability to take information you provide and transform it into meaningful responses—if you know how to craft effective instructions, called "prompts."</p>

<p>Jackson County, Missouri, has declared a state of emergency and closed key offices indefinitely as it responds to what officials believe is a ransomware attack that has made some of its IT systems inoperable.</p>
<p>"Jackson County has identified significant disruptions within its IT systems, potentially attributable to a ransomware attack," officials <a href="https://www.jacksongov.org/Our-County/About-Us/Media-Releases/Media-Releases/2024/Jackson-County-responds-to-potential-ransomware-attack">wrote Tuesday</a>. "Early indications suggest operational inconsistencies across its digital infrastructure and certain systems have been rendered inoperative while others continue to function as normal."</p>
<p>The systems confirmed inoperable include tax and online property payments, issuance of marriage licenses, and inmate searches. In response, the Assessment, Collection and Recorder of Deeds offices at all county locations are closed until further notice.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014470#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014470&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.383454/gov.uscourts.txnd.383454.41.0.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> filed in Texas' northern district last month, MMFA argued that X's lawsuit should be dismissed not just because of a "fatal jurisdictional defect," but "dismissal is also required for lack of venue."</p>
<p>Notably, MMFA is based in Washington, DC, while "X is organized under Nevada law and maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco, California, where its own terms of service require users of its platform to litigate any disputes."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014411#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014411&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, the Artist Rights Alliance (ARA) announced <a href="https://artistrightsnow.medium.com/200-artists-urge-tech-platforms-stop-devaluing-music-559fb109bbac">an open letter</a> critical of AI signed by over 200 musical artists, including Pearl Jam, Nicki Minaj, Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder, Elvis Costello, and the estate of Frank Sinatra. In the letter, the artists call on AI developers, technology companies, platforms, and digital music services to stop using AI to "infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists." A <a href="https://x.com/artistrightsnow/status/1775163089509331299?s=20">tweet</a> from the ARA added that AI poses an "existential threat" to their art.</p>

<p>Visual artists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/artstation-artists-stage-mass-protest-against-ai-generated-artwork/">began protesting</a> the advent of generative AI after the rise of the first mainstream <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">AI image generators</a> in 2022, and considering that generative AI research has since been undertaken for other forms of creative media, we have seen that protest extend to professionals in other creative domains, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ai-vs-hollywood-writers-battle-plagiarism-machines-in-union-talks/">writers</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/fran-drescher-we-are-all-going-to-be-in-jeopardy-of-being-replaced-by-machines/">actors</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/i-just-dont-see-how-we-survive-tyler-perry-issues-hollywood-warning-over-ai-video-tech/">filmmakers</a>—and now musicians.</p>
<p>"When used irresponsibly, AI poses enormous threats to our ability to protect our privacy, our identities, our music and our livelihoods," the open letter states. It alleges that some of the "biggest and most powerful" companies (unnamed in the letter) are using the work of artists without permission to train AI models, with the aim of replacing human artists with AI-created content.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014327#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014327&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Broadcom has made controversial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/">changes</a> to VMware since closing its acquisition of the virtualization brand in late November. Broadcom executives are trying to convince VMware customers and partners that they'll eventually see the subscription-fueled light. But discontent remains, as illustrated by industry groups continuing to urge regulators to rein-in what they claim are unfair business practices.</p>
<p>Since Broadcom announced that it would no longer sell <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">perpetual VMware licenses</a> as of December 2023, there have been complaints about rising costs associated with this model. In March, a VMware User Group Town Hall saw attendees complaining of price jumps of up to 600 percent, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/08/broadcom_q1_2024/">The Register</a> reported. Small managed service providers that had worked with VMware have reported seeing the price of business rising tenfold, per a February <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/vmware-vcsp-customers-seeing-10x-or-more-cost-increases-under-broadcom/">ServeTheHome</a> report.</p>
<h2>Broadcom execs defend subscription model</h2>
<p>However, Sylvain Cazard, president of Broadcom Software for Asia-Pacific, reportedly told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/vmware_cloud_foundation_updates_coming/?td=rt-3a">The Register</a> that complaints about higher prices are unwarranted since customers using at least two components of VMware's flagship Cloud Foundation will end up paying less and because the new pricing includes support, which VMware didn't include before.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014318#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014318&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google offers a VPN via its "Google One" monthly subscription plan, and while it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/google-adds-always-on-vpn-to-its-project-fi-cellular-service/">debuted on phones</a>, a desktop app has been available for Windows and Mac OS for <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-one-vpn-windows-mac-rolling-out-widely/">over a year now</a>. Since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-earnings-100-million-google-one-subscribers-google-cloud-profits/">a lot of people</a> pay for Google One for the cloud storage increase for their Google accounts, you might be tempted to try the VPN on a desktop, but Windows users testing out the app haven't seemed too happy lately. An open bug report on <a href="https://github.com/google/vpn-libraries/issues/36">Google's GitHub</a> for the project says the Windows app "breaks" the Windows DNS, and this has been ongoing since at least November.</p>
<p>A VPN would naturally route all your traffic through a secure tunnel, but you've still got to do DNS lookups somewhere. A lot of VPN services also come with a DNS service, and Google is no different. The problem is that Google's VPN app changes the Windows DNS settings of all network adapters to <em>always</em> use Google's DNS, whether the VPN is on or off. Even if you change them, Google's program will change them back.</p>
<p>Most VPN apps don't work this way, and even Google's Mac VPN program doesn't work this way. The users in the thread (and the ones emailing us) expect the app, at minimum, to use the original Windows settings when the VPN is off. Since running a VPN is often about privacy and security, users want to be able to change the DNS away from Google even when the VPN is running.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014104#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014104&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Before the cancellation of<em> The Problem with Jon Stewart</em> on Apple TV+, Apple forbade the inclusion of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan as a guest and steered the show away from confronting issues related to artificial intelligence, according to Jon Stewart.</p>
<p>This isn't the first we've heard of this rift between Apple and Stewart. When the Apple TV+ show was canceled last October, reports circulated that he told his staff that creative differences over guests and topics were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/report-apple-cancels-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-over-china-ai-topics/">a factor in the decision</a>.</p>

<p>A small underwater drone called Hydrus <a href="https://www.advancednavigation.com/news/press-release/hydrus-plunges-into-rottnest-ships-graveyard-investigating-maritime-mysteries">has located the wreckage</a> of a 100-year-old coal hulk in the deep waters off the coast of western Australia. Based on the data the drone captured, scientists were able to use photogrammetry to virtually "rebuild" the 210-foot ship into a 3D model (above). You can explore an interactive 3D rendering of the wreckage <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/micro-auv-hydrus-captures-shipwreck-11c4619cc5e44045b1df5fd4abdcb586">here</a>.</p>
<p>The use of robotic submersibles to locate and explore historic shipwrecks is well established. For instance, researchers relied on remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/fresh-images-of-hms-terror-shipwreck-could-clear-up-lingering-mysteries/">to study</a> the wreckage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Terror_(1813)">HMS <em>Terror</em></a>, Captain Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition">John S. Franklin</a>'s doomed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition">Arctic expedition</a> to cross the Northwest Passage in 1846. In 2007, a pair of brothers (printers based in Norfolk) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/diving-brothers-found-the-wreck-of-the-gloucester-300-years-after-sinking/">discovered</a> the wreck of the <em>Gloucester</em>, which ran aground on a sandbank off the coast of Norfolk in 1682 and sank within the hour. Among the passengers was James Stuart, Duke of York and future <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England">King James II</a> of England, who escaped in a small boat just before the ship sank.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/long-lost-endurance-shipwreck-found-off-coast-of-antarctica/">In 2022</a>, the <a href="https://fmht.co.uk">Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/endurance-shackleton-ship-found-off-antarctic-coast">National Geographic</a> <a href="https://endurance22.org/endurance-is-found">announced</a> the discovery of British explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton#Loss_of_Endurance">Sir Ernest Shackleton</a>'s ship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_(1912_ship)"><em>Endurance</em></a>. In 1915, Shackleton and his crew were stranded for months on the Antarctic ice after the ship was crushed by pack ice and sank into the freezing depths of the Weddell Sea. The wreckage was found nearly 107 years later, 3,008 meters down, roughly four miles (6.4 km) south of the ship's last recorded position. The wreck was in pristine condition partly because of the lack of wood-eating microbes in those waters. In fact, the lettering "ENDURANCE" was clearly visible in shots of the stern.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014256#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014256&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/klaus-teuber-made-catan-and-it-changed-the-worlds-expectations-for-board-games/">Klaus Teuber's <em>Catan</em></a> (previously <em>Settlers of Catan</em>), the player is tasked with starting from scratch and building as much as they can: the largest army, the most cities, the best sea ports for easy trading, even the longest road. It's all beneficial, and the only real drawback is that you have to prioritize certain things over others. There wasn't direct conflict or battle, but there were scarce resources, and the savviest player could corner the market for them.</p>
<p><em>Catan</em> was released in 1995. Now, in 2024, Teuber's son, Benjamin Teuber, is releasing<em> <a href="https://www.catan.com/catan-new-energies">Catan: New Energies</a>, </em>which he developed with his late father. While it is "rooted in classic <em>Catan</em> mechanics of trading, harvesting, and building," there are some decidedly 2024 issues at play now that the Vikings have settled in for <a href="https://vitabrevis.americanancestors.org/2023/10/catan-playing-with-pieces-of-history">more than a millennia</a>.</p>

<p>In a disturbing sign of the times, Medicare this week implemented a change to its claims-processing system that adds two extra digits to money amounts, expanding the fields from eight digits to 10. The change now allows for billing and payment totals of up to $99,999,999.99, or a penny shy of $100 million.</p>
<p>In a notice released last month, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) explained the change, writing, "With the increase of Part B procedures/treatments exceeding the $999,999.99 limitation, CMS is implementing the expansion of display screens for monetary amount fields related to billing and payment within [the Fiscal Intermediary Shared System (FISS)] to accept and process up to 10 digits ($99,999,999.99)."</p>
<p>The FISS is the processing system used by hospitals and doctors' offices to process Medicare claims.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014290#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014290&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Shane Williams is always on the lookout for dead kangaroos. She keeps a can of red spray paint and a pillowcase in her car, just in case she finds one on the side of the road.</p>
<p>When Williams spots a roo, she hops out of her car to check for an orphaned joey, which might still be in its now-dead mother’s pouch. She then sprays the adult with a large pink cross so drivers will know the body has been searched. If Williams, the founder of <a href="https://www.bwr.org.au/">Bridgetown Wildlife Rescue</a>, finds a baby roo, she’ll hang it up in a pillowcase inside the car for the ride home. Sometimes, she said, when the animals are too small to generate their own heat, “you just put ‘em straight down your top.”</p>
<p>Williams has had plenty of opportunities to refine her technique, as kangaroos are one of Australia’s biggest traffic threats.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014220#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014220&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US and UK have signed a landmark agreement on artificial intelligence, as the allies become the first countries to formally cooperate on how to test and assess risks from emerging AI models.</p>
<p>The agreement, signed on Monday in Washington by UK Science Minister Michelle Donelan and US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, lays out how the two governments will pool technical knowledge, information, and talent on AI safety.</p>
<p>The deal represents the first bilateral arrangement on AI safety in the world and comes as governments push for greater regulation of the existential risks from new technology, such as its use in damaging cyber attacks or designing bioweapons.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014246#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014246&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <p><em>Welcome to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/daily-telescope/">Daily Telescope</a>. There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope.

<p>Good morning. It's April 2, and today's photo comes from the venerable Hubble Space Telescope. It showcases a globular cluster, NGC 1651, in the Large Magellanic Cloud.</p>
<p>This cluster of stars is about 120 light-years across. Like other such globular clusters, it is generally spherical, as the stars are bound to one another by gravity. Thus, there is a higher concentration of stars near the center of the cluster.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014208#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014208&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A few weeks ago, something from the heavens came crashing through the roof of Alejandro Otero's home, and NASA is on the case.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, this nearly 2-pound object came from the International Space Station. Otero said it tore through the roof and both floors of his two-story house in Naples, Florida.</p>
<p>Otero wasn't home at the time, but his son was there. A Nest home security camera captured the sound of the crash at 2:34 pm local time (19:34 UTC) on March 8. That's an important piece of information because it is a close match for the time—2:29 pm EST (19:29 UTC)—that US Space Command recorded the reentry of a piece of space debris from the space station. At that time, the object was on a path over the Gulf of Mexico, heading toward southwest Florida.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013803#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013803&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly">announced</a> that visitors to the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT website</a> in some regions can now use the AI assistant without signing in. Previously, the company required that users create an account to use it, even with the free version of ChatGPT that is currently powered by the GPT-3.5 AI language model. But as we have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">noted in the past</a>, GPT-3.5 is widely known to provide more inaccurate information compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">GPT-4 Turbo</a>, available in paid versions of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Since its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">launch</a> in November 2022, ChatGPT has transformed over time from a tech demo to a comprehensive AI assistant, and it has always had a free version available. The cost is free because "<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/">you're the product</a>," as the old saying goes. Using ChatGPT helps OpenAI gather data that will help the company train future AI models, although free users and ChatGPT Plus subscription members can both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/chatgpt-users-can-now-opt-out-of-chat-history-and-model-training/">opt out</a> of allowing the data they input into ChatGPT to be used for AI training. (OpenAI says it never trains on inputs from <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/team">ChatGPT Team</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/the-new-spreadsheet-openai-introduces-chatgpt-enterprise-for-businesses/">Enterprise</a> members at all.)</p>
<p>Opening ChatGPT to everyone could provide a frictionless on-ramp for people who might use it as a substitute for Google Search or potentially gain new customers by providing an easy way for people to use ChatGPT quickly, then offering an upsell to paid versions of the service.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014076#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014076&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Months after unbundling the apps in the European Union, Microsoft is taking the Office and Teams breakup worldwide. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-separate-teams-office-globally-amid-antitrust-scrutiny-2024-04-01/">reports</a> that Microsoft will begin selling Teams and the other Microsoft 365 apps to new commercial customers as separate products with separate price tags beginning today.</p>
<p>"To ensure clarity for our customers, we are extending the steps we took last year to unbundle Teams from M365 and O365 in the European Economic Area and Switzerland to customers globally," a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars. "Doing so also addresses feedback from the European Commission by providing multinational companies more flexibility when they want to standardize their purchasing across geographies."</p>
<p>The unbundling is a win for other team communication apps like Slack and videoconferencing apps like Zoom, both of which predate Teams but haven't had the benefits of the Office apps' huge established user base.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013950#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013950&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Discord had long been strongly opposed to ads, but starting this week, it's giving video game makers the ability to advertise to its users. The introduction of so-called Sponsored Quests marks a notable change from the startup's previous business model, but, at least for now, it seems much less intrusive than the ads shoved into other social media platforms, especially since Discord users can choose not to engage with them.</p>
<p>Discord first announced Sponsored Quests on March 7, with Peter Sellis, Discord's SVP of product, writing in a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/our-quest-to-support-game-developers">blog post</a> that users would start seeing them in the "coming weeks." Sponsored Quests offer PC gamers in-game rewards for getting friends to watch a stream of them playing through Discord. Discord senior product communications manager Swaleha Carlson confirmed to Ars Technica that Sponsored Quests launch this week.</p>

<p>The goal is for video games to get exposure to more gamers, serving as a form of marketing. On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/discord-to-start-showing-ads-for-gamers-to-boost-revenue-bf5848b9">WSJ</a>) reported that it viewed a slide from a slideshow Discord shows to game developers regarding the ads that reads: "We’ll get you in front of players. And those players will get you into their friend groups."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014027#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014027&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/google-agrees-to-settle-in-chrome-incognito-mode-class-action-lawsuit/">settle a class-action dispute over Chrome's "Incognito" mode</a>, Google has <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Brown-v-Google-Unopposed-Motion-for-Final-Approval-of-Class-Action-Settlement-4-1-2024.pdf">agreed</a> to delete billions of data records reflecting users' private browsing activities.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Ars, users' lawyer, David Boies, described the settlement as "a historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies." Based on Google's insights, users' lawyers valued the settlement between $4.75 billion and $7.8 billion, the Monday <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Brown-v-Google-Unopposed-Motion-for-Final-Approval-of-Class-Action-Settlement-4-1-2024.pdf">court filing</a> said.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, Google agreed to delete class-action members' private browsing data collected in the past, as well as to "maintain a change to Incognito mode that enables Incognito users to block third-party cookies by default." This, plaintiffs' lawyers noted, "ensures additional privacy for Incognito users going forward, while limiting the amount of data Google collects from them" over the next five years. Plaintiffs' lawyers said that this means that "Google will collect less data from users’ private browsing sessions" and "Google will make less money from the data."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014074#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014074&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
