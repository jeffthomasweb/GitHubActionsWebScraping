            <![CDATA[Spoilers ahead! This imaginative sequel to <em>WandaVision</em> is a reminder of just how good the MCU can be.]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>The MCU's foray into streaming television has produced mixed results, but one of my favorites was the weirdly inventive, oh-so-meta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/review-wandavision-sticks-the-landing-with-a-very-marvel-esque-finale/"><em>WandaVision</em></a>. I'm happy to report that the spinoff sequel, <em>Agatha All Along,</em> taps into that same offbeat creativity, giving us a welcome reminder of just how good the MCU can be when it's firing on all storytelling cylinders.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below, including for <em>WandaVision</em> and <em>Multiverse of Madness</em>. We'll give you another heads up when major spoilers for <em>Agatha All Along</em> are imminent.)</strong></p>
<p>The true identity of nosy next-door neighbor Agnes—played to perfection by Kathryn Hahn—was the big reveal of 2021's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/review-wandavision-sticks-the-landing-with-a-very-marvel-esque-finale/"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, even inspiring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8u8md-NiHM">a jingle</a> that went viral. Agnes turned out to be a powerful witch named Agatha Harkness, who had studied magic for centuries and was just dying to learn the source of Wanda's incredible power. Wanda's natural abilities were magnified by the Mind Stone, but Agatha realized that Wanda was a wielder of "chaos magic." She was, in fact, the Scarlet Witch. In the finale, Wanda trapped Agatha in her nosy neighbor persona while releasing the rest of the town of Westview from her grief-driven Hex.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/review-catching-up-with-the-witchy-brew-of-agatha-all-along/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you need any inspiration for cutting loose and relaxing this weekend, look no further than a free-wheeling troop of monkeys that broke out of their South Carolina research facility Wednesday and, as of noon Friday, were still "playfully exploring" with their newfound freedom.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yemasseepolice/posts/pfbid088AMJmPjd4QgbTJtmatZUgc7MfsVy2HkPMZmEzbUH9h9pBTcLyaSpjmJCD3mHvoGl">an update Friday</a>, the police department of Yemassee, SC said that the 43 young, female rhesus macaque monkeys are still staying around the perimeter of the Alpha Genesis Primate Research Facility. "The primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication," the department noted.</p>
<p>The fun-loving furballs got free after a caretaker "failed to secure doors" at the facility.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/43-research-monkeys-on-the-lam-still-playfully-exploring-police-say/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241107699415/en/Anthropic-and-Palantir-Partner-to-Bring-Claude-AI-Models-to-AWS-for-U.S.-Government-Intelligence-and-Defense-Operations">announced</a> a partnership with Palantir and Amazon Web Services to bring its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">Claude AI models</a> to unspecified US intelligence and defense agencies. Claude, a family of AI language models similar to those that power <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, will work within Palantir's platform using AWS hosting to process and analyze data. But some critics have called out the deal as contradictory to Anthropic's widely-publicized "<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety">AI safety</a>" aims.</p>
<p>On X, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/google-embroiled-in-row-over-ai-bias-research/">former Google co-head of AI ethics Timnit Gebru</a> <a href="https://x.com/timnitGebru/status/1854644626348818763">wrote</a> of Anthropic's new deal with Palantir, "Look at how they care so much about 'existential risks to humanity.'"</p>
<p>The partnership makes Claude available within Palantir's <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/how-palantir-meets-il6-security-requirements-with-apollo-f6c3f0c51fe?gi=96e72abeab7f">Impact Level 6 environment</a> (IL6), a defense-accredited system that handles data critical to national security up to the "secret" classification level. This move follows a broader trend of AI companies seeking defense contracts, with Meta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/meta-says-its-making-its-llama-models-available-for-us-national-security-applications/">offering its Llama models</a> to defense partners and OpenAI <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/17/openai-is-quietly-pitching-its-products-to-the-u-s-military-and-national-security-establishment/">pursuing closer ties</a> with the Defense Department.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/safe-ai-champ-anthropic-teams-up-with-defense-giant-palantir-in-new-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Broadcom acquisition was a "wake-up call" for VMware-dependent SMBs. ]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Broadcom has a new subscription tier for VMware virtualization software that may appease some<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/"> disgruntled VMware customers</a>, especially small to medium-sized businesses. The new VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus subscription tier creates a more digestible bundle that's more appropriate for smaller customers. But it may be too late to convince some SMBs not to abandon VMware.</p>
<p>Soon after Broadcom bought VMware, it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">stopped the sale of VMware perpetual licenses</a> and started requiring subscriptions. Broadcom also bundled VMware's products into a smaller number of SKUs, resulting in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/">higher costs</a> and frustration for customers that felt like they were being forced to pay for products that they didn't want. All that, combined with Broadcom ditching some smaller <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/">VMware channel partners</a> (and <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/2024/broadcom-takes-top-vmware-accounts-direct-effective-immediately">reportedly</a> taking the biggest clients direct), have raised doubts that Broadcom's VMware would be a good fit for smaller customers.</p>
<p>“The challenge with much of the VMware by Broadcom changes to date and before the announcement [of the vSphere Enterprise Plus subscription tier] is that it also forced many organizations to a much higher offering and much more components to a stack that they were previously uninterested in deploying," Rick Vanover, Veeam's product strategy VP, told Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/new-smb-friendly-subscription-tier-may-be-too-late-to-stop-vmware-migrations/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Matter, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/matter-and-thread-could-fix-smart-home-compatibility-but-dont-get-excited-yet/">smart home standard</a> that promises an interoperable future for home automation, even if it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/matter-was-more-of-a-nice-smart-home-concept-than-useful-reality-in-2023/">scattered and a bit buggy right now</a>, is out with <a href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/">a new version, 1.4</a>. It promises more device types, improvements for working across ecosystems, and tools for managing battery backups, solar panels, and heat pumps.</p>
<p>"Enhanced Multi-Admin" is the headline feature for anybody invested in Matter's original promise, one where you can buy a device and it doesn't matter if your other gear is meant for Amazon (Alexa), Google, Apple, or whatever, it should just connect and work. With 1.4, a home administrator should be able to let a device onto their network just once, and then have that device picked up by whatever controller they're using. There have technically been ways for a device to be set up on, say, Alexa and Apple Home, but the process has been buggy, involves generating "secondary codes," and is kind of an unpaid junior sysadmin job.</p>
<p>What's now available is "Fabric Sync," which sounds like something that happens in a static-ridden dryer. But "Fabrics" is how the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) describes smart home systems, like Alexa or Google Home. In theory, with every tech company doing their best, you'd set up a smart light bulb with your iPhone, add it to your Apple Home, but still have it be able to be added to a Google Home system, Android phones included. Even better, ecosystems that don't offer controls for entire categories, like Apple and smart displays (because it doesn't make any), should still be able to pick up and control them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/matter-1-4-has-some-solid-ideas-for-the-future-home-now-lets-see-the-support/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile are continuing their fight against fines for selling user location data, with two of the big three carriers submitting new court briefs arguing that the Federal Communications Commission can't punish them.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.3faa6ebe-fa32-ef11-a296-001dd804fa85/gov.uscourts.ca2.3faa6ebe-fa32-ef11-a296-001dd804fa85.36.0.pdf">Verizon brief</a> filed on November 4 and an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.219140/gov.uscourts.ca5.219140.53.0.pdf">AT&amp;T brief</a> on November 1 contest the legal basis for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-fines-big-three-carriers-196m-for-selling-users-real-time-location-data/">FCC fines issued in April 2024</a>. T-Mobile also <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68928957/t-mobile-usa-inc-v-fcc/">sued the FCC</a>, but briefs haven't been filed yet in that case.</p>
<p>"Verizon's petition for review stems from the multiple and significant errors that the FCC, in purporting to enforce statutory consumer data privacy provisions, made in overstepping its authority," Verizon wrote. "The FCC's Forfeiture Order violated both the Communications Act and the Constitution, while failing to benefit the consumers it purported to protect."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/verizon-att-tell-courts-fcc-cant-punish-us-for-selling-user-location-data/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Michigan man who ran chat rooms and Discord servers targeting children playing online games and coercing them into self-harm, sexually explicit acts, suicide, and other violence was sentenced to 30 years in prison Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/member-violent-764-terror-network-sentenced-30-years-prison-sexually-exploiting-child">According to the US Department of Justice</a>, Richard Densmore was a member of an online terrorist network called 764, which the FBI considers a "tier one" terrorist threat. He pled guilty to sexual exploitation of a child as "part of a broader indictment that charged him with other child exploitation offenses." In the DOJ's press release, FBI Director Christopher Wray committed to bring to justice any abusive groups known to be preying on vulnerable kids online.</p>
<p>“This defendant orchestrated a community to target children through online gaming sites and used extortion and blackmail to force his minor victims to record themselves committing acts of self-harm and violence,” Wray said. “If you prey on children online, you can’t hide behind a keyboard. The FBI will use all our resources and authorities to arrest you and hold you accountable.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/discord-terrorist-known-as-rabid-gets-30-years-for-preying-on-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The global space community awoke to a new reality on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The founder of this century's most innovative space company, Elon Musk, successfully used his fortune, time, and energy to help elect Donald Trump to president of the United States. Already, Musk was the dominant Western player in space. SpaceX launches national security satellites and NASA astronauts and operates a megaconstellation. He controls the machines that provide essential space services to NASA and the US military. And now, thanks to his gamble on backing Trump, Musk has strong-armed himself into Trump's inner circle.</p>
<p>Although he may not have a cabinet-appointed position, Musk will have a broad portfolio in the new administration for as long as his relations with Trump remain positive. This gives Musk extraordinary power over a number of areas, including spaceflight. Already this week, he has been soliciting ideas and input from colleagues. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-benefits.html">New York Times reported</a> that Musk has advised Trump to hire key employees from SpaceX into his administration, including at the Department of Defense. This reflects the huge conflict of interest that Musk will face when it comes to space policy. His actions could significantly benefit SpaceX, of which he is the majority owner and has the final say in major decisions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/space-policy-is-about-to-get-pretty-wild-yall/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>People have long been fascinated by the haunting plaster casts of the bodies of people who died in Pompeii when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. Archaeologists have presented certain popular narratives about who these people might have been and how they might have been related. But ancient DNA analysis has revealed that those preferred narratives were not entirely accurate and may reflect certain cultural biases, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01361-7">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. The results also corroborate prior research suggesting that the people of ancient Pompeii were the descendants of immigrants from the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/archaeologists-find-evidence-of-neurons-in-glassy-brain-of-vesuvius-victim/">previously reported</a>, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius released thermal energy roughly equivalent to 100,000 times the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, spewing molten rock, pumice, and hot ash over the cities of Pompeii and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum">Herculaneum</a> in particular. The vast majority of people in Pompeii and Herculaneum—the cities hardest hit—perished from asphyxiation, choking on the thick clouds of noxious gas and ash. But at least some of the Vesuvian victims <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/extreme-heat-of-vesuvius-eruption-vaporized-body-fluids-exploded-skulls/">probably died instantaneously</a> from the intense heat of fast-moving lava flows, with temperatures high enough to boil brains and explode skulls.</p>
<p>In the first phase, immediately after the eruption, a long column of ash and pumice blanketed the surrounding towns, most notably Pompeii and Herculaneum. By late night or early morning, pyroclastic flows (fast-moving hot ash, lava fragments, and gases) swept through and obliterated what remained, leaving the bodies of the victims frozen in seeming suspended action.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/dna-shows-pompeiis-dead-arent-who-we-thought-they-were/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The lawsuit was filed by Ethan Zuckerman, a professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst. He feared that Meta might sue to block his tool, Unfollow Everything 2.0, because Meta threatened to sue to block the original tool when it was released by another developer. In May, Zuckerman told Ars that he was "suing Facebook to make it better" and planned to use Section 230's shield to do it.</p>
<p>Zuckerman's novel legal theory argued that Congress always intended for Section 230 to protect third-party tools designed to empower users to take control over potentially toxic online environments. In his complaint, Zuckerman tried to convince a US district court in California that:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/meta-beats-suit-over-tool-that-lets-facebook-users-unfollow-everything/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwood_Edwards">Elwood Edwards</a>, the voice behind the online service America Online's iconic "You've got mail" greeting, died at age 74, one day before his 75th birthday, according to Cleveland's <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/life/people/elwood-edwards-wkyc-employee-voice-aol-youve-got-mail-greeting-dies-74/95-940b6ed4-b90b-4c4c-b0d5-6c57fddb6546">WKYC Studios</a>, where he worked for many years. The greeting became a cultural touchstone in the 1990s and early 2000s in the early Internet era; it was heard by hundreds of millions of users when they logged in to the service and new email was waiting for them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110712181649/https://whosevoice.org/home/2010/8/12/aols-got-elwood.html">story</a> of Edwards' famous recording began in 1989 when Steve Case, CEO of Quantum Computer Services (which later became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">America Online</a>—or AOL for short), wanted to add a human voice to the company's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Link">Quantum Link</a> online service. Karen Edwards, who worked as a customer service representative, heard Case discussing the plan and suggested her husband Elwood, a professional broadcaster.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ask a few random people about Apple Intelligence and you’ll probably get quite different responses.</p>
<p>One might be excited about the new features. Another could opine that no one asked for this and the company is throwing away its reputation with creatives and artists to chase a fad. Another still might tell you that regardless of the potential value, Apple is simply too late to the game to make a mark.</p>
<p>The release of Apple’s first Apple Intelligence-branded AI tools in iOS 18.1 last week makes all those perspectives understandable.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/despite-unforced-errors-the-future-of-apple-intelligence-could-be-bright/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, told Chinese customers it would no longer manufacture AI chips at advanced process nodes of 7 nanometers or smaller as of this coming Monday, three people familiar with the matter said.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Among the decades-old Windows apps to get renewed attention from Microsoft during the Windows 11 era is Notepad, the basic built-in text editor that was much the same in early 2021 as it had been in the '90 and 2000s. Since then, it has gotten a raft of updates, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/the-latest-app-to-get-a-windows-11-redesign-the-humble-notepad/">a visual redesign</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/windows-notepads-midlife-renaissance-continues-with-spellcheck-and-autocorrect/">spellcheck and autocorrect</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/major-windows-11-update-adds-notepad-tabs-iphone-pairing-and-a-dash-of-ai/">window tabs</a>.</p>
<p>Given Microsoft's continuing obsession with all things AI, it's perhaps not surprising that <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/06/new-ai-experiences-for-paint-and-notepad-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">the app's latest update</a> (currently in preview for Canary and Dev Windows Insiders) is a generative AI feature called Rewrite that promises to adjust the length, tone, and phrasing of highlighted sentences or paragraphs using generative AI. Users will be offered three rewritten options based on what they've highlighted, and they can select the one they like best or tell the app to try again.</p>
<p>Rewrite appears to be based on the same technology as the Copilot assistant, since it uses cloud-side processing (rather than your local CPU, GPU, or NPU) and requires Microsoft account sign-in to work. The initial preview is available to users in the US, France, the UK, Canada, Italy, and Germany.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/notepad-exe-now-an-actively-maintained-app-has-gotten-its-inevitable-ai-update/">Read full article</a></p>

We received more submissions from our readers on Australia's approval of a launch permit for Gilmour Space than we've received on any other news story in recent memory. Thank you for your submissions as global rocket activity continues apace. We'll cover Gilmour in more detail as they get closer to launch. There will be no Rocket Report next week as Eric and I join the rest of the Ars team for our 2024 Technicon in New York.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>Gilmour Space has a permit to fly. </b>Gilmour Space Technologies has been granted a permit to launch its 82-foot-tall (25-meter) orbital rocket from a spaceport in Queensland, Australia. The space company, founded in 2012, had initially planned to lift off in March but was unable to do so without approval from the Australian Space Agency, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-04/gilmour-space-technologies-orbital-rocket-launch-permit-granted/104503690">the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports</a>. The government approved Gilmour's launch permit Monday, although the company is still weeks away from flying its three-stage Eris rocket.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/rocket-report-australia-says-yes-to-the-launch-russia-delivers-for-iran/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/the-spectacular-downfall-of-a-common-useless-cold-medicine/">In a long-sought move</a>, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday formally began the process of abandoning oral doses of a common over-the-counter decongestant, which the agency concluded last year is not effective at relieving stuffy noses.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FDA issued <a href="https://dps.fda.gov/omuf/ordersearch/order_otc000036">a proposed order</a> to remove oral phenylephrine from the list of drugs that drugmakers can include in over-the-counter products—also known as the OTC monograph. Once removed, drug makers will no longer be able to include phenylephrine in products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion.</p>
<p>"It is the FDA’s role to ensure that drugs are safe and effective," Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. "Based on our review of available data and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/fda-proposes-ditching-common-decongestant-for-being-completely-useless/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The operation, which ran from the beginning of April through the end of August, resulted in the arrest of 41 people and the takedown of 1,037 servers and other infrastructure running on 22,000 IP addresses. Synergia II, as the operation was named, was the work of multiple law enforcement agencies across the world, as well as three cybersecurity organizations.</p>

<p>“The global nature of cybercrime requires a global response which is evident by the support member countries provided to Operation Synergia II,” Neal Jetton, director of the Cybercrime Directorate at Interpol, <a href="https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2024/INTERPOL-cyber-operation-takes-down-22-000-malicious-IP-addresses">said</a>. “Together, we’ve not only dismantled malicious infrastructure but also prevented hundreds of thousands of potential victims from falling prey to cybercrime. Interpol is proud to bring together a diverse team of member countries to fight this ever-evolving threat and make our world a safer place.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/law-enforcement-operation-takes-down-22000-malicious-ip-addresses-worldwide/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Confirming previous <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/amazon-is-nearing-a-deal-to-make-a-mass-effect-tv-series/">rumors</a>, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/">Variety</a> reports that Amazon will be moving ahead with producing a TV series based on the popular Mass Effect video game franchise. The writing and production staff involved might not inspire confidence from fans, though.</p>
<p>The series' writer and executive producer is slated to be Daniel Casey, who until now was best known as the primary screenwriter on <em>F9: The Fast Saga</em>, one of the late sequels in the Fast and the Furious franchise. He was also part of a team of writers behind the relatively little-known 2018 science fiction film <em>Kin</em>.</p>
<p>Karim Zreik will also produce, and his background is a little more encouraging; his main claim to fame is in the short-lived Marvel Television unit, which produced relatively well-received series like <em>Daredevil</em> and <em>Jessica Jones</em> for Netflix before Disney+ launched with its Marvel Cinematic Universe shows.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-is-actually-going-to-be-made/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Subscribing to the Max streaming service is expected to become more costly in 2025. That could mean indirectly, like through another streaming password crackdown, or directly, like through increases to monthly and/or annual subscription prices.</p>
<h2>Password crackdowns as a “form of price rises”</h2>
<p>During the earnings call for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for its fiscal Q3 2024, which ended on September 30, WBD signaled that it's gearing up to roll out its next strategy for growing streaming revenue—charging subscribers extra for sharing passwords—over the next few months. This will start with "very soft messaging" toward Max users before the crackdown intensifies in 2025 and 2026, WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734364-warner-bros-discovery-inc-wbd-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript">said</a>.</p>
<p>Wiedenfels admitted that on their own, password crackdowns are “a form of price rises.” <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/password-crackdown-leads-to-more-income-for-netflix/">Netflix</a> kicked off this form of price hike in the US in May 2023, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/hulu-disney-password-crackdown-kills-account-sharing-on-march-14/">other streaming services</a> have followed. That means Max is behind some rivals when it comes to implementing this restriction. Further, Max has been discussing its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/max-confirms-2024-password-crackdown-explores-adding-transactional-ads/">password crackdown since March</a>, so subscribers could take some comfort in not seeing the restrictions launch sooner.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/11/why-you-can-expect-higher-prices-more-ads-from-max-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Republican who is likely to lead the Federal Communications Commission under President-elect Donald Trump detailed how he would run the agency when he wrote a chapter for the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025. Carr, a longtime opponent of net neutrality rules and other broadband regulations, has also made his views clear numerous times when opposing rulemakings initiated by the current Democratic majority.</p>
<p>If Trump makes Carr the next FCC chairman after his inauguration, the FCC is likely to ditch consumer protection initiatives, like a recently announced inquiry into data caps, and attempt to regulate Big Tech companies while reducing regulation of Internet service providers. That could include forcing Big Tech companies to pay into a fund that subsidizes ISPs' broadband network construction.</p>
<p>A Carr-led FCC could also try to punish news organizations that are perceived to be anti-Trump. Just before the election, Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1852887210330341693">alleged</a> that NBC putting Kamala Harris on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> was "a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule," and that the FCC should <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-rips-nbc-over-harris-last-minute-snl-appearance-plainly-designed-evade-rules">consider issuing penalties</a>. Despite Carr's claim, NBC did provide equal time to the Trump campaign.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trumps-likely-fcc-chair-wrote-project-2025-chapter-on-how-hed-run-the-agency/">Read full article</a></p>
