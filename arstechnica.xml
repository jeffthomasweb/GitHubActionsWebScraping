                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX scored its 500th landing of a Falcon 9 first stage booster on an otherwise routine flight earlier this month, sending 28 Starlink communications satellites into orbit. Barring any unforeseen problems, SpaceX will mark the 500th re-flight of a Falcon first stage later this year.</p>
<p>A handful of other US companies, including Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Relativity Space, and Stoke Space, are on the way to replicating or building on SpaceX's achievements in recycling rocket parts. These launch providers are racing a medley of Chinese rocket builders to become the second company to land and reuse a first stage booster.</p>
<p>But it will be many years—perhaps a decade or longer—until anyone else matches the kinds of numbers SpaceX is racking up in the realm of reusable rockets. SpaceX's dominance in this field is one of the most important advantages the United States has over China as competition between the two nations extends into space, US Space Force officials said Monday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/us-intel-officials-cite-reusable-launch-as-difference-maker-with-china/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2024, the US Supreme Court unanimously <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-842_6kg7.pdf">ruled to defend</a> a pretty obvious idea about free speech: viz., that the government cannot punish people or companies simply for saying things that government officials dislike or disagree with. Being a media organization, this principle is of fundamental importance to Ars Technica.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nearly one year on, the government is routinely trying to censor voices it doesn't like. The recent blow-up surrounding late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel is just one of the most obvious examples of the new censorship regime. But the case also shows that, even where courts do not act, the public can still successfully push for change.</p>
<h2>Disfavored speech</h2>
<p>Here's how Justice Sonia Sotomayor put the basic free speech principle last year:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/kimmel-censorship-fiasco-shows-that-protests-still-matter-and-can-still-work/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The space agency on Monday introduced the four men and six women <a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-092225a-nasa-astronaut-candidate-class-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who comprise its 2025 trainee class</a> during a ceremony held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Following two years of basic training, the new candidates will be eligible for mission assignments in low-Earth orbit and on the Moon, as NASA's Artemis program works toward sending the first humans to Mars.</p>
<p>"We picked the best and the brightest, the most skilled, the best looking, the best personalities to take these 10 spots," said Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator and secretary of transportation. "You are America's best and brightest, and we're going to need America's best and brightest because we have a bold exploration plans for the future."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/nasa-names-24th-astronaut-class-including-prior-spacex-crew-member/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">After this story published, President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-trump-kennedy-autism-initiatives-leucovorin-tylenol-research-2025.html">an announcement</a>—in line with earlier reporting—that there is a "potential association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes," specifically autism. The Food and Drug Administration will work to update the drug's safety label and notify physicians of the concerns. At the same time, the administration also touted leucovorin (folinic acid) as a potential treatment for autism. Below is the original story, published at 2:47 pm ET today.</aside>
<p>Health Secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reportedly poised to announce that use of Tylenol (aka acetaminophen, paracetamol) during pregnancy is linked to autism—an unproven assertion that has sent Kennedy's anti-vaccine allies into a rage.</p>
<p>"We didn’t wait 20 years for Bobby to finally speak and then get served Tylenol as an answer," anti-vaccine group Georgia Coalition for Vaccine Choice <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1089730613375080&amp;set=a.502614605420020">wrote in an unhinged Facebook post</a> on Monday morning. "If that's all we hear - is that the end? Not thimerosal. Not aluminum. Not MMR. Not Hep B. Not the insane schedule pushed after pharma got liability protection. Are we supposed to just forget?"</p>
<p>Children's Health Defense (CHD)—the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy—even got in on the backlash, retweeting a post on Monday about parents who falsely blame vaccines for their children's neurological condition, with the statement: "THIS WAS NOT CAUSED BY TYLENOL."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/anti-vaccine-groups-melt-down-over-reports-rfk-jr-to-link-autism-to-tylenol/">Read full article</a></p>

These teardowns got pretty routine for a while, as Apple settled into a fairly consistent design for iPhones, but the new design of the iPhone Air offered an opportunity for compelling observations.</p>
<p>Many of the important components—including the entire logic board—are clustered up at the top of the phone, while the majority of its middle and body house a battery.</p>
<p>iFixit found that this battery is identical to the one included in Apple's iPhone Air MagSafe battery pack—you can even swap the batteries between the pack and the phone with no problems.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/iphone-air-teardown-reveals-a-phone-thats-more-durable-repairable-than-expected/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Jimmy Kimmel is going back on the air. ABC owner Disney today issued a statement saying that <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em> will return on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country," Disney said in a statement today. "It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday."</p>
<p>Disney suspended the show after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">threatened the company</a> with license revocations for broadcast stations affiliated with ABC. After caving to the FCC, Disney faced a public backlash, and many users said they were protesting by canceling subscriptions to Disney-owned services.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/disney-abc-reinstate-jimmy-kimmel-amid-uproar-over-government-censorship/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is back in court, hoping to avoid a painful breakup of its advertising business. US District Judge Leonie Brinkema has already ruled that Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/google-loses-ad-tech-monopoly-trial-faces-additional-breakups/">operated an illegal monopoly</a> in digital advertising, and now it's time to learn the consequences of that behavior. Google's had mixed luck with antitrust rulings lately, but it's not a great sign that Google has so many legal woes that it can be hard to keep them all straight.</p>
<p>The case that just got underway is the remedy phase of the AdTech trial, in which the DOJ secured a ruling against Google several months ago. The remedy phase of the search trial wrapped up recently, which ended with Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-rules/">holding on to Chrome</a> but pledging an appeal to overturn the verdict. There's also the Google Play antitrust case, which was brought by Epic Games. In this case, Google has already lost its appeal, putting some major app changes on the table as it plans yet another appeal.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Google are squaring off in Virginia federal court for the next two weeks or so, and there are no surprises in opening arguments. The government says the only way to deal with a monopolist like this is to break it up, but Google says it has already made numerous changes, and there's no way to excise it from online advertising without breaking the market.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-back-in-court-as-it-tries-to-avoid-advertising-business-breakup/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) slammed Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for policing speech after the FCC chair <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">pressured ABC</a> into suspending Jimmy Kimmel.</p>
<p>Carr's statement that ABC must take action against Kimmel was "absolutely inappropriate," Paul said on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/rand-paul-says-fcc-was-wrong-to-weigh-in-on-jimmy-kimmel-s-suspension-248025157634">NBC's <em>Meet the Press</em></a> yesterday. "Brendan Carr has got no business weighing in on this."</p>
<p>Paul went on to say that employees can be fired for "despicable comments" and that broadcast station owners like Sinclair have the right to object to content distributed by networks. But he said "the FCC should have nothing to do with it... you can be fired for not being popular, this is television for goodness sakes. You have to sell sponsorships, you have to sell commercials, and if you're losing money, you can be fired. But the government's got no business in it and the FCC was wrong to weigh in, and I'll fight any attempt by the government to get involved with speech."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/rand-paul-fcc-chair-had-no-business-intervening-in-abc-kimmel-controversy/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, OpenAI and Nvidia jointly <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/">announced</a> a letter of intent for a strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI's AI infrastructure, with Nvidia planning to invest up to $100 billion as the systems roll out. The companies said the first gigawatt of Nvidia systems will come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-rubin-ultra-and-feynman-ai-chips-for-2027-and-2028/">Vera Rubin</a> platform.</p>
<p>"Everything starts with compute," said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in the announcement. "Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale."</p>
<p>The 10-gigawatt project represents an astoundingly ambitious and as-yet-unproven scale for AI infrastructure. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html">told</a> CNBC that the planned 10 gigawatts equals the power consumption of between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units, which matches the company's total GPU shipments for this year and doubles last year's volume. "This is a giant project," Huang said in an interview alongside Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-and-nvidias-100b-ai-plan-will-require-power-equal-to-10-nuclear-reactors/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Generative AI models are far from perfect, but that hasn't stopped businesses and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/white-house-unveils-sweeping-plan-to-win-global-ai-race-through-deregulation/">even governments</a> from giving these robots important tasks. But what happens when AI goes bad? Researchers at Google DeepMind spend a lot of time thinking about how generative AI systems can become threats, detailing it all in the company's Frontier Safety Framework. DeepMind recently <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/strengthening-our-frontier-safety-framework/">released version 3.0</a> of the framework to explore more ways AI could go off the rails, including the possibility that models could ignore user attempts to shut them down.</p>
<p>DeepMind's safety framework is based on so-called "critical capability levels" (CCLs). These are essentially risk assessment rubrics that aim to measure an AI model's capabilities and define the point at which its behavior becomes dangerous in areas like cybersecurity or biosciences. The document also details the ways developers can address the CCLs DeepMind identifies in their own models.</p>
<p>Google and other firms that have delved deeply into generative AI employ a number of techniques to prevent AI from acting maliciously. Although calling an AI "malicious" lends it intentionality that fancy estimation architectures don't have. What we're talking about here is the possibility of misuse or malfunction that is baked into the nature of generative AI systems.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/deepmind-ai-safety-report-explores-the-perils-of-misaligned-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ads prominently displayed on search engines are impersonating a wide range of online services in a bid to infect Macs with a potent credential stealer, security companies have warned. The latest reported target is users of the LastPass password manager.</p>
<p>Late <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/attack-targeting-macs-via-github-pages">last week</a>, LastPass said it detected a widespread campaign that used search engine optimization to display ads for LastPass macOS apps at the top of search results returned by search engines, including Google and Bing. The ads led to one of two fraudulent GitHub sites targeting LastPass, both of which have been taken down. The pages provided links promising to install LastPass on MacBooks. In fact, they installed a macOS credential stealer known as Atomic Stealer, or alternatively, Amos Stealer.</p>
<h2>Dozens targeted</h2>
<p>“We are writing this blog post to raise awareness of the campaign and protect our customers while we continue to actively pursue takedown and disruption efforts, and to also share indicators of compromise (IoCs) to help other security teams detect cyber threats,” LastPass said in the post.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/potent-atomic-credential-stealer-can-bypass-gatekeeper/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>These days, Austin, Texas feels like ground zero for autonomous cars. Although California was the early test bed for autonomous driving tech, the much more permissive regulatory environment in the Lone Star State, plus lots of wide, straight roads and mostly good weather, ticked enough boxes to see companies like Waymo and Zoox set up shop there. And earlier this summer, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/tesla-launches-robotaxi-service-in-austin/">Tesla added itself to the list</a>. Except things haven't exactly gone well.</p>
<p>According to Tesla's crash reports, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/09/18/tesla-robotaxi-reports-3-crashes-in-austin-on-july-1-details-hidden/">spotted by Brad Templeton over at Forbes</a>, the automaker experienced not one but three crashes, all apparently on its first day of testing on July 1. And as we learned from Tesla CEO Elon Musk later in July during the (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-q2-2025-sell-fewer-cars-and-carbon-credits-make-less-money/">not-great</a>) quarterly earnings call, by that time, Tesla had logged a mere 7,000 miles in testing.</p>
<p>By contrast, Waymo's crash rate is more than two orders of magnitude lower, with 60 crashes logged <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/after-50-million-miles-waymos-crash-a-lot-less-than-human-drivers/">over 50 million miles of driving</a>. (Waymo has now logged more than 96 million miles.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/teslas-robotaxi-test-three-crashes-in-only-7000-miles/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Disney CEO Bob Iger has been under fire for several days now for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">pulling <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em> off the air</a> "indefinitely," with Disney+'s cancellation page <a href="https://creators.yahoo.com/lifestyle/story/disney-cancellation-page-crashes-as-customers-rush-to-quit-after-kimmel-suspension-033512277.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM4nSZxzW_4orDBZHrNHRhq2f5mZiLE1Dp5rVSpNrOS43qusCX-sYqbQGb4S4IVvrDf2A9rHn0BsPw0r0JgeEcxsllexOPZ6lM1NC_v__kzuv-JPlI6EU9tpHMCcs2zwQUfvXhPA7FnpbiRTf8rLdrj5WZwjvDZkJ9A0Kh5T-FrK">actually crashing</a> a couple of times from all the traffic as people rushed to make their displeasure known. So what better time for the studio to release the first teaser trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_and_Grogu"><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em></a>, a feature film spinoff from its megahit Star Wars series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/reunited-din-djarin-and-grogu-face-new-battles-in-the-mandalorian-s3-trailer/"><em>The</em> <em>Mandalorian</em></a>? Grogu and Mando, together again on an exciting space adventure, will certainly be a crowd-pleaser.</p>
<p>Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) won viewers' hearts from the moment he first appeared onscreen in the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, and the relationship between the little green creature and his father-figure bounty hunter has only gotten stronger. With the 2023 Hollywood strikes delaying production on S4 of the series, director Jon Favreau got the green light to make this spinoff film.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Almost a decade old now, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix is part of the modern breed of Formula 1 street circuits. Set on the shores of the Caspian Sea, the anti-clockwise layout manages to combine some of F1's highest top speeds with a rather fiddly section through the old city, all of it lined with walls and barriers to punish mistakes. It's a low-downforce track, with mostly slow corners, similar to Montreal and Monza.</p>
<p>Despite the questionable record of the hosting country—something all too many F1 races can also offer, including the three held in the US—I have a soft spot for watching Baku, with its interesting mix of old and new architecture, and it usually puts on a good race. I particularly love the helicopter and drone shots that follow the action with a God's eye view, giving you a glimpse behind the building facades and into this city by the sea.</p>
<p>Friday's practice sessions gave the Ferrari-supporting <em>Tifosi</em> something to look forward to, with Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc topping the times for FP2. Hamilton, who has looked at sea this year after his switch to Ferrari, was made the bubbliest we've seen him all season when being interviewed on Friday, and his teammate Leclerc has four pole positions to his name at Baku, further stoking the hope.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/f1-in-azerbaijan-this-sport-is-my-red-flag/">Read full article</a></p>

Over that same period, the world’s largest fossil fuel producers have expanded their planned output for the future, setting humanity on an even more dangerous path into a warmer climate.</p>
<p>Governments now expect to produce more than twice as much coal, oil and gas in 2030 as would be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to a <a href="https://productiongap.org/2025report/">report released Monday</a>. That level is slightly higher than what it was in 2023, the last time the biennial Production Gap report was published.</p>
<p>The increase is driven by a slower projected phaseout of coal and higher outlook for gas production by some of the top producers, including China and the United States.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/what-climate-targets-top-fossil-fuel-producing-nations-keep-boosting-output/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin met each other at a graduate student orientation at Stanford in 1996. Both were studying for their PhDs in computer science, and both were interested in analyzing large sets of data. Because the web was growing so rapidly, they decided to start a project to improve the way people found information on the Internet.</p>
<p>They weren’t the first to try this. Hand-curated sites like Yahoo had already given way to more algorithmic search engines like AltaVista and Excite, which both started in 1995. These sites attempted to find relevant webpages by analyzing the words on every page.</p>
<p>Page and Brin’s technique was different. Their “BackRub” software created a <a href="https://internet-map.net/">map</a> of all the links that pages had to each other. Pages on a given subject that had many incoming links from other sites were given a higher ranking for that keyword. Higher-ranked pages could then contribute a larger score to any pages they linked to. In a sense, this was a like a crowdsourcing of search: When people put “This is a good place to read about alligators” on a popular site and added a link to a page about alligators, it did a better job of determining that page’s relevance than simply counting the number of times the word appeared on a page.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/a-history-of-the-internet-part-3-the-rise-of-the-user/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As businesses around the world have shifted their digital infrastructure over the last decade from self-hosted servers to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/secret-hunting-bill-demirkapi/">cloud</a>, they’ve benefitted from the standardized, built-in security features of major cloud providers like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-secure-future-initiative/">Microsoft</a>. But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-cloud-attack-china-hackers/">disastrous consequences</a> at a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a <a href="https://dirkjanm.io/obtaining-global-admin-in-every-entra-id-tenant-with-actor-tokens/">pair of vulnerabilities</a> in Microsoft Azure’s identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts.</p>
<p>Known as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer’s user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to <a href="https://i.blackhat.com/BH-USA-25/Presentations/US-25-Mollema-Advanced-AD-to-Entra-ID-lateral-movement-techniques-Wednesday.pdf">present</a> at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>“I was just staring at my screen. I was like, ‘No, this shouldn’t really happen,’” says Mollema, who runs the Dutch cybersecurity company Outsider Security and specializes in cloud security. “It was quite bad. As bad as it gets, I would say.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/microsofts-entra-id-vulnerabilities-could-have-been-catastrophic/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Two things about the<a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-vado-sl-2-60-carbon/p/4206186?color=5356065-4206186"> Specialized Turbo Vado SL 2 6.0 Carbon</a> are hard to fathom: One is how light and lithe it feels as an e-bike, even with the battery off; the other is how hard it is to recite its full name when other riders ask you about the bike at stop lights and pit stops.</p>
<p>I’ve tested about a half-dozen e-bikes for Ars Technica. Each test period has included a ride with my regular group for about 30 miles. Nobody else in my group rides electric, so I try riding with no assist, at least part of the way. Usually I give up after a mile or two, realizing that most e-bikes are not designed for unpowered rides.</p>
<p>On the Carbon (as I’ll call it for the rest of this review), you can ride without power. At 35 pounds, it’s no gram-conscious road bike, but it feels lighter than that number implies. My daily ride is an aluminum-framed model with an internal geared hub that weighs about the same, so I might be a soft target. But it’s a remarkable thing to ride an e-bike that starts with a good unpowered ride and lets you build on that with power.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/youll-enjoy-the-specialized-turbo-vado-sl-2-6-0-carbon-even-without-assist/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Some time soon, perhaps next year, SpaceX will attempt to fly one of its enormous Starship rockets from low-Earth orbit back to its launch pad in South Texas. A successful return and catch at the launch tower would demonstrate a key capability underpinning Elon Musk's hopes for a fully reusable rocket.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, SpaceX must overcome the tyranny of geography. Unlike launches over the open ocean from Cape Canaveral, Florida, rockets departing from South Texas must follow a narrow corridor to steer clear of downrange land masses.</p>
<p>All 10 of the rocket's test flights so far have launched from Texas toward splashdowns in the Indian or Pacific Oceans. On these trajectories, the rocket never completes a full orbit around the Earth, but instead flies an arcing path through space before gravity pulls it back into the atmosphere.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/starship-will-soon-fly-over-towns-and-cities-but-will-dodge-the-biggest-ones/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The White House proposed a budget earlier this year with significant cuts for a number of agencies, including NASA. In the months since then, through the appropriations process, both the House and Senate have proposed their own budget templates. However, Congress has not passed a final budget, and the new fiscal year begins on October 1.</p>
<p>As a result of political wrangling over whether to pass a "continuing resolution" to fund the government before a final budget is passed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/19/us/trump-news?unlocked_article_code=1.nE8.9weM.l2REs_kmW7GE&amp;smid=url-share">a government shutdown</a> appears to be increasingly likely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/amid-budget-uncertainty-nasa-gets-some-good-news-use-house-funding-levels/">Read full article</a></p>
