                            <![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization on Friday released a formal statement <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-02-2026-statement-on-the-planned-hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccine-trial-in-guinea-bissau">blasting a US-funded vaccine trial as "unethical,"</a> because it would withhold an established, safe, and potentially lifesaving vaccine against hepatitis B from some newborns in Guinea-Bissau, Africa.</p>
<p>"In its current form, and based on publicly available information, the trial is inconsistent with established ethical and scientific principles," the WHO concluded, after providing a bullet-point list of reasons the trial was harmful and low quality.</p>
<p>The trial has drawn widespread condemnation from health experts since <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/18/2025-23245/notice-of-award-of-a-single-source-unsolicited-grant-to-fund-university-of-southern-denmark-sdu">notice of the US funding</a> was published in the Federal Register in December. The notice revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—had awarded $1.6 million to Danish researchers for their non-competitive, unsolicited proposal to conduct the trial.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/who-slams-us-funded-newborn-vaccine-trial-as-unethical/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon this week imposed a new roadblock for people who want to pay off device installment plans early in order to get their phones unlocked. The latest version of Verizon's <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy">device unlocking policy</a> for postpaid customers imposes a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off their device installment plan online or in the Verizon app.</p>
<p>Payments made over the phone also trigger a 35-day waiting period, as do payments made at Verizon Authorized Retailers. Getting an immediate unlock apparently requires paying off the device plan at a Verizon corporate store.</p>
<p>Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on another network, letting customers switch from one carrier to another. Previously, the 35-day waiting period for unlocks was only applied when a customer paid off the plan with a Verizon gift card.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-makes-customers-wait-35-days-to-unlock-fully-paid-off-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amazon and Flock Safety have ended a partnership that would've given law enforcement access to a vast web of Ring cameras.</p>
<p>The decision came after Amazon faced substantial backlash for airing a Super Bowl ad that was meant to be warm and fuzzy, but instead came across as disturbing and dystopian.</p>
<p>The ad begins with a young girl surprised to receive a puppy as a gift. It then warns that 10 million dogs go missing annually. Showing a series of lost dog posters, the ad introduces a new "Search Party" feature for Ring cameras that promises to revolutionize how neighbors come together to locate missing pets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/after-creepy-super-bowl-ad-sparks-outrage-ring-abandons-flock-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed some reporting a few days ago that Android 17 was rolling out in beta form, but that didn't happen. For reasons Google still has not explained, the release was canceled. Two days later, <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2026/02/the-first-beta-of-android-17.html">Android 17 is here for real</a>. If you've got a recent Pixel device, you can try the latest version today, but don't expect big changes just yet—there's still a long way to go before release.</p>
<p>Google will probably have more to say about feature changes for Android 17 in the coming months, but this first wide release is aimed mostly at testing system and API changes. One of the biggest changes in the beta is expanded support for adaptive apps, which ensures that apps can scale to different screen sizes. That makes apps more usable on large-screen devices like tablets and foldables with multiple displays.</p>
<p>We first saw this last year in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-review-post-hype/">Android 16</a>, but developers were permitted to opt out of support. The new adaptive app roadmap puts an end to that. Any app that targets Android 17 (API level 37) must support resizing and windowed multitasking. Apps can continue to target the older API for the time being, but Google filters apps from the Play Store if they don't keep up.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/the-first-android-17-beta-is-now-available-on-pixel-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Longtime fans of the cult TV show <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> know that the series’ one constant is change (well, that and bad movies).</p>
<p>The show’s cast and crew were in a near-constant state of flux, a byproduct of the show's existence as a perennial bubble show produced in the Twin Cities rather than a TV-and-comedy hub like New York or LA. It was rare, especially toward the middle of its 10-season original run on national TV, for the performers in front of the camera (and the writers’ room, since they were all the same people) to stay the same for more than a season or two.</p>
<p>Series creator Joel Hodgson embraced that spirit of change for the show's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/netflix-will-stream-14-episodes-of-mystery-science-theater-3000-revival/">Kickstarter-funded, Netflix-aired revival</a> in the mid-2010s, featuring a brand-new cast and mostly new writers. And that change only accelerated in the show's brief post-Netflix "Gizmoplex" era, which featured a revolving cast of performers that could change from episode to episode. Hodgson leaned into the idea that as long as there were silhouettes and puppets talking in front of a bad movie, it didn't matter much <em>who</em> was doing the talking.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/1-8-million-mst3k-kickstarter-brings-in-almost-everyone-from-the-old-show/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of unanswered questions about the origin of life on Earth. But the research community has largely reached consensus that one of the key steps was the emergence of an RNA molecule that could replicate itself. RNA, like its more famous relative DNA, can carry genetic information. But it can also fold up into three-dimensional structures that act as catalysts. These two features have led to the suggestion that early life was protein-free, with RNA handling both heredity and catalyzing a simple metabolism.</p>
<p>For this to work, one of the reactions that the early RNAs would need to catalyze is the copying of RNA molecules, without which any sort of heritability would be impossible. While we've found a number of catalytic RNAs that can copy other molecules, none have been able to perform a key reaction: making a copy of themselves. Now, however, a team has found an incredibly short piece of RNA—just 45 bases long—that can make a copy of itself.</p>
<h2>Finding an RNA polymerase</h2>
<p>We have identified a large number of catalytic RNAs (generically called ribozymes, for RNA-based enzymes), and some of them can catalyze reactions involving other RNAs. A handful of these are ligases, which link together two RNA molecules. In some cases, they need these molecules to be held together by a third RNA molecule that base pairs with both of them. We've only identified a few that can act as polymerases, which add RNA bases to a growing molecule, one at a time, with each new addition base pairing with a template molecule.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/researchers-find-small-rnas-that-can-make-copies-of-themselves/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Autonomous vehicles have a lot of potential. As long as you program them right, they won't speed, won't break traffic laws, and won't get drunk, high, abusive, or violent. And the technology has been getting much more capable, even as some of the hype has died down, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/seeing-no-road-to-profit-gm-shutters-cruise/">taking some</a> of the related companies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/self-driving-startups-are-becoming-an-endangered-species/">with it</a>. Waymo still easily leads the field and is already operating commercially in six cities across America, with a dozen more (plus London) coming soon. Waymos can even drop you off and pick you up at the airport in Phoenix and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Soon, Waymo will begin deploying its sixth-generation Waymo Driver, using upfitted Zeekr Ojai minivans, adding to the Jaguar I-Paces that have become so common on San Francisco streets and to its fleet of Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric vehicles. It has upgraded the cameras, lidar, and radar, meaning the cars can better sense their environments at night and in inclement weather. There are even microphones that can pick up sounds like sirens to better inform the robotaxi of the direction the emergency vehicle(s) are coming from.</p>
<p>But even with all these advances since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/05/googles-quirky-self-driving-bubble-car-hits-public-roads-this-summer/">pod-like two-seater</a> that predates even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/google-spins-out-self-driving-car-unit-now-called-waymo/">the Waymo name</a>, there are still a few things that remain beyond a robotaxi's capabilities. Like closing a door a passenger left open on their way out. All the sophisticated sensors and high-powered computer processing in the world are useless if the car can't move until the door closes and there's no one there to give it a hand.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/what-if-riders-dont-close-a-robotaxi-door-after-a-ride-try-doordash/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, does not often post on the social media site owned by his rival Elon Musk. But on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/2020861883524247807" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bezos did</a>, sharing a black-and-white image of a turtle emerging from the shadows on X.</p>
<p>The photo, which included no text, may have stumped some observers. Yet for anyone familiar with Bezos' privately owned space company, Blue Origin, the message was clear. The company’s coat of arms prominently features two turtles, a reference to one of Aesop’s Fables, "The Tortoise and the Hare," in which the slow and steady tortoise wins the race over a quicker but overconfident hare.</p>
<p>Bezos' foray into social media turtle trolling came about 12 hours after Musk made major waves in the space community <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/has-elon-musk-given-up-on-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by announcing</a> that SpaceX was pivoting toward the Moon, rather than Mars, as a near-term destination. It represented a huge shift in Musk's thinking, as the SpaceX founder has long spoken of building a multi-planetary civilization on Mars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/why-is-bezos-trolling-musk-on-x-with-turtle-pics-because-he-has-a-new-moon-plan/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>So, when I saw RentAHuman, a new site where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malevolent-ai-agent-openclaw-clawdbot/">AI agents</a> hire humans to perform physical work in the real world on behalf of the virtual bots, I was eager to see how these AI overlords would compare to my past experiences with the gig economy.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.29 of the Rocket Report! We have a stuffed report this week with news from across the launch spectrum. Long-term, probably the most significant development this week was a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket successfully launching and then executing a picture-perfect ocean landing. China is catching up rapidly to the United States when it comes to reusable launch.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Orbex is going away</strong>. The UK-based launch company Orbex has entered insolvency proceedings after a planned takeover by European space logistics startup The Exploration Company fell through, <a href="https://europeanspaceflight.com/orbex-fails-after-planned-purchase-falls-through/">European Spaceflight reports</a>. In a statement, Orbex said the decision came after all "fundraising, merger and acquisition opportunities had all concluded unsuccessfully." For anyone paying attention, this decision should not come as a surprise. A decade into its existence, Orbex had yet to produce demonstrable, ready-for-flight hardware.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/rocket-report-say-cheerio-to-orbex-china-is-getting-good-at-booster-landings/">Read full article</a></p>

Early lawsuits show that platforms have caved, even though experts say they could refuse these demands without a court order.</p>

<p>The Ariane 6 rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center on the northeastern coast of South America at 11:45 am EST (16:45 UTC), quickly soaring into a clear sky at the tropical spaceport on the power of a hydrogen-fueled main engine and four strap-on solid rocket boosters.</p>
<p>This Ariane 6 configuration, called Ariane 64, is the first to use the rocket's full complement of four boosters. Collectively, the rocket generated more than 3.4 million pounds of thrust (15,400 kilonewtons) of thrust as it steered northeast over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the rocket's upper stage released all 32 of Amazon's satellites into an on-target orbit at an altitude of 289 miles (465 kilometers).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/when-amazon-badly-needed-a-ride-europes-ariane-6-rocket-delivered/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/">released</a> its first production AI model to run on non-Nvidia hardware, deploying the new GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark coding model on chips from Cerebras. The model delivers code at more than 1,000 tokens (chunks of data) per second, which is reported to be roughly 15 times faster than its predecessor. To compare, Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 in its new premium-priced fast mode <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/fast-mode">reaches</a> about 2.5 times its standard speed of <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/claude-opus-4-6-adaptive">68.2 tokens per second</a>, although it is a larger and more capable model than Spark.</p>
<p>"Cerebras has been a great engineering partner, and we're excited about adding fast inference as a new platform capability," Sachin Katti, head of compute at OpenAI, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Codex-Spark is a research preview available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month) through the Codex app, command-line interface, and VS Code extension. OpenAI is rolling out API access to select design partners. The model ships with a 128,000-token context window and handles text only at launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openai-sidesteps-nvidia-with-unusually-fast-coding-model-on-plate-sized-chips/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/02/11/moderna-flu-vaccine-application-rejected-by-prasad-overruling-fda-staff/">Stat</a> was first to report, based on unnamed FDA sources, that a team of career scientists at the agency was ready to review the vaccine and that David Kaslow, a top career official who reviews vaccines, even wrote a memo objecting to Prasad’s rejection. The memo reportedly included a detailed explanation of why the review should proceed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/why-the-fda-blocked-modernas-new-flu-shot-84fdaab6">The Wall Street Journal confirmed</a> the report with its own sources, who added that FDA scientists attended an hourlong meeting with Prasad in early January, in which they laid out their objections to Prasad's plans to block the vaccine review. They reportedly told Prasad—a political appointee known for causing turmoil and espousing anti-vaccine rhetoric—that it was the wrong approach.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/trump-official-overruled-fda-scientists-to-reject-modernas-flu-shot/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HgMbkitzhEM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Nicolas Cage has carved out a quirky niche for himself in recent years with such films as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/color-out-of-space-review-nic-cage-lovecraft-match-made-in-rlyeh/"><em>Color Out of Space</em></a> (2019), <em>Pig</em> (2021), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/ars-technicas-favorite-films-in-2022/"><em>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</em></a> (2022), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/film-technica-our-favorite-movies-of-2023/"><em>Dream Scenario</em></a> (2023), and <em>Longlegs</em> (2024), among others. Now he's starring in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Noir"><em>Spider-Noir</em></a>, a new live-action series based on the Marvel Comics character. Cage plays an aging private investigator and disillusioned superhero in 1930s New York. Prime Video released the first teaser in two forms: one in black and white—very Raymond Chandler-esque—and another in color, which the showrunners are calling "True Hue."</p>
<p>Marvel Comics created its "noir" line in 2009, reinterpreting familiar Marvel characters in an alternate universe, usually set during the Great Depression in the US. A version of the Spider-Noir character, voiced by Cage, briefly appeared in the animated masterpieces, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review-more-spider-people-means-a-better-film/"><em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em></a> (2018) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/film-technica-our-favorite-movies-of-2023/"><em>Across the Spider-Verse</em></a> (2023). (He is set to reprise that role in the upcoming <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse</em>.)</p>
<p>Co-showrunner (with Steve Lightfoot) Oren Uziel is a film noir fan, so that Marvel series naturally appealed to him. The live-action series is still set in 1930s New York, but the spidery superhero is not Peter Parker. (Uziel thought the Parker character was too associated with a boyish high school type, which didn't really fit the noir vibe.) So Cage is playing Ben Reilly, a hard-boiled PI with a secret superhero identity, The Spider. Cage has described his portrayal as "70 percent Humphrey Bogart [specifically <em>The Big Sleep</em>] and 30 percent Bugs Bunny," which seems pretty on point for Cage's distinctively flamboyant style.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/spider-noir-teaser-comes-in-colorized-true-hue-and-black-and-white/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Moments after liftoff from Florida's Space Coast early Thursday morning, a shower of sparks emerged in the exhaust plume of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket. Seconds later, the rocket twisted on its axis before recovering and continuing the climb into orbit with a batch of US military satellites.</p>
<p>The sight may have appeared familiar to seasoned rocket watchers. Sixteen months ago, a Vulcan rocket lost one of its booster nozzles shortly after launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The rocket recovered from the malfunction and still reached the mission's planned orbit.</p>
<p>Details of Thursday's booster problem remain unclear. An investigation into the matter is underway, according to ULA, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But the circumstances resemble those of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/ulas-second-vulcan-rocket-lost-part-of-its-booster-and-kept-going/">booster malfunction in October 2024</a>. Closeup video from Thursday's launch shows a fiery plume near the throat of one of the rocket's four solid-fueled boosters, the area where the motor's propellant casing connects to its bell-shaped exhaust nozzle. The throat drives super-hot gas from the burning solid propellant through the nozzle to generate thrust.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/ulas-vulcan-launcher-still-has-a-solid-rocket-booster-problem/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a widely expected move, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us">has announced</a> that it is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-trumps-epa-hopes-to-avoid-greenhouse-gas-regulations/">revoking an analysis of greenhouse gases</a> that laid the foundation for regulating their emissions by cars, power plants, and industrial sources. The analysis, called an endangerment finding, was initially ordered by the US Supreme Court in 2007 and completed during the Obama administration; it has, in theory, served as the basis of all government regulations of carbon dioxide emissions since.</p>
<p>In practice, lawsuits and policy changes between Democratic and Republican administrations have meant it has had little impact. In fact, the first Trump administration left the endangerment finding in place, deciding it was easier to respond to it with weak regulations than it was to challenge its scientific foundations, given the strength of the evidence for human-driven climate change.</p>
<h2>Legal tactics</h2>
<p>The second Trump administration, however, was prepared to tackle the science head-on, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/mockery-of-science-climate-scientists-tear-into-new-us-climate-report/">gathering a group of contrarians</a> to write a report questioning that evidence. It did not go well, either <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/mockery-of-science-climate-scientists-tear-into-new-us-climate-report/">scientifically</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/us-forced-to-disclose-its-climate-working-groups-communications/">legally</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/as-expected-trumps-epa-guts-climate-endangerment-finding/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson has accused Apple of violating US law by suppressing conservative-leaning news outlets on Apple News.</p>
<p>Ferguson pointed to research by a pro-Trump group that accused Apple News of suppressing articles by Fox News, the New York Post, Daily Mail, Breitbart, and The Gateway Pundit. The FTC chair claims that Apple News might be violating promises made to consumers in its terms of service, but his letter doesn't cite any specific provisions from the Apple terms that might have been violated.</p>
<p>"Recently, there have been reports that Apple News has systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed news articles from more conservative publications," Ferguson wrote in the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/apple-news-warning-letter.pdf">letter</a> to Apple CEO Tim Cook yesterday. He said the "reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers, as well as the reasonable consumer expectations of the tens of millions of Americans who use Apple News."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-ftc-denies-being-speech-police-but-says-apple-news-is-too-liberal/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Framework, the company behind repairable and upgradeable computer designs like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/review-ryzen-ai-cpu-makes-this-the-fastest-the-framework-laptop-13-has-ever-been/">Laptop 13</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/review-new-framework-laptop-16-takes-a-fresh-stab-at-the-upgradeable-laptop-gpu/">Laptop 16</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/framework-laptop-12-review-im-excited-to-see-what-the-2nd-generation-looks-like/">Laptop 12</a>, is also taking a hard hit by price increases. The company stopped selling standalone RAM sticks in November 2025 and has increased prices on one or more of its systems <a href="https://frame.work/blog/updates-on-memory-pricing-and-navigating-the-volatile-memory-market">every month since then</a>; this week's increases are hitting the Framework Desktop and the DIY Editions of its various laptops particularly hard.</p>
<p>The price increases are affecting both standalone SODIMM memory modules and the soldered-down LPDDR5X memory used in the Framework Desktop. Patel says that standalone RAM sticks are being priced "as close as we can to the weighted average cost of our purchases from suppliers." In September, buying an 8GB stick of RAM with a Framework Laptop 13 cost $40; it currently costs $130. A 96GB DDR5 kit of two 48GB sticks costs $1,340, up from $480 in September.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/frameworks-ram-prices-climbing-on-a-monthly-cadence-with-more-hikes-to-come/">Read full article</a></p>
