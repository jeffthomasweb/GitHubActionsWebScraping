                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon lost an attempt to overturn a $46.9 million fine for selling customer location data without its users' consent. The US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected Verizon's challenge in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.3faa6ebe-fa32-ef11-a296-001dd804fa85/gov.uscourts.ca2.3faa6ebe-fa32-ef11-a296-001dd804fa85.107.0.pdf">ruling</a> issued today.</p>

The companies sued the FCC in three different courts, with varying results.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.219140/gov.uscourts.ca5.219140.88.1.pdf">beat the FCC</a> in the reliably conservative US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/t-mobile-claimed-selling-location-data-without-consent-is-legal-judges-disagree/">T-Mobile lost</a> in the District of Columbia Circuit. Although FCC Chairman Brendan Carr <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-40A3.pdf">voted against</a> the fine last year, when the commission had a Democratic majority, his FCC urged the courts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/att-court-win-over-fcc-could-make-it-impossible-for-agency-to-fine-carriers/">uphold the Biden-era decisions</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/court-rejects-verizon-claim-that-selling-location-data-without-consent-is-legal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As part of its unprovoked invasion, Russia has been firing massed waves of drones and missiles into Ukraine for years, though the tempo has been raised dramatically in recent months. Barrages of 700-plus drones now regularly attack Ukraine during overnight raids. Russia also appears to have upped the ante dramatically by sending at least 19 drones into Poland last night, some of which were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/world/europe/poland-russia-drones-ukraine-attack.html">shot down by NATO forces</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these drones are Shahed/Geran types built with technology imported from Iran, and they have recently gained the ability to fly higher, making shootdowns more difficult. Given the low cost of the drones (estimates suggest they cost a few tens of thousands of dollars apiece, and many are simply decoys without warheads), hitting them with multimillion-dollar missiles from traditional air defense batteries makes little sense and would quickly exhaust missile stocks.</p>
<p>So Ukraine has adopted widespread electronic warfare to disrupt control systems and navigation. Drones not forced off their path are fought with <a href="https://defence-blog.com/video-shows-gepard-shooting-down-russian-suicide-drone/">mobile anti-aircraft guns</a>, aircraft, and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/war-in-ukraine-interceptor-drones-russia-shahed-drones/">interceptor drones</a>, many launched from mobile fire teams patrolling Ukraine during the night.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/after-ukrainian-testing-drone-detection-radar-doubles-range-with-simple-software-patch/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Someone might want to tell David Zaslav to read the room. Despite people’s ongoing frustration with the rising prices of streaming services—and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/price-tracker/">just about everything else</a>—the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) thinks that there is reason for HBO Max to charge more.</p>
<p>Zaslav shared his sentiments while speaking at the Goldman Sachs Cornucopia + Technology conference today in San Francisco. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/david-zaslav-tv-terrible-hbo-max-password-sharing-crackdown-1236367283/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> quoted Zaslav as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that this is quality—and that’s true across our company, motion picture, TV production [and] streaming quality—we all ... think that gives us a chance to raise price. We think we’re way underpriced.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, HBO Max starts at $10 per month with ads, $17/month for no ads, and $21/month for no ads and premium features (4K streaming, Dolby Atmos, and the ability to stream from more devices simultaneously and perform more downloads). The streaming platform has raised prices twice since launching (as Max) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/warner-bros-discovery-will-launch-new-max-streaming-service-may-23/">in May 2023</a>. In June 2024, the Standard, ad-free plan went from $16/month to $17/month, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/lawsuit-against-prime-video-ads-shows-perils-of-annual-streaming-subscriptions/">annual subscription fees</a> went up by $20 or $10, depending on the plan. Subscription fees also increased in January 2023.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/hbo-max-is-way-underpriced-warner-bros-discovery-ceo-says/">Read full article</a></p>

While senators clearly struggled to believe that explanation, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) wryly noted that Kennedy should have asked her the question before having the Senate confirm her for the role.</p>
<p>In an<a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa"> op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal</a> the same day as Kennedy's testimony, Monarez gave a different account of her firing—one corroborated by independent reporting—saying that she was ousted after she refused Kennedy's directives to fire senior CDC staff and pre-approve vaccine recommendations from an advisory committee he had stacked with fellow anti-vaccine advocates.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/ousted-cdc-director-to-testify-before-senate-after-rfk-jr-called-her-a-liar/">Read full article</a></p>

Ron Wyden (D–Ore.) said an investigation his office conducted into the 2024 ransomware breach of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/health-care-giant-ascension-says-5-6-million-patients-affected-in-cyberattack/">health care giant Ascension</a> found that the default use of the RC4 encryption cipher was a direct cause. The breach led to the theft of medical records of 5.6 million patients.</p>
<p>It's the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/us-senator-blasts-microsoft-for-negligent-cybersecurity-practices/">second time</a> in as many years that Wyden has used the word “negligence” to describe Microsoft's security practices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/senator-blasts-microsoft-for-making-default-windows-vulnerable-to-kerberoasting/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is one of the most ardent proponents of generative AI technology, as evidenced by the recent launch of the Pixel 10 series. The phones were announced with more than 20 new AI experiences, according to Google. However, one of them is already being pulled from the company's phones. If you go looking for your Daily Hub, you may be disappointed. Not <em>that</em> disappointed, though, as it has been pulled because it didn't do very much.</p>
<p>Many of Google's new AI features only make themselves known in specific circumstances, for example when Magic Cue finds an opportunity to suggest an address or calendar appointment based on your screen context. The Daily Hub, on the other hand, asserted itself multiple times throughout the day. It appeared at the top of the Google Discover feed, as well as in the At a Glance widget right at the top of the home screen.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks after release, Google has pulled the Daily Hub preview from Pixel 10 devices. You will no longer see it in Google Discover nor in the home screen widget. After being spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/08/pixel-10-daily-hub-pause/">9to5Google</a>, the company has issued a statement explaining its plans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/google-pulls-daily-hub-ai-feature-from-pixel-10-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Anthropic <a href="https://status.anthropic.com/incidents/k6gkm2b8cjk9">experienced</a> a brief but complete service outage that took down its AI infrastructure, leaving developers unable to access Claude.ai, the API, Claude Code, or the management console for around half an hour. The outage affected all three of Anthropic's main services simultaneously, with the company posting at 12:28 pm Eastern that "APIs, Console, and Claude.ai are down. Services will be restored as soon as possible." As of press time, the services appear to be restored.</p>
<p>The disruption, though lasting only about 30 minutes, quickly took the top spot on tech link-sharing site Hacker News for a short time and inspired immediate reactions from developers who have become increasingly reliant on AI coding tools for their daily work. "Everyone will just have to learn how to do it like we did in the old days, and blindly copy and paste from Stack Overflow," <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200522">joked</a> one Hacker News commenter. Another user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200398">recalled</a> a joke from a previous AI outage: "Nooooo I'm going to have to use my brain again and write 100% of my code like a caveman from December 2024."</p>
<p>The most recent outage came at an inopportune time, affecting developers across the US who have integrated Claude into their workflows. One Hacker News user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200333">observed</a>: "It's like every other day, the moment US working hours start, AI (in my case I mostly use Anthropic, others may be better) starts dying or at least getting intermittent errors. In EU working hours there's rarely any outages." Another user also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200449">noted</a> this pattern, saying that "early morning here in the UK everything is fine, as soon as most of the US is up and at it, then it slowly turns to treacle."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/developers-joke-about-coding-like-cavemen-as-ai-service-suffers-major-outage/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has a simple request for the Trump administration: Don't take our broadband money away.</p>
<p>Trump's Commerce Department rewrote the rules of the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program, forcing states to change how they spend money earmarked for expanding broadband access. The overhaul led states to reduce spending on fiber networks and increase spending on satellite—although not to the extent sought by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-wants-billions-in-grants-but-state-governments-arent-cooperating/">demanding more money</a> for his Starlink network.</p>
<p>Since states are spending less on deployment, and the program still has the $42 billion allocated by Congress, what happens to the leftover amount after money is spent on deploying broadband networks? Amid speculation that the Trump administration wants to return that money to the US Treasury, Louisiana's Republican governor is worried that states won't be able to use the full $42 billion. It's possible that half or more of the $42 billion won't be used to expand broadband.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/can-we-please-keep-our-broadband-money-republican-governor-asks-trump-admin/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For millions of Spotify users, the "Wrapped" feature—which crunches the numbers on their annual listening habits—is a highlight of every year's end, ever since it debuted in 2015. NPR once <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/08/1218100638/love-sharing-your-favorite-music-with-friends-people-are-into-spotify-wrapped">broke down</a> exactly why our brains find the feature so "irresistible," while Cosmopolitan last year <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a63089815/spotify-wrapped-status-symbol/">declared</a> that sharing Wrapped screenshots of top artists and songs had by now become "the ultimate status symbol" for tens of millions of music fans.</p>
<p>It's no surprise then that, after a decade, some Spotify users who are especially eager to see Wrapped evolve are no longer willing to wait to see if Spotify will ever deliver the more creative streaming insights they crave.</p>
<p>With the help of AI, these users expect that their data can be more quickly analyzed to potentially uncover overlooked or never-considered patterns that could offer even more insights into what their listening habits say about them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/spotify-peeved-after-10000-users-sold-data-to-build-ai-tools/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's Office 365 suite will soon incorporate AI models from Anthropic alongside existing OpenAI technology, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-buy-ai-anthropic-shift-openai">The Information reported</a>, ending years of exclusive reliance on OpenAI for generative AI features across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.</p>
<p>The shift reportedly follows internal testing that revealed Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 model excels at specific Office tasks where OpenAI's models fall short, particularly in visual design and spreadsheet automation, according to sources familiar with the project cited by The Information, who stressed the move is not a negotiating tactic.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Ars spent some time driving the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/everything-we-know-about-the-2026-nissan-leaf/">new Nissan Leaf</a>. We have to wait until Friday to tell you how that car drives, but among the changes from the previous generation are door handles that retract flush with the bodywork, for the front doors at least. Car designers love them for not ruining the lines of the door with the necessities of real life, but is the benefit from drag reduction worth the safety risk?</p>
<p>That question is in even sharper relief this morning. Bloomberg's Dana Hull has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/">a deeply reported article</a> that looks at the problem of Tesla's door handles, which fail when the cars lose power.</p>
<p>The electric vehicle manufacturer chose not to use conventional door locks in its cars, preferring to use IP-based electronic controls. While the front seat occupants have always had a physical latch that can open the door, it took some years for the automaker to add emergency releases for the rear doors, and even now that it has, many rear-seat Tesla passengers will be unaware of where to find or how to operate the emergency release.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/flush-door-handles-are-the-car-industrys-latest-safety-problem/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/07/no-nasa-hasnt-found-life-on-mars-yet-but-the-latest-discovery-is-intriguing/">we reported</a> on the discovery of an intriguing arrow-shaped rock on Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover. The rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. Granted, this was not slam-dunk evidence of past life on Mars, and the results were preliminary, awaiting peer review. But it was an intriguing possibility nonetheless.</p>
<p>Now further analysis and peer review are complete, and there is a new paper, published in the journal Nature, reporting on the findings. It's still not definitive proof that there was water-based life on Mars billions of years ago, but the results are consistent with a biosignature. It's just that other non-biological processes would also be consistent with the data, so definitive proof might require analysis of the Martian samples back on Earth. You can watch NASA's livestream briefing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-StZggK4hhA">here</a>.</p>
<p>"We have improved our understanding of the geological context of the discovery since [last year], and in the paper, we explore abiotic and biological pathways to the formation of the features that we observe," co-author Joel Hurowitz, an astrobiologist at Stony Brook University in New York, told Ars. "My hope is that this discovery motivates a whole bunch of new research in laboratory and analog field settings on Earth to try to understand what conditions might give rise to the textures and mineral assemblages we've observed. This type of follow-on work is exactly what is needed to explore the various biological and abiotic pathways to the formation of the features that we are calling potential biosignatures."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/has-perseverance-found-a-biosignature-on-mars/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's most famous chips are the A- and M-series processors that power its iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but this year, its effort to build its own wireless chips is starting to bear fruit. Earlier this spring, the iPhone 16e included Apple's C1 modem, furthering Apple's ambitions to shed its dependence on Qualcomm, and today's iPhone Air brought a faster Apple C1X variant, plus something new: the Apple N1, a chip that provides Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support for all of today's new iPhones.</p>
<p>Apple didn't dive deep into the capabilities of the N1, or why it had switched from using third-party suppliers (historically, Apple has mostly leaned on Broadcom for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). However, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-unveils-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/">the company's press releases</a> say that it should make Continuity features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop more reliable—these features use Bluetooth for initial communication and then Wi-Fi to establish a high-speed local link between two devices. Other features that use a similar combination of wireless technologies, like using an iPad as an extended Mac display, should also benefit.</p>
<p>These aren't Apple's first chips to integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth technology. The Apple Watches rely on W-series chips to provide their Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity; the Apple H1 and H2 chips also provide Bluetooth connectivity for many of Apple's wireless headphones. But this is the first time that Apple has switched to its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip in one of its iPhones, suggesting that the chips have matured enough to provide higher connectivity speeds for more demanding devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/apples-n1-chip-extends-its-custom-silicon-into-wi-fi-bluetooth-and-thread/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Reddit has addressed a problem where the description of subreddits originally written by moderators appeared different—and, often, inaccurate—on Reddit’s Android app. For weeks, the problem was largely suspected to be caused by Reddit clumsily using generative AI to create new subreddit descriptions. However, Reddit says that the changes were the fault of a bug tied to its AI-powered translation technology.</p>
<p>Reports of subreddits suddenly having inaccurate summaries when viewed on Reddit’s Android app started surfacing on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticParents/comments/1mxlvdc/has_this_subreddit_changed/">a couple of weeks ago</a>. On August 29, a moderator <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1n2zo33/comment/nbcdyxe/?context=3">reported</a> on the r/ModSupport subreddit for moderators that the r/ThronesAndDominions subreddit's description changed from “The wayward adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth” to “The crazy adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth.” The problem got more attention when r/actuallesbians’ Android app description <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1nb7r43/why_does_the_subs_description_say_straight/?share_id=-7RsDHvw9KgB6OYfk0ymn&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">described</a> the community as “a place for straight and transgender lesbians …” instead of “a place for cis and trans lesbians …”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1nb916s/some_users_are_seeing_different_subreddit/">Other complaints</a> followed, including from r/autisticparents, a subreddit for parents with autism whose description <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticParents/comments/1mxp16u/how_the_sub_description_looks_for_me_on_mobile/">was changed</a> to say that it is a group for “parents of autistic children.” A moderator who asked to be referred to by their Reddit username, Paige_Railstone, described the confusion that the changes brought to their subreddit:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/reddit-bug-caused-lesbian-subreddit-to-be-labeled-as-a-place-for-straight-women/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—We're a long way from the days when a new iPhone launch just meant one new phone. It shifted to "basically the same phone in two sizes" a decade or so ago, and then to a version of "one lineup of regular phones and one lineup of Pro phones" in 2017 when the iPhone 8 was introduced next to the iPhone X.</p>
<p>But thanks to Apple's newly introduced iPhone Air, the iPhone 17 lineup gives new phone buyers more choices and trade-offs than they've ever had before. Apple's phones are now available in a spectrum of sizes, weights, speeds, costs, and camera configurations. And while options are great to have, it also means you need to know more about which one to pick.</p>
<p>We've gone hands-on with all four of Apple's new phones, and while more extensive tire-kicking will be required, we can at least try to nail down exactly what kind of person each of these phones is for.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/hands-on-with-the-iphone-17-lineup-including-the-wispy-air-and-the-lumpy-pro/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Pfizer and BioNTech report that their <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-topline-data-demonstrating">updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for the 2025–2026 season</a> produced strong immune responses, boosting neutralizing antibody levels by at least fourfold in older people and those with underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>The positive results come as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/who-can-get-a-covid-vaccine-and-how-its-complicated/">Americans face a confusing, state-by-state patchwork of access to the shots</a> under health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an ardent anti-vaccine activist who has unilaterally restricted access. Prior to the second Trump administration, all Americans ages 6 months and older had access to the vaccines. But under Kennedy, the Food and Drug Administration limited COVID-19 vaccine approvals to people 65 and older, and people under 64 years only if they have an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>In Pfizer and BioNTech's latest trial, the companies limited enrollment to these groups. The phase 3 trial included 100 people total, 50 people age 65 or older and 50 people age 18 to 64 with an underlying condition. <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07069309">Those conditions</a> included asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, HIV, mental health conditions, Parkinson's disease, obesity, or smoking. All participants had gotten last season's COVID shot at least six months prior to the trial and had not gotten any other COVID-19 vaccines or a COVID-19 infection since then.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/pfizer-reports-positive-covid-shot-results-despite-government-fueled-chaos/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files">launched</a> a new file-creation feature for its Claude AI assistant that enables users to generate Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and other documents directly within conversations on the web interface and in the Claude desktop app. While the feature may be handy for Claude users, the company's support documentation also <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude">warns</a> that it "may put your data at risk" and details how the AI assistant can be manipulated to transmit user data to external servers.</p>
<p>The feature, awkwardly named "Upgraded file-creation and analysis," is basically Anthropic's version of ChatGPT's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-eyes-and-ears-with-plugins-that-can-interface-ai-with-the-world/">Code Interpreter</a> and an upgraded version of Anthropic's <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/analysis-tool">"analysis" tool</a>. It's currently available as a preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan users, with Pro users scheduled to receive access "in the coming weeks," according to the announcement.</p>
<p>The security issue comes from the fact that the new feature gives Claude access to a sandbox computing environment, which enables it to download packages and run code to create files. "This feature gives Claude Internet access to create and analyze files, which may put your data at risk," Anthropic writes in its blog announcement. "Monitor chats closely when using this feature."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/anthropics-new-claude-feature-can-leak-data-users-told-to-monitor-chats-closely/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A new independent report finds that although NASA's ambitious mission to fly across the surface of Titan is delayed and over budget, the fault is due to the space agency's management rather than the program itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/office-of-inspector-general-oig/audit-reports/nasas-management-of-the-dragonfly-project/">Released Tuesday by NASA's Office of Inspector General</a>, the report found that the mission's budget has soared from an initial figure of $850 million upon its selection in 2019 to $3.35 billion today. Additionally, the launch target has slipped from the year 2026 to 2028.</p>
<p>However, the cost increase and schedule slippages are not new.
