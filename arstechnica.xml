                            <![CDATA[<p>Threat actors, likely supported by the Russian government, hacked multiple high-value mail servers around the world by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, a class of bug that was among the most commonly exploited in decades past.</p>
<p>XSS is short for cross-site scripting. Vulnerabilities result from programming errors found in webserver software that, when exploited, allow attackers to execute malicious code in the browsers of people visiting an affected website. XSS first got attention in 2005, with the creation of the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/13/weekend_twitter_worm_attacks/">Samy Worm</a>, which knocked MySpace out of commission when it added more than one million MySpace friends to a user named Samy. XSS exploits abounded for the next decade and have gradually fizzled more recently, although this class of attacks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/thousands-of-wordpress-sites-have-been-hacked-through-tagdiv-plugin-vulnerability/">continues now</a>.</p>
<h2>Just add JavaScript</h2>
<p>On Thursday, security firm ESET <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/operation-roundpress/">reported</a> that Sednit, a Kremlin-backed hacking group also tracked as APT28, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, and Sofacy—gained access to high-value email accounts by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in mail server software from four different makers. Those packages are: Roundcube, MDaemon, Horde, and Zimbra.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/spies-hack-high-value-mail-servers-using-an-exploit-from-yesteryear/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A US-based propulsion company, Venus Aerospace, said Wednesday it had completed a short flight test of its rotating detonation rocket engine at Spaceport America in New Mexico.</p>
<p>The company's chief executive and co-founder, Sassie Duggleby, characterized the flight as "historic." It is believed to be the first US-based flight test of an idea that has been discussed academically for decades, a rotating detonation rocket engine. The concept has previously been tested in a handful of other countries, but never with a high-thrust engine.</p>
<p>"By proving this engine works beyond the lab, Venus brings the world closer to a future where hypersonic travel—traversing the globe in under two hours—becomes possible," Duggleby told Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/venus-aerospace-flies-its-rotating-detonation-rocket-engine-for-the-first-time/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Users on X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/grok/">love to tag the verified @grok account in replies</a> to get the large language model's take on any number of topics. On Wednesday, though, that account started largely ignoring those requests en masse in favor of redirecting the conversation towards the topic of alleged "white genocide" in South Africa and the related song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubul%27_ibhunu">"Kill the Boer."</a></p>
<p>Searching the Grok account's replies <a href="https://x.com/search?q=boer%20from%3Agrok&amp;src=typed_query">for mentions of "genocide"</a> or <a href="https://x.com/search?q=boer%20from%3A%40grok&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">"boer"</a> currently returns dozens if not hundreds of posts where the LLM responds to completely unrelated queries with quixotic discussions about alleged killings of white farmers in South Africa (though many have been deleted in the time just before this post went live; links in this story have been replaced with archived versions where appropriate). The sheer range of these non-sequiturs is somewhat breathtaking; everything from <a href="https://archive.is/vwqkF">questions about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s disinformation</a> to <a href="https://archive.is/iT7pF">discussions of MLB pitcher Max Scherzer's salary</a> to <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1922649282748039303">a search for new group-specific put-downs</a>, see Grok quickly turning the subject back toward the suddenly all-important topic of South Africa.</p>
<p>It's like Grok has become the world's most tiresome party guest, harping on its own pet talking points to the exclusion of any other discussion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/xais-grok-suddenly-cant-stop-bringing-up-white-genocide-in-south-africa/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1922707554745909391">announced</a> that ChatGPT users now have access to GPT-4.1, an AI language model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/when-is-4-1-greater-than-4-5-when-its-openais-newest-model/">previously available</a> only through the company's API since its launch one month ago. The update brings what OpenAI describes as improved coding and web development capabilities to paid ChatGPT subscribers, with wider enterprise rollout planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>GPT-4.1 and 4.1 mini to ChatGPT adds to an already complex model selection that includes GPT-4o, various specialized GPT-4o versions, o1-pro, o3-mini, and o3-mini-high models. There are technically nine AI models available for ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Wharton professor Ethan Mollick recently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3lp3ue3qizs2a">publicly lampooned</a> the awkward situation on social media.</p>

<p>Deciding which AI model to use can be daunting for AI novices. Reddit users and <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/less-is-more-chatgpt-has-too-many-options-but-poor-performance/1213483">OpenAI forum members</a> alike commonly voice confusion about the available options. "I do not understand the reason behind having multiple models available for use," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1j2dh5m/why_are_multiple_models_available/">wrote</a> one Reddit user in March. "Why would anyone use anything but the best one?" Another Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1jio5sk/a_bit_lost_with_so_many_models_and_limits/">said</a> they were "a bit lost" with the many ChatGPT models available after switching back from using Anthropic Claude.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/some-chatgpt-users-now-face-9-ai-models-to-choose-from-after-gpt-4-1-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since 2017, a particularly dangerous strain of <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 has emerged across the country to spark outbreaks, severe disease, and deaths. It spreads in various ways: via leafy greens and contaminated beef, like its relatives, but also recreational waters. Hundreds of people across 46 states have been infected, and health officials have documented at least nine separate outbreaks. One in 2018, linked to lettuce, caused over 200 infections across 37 states, killing five people and causing a severe kidney condition in 26.</p>
<p>Now, a sweeping genetic analysis by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests a tiny mutation in one of the bacteria's molecular weapons may be behind the strain's rise. The finding, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/13/24-0686_article">published recently in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases</a>, provides insights into this clinically significant plague and its rise to prominence. It also highlights the role of the bacteria's sophisticated military tactics.</p>
<p>The mutated weapon is part of a complex system that <em>E. coli</em> and other harmful bacteria sometimes use called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_III_secretion_system">a Type 3 Secretion System</a> (T3SS). This involves molecular machinery that basically functions like a syringe, complete with a long needle that is poked into the cells of its victims. The T3SS then directly injects a fleet of hostile proteins. Those proteins—called effectors—attack specific targets that collectively disable the host's defense responses and make the host more hospitable for its bacterial conqueror.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/a-dangerous-e-coli-strain-has-emerged-a-small-mutation-may-explain-its-rise/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's DeepMind research division claims its newest AI agent marks a significant step toward using the technology to tackle big problems in math and science. The system, known as AlphaEvolve, is based on the company's Gemini large language models (LLMs), with the addition of an "evolutionary" approach that evaluates and improves algorithms across a range of use cases.</p>
<p>AlphaEvolve is essentially an AI coding agent, but it goes deeper than a standard Gemini chatbot. When you talk to Gemini, there is always a risk of hallucination, where the AI makes up details due to the non-deterministic nature of the underlying technology. AlphaEvolve uses an interesting approach to increase its accuracy when handling complex algorithmic problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/">According to DeepMind</a>, this AI uses an automatic evaluation system. When a researcher interacts with AlphaEvolve, they input a problem along with possible solutions and avenues to explore. The model generates multiple possible solutions, using the efficient Gemini Flash and the more detail-oriented Gemini Pro, and then each solution is analyzed by the evaluator. An evolutionary framework allows AlphaEvolve to focus on the best solution and improve upon it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/google-deepmind-creates-super-advanced-ai-that-can-invent-new-algorithms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The world of computers is dominated by binary. Silicon transistors are either conducting or they're not, and so we've developed a whole world of math and logical operations around those binary capabilities. And, for the most part, quantum computing has been developing along similar lines, using qubits that, when measured, will be found in one of two states.</p>
<p>In some cases, the use of binary values is a feature of the object being used to hold the qubit. For example, a technology called dual-rail qubits takes its value from which of two linked resonators holds a photon. But there are many other quantum objects that have access to far more than two states—think of something like all the possible energy states an electron could occupy when orbiting an atom. We can use things like this as qubits by only relying on the lowest two energy levels. But there's nothing stopping us from using more than two.</p>
<p>In Wednesday's issue of Nature, researchers describe creating qudits, the generic term for systems that hold quantum information—it's short for quantum digits. Using a system that can be in three or four possible states (qutrits and ququarts, respectively), they demonstrate the first error correction of higher-order quantum memory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/beyond-qubits-meet-the-qutrit-and-ququart/">Read full article</a></p>

      David Corenswet stars as Clark Kent in director James Gunn's <em>Superman</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>We're about to enter a new era for DC Studios with the July release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(2025_film)"><em>Superman</em></a>, writer/director James Gunn's fresh take on one of the most iconic superheroes. And after months of tantalizing teases, we finally have the first official trailer, featuring a bickering Clark Kent and Lois Lane, plenty of action, villains being villains, <em>kaiju</em>, and of course, our favorite flying super-pup, Krypto.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/krypto-steals-the-show-in-superman-teaser/">previously reported</a>, Gunn has described his take as less of an origin story and more of a journey, with Superman struggling to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage and aristocratic origins with his small-town adoptive human family. Gunn tapped David Corenswet to play Clark Kent/Superman at 25, a bit more established than the young cub reporter of <em>Smallville</em>, for instance. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane, Skyler Gisondo plays Jimmy Olsen, and Nicholas Hoult is arch-nemesis Lex Luthor. Luthor's sidekicks are played by Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher and Terence Rosemore as Otis.</p>
<p>The cast also includes Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner/Green Lantern (sporting a disastrous bowl haircut); Anthony Carrigan as Rex Mason/Metamorpho, who can transmute elements in his body to change forms; Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl; Edi Gathegi as Michael Holt/Mister Terrific, an inventor turned superhero; Maria Gabriela de Faria as Angela Spica/The Engineer, whose abilities stem from embedded nanotechnology; and Pruitt Taylor Vince and Neva Howell as Clark's parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, respectively. We'll also see Frank Grillo reprise his role as Rick Flag Sr. from the animated series <em>Creature Commandos</em>; Sean Gunn as Maxwell Lord; and Milly Alcock as Superman's cousin, Kara Zor-El/Supergirl.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/krypto-steals-the-show-again-in-superman-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

The sudden deactivation of accounts resulted in customer backlash online, including, as of this writing, 24 pages of one-star reviews on <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/vpnsecure.me?page=15&amp;stars=1">Trustpilot.</a></p>
<p>“… maybe, honestly, we should have just walked away from this 'opportunity,’” Romain Brabant, the CEO of InfiniteQuant Ltd, told Ars Technica when asked if he would have handled things differently in hindsight.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/vpnsecure-owner-says-it-had-to-cancel-unsustainable-lifetime-subscriptions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Gilmour Space, a venture-backed startup based in Australia, is about to launch a small rocket from its privately owned spaceport on a remote stretch of the country's northeastern coastline.</p>
<p>It's the first time anyone has attempted to reach orbit with a rocket designed and built in Australia. Gilmour's three-stage rocket, named Eris, could launch at any time during a 10-hour window as soon as Friday, local time. In the United States, the launch window runs from 5:30 pm EDT Thursday until 3:30 am EDT Friday.</p>
<p>This comes after a 24-hour delay due to an "issue in the ground support system" for the launch, Gilmour said Wednesday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/for-the-first-time-an-australian-rocket-will-take-aim-at-low-earth-orbit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A plaintiff's law firms were sanctioned and ordered to pay $31,100 after submitting fake AI citations that nearly ended up in a court ruling. Michael Wilner, a retired US magistrate judge serving as <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/special_master">special master</a> in US District Court for the Central District of California, admitted that he initially thought the citations were real and "almost" put them into an order.</p>
<p>These aren't the first lawyers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/lawyers-have-real-bad-day-in-court-after-citing-fake-cases-made-up-by-chatgpt/">caught</a> submitting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/michael-cohen-gave-his-lawyer-fake-citations-invented-by-google-bard-ai-tool/">briefs</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/mypillow-ceos-lawyers-used-ai-in-brief-citing-fictional-cases-judge-says/">fake citations</a> generated by AI. In some cases, opposing attorneys figure out what happened and notify the judge. In this instance, the judge noticed that some citations were unverifiable but was troubled by how close he came to including the bogus citations in an order.</p>
<p>"Directly put, Plaintiff's use of AI affirmatively misled me," Judge Wilner wrote in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.930490/gov.uscourts.cacd.930490.119.0.pdf">May 5 order</a>. "I read their brief, was persuaded (or at least intrigued) by the authorities that they cited, and looked up the decisions to learn more about them—only to find that they didn't exist. That's scary. It almost led to the scarier outcome (from my perspective) of including those bogus materials in a judicial order. Strong deterrence is needed to make sure that attorneys don't succumb to this easy shortcut."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/judge-initially-fooled-by-fake-ai-citations-nearly-put-them-in-a-ruling/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We've known for months now that Valve is expanding its Linux-based SteamOS operating system beyond the Steam Deck to other handheld PCs, starting with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">some versions of the Asus ROG Ally</a>. This week, Valve began making some changes to its Steam storefront to prepare for a future when the Deck isn't the only hardware running SteamOS.</p>
<p>A new "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">SteamOS Compatible</a>" label will begin rolling out "over the next few weeks" to denote "whether a game and all of its middleware is supported on SteamOS," including "game functionality, launcher functionality, and anti-cheat support." Games that don't meet this requirement will be marked as "SteamOS Unsupported." As with current games and the Steam Deck, this label doesn't mean these games won't run, but it does mean there may be some serious compatibility issues that keep the game from running as intended.</p>
<p>Valve says that "over 18,000 titles on Steam [will] be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate," and that game developers won't need to do anything extra to earn the label if their titles already support the Steam Deck.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/valve-adds-steamos-compatible-game-label-as-it-prepares-to-expand-beyond-steam-deck/">Read full article</a></p>

      Dominique Thorne is back as Riri Williams in <em>Ironheart</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Ryan Coogler is riding high as his new film <em>Sinners</em> <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/">lights up the box office</a>, and he's got another major TV project waiting in the wings: the Marvel limited series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironheart_(miniseries)"><em>Ironheart</em></a>. And the studio has dropped a shiny new trailer ahead of the show's June release. The six-episode series stars Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams, aka the titular Ironheart, a teen tech genius who is a protégé of Tony Stark in the comics. It's the final TV series in Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Five.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>The series was first announced in December 2020 and originally slated for a 2023 release. But then Marvel began rethinking its long-term strategy and decided to scale back on content to counter suggestions of market saturation, and <em>Ironheart</em> was delayed until now. It has <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1639518/ironheart-footage-reaction-riri-williams-suits-up-crime-thriller-d23/">been described</a> as "a crime show with an <em>Iron Man</em> twist at the center," based on footage revealed at 2024's D23 convention.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/a-frustrated-riri-finds-a-mysterious-ally-in-ironheart-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As the underground industry of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meet-zachxbt-243-million-crypto-theft/">crypto investment scams</a> has grown into one of the world's most lucrative forms of cybercrime, the secondary market of money launderers for those scammers has grown to match it. Amid that black market, one such Chinese-language service on the messaging platform Telegram blossomed into an all-purpose underground bazaar: It has offered not only cash-out services to scammers but also money laundering for North Korean hackers, stolen data, targeted harassment-for-hire, and even what appears to be sex trafficking. And somehow, it's all overseen by a company legally registered in the United States.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/xinbi-guarantee">new research</a> released today by crypto-tracing firm Elliptic, a company called Xinbi Guarantee has since 2022 facilitated no less than $8.4 billion in transactions via its Telegram-based marketplace prior to Telegram’s actions in recent days to remove its accounts from the platform. Money stolen from scam victims likely represents the “vast majority” of that sum, according to Elliptic's cofounder Tom Robinson. Yet even as the market serves Chinese-speaking scammers, it also boasts on the top of its website—in Mandarin—that it's registered in Colorado.</p>
<p>“Xinbi Guarantee has served as a giant, purportedly US-incorporated illicit online marketplace for online scams that primarily offers money laundering services,” says Robinson. He adds, though, that Elliptic has also found a remarkable variety of other criminal offerings on the market: child-bearing surrogacy and egg donors, harassment services that offer to threaten or throw feces at any chosen victim, and even sex workers in their teens who are likely trafficking victims.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/incorporated-in-us-8-4b-money-launderer-for-chinese-speaking-crypto-scammers/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>While Nintendo offered an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/?srsltid=AfmBOoowUYne40T8hrt1f-h_qteOG6JM7ZIXmUSPF76xgZ9-jFvW-Q0H">official spec sheet</a> for the Switch 2 last month, neither it nor <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-confirms-the-switch-2-supports-dlss-g-sync-and-ray-tracing/">an accompanying blog post from chip-making partner Nvidia</a> provided many specific numbers for the upcoming console's raw CPU and GPU horsepower. Today, though, Digital Foundry is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">offering what it calls "rock-solid confirmation" of the system's final tech specs</a>, adding detail and clarity to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">years-old leaks and educated speculation</a> on the system's internals (which turned out to be largely reliable in the end).</p>
<p>Unlike the Switch—which basically used an off-the-shelf Nvidia Tegra T1 chip—Digital Foundry says the Switch 2 is using "very much custom silicon designed specifically for Nintendo and for mobile gaming." You can see what that means in terms of raw hardware performance in the tables below.</p>

<p>Glancing at those numbers, it's easy to pick out a large difference between the system's performance in docked and undocked modes; its GPU clock and memory bandwidth both increase substantially when plugged into a TV. Those differences could help explain why the Switch 2 dock uses an active cooling fan, unlike the much simpler TV-connection dock on the original Switch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/new-switch-2-specs-show-large-performance-dip-in-undocked-mode/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) streaming service Max will be called HBO Max starting this summer, bringing back a name that WBD curiously ditched a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>In May 2020, the company then known as WarnerMedia Group launched its flagship streaming service, HBO Max. The successor to the HBO Now subscription-based streaming service that launched in 2014, and not to be confused with the now-defunct HBO Go (which was a video-on-demand streaming service accessible to those with subscriptions to the HBO cable channel), HBO Max offered “the entire HBO service,” per WarnerMedia’s announcement. HBO Max also combined content from other titles WarnerMedia owned, including titles from DC Comics and Cartoon Network. But the main draw continued to be the ability to stream HBO’s prestigious library via a Netflix-like streaming subscription.</p>
<p>When WarnerMedia acquired Discovery in 2022 and became WBD, it sought to combine the libraries of HBO Max and the Discovery+ streaming service. WBD landed on Max as the name for the combined app. The name seemed to suggest access to a maximum amount of streaming content with maximum appeal. However, it questionably distanced itself from the legacy of high-budget, award-winning TV shows and recent popular movies that the HBO brand had been building since 1972.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/max-pivots-back-to-hbo-max-as-wbd-rethinks-ability-to-compete-with-netflix/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the federal government's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that it had terminated research grants to Harvard totalling $450 million, spread out across eight federal agencies. The move comes on the heels of $2.2 billion in earlier cuts and an announcement that the university will be prevented from receiving any future grants. The ongoing campaign appears to be heading toward a point where no researchers at Harvard will receive federal funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/anti-semitism-task-force-statement-on-additional-harvard-grants.html">The announcement</a> reiterates accusations that are familiar from earlier federal funding terminations. It references antisemitic incidents during earlier protests about Israel's actions in Gaza and the fact that the Harvard Law Review has taken steps to diversify the authors it publishes, which the government considers illegal discrimination. Notably, the letter does not mention any more recent events, nor Harvard's efforts to address antisemitism on campus, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harvard’s campus, once a symbol of academic prestige, has become a breeding ground for virtue signaling and discrimination. This is not leadership; it is cowardice. And it’s not academic freedom; it’s institutional disenfranchisement. There is a dark problem on Harvard’s campus, and by prioritizing appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school's claim to taxpayer support.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's generally difficult to understand the big picture of these cuts and the reasons for them from this announcement. Instead, it has to be pieced together from the multitude of letters that individual agencies have sent Harvard.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/feds-continue-effort-to-defund-research-at-harvard/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Privacy watchdog Noyb sent a cease-and-desist <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2025-05/noyb_cease%20and%20desist%20letter_Meta%20AI_pub.pdf">letter</a> to Meta Wednesday, threatening to pursue a potentially billion-dollar class action to block Meta's AI training, which starts soon in the European Union.</p>
<p>In the letter, Noyb noted that Meta only recently notified EU users on its platforms that they had until May 27 to opt their public posts out of Meta's AI training data sets. According to Noyb, Meta is also requiring users who already opted out of AI training in 2024 to opt out again or forever lose their opportunity to keep their data out of Meta's models, as training data likely cannot be easily deleted. That's a seeming violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Noyb alleged.</p>
<p>"Meta informed data subjects that, despite that fact that an objection to AI training under Article 21(2) GDPR was accepted in 2024, their personal data will be processed unless they object again—against its former promises, which further undermines any legitimate trust in Meta’s organizational ability to properly execute the necessary steps when data subjects exercise their rights," Noyb's letter said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/meta-is-making-users-who-opted-out-of-ai-training-opt-out-again-watchdog-says/">Read full article</a></p>
