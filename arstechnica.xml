                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKa6u7LT0qE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Director Andy Muschietti's two-film adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel <em> IT</em> racked up over $1 billion at the box office worldwide. Now Muschietti is back with a nine-episode prequel series for HBO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_%E2%80%93_Welcome_to_Derry"><em>IT: Welcome to Derry</em></a>, exploring the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the ancient evil that terrorized the fictional town every 27 years. And now we have an official trailer a month before the prequel's October debut.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below for <em>IT</em> and <em>IT: Chapter Two</em>.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/new-trailer-for-it-chapter-two-ratchets-up-the-horror/">previously reported</a>, set in 1989,  <em>IT</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_(2017_film)">essentially adapted</a> half of King's original novel, telling the story of a group of misfit kids calling themselves "The Losers Club." The kids discover their small town of Derry is home to an ancient, trans-dimensional evil that awakens every 27 years to prey mostly on children by taking the form of an evil clown named Pennywise. Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) loses his little brother, Georgie, to Pennywise, and the group decides to take on Pennywise and drive him into early hibernation, where he will hopefully starve. But Beverly (Sophia Lillis) has a vision warning that Pennywise will return on schedule in 27 years, and they must be ready to fight him anew.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/pennywise-gets-an-origin-story-in-welcome-to-derry-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>If an Iranian taxi driver waves away your payment, saying, "Be my guest this time," accepting their offer would be a cultural disaster. They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taarof">taarof</a>, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it.</p>
<p>New research <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01035">released</a> earlier this month titled "We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and <a href="https://ollama.com/partai/dorna-llama3">Dorna</a>, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3.</p>
<p>A study led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w_aHFFUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Nikta Gohari Sadr</a> of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces "TAAROFBENCH," the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/when-no-means-yes-why-ai-chatbots-cant-process-persian-social-etiquette/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While mired in controversy from all sides, the Walt Disney Company has unveiled price hikes for Disney+ and its other streaming services today.</p>
<p>As of October 21, Disney+ will cost up to 20 percent more, depending on the plan you have. Disney+ with ads is increasing from $10 to $12 per month, while the ad-free plan is going from $16 to $19 per month. The annual, ad-free plan will go from $160 to $190.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/hulus-days-look-numbered-but-theres-reason-for-disney-to-keep-it-around/">Acquisitions</a> have enabled Disney to own multiple streaming services, so it’s not just Disney+ subscribers who will be impacted. Subscriptions for Hulu and ESPN Select will also increase, as will all Hulu + Live TV plans and bundles of Disney’s three subscription-based streaming services.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/disney-decides-it-hasnt-angered-people-enough-announces-disney-price-hikes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's not exactly hard to find politically conservative content on YouTube, but the platform may soon skew even further to the right. YouTube parent Alphabet has confirmed that it will restore channels that were banned in recent years for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and elections. Alphabet says it values free expression and political debate, placing the blame for its previous moderation decisions on the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Alphabet made this announcement via a <a href="https://x.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1970474487809265878">lengthy letter</a> to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The letter, a response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, explains in no uncertain terms that the company is taking a more relaxed approach to moderating political content on YouTube.</p>
<p>For starters, Alphabet denies that its products and services are biased toward specific viewpoints and that it "appreciates the accountability" provided by the committee. The cloying missive goes on to explain that Google didn't really want to ban all those accounts, but Biden administration officials just kept asking. Now that the political tables have turned, Google is looking to dig itself out of this hole.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/youtube-will-restore-channels-banned-for-covid-and-election-misinformation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr wants you to know that he never threatened to revoke TV licenses if Disney refused to suspend Jimmy Kimmel. The problem for Carr is that lots of people heard him do exactly that last week.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of Democrats out there that are engaged in a campaign of projection and distortion," Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1970183350733410786">said</a> during an on-stage interview at the Concordia Summit yesterday. "The distortion is they're completely misrepresenting the work of the FCC and what we've been doing. I saw there's a letter from some Senate Democrats that said the FCC threatened to revoke the license of Disney and ABC if they didn't fire Jimmy Kimmel, and that did not happen in any way, shape, or form."</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you'll indulge me for a moment, here's some ancient history.</p>
<p>In 2008, when Apple took <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/02/macbook-air-review/">the very first MacBook Air</a> out of a manila envelope, it was not positioned as Apple's new entry-level Mac laptop. The innovative but flawed system started at $1,799, far above the $999 price of the entry-level plastic MacBook and well into MacBook Pro territory.</p>
<p>In those early, formative years, the "Air" branding denoted not a midrange or entry-level model but an alternate branching path from the baseline MacBook. Paying Apple more money could get you more computer—the Pro model, with more processor, more screen, more storage, more everything—or it could get you a <em>different</em> kind of computer, with fundamentally different benefits and trade-offs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/iphone-air-review-apples-different-est-phone-in-years-is-appealing-despite-itself/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>

<p>It's a rare occurrence for scientists to witness sharks mating in the wild. It's even rarer to catch three leopard sharks—two males and one female—engaging in what amounts to a threesome in the wild on camera, particularly since they are considered an endangered species. But that's just what one enterprising marine biology team achieved, describing the mating sequence in careful, clinical detail in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-025-00866-4">a paper</a> published in the Journal of Ethology.</p>
<p>It's not like scientists don't know anything about leopard shark mating behavior; rather, most of that knowledge comes from studying the sharks in captivity. Whether the behavior is identical in the wild is an open question because there hadn't been any documented observations of leopard shark mating practices in the wild—until now.</p>
<p>Hugo Lassauce, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia, was working with the Aquarium des Lagons in Nouméa, New Caledonia, to monitor sharks off the coast of that South Pacific territory. Lassauce has been snorkeling daily with sharks for a year as part of that program—always with an accompanying boat for safety purposes—and had seen bits of the leopard shark mating behavior before, but never the entire sequence. Then he spotted a female shark on the sand below with two males hanging onto her pectoral fins—classic pre-copulation (courtship) behavior observed in captive leopard sharks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/scientists-catch-a-shark-threesome-on-camera/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>There's an old saying that life is not about how many times you fall down but how many times you get back up. In my roughly 13 hours of walking through the surreal mountain wilderness of <em>Baby Steps</em>, I'd conservatively estimate I easily fell down 1,000 times.</p>
<p>If so, I got up 1,001 times, which is the entire point.</p>
<p>When I say "fell down" here, I'm not being metaphorical. In <em>Baby Steps</em>, the only real antagonist is terrain that threatens to send your pudgy, middle-aged, long-underwear-clad avatar tumbling to the ground (or down a cliff) like a rag doll after the slightest misstep. You pilot this avatar using an intentionally touchy and cumbersome control system where each individual leg is tied a shoulder trigger on your controller.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/baby-steps-is-the-most-gloriously-frustrating-game-ive-ever-struggled-through/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2025/09/us-secret-service-dismantles-imminent-telecommunications-threat-new-york">announced this morning</a> that it has located and seized a cache of telecom devices large enough to "shut down the cellular network in New York City." And it believes a nation-state is responsible.</p>
<p>According to the agency, "more than 300 co-located SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards" were discovered at multiple locations within the New York City area. Photos of the seized gear show what appear to be "SIM boxes" bristling with antennas and stuffed with SIM cards, then stacked on six-shelf racks. (SIM boxes are <a href="https://www.subex.com/blog/simbox-fraud-challenges-and-ai-powered-solutions-for-telecom-operators/">often used for fraud</a>.) One photo even shows neatly stacked towers of punched-out SIM card packaging, suggesting that whoever assembled the system invested some quality time in just getting the whole thing set up.</p>
<p>The gear was identified as part of a Secret Service investigation into "anonymous telephonic threats" made against several high-ranking US government officials, but the setup seems designed for something larger than just making a few threats. The Secret Service believes that the system could have been capable of activities like "disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial of services attacks, and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/us-uncovers-100000-sim-cards-that-could-have-shut-down-nyc-cell-network/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Judge calls decision to stop construction “the height of arbitrary and capricious.”]]>
                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, a judge blocked the Trump administration's latest attempt to stifle the US's nascent offshore wind industry. The ruling allows construction to restart on Revolution Wind, which the Danish company Orsted is building in the waters off Rhode Island and Connecticut. While the preliminary injunction can still be appealed, the project is already 80 percent complete, so construction could potentially wrap up while the case is still pending.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has made no secret of its <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lzj6gqfsne2n">animosity toward renewable power</a> and issued early executive orders that blocked further offshore leases and re-evaluated the permitting process for others. But it has also gone beyond that and issued stop-work orders for sites that had already been through the permitting process and were under construction. Its reasons for doing so have been remarkably vague, with suggestions of unspecified flaws to the permitting process that involve everything from environmental impacts to detail-free national security concerns.</p>
<p>But those reasons could apparently be ignored under the right circumstances. After blocking further construction of New York's Empire Wind, the administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trump-admin-lifts-hold-on-offshore-wind-farm-doesnt-explain-why/">lifted the block</a> without explaining why its supposed reasons for instituting it no longer applied.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic forced kids to stay home, educators flocked to VMware, and thousands of school districts adopted virtualization. The technology became a solution for distance learning during the pandemic and after, when events such as bad weather and illness can prevent children from physically attending school.</p>
<p>However, the VMware being sold to K–12 schools today differs from the VMware that existed before and during the pandemic. Now a Broadcom business, the platform features <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/">higher prices</a> and a business strategy that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/more-vmware-cloud-partners-axed-as-broadcom-launches-new-invite-only-program/">favors big spenders</a>. This has created unique problems for educational IT departments juggling restrictive budgets and multiple technology vendors with children's needs.</p>
<h2>Curriculum impacted by IT delays</h2>
<p>Ars Technica recently spoke with an IT director at a public school district in Indiana. The director requested anonymity for themself and the district out of concern about potential blowback. The director confirmed that the district has five schools and about 3,000 students. The district started using VMware’s vSAN, a software-defined storage offering, and the vSphere virtualization platform in 2019. The Indiana school system bought the VMware offerings through a package that combined them with VxRail, which is hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) hardware that Dell jointly engineered with VMware.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/broadcoms-prohibitive-vmware-prices-create-a-learning-barrier-it-pro-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court yesterday allowed President Trump to fire a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission and will decide whether to overturn a 90-year-old precedent that says the president cannot fire an FTC commissioner without cause.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-fires-both-ftc-democrats-in-challenge-to-supreme-court-precedent/">fired Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter</a> in March with a notice that said her "continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration's priorities." Trump did so despite the 1935 ruling in <em>Humphrey's Executor v. United States</em>, in which the Supreme Court unanimously held that the president can only remove FTC commissioners for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.</p>
<p>An appeals court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/trump-cant-fire-ftc-commissioners-just-because-he-wants-to-judges-rule/">reinstated Slaughter</a> three weeks ago, with judges finding that "the government has no likelihood of success on appeal given controlling and directly on point Supreme Court precedent." But on September 8, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/supreme-court-chief-justice-lets-trump-fire-ftc-democrat-at-least-for-now/">granted a stay</a> that temporarily blocked the lower-court ruling against Trump.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/supreme-court-lets-trump-fire-ftc-democrat-despite-90-year-old-precedent/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The era of Google's Play's unrivaled dominance may be coming to an end in the wake of the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">antitrust loss</a>, but Google's app store isn't going anywhere. In fact, the Play Store experience is getting a massive update with more personalization, content, and yes, AI. This is Google, after all.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/curation-update-september-2025/">revamped Google Play Games</a> is a key part of this update. Gamer profiles will now have a public face, allowing you to interact with other players if you choose. Play Games will track your activity for daily streaks, which will be shown on your profile and unlock new Play Points rewards. Your profile will also display your in-game achievements.</p>
<p>Your gaming exploits can also span multiple platforms. Google Play Games for PC is officially leaving beta. Google says there are now 200,000 games that work across mobile and PC, and even more PC-friendly titles, like <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>, are on the way. Your stats and streaks will apply across both mobile and PC as long as the title comes from the Play Store.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/googles-big-play-store-revamp-includes-better-gamer-profiles-gemini-live-in-game-help/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Volvo is undergoing something of a restructuring. The automaker wants to be fully electric by 2040, but for that to happen, it needs to remain in business until then. Earlier this year, that meant layoffs, but today, Volvo announced it has big plans for its North American factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina.</p>
<p>Volvo has been making cars in South Carolina since 2017, starting with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/10/the-2019-volvo-s60-is-swedish-style-at-a-surprisingly-good-price/">S60 sedan</a>—a decision I always found slightly curious given that US car buyers had already given up on sedans by that point in favor of crossovers and SUVs. S60 production ended last summer, and these days, the plant builds the large electric <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-volvo-ex90-a-low-key-luxury-electric-suv/">EX90 SUV</a> and the related <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-polestar-3-drives-sporty-looks-sharp-can-be-a-little-annoying/">Polestar 3</a>.</p>
<p>The company is far from fully utilizing the Ridgeville plant, though, which has an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles. When the turnaround plan was first announced this July, Volvo revealed it would start building the next midsize XC60 in South Carolina—a wise move given the Trump tariffs and the importance of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/the-volvo-xc60-recharge-benefits-from-bigger-hybrid-battery/">this model</a> to Volvo's sales figures here.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/volvo-says-it-has-big-plans-for-south-carolina-factory/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX scored its 500th landing of a Falcon 9 first stage booster on an otherwise routine flight earlier this month, sending 28 Starlink communications satellites into orbit. Barring any unforeseen problems, SpaceX will mark the 500th re-flight of a Falcon first stage later this year.</p>
<p>A handful of other US companies, including Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Relativity Space, and Stoke Space, are on the way to replicating or building on SpaceX's achievements in recycling rocket parts. These launch providers are racing a medley of Chinese rocket builders to become the second company to land and reuse a first stage booster.</p>
<p>But it will be many years—perhaps a decade or longer—until anyone else matches the kinds of numbers SpaceX is racking up in the realm of reusable rockets. SpaceX's dominance in this field is one of the most important advantages the United States has over China as competition between the two nations extends into space, US Space Force officials said Monday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/us-intel-officials-cite-reusable-launch-as-difference-maker-with-china/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2024, the US Supreme Court unanimously <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-842_6kg7.pdf">ruled to defend</a> a pretty obvious idea about free speech: viz., that the government cannot punish people or companies simply for saying things that government officials dislike or disagree with. Being a media organization, this principle is of fundamental importance to Ars Technica.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nearly one year on, the government is routinely trying to censor voices it doesn't like. The recent blow-up surrounding late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel is just one of the most obvious examples of the new censorship regime. But the case also shows that, even where courts do not act, the public can still successfully push for change.</p>
<h2>Disfavored speech</h2>
<p>Here's how Justice Sonia Sotomayor put the basic free speech principle last year:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/kimmel-censorship-fiasco-shows-that-protests-still-matter-and-can-still-work/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a press event alongside Trump, Kennedy said that the Food and Drug Administration will work to update the drug's safety label and notify physicians of the concerns.
