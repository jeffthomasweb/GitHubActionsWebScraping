              <![CDATA[<p>Drinking alcohol is bad in many ways; raising a glass can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/more-cancer-less-death-new-alcohol-risk-reviews-offer-conflicting-takeaways/">raise your risks of various health problems</a>, such as accidental injuries, liver diseases, high blood pressure, and several types of cancers. But, it's not all bad—in fact, it's surprisingly good for your cholesterol levels, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831319">a study published today in JAMA Network Open</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers at Harvard University led the study, and it included nearly 58,000 adults in Japan who were followed for up to a year using a database of medical records from routine checkups. Researchers found that when people switched from being nondrinkers to drinkers during the study, they saw a drop in their "bad" cholesterol—aka low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or LDL.  Meanwhile, their "good" cholesterol—aka high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or HDL—went up when they began imbibing. HDL levels went up so much, that it actually beat out improvements typically seen with medications, the researchers noted.</p>
<p>On the other hand, drinkers who stopped drinking during the study saw the opposite effect: Upon giving up booze, their bad cholesterol went up and their good cholesterol went down.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/large-study-shows-drinking-alcohol-is-good-for-your-cholesterol-levels/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Opinion: The long-rumored Sonos streaming box wasn't a good idea anyway. ]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Sonos has canceled plans to release a streaming box, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/628297/sonos-pinewood-streaming-box-canceled">The Verge</a> reported today. The audio company never publicly confirmed that it was making a streaming set-top box, but rumors of its impending release have been floating around <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/sonos-plans-400-500-headphones-tv-set-top-box-video-roam-2-new-sound-bar">since November 2023</a>. With everything that both Sonos and streaming users have going on right now, though, a Sonos-branded rival to the Apple TV 4K wasn’t a good idea anyway.</p>
<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman was the first to report on Sonos’ purported streaming ambitions. He reported that Sonos’ device would be a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/sonos-plans-roku-like-tv-streaming-box-and-airpods-max-like-headphones/">black box that cost $150 to $200</a>.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seemed like a reasonable idea. Sonos was facing increased competition for wireless speakers from big names like Apple and Bose. Meanwhile, Sonos speaker sales growth had slowed down, making portfolio diversification seem like a prudent way to protect business.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/sonos-reportedly-cancels-its-plans-for-an-apple-tv-streaming-box-rival/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a little over three months, Intel has a new CEO to replace <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-steps-down-after-terrible-no-good-very-bad-year/">ousted former CEO Pat Gelsinger</a>. Intel's board <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312399008/en/Intel-Appoints-Lip-Bu-Tan-as-Chief-Executive-Officer">announced</a> that Lip-Bu Tan will begin as Intel CEO on March 18, taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus.</p>
<p>Gelsinger was booted from the CEO position by Intel's board on December 2 after several quarters of losses, rounds of layoffs, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/intel-introduced-bitcoin-mining-chips-a-year-ago-and-theyre-already-going-away/">canceled</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/intel-is-apparently-winding-down-its-nuc-mini-pcs-after-more-than-a-decade/">spun-off</a> side projects. Gelsinger sought to turn Intel into a foundry company that also manufactured chips for fabless third-party chip design companies, putting it into competition with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(TSMC), Samsung, and others, a plan that Intel said it was still committed to when it let Gelsinger go.</p>
<p>Intel said that Zinsner would stay on as executive vice president and CFO, and Johnston Holthaus would remain CEO of the Intel Products Group, which is mainly responsible for Intel's consumer products. These were the positions both executives held before serving as interim co-CEOs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/new-intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-will-pick-up-where-pat-gelsinger-left-off/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have discovered multiple Android apps, some that were available in Google Play after passing the company’s security vetting, that surreptitiously uploaded sensitive user information to spies working for the North Korean government.</p>
<p>Samples of the malware—named KoSpy by Lookout, the security firm that discovered it—masquerade as utility apps for managing files, app or OS updates, and device security. Behind the interfaces, the apps can collect a variety of information including SMS messages, call logs, location, files, nearby audio, and screenshots and send them to servers controlled by North Korean intelligence personnel. The apps target English language and Korean language speakers and have been available in at least two Android app marketplaces, including Google Play.</p>

<p>You might remember the truly bizarre 2020 press conference held—for no discernible reason—at Four Seasons Total Landscaping, a half block off Cottman Avenue, where a not-yet-<a href="https://apnews.com/article/giuliani-new-york-disbarred-81b327f9ab1f98548cb888f8e652c9a8">disbarred</a> Rudy Giuliani led an farcical ensemble of characters in an event so weird it has been immortalized in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Seasons_Total_Landscaping_press_conference">own, quite lengthy, Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
<p>Then in 2023, a truck carrying gasoline caught fire just a block away, right where Cottman passes under I-95. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Interstate_95_highway_collapse">resulting fire damaged I-95 in both directions</a>, bringing down several lanes and closing I-95 completely for some time.

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, a ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee accused the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of "misusing law enforcement" to claw back climate funds and "humor" Donald Trump’s "vindictive political whims."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-launches-inquiry-into-potential-law-enforcement-misconduct-around-epa-climate-funding-freeze/">letter</a> to Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) requested information about a supposed criminal investigation into the EPA's $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whitehouse alleged that there was no basis to freeze the funding. He claimed that Bondi and Patel "reverted to a pretextual criminal investigation to provide an alternative excuse to interfere" after "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced via social media that he had 'found' $20 billion in EPA funds at Citibank and falsely suggested that the use of a financial agent agreement—a commonly used financial tool that presidential administrations have used for centuries—was improper."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/epa-accused-of-faking-criminal-investigation-to-claw-back-climate-funds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Right now, quantum computers are small and error-prone compared to where they'll likely be in a few years. Even within those limitations, however, there have been regular claims that the hardware can perform in ways that are impossible to match with classical computation (one of the more recent examples coming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/">just last year</a>). In most cases to date, however, those claims were quickly followed by some tuning and optimization of classical algorithms that boosted their performance, making them competitive once again.</p>
<p>Today, we have a new entry into the claims department—or rather a new claim by an old entry. D-Wave is a company that makes quantum annealers, specialized hardware that is most effective when applied to a class of optimization problems. The new work shows that the hardware can track the behavior of a quantum system called an Ising model far more efficiently than any of the current state-of-the-art classical algorithms.</p>
<p>Knowing what will likely come next, however, the team behind the work writes, "We hope and expect that our results will inspire novel numerical techniques for quantum simulation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/d-wave-quantum-annealers-solve-problems-classical-algorithms-struggle-with/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Google Gemini Robotics AI model gives robots fine motor skills and adaptability for general world use.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Google DeepMind <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-robotics-brings-ai-into-the-physical-world/">announced</a> two new AI models designed to control robots: Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER. The company claims these models will help robots of many shapes and sizes understand and interact with the physical world more effectively and delicately than previous systems, paving the way for applications such as humanoid robot assistants.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that even though hardware for robot platforms appears to be advancing at a steady pace (well, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/dangling-twitching-human-robot-with-synthetic-muscles-makes-its-debut/">maybe not always</a>), creating a capable AI model that can pilot these robots autonomously through novel scenarios with safety and precision has proven elusive. What the industry calls "embodied AI" is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-announces-moonshot-to-create-embodied-human-level-ai-in-robot-form/">moonshot goal</a> of Nvidia, for example, and it remains a holy grail that could potentially turn robotics into general-use laborers in the physical world.</p>
<p>Along those lines, Google's new models build upon its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Gemini 2.0</a> large language model foundation, adding capabilities specifically for robotic applications. Gemini Robotics includes what Google calls "vision-language-action" (VLA) abilities, allowing it to process visual information, understand language commands, and generate physical movements. By contrast, Gemini Robotics-ER focuses on "embodied reasoning" with enhanced spatial understanding, letting roboticists connect it to their existing robot control systems.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/googles-origami-folding-ai-brain-may-power-new-wave-of-humanoid-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Trade Commission is moving to push back a trial set to determine if <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-sues-amazon-over-4-page-6-click-15-option-prime-cancellation-process/">Amazon tricked customers into signing up for Prime</a> subscriptions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At a Zoom status hearing on Wednesday, the FTC officially asked US District Judge John Chun to delay the trial. According to the FTC's attorney, Jonathan Cohen, the agency needs two months to prepare beyond the September 22 start date, blaming recent "staffing and budgetary shortfalls" stemming from the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/ftc-asks-to-delay-amazon-prime-deceptive-practices-case-citing-staffing-shortfalls.html">reported.</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division, and on our case team," Cohen said, explaining that "there is an extremely severe resource shortfall in terms of money and personnel," Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-12/ftc-seeks-delay-in-amazon-prime-case-over-resource-constraints">reported</a>. Cuts are apparently so bad, Cohen told Chun that the FTC is stuck with a $1 cap on any government credit card charges and "may not be able to purchase the transcript from Wednesday’s hearing," Bloomberg reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/doges-extremely-severe-ftc-cuts-prompt-request-to-delay-amazon-trial/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hand clapping is ubiquitous behavior for humans across time and cultures, serving many different purposes: to signify approval with applause, for instance, or to keep time to music. Acousticians often use a hand clap as a cheap substitute for pricey equipment to make acoustic measurements in architecture. While the basic physical mechanism is simple, the underlying physical mechanisms are less well-understood.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.013259">new paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Research provides experimental support for the hypothesis that hand clapping essentially acts like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance">Helmholtz resonator</a>—akin to the hum generated by blowing across the top of a bottle, or the hiss one hears when holding a conch shell to one's ear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2624-599X/2/2/15">In 2020</a>, engineers Nikolaos Papadakis and Georgios Stavroulakis, both at the Technical University of Crete, recruited 24 students to clap their hands once in different venues, varying their hand configurations in 11 different ways—changing the angle of the hands with respect to one another, for instance, or changing how many fingers of one hand overlapped with the fingers or palms of the other.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-ones-hand-configuration-affects-the-sound-of-clapping/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Most new AI models go big—more parameters, more tokens, more everything. Google's newest AI model has some big numbers, but it's also tuned for efficiency. <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-3/">Google says</a> the Gemma 3 open source model is the best in the world for running on a single GPU or AI accelerator. The latest Gemma model is aimed primarily at developers who need to create AI to run in various environments, be it a data center or a smartphone. And you can tinker with Gemma 3 right now.</p>
<p>Google claims Gemma 3 will be able to tackle more challenging tasks compared to the older open source Google models. The context window, a measure of how much data you can input, has been expanded to 128,000 from 8,192 tokens in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-goes-open-ai-with-gemma-a-free-open-weights-chatbot-family/">previous Gemma models</a>. Gemma 3, which is based on the proprietary Gemini 2.0 foundation, is also a multimodal model capable of processing text, high-resolution images, and even video. Google also has a new solution for image safety called ShieldGemma 2, which can be integrated with Gemma to help block unwanted images in three content categories: dangerous, sexual, or violent.</p>
<p>Most of the popular AI models you've heard of run on collections of servers in a data center, filled to the brim with AI computing power. Many of them are far too large to run on the kind of hardware you have at home or in the office. The release of the first Gemma models last year gave developers and enthusiasts another low-hardware option to compete with the likes of Meta Llama3. There has been a drive for efficiency in AI lately, with models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">DeepSeek R1</a> gaining traction on the basis of lower computing costs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-new-gemma-3-ai-model-is-optimized-to-run-on-a-single-gpu/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Lately, SpaceX founder Elon Musk has taken an aggressive posture toward Europe. He has called for the United States <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-09/musk-calls-on-us-to-quit-nato-stop-paying-for-defense-of-europe?embedded-checkout=true">to exit NATO</a>, a strategic alliance that has been the bedrock of trans-Atlantic cooperation since the end of World War II. Musk has also championed right-wing populism that seeks to topple existing governments on the continent.</p>
<p>And then there's Musk's <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/musk-twitter-x-zelensky-ukraine-russia-war-b2713453.html">increasingly antagonistic</a> attitude toward Ukraine, a country viewed by many Europeans as a bulwark against further Russian aggression. This threatens the availability of a vital link in Ukraine's military, Starlink.</p>
<p>Musk's world-class satellite technology has provided lifesaving connectivity to citizens and soldiers in Ukraine. It has increased the country's offensive capabilities. And yet Musk could shut off his Starlink service anywhere in the world with an email.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/if-starlink-is-turned-off-in-ukraine-are-there-any-good-alternatives/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Robotics firm iRobot, originator of the robotic vacuum Roomba facing stiff competition from lower-priced competitors, <a href="https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/irobot-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial">told investors Tuesday</a> that there was "substantial doubt" about the company's survival "as a going concern" in the next year or so.</p>
<p>Investors took iRobot at its word, and its stock price had fallen nearly 40 percent as of 10:20 am Wednesday from the day before. The dire accounting language and market reaction are nothing new for tech firms, but iRobot's annual report suggests deeper issues than investor confidence. The company saw revenue drop 47 percent in the fourth quarter, it is actively seeking to renegotiate its largest loans, and it has launched a "formal strategic review" to consider refinancing, sale, or other alternatives.</p>
<h2>The shaky world of consumer robotics</h2>
<p>iRobot's fortunes have changed dramatically since 2022, when Amazon announced a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/amazon-buys-roomba-maker-for-1-7-billion/">$1.7 billion bid</a> to buy the struggling but prominent firm.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/irobot-says-there-is-substantial-doubt-about-it-as-a-going-concern/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, Toyota and Lexus debuted some improved and some new electric vehicles. The event was focused on the European market, where battery EV penetration is relatively high, and I wouldn't expect either the Urban Cruiser or C-HR+ crossovers to show up on sale in the US. But we'll likely find the upgrades to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/the-2023-toyota-bz4x-review-not-as-bad-as-the-horror-stories-have-it/">Toyota bZ4x</a> and the closely related <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/lexus-2023-rz-450e-disappoints-offering-poor-ev-range-and-a-bumpy-ride/">Lexus RZ</a>, or at least some of them, in North American models at some point.</p>
<p>The revised bZ4x will come in three powertrain options, at least in the EU, all with new battery packs. There's a 165 hp (123 kW) front-wheel drive version coupled to a smaller-capacity 57.7 kWh battery pack (which I would not expect to come to the US), and then 221 hp (165 kW) FWD and 337 (252 kW) all-wheel drive options, both of which use a new 73.1 kWh battery pack.</p>
<p>For comparison, the bZ4xs that went on sale in the US several years ago are offered with either a 71.4 kWh pack for FWD or a 72.8 kWh pack for AWD versions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/toyota-and-lexus-tweak-their-evs-for-eu-and-likely-the-us/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>With all the announcements from automakers planning for more gasoline and hybrid cars in their future lineups, you'd think that electric vehicles had stopped selling. While that might be increasingly true for Tesla, everyone else is more than picking up the slack. According to analysts at Rho Motion, global EV sales are up 30 percent this year already. Even here in the US, EV sales were still up 28 percent compared to 2024, despite particularly EV-unfriendly headwinds.</p>
<p>Getting ahead of those unfriendly winds may actually be driving the sales bump in the US, where EV sales only grew by less than 8 percent last year, for contrast. "American drivers bought 30 percent more electric vehicles than they had by this time last year, making use of the final months of IRA tax breaks before the incentives are expected to be pulled later this year," said Charles Lester, Rho Motion data manager.</p>
<p>With the expected loss of government incentives and the prospect of new tariffs that will add tens of thousands of dollars to new car prices, now is probably a good time to buy an EV if you think you're going to want or need one.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/despite-everything-us-ev-sales-are-up-28-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"The future of podcasting shouldn't be locked behind walled gardens," <a href="https://blog.pocketcasts.com/2025/03/11/webplayer/">writes the team at Pocket Casts</a>. To push that point forward, Pocket Casts, owned by the company behind WordPress, Automattic Inc., has made its <a href="http://play.pocketcasts.com/">web player free to everyone</a>.</p>
<p>Previously available only to logged-in Pocket Casts users paying $4 per month, Pocket Casts now offers nearly any public-facing podcast feed for streaming, along with controls like playback speed and playlist queueing. If you create an account, you can also sync your playback progress, manage your queue, bookmark episode moments, and save your subscription list and listening preferences. The free access also applies to its clients for <a href="https://pocketcasts.com/downloads/windows/">Windows</a> and <a href="https://pocketcasts.com/downloads/mac/">Mac</a>.</p>
<p>"Podcasting is one of the last open corners of the Internet, and we’re here to keep it that way," Pocket Casts' blog post reads. For those not fully tuned into the podcasting market, this and other statements in the post—like sharing "without needing a specific platform's approval" and "podcasts belong to the people, not corporations"—are largely shots at Spotify, and to a much lesser extent other streaming services, which have sought to wrap podcasting's originally open and RSS-based nature inside proprietary markets and formats.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/pocket-casts-makes-its-web-player-free-takes-shots-at-spotify-and-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, MMFA filed a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MMFA-v-X-Complaint-3-10-25.pdf">complaint</a> in a US district court in San Francisco, alleging that X violated its own terms of service by suing MMFA in Texas, Dublin, and Singapore.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">"X Corp.’s decision to file in multiple jurisdictions across the globe is intended to chill Media Matters’ reporting and drive up costs—both of which it has achieved—and it is directly foreclosed by X’s own Terms of Service," MMFA's complaint said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/xs-globe-trotting-defense-of-ads-on-nazi-posts-violates-tos-media-matters-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The AI industry is doing its best to will "agents"—pieces of AI-driven software that can perform multistep actions on your behalf—into reality. Several tech companies, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">including Google</a>, have emphasized agentic features recently, and in January, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/01/sam-altman-says-we-are-now-confident-we-know-how-to-build-agi/">wrote</a> that 2025 would be the year AI agents "join the workforce."</p>
<p>OpenAI is working to make that promise happen. On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/">unveiled</a> a new "<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?api-mode=responses">Responses API</a>" designed to help software developers create AI agents that can perform tasks independently using the company's AI models. The Responses API will eventually replace the current <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants">Assistants API</a>, which OpenAI plans to retire in the first half of 2026.</p>
<p>With the new offering, users can develop custom AI agents that <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search">scan company files</a> with a file search utility that rapidly checks company databases (with OpenAI promising not to train its models on these files) and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use">navigates websites</a>—similar to functions available through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">OpenAI's Operator</a> agent, whose underlying Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model developers can also access to enable automation of tasks like data entry and other operations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openai-pushes-ai-agent-capabilities-with-new-developer-api/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple on Tuesday patched a critical zero-day vulnerability in virtually all iPhones and iPad models it supports and said it may have been exploited in “an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals” using older versions of iOS.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24201, resides in Webkit, the browser engine driving Safari and all other browsers developed for iPhones and iPads. Devices affected include the iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later. The vulnerability stems from a bug that wrote to out-of-bounds memory locations.</p>
<h2>Supplementary fix</h2>
<p>“Impact: Maliciously crafted web content may be able to break out of Web Content sandbox,” Apple wrote in a bare-bones <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122281">advisory</a>. “This is a supplementary fix for an attack that was blocked in iOS 17.2. (Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 17.2.)”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/apple-patches-0-day-exploited-in-extremely-sophisticated-attack/">Read full article</a></p>
