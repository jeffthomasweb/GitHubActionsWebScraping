              <![CDATA[<p>Russian nation-state hackers have followed an unusual path to gather intel in the country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine—appropriating the infrastructure of fellow threat actors and using it to infect electronic devices its adversary’s military personnel are using on the front line.</p>
<p>On at least two occasions this year, the Russian hacking group tracked under names including Turla, Waterbug, Snake, and Venomous Bear has used servers and malware used by separate threat groups in attacks targeting front-line Ukrainian military forces, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/11/frequent-freeloader-part-ii-russian-actor-secret-blizzard-using-tools-of-other-groups-to-attack-ukraine/">said</a> Wednesday. In one case, Secret Blizzard—the name Microsoft uses to track the group—leveraged the infrastructure of a cybercrime group tracked as Storm-1919. In the other, Secret Blizzard appropriated resources of Storm-1837, a Russia-based threat actor with a history of targeting Ukrainian drone operators.</p>
<p>The more common means for initial access by Secret Blizzard is spear phishing followed by lateral movement through server-side and edge device compromises. Microsoft said that the threat actor’s pivot here is unusual but not unique. Company investigators still don’t know how Secret Blizzard obtained access to the infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/russia-takes-unusual-route-to-hack-starlink-connected-devices-in-ukraine/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Software reference could point to a release sooner rather than later.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The macOS 15.2 update that was released earlier today came with a handful of new features, plus something unexpected: an apparently accidental reference to the upcoming M4 MacBook Airs. MacRumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/macos-sequoia-15-2-m4-macbook-air-leak/">reports</a> that the "Mac16,12" and "Mac16,13" model identifiers reference 13- and 15-inch models of the M4 Air and that both are coming in 2025.</p>
<p>That a MacBook Air refresh is planned for next year isn't much of a surprise at this point—in reporting that pretty much nailed the details of the first M4 Macs, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/report-first-wave-of-m4-macs-including-smaller-mac-mini-coming-november-1/">has said</a> that the Air, the Mac Studio, and the Mac Pro are all slated for updates throughout 2025.</p>
<p>But a reference in the current release of macOS could point to a launch sooner rather than later; the M4 Mac mini was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/report-big-batch-of-m4-macs-and-cheaper-ipads-on-tap-for-october-apple-event/">referenced in a macOS update</a> in mid-September around a month and a half before it was released. The M3 Airs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/review-apples-efficient-m3-macbook-airs-are-just-about-as-good-as-laptops-get/">came out in March this year</a>, but Apple has been known to put out new Macs as early as January in recent years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/errant-reference-in-macos-15-2-seems-to-confirm-m4-macbook-airs-for-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Photobucket was <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Pierce-v-Photobucket-Complaint-12-11-24.pdf">sued</a> Wednesday after a recent privacy policy update revealed plans to sell users' photos—including biometric identifiers like face and iris scans—to companies training generative AI models.</p>
<p>The proposed class action seeks to stop Photobucket from selling users' data without first obtaining written consent, alleging that Photobucket either intentionally or negligently failed to comply with strict privacy laws in states like Illinois, New York, and California by claiming it can't reliably determine users' geolocation.</p>
<p>Two separate classes could be protected by the litigation. The first includes anyone who ever uploaded a photo between 2003—when Photobucket was founded—and May 1, 2024. Another potentially even larger class includes any non-users depicted in photographs uploaded to Photobucket, whose biometric data has also allegedly been sold without consent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/photobucket-sold-users-biometric-data-without-consent-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Advertising has become a focal point of TV software. We’re seeing companies that sell TV sets be increasingly interested in leveraging TV operating systems (OSes) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/">for ads and tracking</a>. This has led to bold new strategies, like an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/an-ad-giant-wants-to-control-your-next-tvs-operating-system/">adtech firm launching a TV OS</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/lg-tvs-continue-down-advertising-rabbit-hole-with-new-screensaver-ads/">ads on TV screensavers</a>.</p>
<p>With new short films set to debut on its free streaming service tomorrow, TV-maker TCL is positing a new approach to monetizing TV owners and to film and TV production that sees reduced costs through reliance on generative AI and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/streaming-industry-has-unprecedented-surveillance-manipulation-capabilities/">targeted ads</a>.</p>
<p>TCL's five short films are part of a company initiative to get people more accustomed to movies and TV shows made with generative AI. The movies will “be promoted and featured prominently on” TCL's free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) service, TCLtv+, TCL announced in November. TCLtv+has hundreds of FAST channels and comes on TCL-brand TVs using various OSes, including Google TV and Roku OS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/tcl-tvs-will-use-films-made-with-generative-ai-to-push-targeted-ads/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/">unveiled</a> Gemini 2.0, the next generation of its AI-model family, starting with an experimental release called Gemini 2.0 Flash. The model family can generate text, images, and speech while processing multiple types of input including text, images, audio, and video. It's similar to multimodal AI models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>, which powers OpenAI's ChatGPT.</p>
<p>"Gemini 2.0 Flash builds on the success of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/google-strikes-back-at-openai-with-project-astra-ai-agent-prototype/">1.5 Flash</a>, our most popular model yet for developers, with enhanced performance at similarly fast response times," said Google in a statement. "Notably, 2.0 Flash even outperforms <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/">1.5 Pro</a> on key benchmarks, at twice the speed."</p>
<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash—which is the smallest model of the 2.0 family in terms of parameter count—launches today through Google's developer platforms like Gemini API, AI Studio, and Vertex AI. However, its image generation and text-to-speech features remain limited to early access partners until January 2025. Google plans to integrate the tech into products like Android Studio, Chrome DevTools, and Firebase.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple has announced that it will be releasing the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 updates to the public later this afternoon, following weeks of beta testing for developers and users. As with iOS 18.1, the headlining features are new additions to Apple Intelligence, mainly the image-generation capabilities: Image Playground for general images, and "Genmoji" for making custom images in the style of Apple's built-in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/face-with-bags-under-eyes-sets-the-tone-for-new-unicode-16-0-emoji-update/">Unicode-based</a> emoji characters.</p>
<p>Other AI features include "Image Wand," which will take sketched images from the Notes app and turn them into a "polished image" using context clues from other notes; and ChatGPT integration for the Writing Tools feature.</p>
<p>The updates also include a long list of bug fixes and security updates, for those who don't care about Apple Intelligence. Safari gets better data importing and exporting support, an HTTPS Priority feature that "upgrades URLs to HTTPS whenever possible," and a download status indicator for iPhones with a Dynamic Island. Mail in iOS offers to automatically sort messages to bring important ones to the top of your inbox. There are also various tweaks and improvements for the Photos, Podcasts, Voice Memos, and Stocks apps, while the Weather app in macOS can optionally display the weather in your menu bar.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/ios-18-2-macos-15-2-updates-arrive-today-with-image-and-emoji-generation/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you've been too busy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-captures-the-feel-of-a-great-indy-movie/">punching virtual Nazis</a> to take part in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/win-hardware-collectibles-and-more-in-the-2024-ars-technica-charity-drive/">this year's Ars Technica Charity Drive sweepstakes</a>, don't worry. You still have time to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $4,000 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win).</p>
<p>In the first three days of the drive, over 100 readers have contributed almost $9,500 to either the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is now leading in the donation totals by about $1,000). That's a long way off from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/">2020's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Thursday, January 2, 2025.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/reminder-donate-to-win-swag-in-our-annual-charity-drive-sweepstakes-14/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Eleven months after the <em>Ingenuity</em> helicopter made its final flight on Mars, engineers and scientists at NASA and a private company that helped build the flying vehicle said they have identified what probably caused it to crash on the surface of Mars.</p>
<p>In short, the helicopter's on-board navigation sensors were unable to discern enough features in the relatively smooth surface of Mars to determine its position, so when it touched down, it did so moving horizontally. This caused the vehicle to tumble, snapping off all four of the helicopter's blades.</p>
<h2>Delving into the root cause</h2>
<p>It is not easy to conduct a forensic analysis like this on Mars, which is typically about 100 million miles from Earth. <em>Ingenuity</em> carried no black box on board, so investigators have had to piece together their findings from limited data and imagery.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/nasa-believes-it-understands-why-ingenuity-crashed-on-mars/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google reportedly wants the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to end Microsoft's exclusive cloud deal with OpenAI that requires anyone wanting access to OpenAI's models to go through Microsoft's servers.</p>
<p>Someone "directly involved" in Google's effort <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-asks-ftc-to-kill-microsofts-exclusive-cloud-deal-with-openai">told The Information</a> that Google's request came after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ftc-to-launch-investigation-into-microsofts-cloud-business/">FTC began broadly probing</a> how Microsoft's cloud computing business practices may be harming competition.</p>
<p>As part of the FTC's investigation, the agency apparently asked Microsoft's biggest rivals if the exclusive OpenAI deal was "preventing them from competing in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market," multiple sources told The Information. Google reportedly was among those arguing that the deal harms competition by saddling rivals with extra costs and blocking them from hosting OpenAI's latest models themselves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/report-microsofts-exclusive-deal-with-openai-harms-competition-google-told-ftc/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Recently, Congress' Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic released <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/final-report-covid-select-concludes-2-year-investigation-issues-500-page-final-report-on-lessons-learned-and-the-path-forward/">its final report</a>. The basic gist is about what you'd expect from a Republican-run committee, in that it trashes a lot of Biden-era policies and state-level responses while praising a number of Trump's decisions. But what's perhaps most striking is how it tackles a variety of scientific topics, including many where there's a large, complicated body of evidence.</p>
<p>Notably, this includes conclusions about the origin of the pandemic, which the report describes as "most likely" emerging from a lab rather than being the product of the zoonotic transfer between an animal species and humans. The latter explanation is favored by many scientists.</p>
<p>The conclusions themselves aren't especially interesting; they're expected from a report with partisan aims. But the method used to reach those conclusions is often striking: The Republican majority engages in a process of systematically changing the standard of evidence needed for it to reach a conclusion. For a conclusion the report's authors favor, they'll happily accept evidence from computer models or arguments from an editorial in the popular press; for conclusions they disfavor, they demand double-blind controlled clinical trials.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/congressional-republicans-conclude-sars-cov-2-originated-in-a-lab-leak/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After spending more than $10 billion to try to develop an autonomous robotaxi, General Motors is now calling time on the endeavor. On Tuesday afternoon, the automaker announced that it is done investing in Cruise's robotaxi development and will instead combine the startup's technical team with its internal efforts at GM.</p>
<p>After several years, GM has accepted the inevitable: Given the costs, there's no way to build a profitable robotaxi business. This year, GM will have spent around $2 billion on Cruise.</p>
<p>"GM is committed to delivering the best driving experiences to our customers in a disciplined and capital efficient manner," said Mary Barra, chair and CEO of GM. "Cruise has been an early innovator in autonomy, and the deeper integration of our teams, paired with GM’s strong brands, scale, and manufacturing strength, will help advance our vision for the future of transportation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/seeing-no-road-to-profit-gm-shutters-cruise/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There is, of course, no quantitative way to rank amazing things that happen in space. We cannot measure their absolute magnitude nor assign them a numerical value, and trying to do so is something of a fool’s errand. Are we fools? Maybe. But we're fools who like to have a little fun.</p>
<p>Understandably, then, this list is completely subjective. How else could one rank events that span the cosmos, from gravitational wave detection to the launch of humans into suborbital space? What follows is a list of the most incredible, surprising, impressive, and demanding achievements and developments in space and spaceflight during the first 25 years of the 2000s—as selected by the editors of Ars Technica.</p>
<p>You will probably disagree with some choices and their ranking, and that’s totally fine. That’s what the comments section is for. But the point here is simply to bring some of these incredible moments back onto the front burner so we can all bask in their glory once again. Each of these achievements deserves our celebration and appreciation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/ranking-the-25-coolest-things-in-space-so-far-during-the-21st-century/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Startup Embodied is closing down, and its product, an $800 robot for kids ages 5 to 10, will soon be bricked.</p>
<p>Embodied blamed its closure on a failed “critical funding round." On its <a href="https://moxierobot.com/pages/closing-faqs">website</a>, it explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We had secured a lead investor who was prepared to close the round. However, at the last minute, they withdrew, leaving us with no viable options to continue operations. Despite our best efforts to secure alternative funding, we were unable to find a replacement in time to sustain operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company didn’t provide further details about the pulled funding. Embodied’s previous backers have included Intel Capital, Toyota AI Ventures, Amazon Alexa Fund, Sony Innovation Fund, and Vulcan Capital, but we don't know who the lead investor mentioned above is.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/startup-will-brick-800-emotional-support-robot-for-kids-without-refunds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Since the dawn of the generative AI era a few years ago, the march of technology—toward what tech companies hope will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/ai-superintelligence-looms-in-sam-altmans-new-essay-on-the-intelligence-age/">replace human intellectual labor</a>—has continuously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/ceos-say-generative-ai-will-result-in-job-cuts-in-2024/">sparked angst</a> about the future role humans will play in the job market. Will we all be replaced by machines?</p>
<p>A Y-Combinator-backed company called <a href="https://www.artisan.co/">Artisan</a>, which sells customer service and sales workflow software, recently launched a provocative billboard campaign in San Francisco playing on that angst, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-firms-stop-hiring-humans-billboard-campaign-sparks-outrage-2000536368">reports Gizmodo</a>. It features the slogan "Stop Hiring Humans." The company markets its software products as "AI Employees" or "Artisans."</p>
<p>The company's billboards feature messages that might inspire nightmares among workers, like "Artisans won't complain about work-life balance" and "The era of AI employees is here." And they're on display to the same human workforce the ads suggest replacing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/ai-company-trolls-san-francisco-with-billboards-saying-stop-hiring-humans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Micron Technology will receive more than $6.1 billion after the US Department of Commerce finalized one of the largest CHIPS Act awards ever to "the only US-based manufacturer of memory chips," Vice President Kamala Harris said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/10/statement-from-vice-president-kamala-harris-on-chips-and-science-act-investments-in-micron-technology/">press statement</a>.</p>
<p>Micron will use the funding to construct "several state-of-the-art memory chips facilities" in New York and Idaho, Harris said. The chipmaker has committed to a "$125 billion investment over the next few decades" and promised to create "at least 20,000 jobs," Harris confirmed.</p>
<p>Additionally, Micron "agreed to preliminary terms for an additional investment of $275 million to expand" its facility in Manassas, Virginia, Harris confirmed. Those facilities will mostly be used to manufacture chips for automotive and defense industries, Harris noted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/microns-6b-chips-funding-should-have-more-strings-attached-critics-say/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A location-tracking company that sells its services to police departments is apparently using addresses and coordinates of doctors' and lawyers' offices and other types of locations to help cops compile lists of places visited by suspects, according to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/location-data-firm-offers-to-help-cops-track-targets-via-doctor-visits/">404 Media report</a> published today.</p>
<p>Fog Data Science, which <a href="https://fogdatascience.com/">says</a> it "harness[es] the power of data to safeguard national security and provide law enforcement with actionable intelligence," has a "Project Intake Form" that asks police for locations where potential suspects and their mobile devices might be found. The form, obtained by 404 Media, instructs police officers to list locations of friends' and families' houses, associates' homes and offices, and the offices of a person's doctor or lawyer.</p>
<p>Fog Data has a trove of location data derived from smartphones' geolocation signals, which would already include doctors' offices and many other types of locations even before police ask for information on a specific person. Details provided by police on the intake form seem likely to help Fog Data conduct more effective searches of its database to find out when suspects visited particular places. The form also asks police to identify the person of interest's name and/or known aliases and their "link to criminal activity."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/location-data-firm-helps-police-find-out-when-suspects-visited-their-doctor/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon started selling new cars today. The online retailer and Internet giant has had its sights on shifting metal for some time now, and if you live in one of 48 cities in the US, and you're looking for a new Hyundai, it's ready for your business.</p>
<p>Hyundai has been working with Amazon for several years on its digital experience, adding Alexa to its cars and showcasing its products at <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. But now, with Amazon Autos, customers can go ahead and buy the car, not just learn about it so they can go to a dealer well-informed.</p>
<p>In fact, the dealerships remain part of the process even with Amazon Autos—hence the fact that the service is not rolling out nationwide.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/amazon-gets-into-the-car-sales-game-starting-with-hyundai/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Are humans just squishy machines? Can an artificially intelligent robot create a true moral compass for itself? Is there a best time to play <em>The Talos Principle</em> again?</p>
<p>The answer to at least one of these questions is now somewhat answered. <em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened,</em> due in "Early 2025," will bundle the original critically acclaimed 2014 game, its <em>Road to Gehenna </em>DLC, and a new chapter, "In the Beginning," into an effectively definitive edition. Developer commentary and a level editor will also be packed in. But most of all, the whole game has been rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, bringing "vastly improved visuals" and quality-of-life boosts to the game, according to publisher Devolver Digital.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the oldest maxims in hacking is that once an attacker has physical access to a device, it’s game over for its security. The basis is sound. It doesn’t matter how locked down a phone, computer, or other machine is; if someone intent on hacking it gains the ability to physically manipulate it, the chances of success are all but guaranteed.</p>
<p>In the age of cloud computing, this widely accepted principle is no longer universally true. Some of the world’s most sensitive information—health records, financial account information, sealed legal documents, and the like—now often resides on servers that receive day-to-day maintenance from unknown administrators working in cloud centers thousands of miles from the companies responsible for safeguarding it.</p>
<h2>Bad (RAM) to the bone</h2>
<p>In response, chipmakers have begun baking protections into their silicon to provide assurances that even if a server has been physically tampered with or infected with malware, sensitive data funneled through virtual machines can’t be accessed without an encryption key that’s known only to the VM administrator. Under this scenario, admins inside the cloud provider, law enforcement agencies with a court warrant, and hackers who manage to compromise the server are out of luck.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/new-badram-attack-neuters-security-assurances-in-amd-epyc-processors/">Read full article</a></p>
