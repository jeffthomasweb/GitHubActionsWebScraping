                            <![CDATA[<p>It may be more tempting to take that aging Mac you've been coddling and put it out to pasture soon. Apple has announced an event for March 4, which in usual Apple fashion, it has branded a "Special Apple Experience." Also in usual Apple fashion, it has not come out and said what it's going to be announcing. We have a pretty good idea, though.</p>
<p>The event will kick off at 9AM ET on March 4—Ars will be on the ground in New York City to cover Apple's latest unveiling, whatever form it may take. Apple doesn't release most products on a set schedule, but some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/report-imminent-apple-hardware-updates-include-macbook-pro-ipads-and-iphone-17e/">recent speculation</a> about likely hardware updates can point us in the right direction.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/report-imminent-apple-hardware-updates-include-macbook-pro-ipads-and-iphone-17e/">reported</a> recently, the iPhone 17e may be making an appearance in Apple's lineup soon. This updated version of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/iphone-16e-review-the-most-expensive-cheap-iphone-yet/">budget-oriented iPhone</a> will have an A19 chip inside, similar to the one powering the base model iPhone 17. It may also add MagSafe charging. Don't expect to see a multi-camera array like you'd get on the more expensive Apple phones, though. Pricing will be the most important thing to watch for should Apple announce this phone. Right now, the non-Pro iPhone 16 and 17 (including the 16e) are all clustered in the $600-800 range. Another $599 budget iPhone won't make waves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/get-ready-for-new-macs-and-ipads-apple-announces-special-experience-on-march-4/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Best Buy employee in Florida was charged with fraud after allegedly using his manager's code to heavily discount nearly 150 items that he and his accomplices purchased and pawned.</p>
<p>It seems that the manager first started growing suspicious about "strange sales numbers" in December 2024, an ABC News affiliate in West Palm Beach <a href="https://www.wpbf.com/article/best-buy-employee-charged-fraud-palm-beach-gardens/70311367">reported</a>. Private investigators traced the weird sales back to a 36-year-old employee, Matthew Lettera, who allegedly conducted 97 discounted purchases for himself and 52 additional transactions for others. Some MacBooks were discounted as much as 99 percent, a local CW affiliate <a href="https://cw34.com/news/local/palm-beach-gardens-best-buy-employee-accused-of-118k-discount-scheme-loss-electronics-pawned-laptops-police-crime-retail-scam-six-figure-insider-theft-manager-code-investigation-news">reported</a>. In total, Best Buy lost more than $118,000 from the scheme.</p>
<p>According to a LinkedIn profile that matches Lettera's information, he started working at Best Buy in January 2020 after pivoting from career training as a chef.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/best-buy-worker-used-managers-code-to-get-99-off-macbooks-cops-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>ByteDance says that it's rushing to add safeguards to block Seedance 2.0 from generating iconic characters and deepfaking celebrities, after substantial Hollywood backlash after launching the latest version of its AI video tool.</p>
<p>The changes come after Disney and Paramount Skydance sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance urging the Chinese company to promptly end the allegedly vast and blatant infringement.</p>
<p>Studios claimed the infringement was widescale and immediate, with Seedance 2.0 users across social media sharing AI videos featuring copyrighted characters like Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and SpongeBob Square Pants. In its letter, Disney fumed that Seedance was "hijacking" its characters, accusing ByteDance of treating Disney characters like they were "free public domain clip art," Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/disney-bytedance-seedance">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/bytedance-backpedals-after-seedance-2-0-turned-hollywood-icons-into-ai-clip-art/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Heating accounts for nearly half of the global energy demand, and two-thirds of that is met by burning fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar energy is a possible alternative, but while we have become reasonably good at storing solar electricity in lithium-ion batteries, we’re not nearly as good at storing heat.</p>
<p>To store heat for days, weeks, or months, you need to trap the energy in the bonds of a molecule that can later release heat on demand. The approach to this particular chemistry problem is called molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. While it has been the next big thing for decades, it never really took off.</p>
<p>In a recent <em>Science</em> paper, a team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and UCLA demonstrate a breakthrough that might finally make MOST energy storage effective.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/dna-inspired-molecule-breaks-records-for-storing-solar-heat/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Michigan is taking on major oil and gas companies in court, joining nearly a dozen other states that have brought climate-related lawsuits against ExxonMobil and its industry peers. But Michigan’s approach is different: accusing Big Oil not of deceiving consumers or misrepresenting climate change risks, but of driving up energy costs by colluding to suppress competition from cleaner and cheaper technologies like solar power and electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The strategy is risky and might run into challenges, but it could potentially be a game changer if the state can overcome initial dismissal attempts by the industry defendants, legal experts say.</p>
<p>Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed the lawsuit last month in federal District Court against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute. The <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/ag/-/media/Project/Websites/AG/releases/2026/January/Michigan-Energy-Affordability-Complaint.pdf?rev=5fe0d3cf29174f30a7f4853ef1eb0c22&amp;hash=3242B297D226DCDD835DF7D328490E32">suit</a>, brought under federal and state antitrust laws, alleges a conspiracy to delay the transition to renewable energy and EVs and maintain market dominance of fossil fuels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/michigan-accuses-oil-companies-of-antitrust-violations-in-climate-change-lawsuit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">McLaren provided flights from Washington, DC, to Ivalo, Finland, and accommodation so Ars could drive its car on a frozen lake. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>SAARISELKÄ, FINLAND—If you're expecting it, the feeling in the pit of your stomach when the rear of your car breaks traction and begins to slide is rather pleasant. It's the same exhilaration we get from roller coasters, but when you're in the driver's seat, you're in charge of the ride.</p>
<p>When you're not expecting it, though, there's anxiety instead of excitement and, should the slide end with a crunch, a lot more negative emotions, too.</p>
<p>Thankfully, fewer and fewer drivers will have to experience that kind of scare thanks to the proliferation and sophistication of modern electronic stability and traction control systems. For more than 30 years, these electronic safety nets have grown in capability and became mandatory in the early 2010s, saving countless crashes in the process.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/02/learning-the-limits-of-stability-control-on-a-frozen-lake-in-a-mclaren/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The arrival of four new astronauts as part of the Crew 12 mission—Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway of NASA, Sophie Adenot of the European Space Agency, and Andrey Fedyaev of Roscosmos—brought the total number of crew on board the space station to seven, giving the US space agency a full complement in orbit.</p>
<p>The number of astronauts living on board the station fluctuates over time, depending on crew rotations and private astronauts making shorter stays, but since Crew Dragon began flying regularly at the end of 2020 NASA has sought to keep at least four "USOS" astronauts on board at all time. This stands for "US Orbital Segment," and means astronauts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan who are trained to operate the areas of the station maintained by NASA and its partner astronauts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/space-station-returns-to-a-full-crew-complement-after-a-month/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A recent study showed that Mars was warm and wet billions of years ago. The finding contrasts with another theory that this era was mainly cold and icy. The result has implications for the idea that life could have developed on the planet at this time.</p>
<p>Whether Mars was once habitable is a fascinating and intensely researched topic of interest over many decades. <a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/mars-178">Mars</a>, like the Earth, is about 4.5 billion years old and its geological history is divided into different epochs of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02856-3">The latest paper</a> relates to Mars during a time called the Noachian epoch, which extended from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago. This was during a stage in solar system history called the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/lunar-craters/what-is-the-late-heavy-bombardment/">Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB)</a>. Evidence for truly cataclysmic meteorite impacts during the LHB are found on many bodies throughout the solar system.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/ancient-mars-was-warm-and-wet-not-cold-and-icy/">Read full article</a></p>

That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.</p>
<p>That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.</p>
<p>Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2026/02/editors-note-retraction-of-article-containing-fabricated-quotations/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>It was the image that launched a cultural icon. In 1967, in the Northern California woods, a 7-foot-tall, ape-like creature covered in black fur and walking upright was captured on camera, at one point turning around to look straight down the lens. The image is endlessly copied in popular culture—it’s even become an emoji. But what was it? A hoax? A bear? Or a real-life example of a mysterious species called the Bigfoot?</em></p>
<p><em>The film has been analysed and re-analysed <a href="https://www.discoveryuk.com/mysteries/the-patterson-gimlin-film-evidence-of-bigfoot-or-elaborate-hoax/">countless times</a>. Although most people believe it was some sort of hoax, there are some who argue that it’s never been definitively debunked. One group of people, dubbed Bigfooters, is so intrigued that they have taken to the forests of Washington, California, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, and beyond to look for evidence of the mythical creature.</em></p>
<p><em>But why? That’s what sociologists Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to uncover. They were itching to understand what prompts this community to spend valuable time and resources looking for a beast that is highly unlikely to even exist. During lockdown, Lewis started interviewing more than 130 Bigfooters (and a few academics) about their views, experiences, and practices, culminating in <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Bigfooters-and-Scientific-Inquiry-On-the-Borderlands-of-Legitimate-Science/Lewis-Bartlett/p/book/9781032777832">the duo’s recent book</a> "Bigfooters and Scientific Inquiry: On the Borderlands of Legitimate Science."</em></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/it-aint-no-unicorn-these-researchers-have-interviewed-130-bigfoot-hunters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Saturday the agency is looking at ways to prevent the fueling problems plaguing the Space Launch System rocket before the Artemis III mission.</p>
<p>Artemis III is slated to be the first crew mission to land on the Moon since the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. As for Artemis II, which remains on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after missing a launch window earlier this month, NASA is preparing for a second countdown rehearsal as soon as next week to confirm whether technicians have resolved a hydrogen fuel leak that cut short a practice countdown run February 2.</p>
<p>Artemis II is the first crew flight for SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The nearly 10-day mission will carry four astronauts around the far side of the Moon and return them to Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-chief-vows-to-solve-sls-rocket-fueling-issues-before-artemis-iii/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It's Valentine's Day, and while there are plenty of classic and current rom-coms out there for those wishing to immerse themselves in warm and fuzzy feelings, we're opting to celebrate in a different way: honoring Ang Lee's 2000 masterpiece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon"><em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em></a>, a <em>wuxia</em> tragic fairy tale featuring one of the most beautifully heartbreaking love stories in film at its center. It's also got stunning cinematography and tons of awe-inspiring martial arts sequences, which makes it my personal perfect date night movie.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below, but we will give you a heads up before the major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>The film is adapted from a 1940s novel by Wang Dulu and is set sometime during the Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 through 1912. (No specific date is given.) The title is a direct translation of a line from a 6th century Chinese poem: "behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon." It's generally interpreted as a description of legendary martial arts masters living un-noticed and/or hiding in plain sight—until someone picks a fight, that is. And some of those hidden masters are women.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/a-valentines-day-homage-to-crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Out beyond the orbit of Neptune lies an expansive ring of ancient relics, dynamical enigmas, and possibly a hidden planet—or two.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/kuiper-belt/">Kuiper Belt</a>, a region of frozen debris about 30 to 50 times farther from the sun than the Earth is—and perhaps farther, though nobody knows—has been shrouded in mystery since it first came into view in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, astronomers have cataloged about 4,000 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), including a smattering of dwarf worlds, icy comets, and leftover planet parts. But that number is expected to increase tenfold in the coming years as observations from more advanced telescopes pour in. In particular, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile will illuminate this murky region with its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which began operating last year. Other next-generation observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will also help to bring the belt into focus.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/astronomers-are-filling-in-the-blanks-of-the-kuiper-belt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization on Friday released a formal statement <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-02-2026-statement-on-the-planned-hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccine-trial-in-guinea-bissau">blasting a US-funded vaccine trial as "unethical,"</a> because it would withhold an established, safe, and potentially lifesaving vaccine against hepatitis B from some newborns in Guinea-Bissau, Africa.</p>
<p>"In its current form, and based on publicly available information, the trial is inconsistent with established ethical and scientific principles," the WHO concluded, after providing a bullet-point list of reasons the trial was harmful and low quality.</p>
<p>The trial has drawn widespread condemnation from health experts since <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/18/2025-23245/notice-of-award-of-a-single-source-unsolicited-grant-to-fund-university-of-southern-denmark-sdu">notice of the US funding</a> was published in the Federal Register in December. The notice revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon this week imposed a new roadblock for people who want to pay off device installment plans early in order to get their phones unlocked. The latest version of Verizon's <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy">device unlocking policy</a> for postpaid customers imposes a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off their device installment plan online or in the Verizon app.</p>
<p>Payments made over the phone also trigger a 35-day waiting period, as do payments made at Verizon Authorized Retailers. Getting an immediate unlock apparently requires paying off the device plan at a Verizon corporate store.</p>
<p>Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on another network, letting customers switch from one carrier to another. Previously, the 35-day waiting period for unlocks was only applied when a customer paid off the plan with a Verizon gift card.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-makes-customers-wait-35-days-to-unlock-fully-paid-off-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amazon and Flock Safety have ended a partnership that would've given law enforcement access to a vast web of Ring cameras.</p>
<p>The decision came after Amazon faced substantial backlash for airing a Super Bowl ad that was meant to be warm and fuzzy, but instead came across as disturbing and dystopian.</p>
<p>The ad begins with a young girl surprised to receive a puppy as a gift. It then warns that 10 million dogs go missing annually. Showing a series of lost dog posters, the ad introduces a new "Search Party" feature for Ring cameras that promises to revolutionize how neighbors come together to locate missing pets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/after-creepy-super-bowl-ad-sparks-outrage-ring-abandons-flock-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed some reporting a few days ago that Android 17 was rolling out in beta form, but that didn't happen. For reasons Google still has not explained, the release was canceled. Two days later, <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2026/02/the-first-beta-of-android-17.html">Android 17 is here for real</a>. If you've got a recent Pixel device, you can try the latest version today, but don't expect big changes just yet—there's still a long way to go before release.</p>
<p>Google will probably have more to say about feature changes for Android 17 in the coming months, but this first wide release is aimed mostly at testing system and API changes. One of the biggest changes in the beta is expanded support for adaptive apps, which ensures that apps can scale to different screen sizes. That makes apps more usable on large-screen devices like tablets and foldables with multiple displays.</p>
<p>We first saw this last year in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-review-post-hype/">Android 16</a>, but developers were permitted to opt out of support. The new adaptive app roadmap puts an end to that. Any app that targets Android 17 (API level 37) must support resizing and windowed multitasking. Apps can continue to target the older API for the time being, but Google filters apps from the Play Store if they don't keep up.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/the-first-android-17-beta-is-now-available-on-pixel-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Longtime fans of the cult TV show <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> know that the series’ one constant is change (well, that and bad movies).</p>
<p>The show’s cast and crew were in a near-constant state of flux, a byproduct of the show's existence as a perennial bubble show produced in the Twin Cities rather than a TV-and-comedy hub like New York or LA. It was rare, especially toward the middle of its 10-season original run on national TV, for the performers in front of the camera (and the writers’ room, since they were all the same people) to stay the same for more than a season or two.</p>
<p>Series creator Joel Hodgson embraced that spirit of change for the show's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/netflix-will-stream-14-episodes-of-mystery-science-theater-3000-revival/">Kickstarter-funded, Netflix-aired revival</a> in the mid-2010s, featuring a brand-new cast and mostly new writers. And that change only accelerated in the show's brief post-Netflix "Gizmoplex" era, which featured a revolving cast of performers that could change from episode to episode. Hodgson leaned into the idea that as long as there were silhouettes and puppets talking in front of a bad movie, it didn't matter much <em>who</em> was doing the talking.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/1-8-million-mst3k-kickstarter-brings-in-almost-everyone-from-the-old-show/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of unanswered questions about the origin of life on Earth. But the research community has largely reached consensus that one of the key steps was the emergence of an RNA molecule that could replicate itself. RNA, like its more famous relative DNA, can carry genetic information. But it can also fold up into three-dimensional structures that act as catalysts. These two features have led to the suggestion that early life was protein-free, with RNA handling both heredity and catalyzing a simple metabolism.</p>
<p>For this to work, one of the reactions that the early RNAs would need to catalyze is the copying of RNA molecules, without which any sort of heritability would be impossible. While we've found a number of catalytic RNAs that can copy other molecules, none have been able to perform a key reaction: making a copy of themselves. Now, however, a team has found an incredibly short piece of RNA—just 45 bases long—that can make a copy of itself.</p>
<h2>Finding an RNA polymerase</h2>
<p>We have identified a large number of catalytic RNAs (generically called ribozymes, for RNA-based enzymes), and some of them can catalyze reactions involving other RNAs. A handful of these are ligases, which link together two RNA molecules. In some cases, they need these molecules to be held together by a third RNA molecule that base pairs with both of them. We've only identified a few that can act as polymerases, which add RNA bases to a growing molecule, one at a time, with each new addition base pairing with a template molecule.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/researchers-find-small-rnas-that-can-make-copies-of-themselves/">Read full article</a></p>
