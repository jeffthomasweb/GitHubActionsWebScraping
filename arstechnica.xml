<p>We're at an interesting crossroads in the high-performance enthusiast car market. Running east to west is the adoption of electric vehicles and a slow reduction in internal combustion engine car production. North to south is the progression of ICE horsepower from the factory over the years, and it's unclear how far it continues from here. Coming in diagonally is the weakening demand for manual transmissions—this is sadly where they end.</p>
<p>In the middle of this intersection is the 2024 BMW M2 six-speed manual, hanging its tail out in a massive controlled drift around the edges, expressing one last hurrah as BMW's final object of internal-combustion M car affection.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to pilot BMW's latest, smallest M car through some of Southern California's most fun mountain roads, plus Willow Springs International Raceway's Streets of Willow circuit. When it comes to quickly figuring out this kind of car's powertrain and chassis, I can't think of a better mix of pavement. Here's what makes the latest—and last—six-speed-manual-equipped M2 generation an overall excellent enthusiast coupe.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012238#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012238&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an interview on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor ahead of Reddit’s market debut on Thursday, chief executive Steve Huffman acknowledged that the mischievous retail investors that congregate on the social media platform might deliberately drive down its share price.</p>
<p>“It’s a free market!” he said.</p>
<p>For Reddit, as for Huffman, the bet on a public offering for a site he described as a “fun and special, but sometimes crazy place” has appeared to pay off.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012282#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012282&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With all due respect to the Capcom team, which poured itself into <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a> and deserves praise, raises, and time off, let me get right to it: I love this game for how dumb it is.</p>

<p>I mean "dumb" in the way most heavy metal lyrics are dumb, but you find yourself rocking out nonetheless. Dumb like when you laugh uncontrollably at the sight of someone getting conked in the head and falling over backward. Dumb as in the silliest bits of <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>, just nowhere near as self-aware (unless, due to translation issues, this game actually is self-aware, then I apologize).</p>
<p><i>Dragon’s Dogma 2</i> (<em>DD2</em>) reminds me of playing another huge, dumb, enjoyable game: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/11/skyrim-sells-a-reported-35-million-units-in-2-days-shows-demand-for-single-player-gaming/"><i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i></a>. Not the first time you play through it, though. I’m talking about the second or third run-through (or that 100-plus-hour save in which you refuse to finish the game), and your admiration of this huge, rich world gives way to utter ridiculousness. You one-shot dragons with your <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/skyrim-stealth-archer-build/">broken stealth-archer build</a>, you put <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/skyrim-bucket-robbery-is-a-testament-to-player-creativity/">buckets on the heads of NPCs</a> to rob them, and you marvel at how the most effective fast travel is <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrims-horse-tilting-glitch-redefines-fast-travel-1788754191">horse tilting</a>. You lunge into possibilities, choose chaos, and appreciate all the ways you can do so.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012266#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012266&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>After public outcry, General Motors has decided to stop sharing driving data from its connected cars with data brokers. Last week, news broke that customers enrolled in GM's OnStar Smart Driver app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/car-makers-shady-data-sharing-takes-spotlight-in-gm-connected-car-scandal/">have had their data shared with LexisNexis and Verisk</a>.</p>
<p>Those data brokers in turn shared the information with insurance companies, resulting in some drivers finding it much harder or more expensive to obtain insurance. To make matters much worse, customers allege they never signed up for OnStar Smart Driver in the first place, claiming the choice was made for them by salespeople during the car-buying process.</p>
<p>Now, in what feels like an all-too-rare win for privacy in the 21st century, that data-sharing deal is no more.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012276#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012276&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO—Trade shows like the Game Developers Conference and the (dearly departed) E3 are a great chance to see what's coming down the pike for the game industry. But they can also be a great place to celebrate gaming's history, as we've shown you with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/a-trip-through-gaming-history-the-videogame-history-museum-at-e3/">any</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/06/e3-photo-diary-finale-vr-headsets-and-a-visit-to-the-game-history-museum/">number</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/gallery-take-a-tour-of-e3s-video-game-theme-park/">on-site</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/gallery-gdc-2015-shows-off-inventive-controllers-and-atari-history/">photo galleries</a> in years past.</p>
<p>The history display tucked away in a corner of this year's Game Developers Conference—the first one arranged by the Video Game History Foundation—was a little different. Rather than simply laying out a parcel of random collectibles, as past history-focused booths have, VGHF took a more curated approach, with mini-exhibits focused on specific topics like women in gaming, oddities of gaming music, and an entire case devoted to <a href="https://gamehistory.org/where-in-north-dakota-is-carmen-sandiego/">a little-known entry in a famous edutainment series</a>.</p>
<p>Then there was the central case, devoted to the idea that all sorts of ephemera—from design docs to photos to pre-release prototypes to newsletters to promotional items—were all an integral part of video game history. The organization is practically begging developers, journalists, and fan hoarders of all stripes not to throw out even items that seem like they have no value. After all, today's trash might be tomorrow's important historic relic.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012261#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012261&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An Internet service provider that admitted lying to the Federal Communications Commission about where it offers broadband will pay a $10,000 fine and implement a compliance plan to prevent future violations.</p>
<p>Jefferson County Cable (JCC), a small ISP in Toronto, Ohio, admitted that it falsely claimed to offer fiber service in an area that it hadn't expanded to yet. A company executive also admitted that the firm submitted false coverage data to prevent other ISPs from obtaining government grants to serve the area. Ars helped expose the incident in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/cable-company-tries-to-block-grants-to-rivals-by-lying-about-coverage-area/">February 2023 article</a>.</p>
<p>The FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-eb-settles-jefferson-county-cable">announced the outcome</a> of its investigation on March 15, saying that Jefferson County Cable violated the Broadband Data Collection program requirements and the Broadband DATA Act, a US law, "in connection with reporting inaccurate information or data with respect to the Company's ability to provide broadband Internet access service."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012235#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012235&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Electric design is a field full of varying opinions and trade-offs. Companies agonize over the physical shapes of their devices and the materials used, all trying to create a high-quality, premium-feeling device that fits with the constraints of mass production. Material choices usually center around cost, feeling, and durability, but how often do manufacturers take into account <em>smell? </em>Samsung users are finding that if you pop out the Galaxy S24 Ultra's "S-Pen" stylus and give it a whiff like you're huffing a marker, you'll find that it... smells bad?</p>
<p><a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/samsung-ultra-s-pen-stink-galaxy-note/">9to5Google</a> found the following incredible post from Reddit user "LatifYil" titled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1bixq94/why_does_my_s_pen_smell_so_bad/">Why does my s pen smell so bad?</a>" The post has almost 250 comments of users all mostly agreeing with the post's sentiment that "the S-Pen in my Galaxy S24 Ultra absolutely reeks. Either I have a sensitive nose or this thing is being barbequed by the internals while it's unsheathed." The top-rated, very-online comment is, "Op got me to smell my pen. Can confirm it's a stinky boi."</p>
<p>Those describing the smell all seem to agree Samsung's stylus often smells like an electrical fire. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1bixq94/why_does_my_s_pen_smell_so_bad/kvnme2s/">writes</a> that it's "a very burnt and plastics smell." Another says the S23 Ultra stylus "smells like new tech with a hint of burning." A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1bixq94/why_does_my_s_pen_smell_so_bad/kvobuky/">more descriptive</a> commenter says it smells like "an electric mixer that's turned on, but the beaters are jammed up and can't turn, so the motor is overheating." The S-Pen is mostly plastic but has a soft rubber tip, and a lot of users identify that soft bit as the smelly part.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012171#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012171&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Instagram users have started complaining on X (formerly Twitter) after discovering that Meta has begun limiting recommended political content by default.</p>
<p>"Did [y'all] know Instagram was actively limiting the reach of political content like this?!" an X user named Olayemi Olurin <a href="https://twitter.com/msolurin/status/1771004110826766643?s=46&amp;t=W6K2WPlvnFQ1nyDiOeCIfw">wrote</a> in an X post with more than 150,000 views as of this writing. "I had no idea 'til I saw this comment and I checked my settings and sho nuff political content was limited."</p>
<p>"Instagram quietly introducing a 'political' content preference and turning on 'limit' by default is insane?" <a href="https://twitter.com/mattxiv/status/1771201399289696576">wrote</a> another X user named Matt in a post with nearly 40,000 views.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012207#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012207&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Swen Vincke, director of the colossal entity that is <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, is not leaving the door open to future expansions of that already fully packed game.</p>
<p>At this week's Game Developer's Conference (GDC), Vincke made it clear during a talk and in interviews that Larian Studios is not going to make any major new content for <em>Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3)—</em>nor start work on <em>Baldur's Gate 4,</em> nor make anything, really, inside the framework of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons' </em>Fifth Edition (5e).</p>
<p>Not that Vincke or his team are bitter. Their hearts just aren't in it. They had actually started work on <em>BG3 </em>downloadable content and gave some thought to <em>Baldur's Gate 4, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">Vincke told IGN</a>. "But we hadn’t really had closure on BG3 yet and just to jump forward on something new felt wrong." On top of that, the team had new ideas that didn't fit <em>D&amp;D 5e</em>, which "is not an easy system to put into a video game," Vincke said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012139#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012139&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>More than a decade has gone by since three <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> fans <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/make-it-so-how-three-guys-got-most-of-the-enterprise-d-bridge/">first decided</a> to restore the bridge from the <a href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/inconsistencies/enterprise-d-bridge.htm">Enterprise-D</a>. Plans for the restored bridge morphed from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/captain-i-saved-the-bridge-boldly-going-where-no-tv-set-has-gone-before/">opening it up to non-commercial uses</a> like weddings or educational events <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/no-romulans-just-angry-volunteers-one-mans-journey-to-restore-star-treks-bridge/">into a fully fledged museum</a>, and now that museum is almost ready to open. Backers of the project on Kickstarter have been notified that Sci-Fi World Museum will open to them in Santa Monica, California, on May 27, with general admission beginning in June.</p>
<p>It's not actually the original set from <em>TNG</em>, as that was destroyed while filming <em>Star Trek: Generations</em>, when the saucer section crash-lands on Veridian III. But three replicas were made, overseen by Michael Okuda and Herman Zimmerman, the show's set designers. Two of those welcomed Trekkies at <em>Star Trek: The Experience</em>, an attraction in Las Vegas until <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/farewell-star-trek-the-experience.110085/">it closed in 2008</a>.</p>
<p>The third spent time in Hollywood, then traveled to Europe and Asia for <em>Star Trek: World Tour</em> before it ended up languishing in a warehouse in Long Beach. It's this third globe-trotting Enterprise-D bridge that—like the grit that gets an oyster to create a pearl—now finds a science-fiction museum accreted around it. Well, mostly—the chairs used by Riker, Troi, Data, and some other bits were salvaged from the Las Vegas exhibit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012173#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012173&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Switch emulator Suyu—a fork of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/how-strong-is-nintendos-legal-case-against-switch-emulator-yuzu/">Nintendo-targeted</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-makers-agree-to-pay-2-4-million-to-settle-nintendo-lawsuit/">now-defunct</a> emulation project Yuzu—has been taken down from GitLab following a DMCA request Thursday. But the emulation project's open source files remain available on <a href="https://git.suyu.dev/suyu/suyu">a self-hosted git repo on the Suyu website</a>, and recent compiled binaries remain available on <a href="https://gitlab.com/suyu-emu/suyu-releases/-/tree/master/v0.0.2-master?ref_type=heads">an extant GitLab repo</a>.</p>
<p>While the DMCA takedown request has not yet appeared on <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">GitLab's public repository of such requests</a>, a GitLab spokesperson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24108191/gitlab-suyu-nintendo-switch-emulator-takedown">confirmed to The Verge</a> that the project was taken down after the site received notice "from a representative of the rightsholder." GitLab has not specified who made the request or how they represented themselves; a representative for Nintendo was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Whatever else you can say about Windows 11—and whatever you think about its pushy tendencies and the Copilot feature that has been rolled out to pretty much everyone despite being labeled a "preview"—the operating system has ushered in a bit of a renaissance for decades-old built-in apps like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/hell-freezes-over-ms-paint-adds-support-for-layers-and-png-transparency/">Paint</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/microsoft-is-testing-out-tabs-for-the-windows-11-version-of-notepad/">Notepad</a>.</p>
<p>Notepad's development in particular has been striking; it had gotten small under-the-hood updates over the years, but in many ways, the version that was still in Windows 11 at launch in 2021 was the same app that Microsoft shipped with Windows XP, Windows 95, Windows 3.1, or even Windows 1.0.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/03/21/spellcheck-in-notepad-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">An updated version of Notepad</a> currently rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev channels is adding two more modern features to the old app: spellcheck and autocorrect. Per usual, spellcheck in Notepad highlights misspellings with red squiggly underlines, and right-clicking the word or pressing Shift + F10 will pop up a short menu of suggested fixes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012109#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012109&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Needle, a cheerful miniature schnauzer I had as a kid, turned into a ball of unspeakable noise and fury each time she saw a dog called Puma. She hated Puma so much she would go ballistic, barking and growling. Merely whispering the name “Puma” set off the same reaction, as though the sound of it and the idea of the dog it represented were clearly connected deep in Needle’s mind.</p>
<p>A connection between a word and a mental representation of its meaning is called “referential understanding,” and for a very long time, we believed dogs lacked this ability. Now, a study published by a team of Hungarian researchers indicates we might have been wrong.</p>
<h2>Practice makes perfect</h2>
<p>The idea that dogs couldn’t form associations with language in a referential manner grew out of behavioral studies in which dogs were asked to do a selective fetching task. The canines had a few objects placed in front of them (like a toy or a bone) and then had to fetch the one specifically named by their owner.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012123#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012123&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When thousands of security researchers descend on Las Vegas every August for what's come to be known as “hacker summer camp,” the back-to-back <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/black-hat/">Black Hat</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/defcon/">Defcon</a> hacker conferences, it's a given that some of them will experiment with hacking the infrastructure of Vegas itself, the city's elaborate array of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/">casino</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elevator-phone-phreaking-defcon/">hospitality</a> technology. But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were actually <i>invited</i> to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one of the room's gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone.</p>
<p>One team of hackers spent those days focused on the lock on the room's door, perhaps its most sensitive piece of technology of all. Now, more than a year and a half later, they're finally bringing to light the results of that work: a technique they discovered that would allow an intruder to open any of millions of hotel rooms worldwide in seconds, with just two taps.</p>
<p>Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call <a href="https://unsaflok.com/">Unsaflok</a>. The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012114#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012114&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.36 of the Rocket Report! SpaceX wants to launch the next Starship test flight as soon as early May, the company's president and chief operating officer said this week. The third Starship test flight last week went well enough that the Federal Aviation Administration—yes, the FAA, the target of many SpaceX fans' frustrations—anticipates a simpler investigation and launch licensing process than SpaceX went through before its previous Starship flights. However, it looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for Starship to start launching real satellites.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>Starship could threaten small launch providers. </b>Officials from several companies operating or developing small satellite launch vehicles are worried that SpaceX's giant Starship rocket could have a big impact on their marketability, <a href="https://spacenews.com/starship-could-have-a-big-impact-on-small-launch-vehicles/">Space News reports</a>. Starship's ability to haul more than 100 metric tons of payload mass into low-Earth orbit will be attractive not just for customers with heavy satellites but also for those with smaller spacecraft. Aggregating numerous smallsats on Starship will mean lower prices than dedicated small satellite launch companies can offer and could encourage customers to build larger satellites with cheaper parts, further eroding business opportunities for small launch providers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012042#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012042&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Researchers have unearthed never-before-seen wiper malware tied to the Kremlin and an operation two years ago that took out more than 10,000 satellite modems located mainly in Ukraine on the eve of Russia’s invasion of its neighboring country.</p>
<p>AcidPour, as researchers from security firm Sentinel One have named the new malware, has stark similarities to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/mystery-solved-in-destructive-attack-that-knocked-out-10k-viasat-modems/">AcidRain</a>, a wiper discovered in March 2022 that Viasat has confirmed was used in the attack on its modems earlier that month. Wipers are malicious applications designed to destroy stored data or render devices inoperable. Viasat said AcidRain was installed on more than 10,000 Eutelsat KA-SAT modems used by the broadband provider seven days prior to the March 2022 discovery of the wiper. AcidRain was installed on the devices after attackers gained access to the company’s private network.</p>
<p>Sentinel One, which also discovered AcidRain, said at the time that the earlier wiper had enough technical overlaps with malware the US government attributed to the Russian government in 2018 to make it likely that AcidRain and the 2018 malware, known as VPNFilter, were closely linked to the same team of developers. In turn, Sentinel One’s report Thursday noting the similarities between AcidRain and AcidPour provides evidence that AcidPour was also created by developers working on behalf of the Kremlin.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012093#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012093&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thanks to the vaccination program that began in 1995, chickenpox is now relatively rare. Cases of the miserable, itchy condition have fallen more than 97 percent. But, while children have largely put the oatmeal baths and oven mitts behind them, doctors have apparently let their diagnostic skills get a little crusty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7311a3.htm?s_cid=mm7311a3_w">According to a study published Thursday</a>, public health researchers in Minnesota found that 55 percent of people diagnosed with chickenpox based on their symptoms were actually negative for the varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes chickenpox. The study noted that the people were all diagnosed in person by health care providers in medical facilities. But, instead of chickenpox, lab testing showed that some of the patients were actually infected with an enterovirus, which can cause a rash, or the herpes simplex virus 1, which causes cold sores.</p>
<p>The study, published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, supports expanding laboratory testing for suspected chickenpox cases in the state's program and highlights that diagnoses based on symptoms are "unreliable."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012079#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012079&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Upgrades at SpaceX's most-used launch pad in Florida got a trial run Thursday with the liftoff of a Falcon 9 rocket with a Dragon cargo ship heading for the International Space Station.</p>
<p>SpaceX's Cargo Dragon spacecraft launched at 4:55 pm EDT (20:55 UTC) Thursday from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This mission, known as CRS-30, is SpaceX's 30th resupply mission to the space station since 2012.</p>
<p>The automated Dragon supply ship took off on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, heading for a monthlong stay at the International Space Station, where it will deliver more than 6,000 pounds of hardware, fresh food, and experiments for the lab's seven-person crew.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011649#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011649&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147831">consented to adopt</a> what some call the first global resolution on AI, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/un-adopts-first-global-artificial-intelligence-resolution-2024-03-21/">Reuters</a>. The resolution aims to foster the protection of personal data, enhance privacy policies, ensure close monitoring of AI for potential risks, and uphold human rights. It emerged from a proposal by the United States and received backing from China and 121 other countries.</p>

<p>Being a nonbinding agreement and thus effectively toothless, the resolution seems broadly popular in the AI industry. On X, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1770854291521126617?s=20">wrote</a>, "We fully support the @UN's adoption of the comprehensive AI resolution. The consensus reached today marks a critical step towards establishing international guardrails for the ethical and sustainable development of AI, ensuring this technology serves the needs of everyone."</p>
<p>The resolution, titled "<a href="https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/ltd/n24/065/92/pdf/n2406592.pdf?token=hD5fXbnj2VZHJd5ZEF&amp;fe=true">Seizing the opportunities of safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems for sustainable development</a>," resulted from three months of negotiation, and the stakeholders involved <a href="https://usun.usmission.gov/joint-statement-on-the-proposed-unga-resolution-on-seizing-the-opportunities-of-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-ai-systems-for-sustainable-development/">seem pleased</a> at the level of international cooperation. "We're sailing in choppy waters with the fast-changing technology, which means that it's more important than ever to steer by the light of our values," one senior US administration official told Reuters, highlighting the significance of this "first-ever truly global consensus document on AI."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012004#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012004&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
