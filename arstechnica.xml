                            <![CDATA[<p>Eighteen months after leaving his job as a vice president at Amazon to take over as Blue Origin's chief executive, Dave Limp has some thoughts on how commercial companies and government agencies like NASA should explore the Solar System together.</p>
<p>Limp had no background in the space industry before taking the helm of Jeff Bezos' space company in December 2023. He started his career as a computer scientist at Apple, took a stint at a venture capital firm, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/bob-smith-is-finally-gone-from-blue-origin-his-replacement-comes-from-amazon/">joined Amazon in 2010</a>, where he managed development of consumer devices like Alexa, Kindle, and the Fire TV.</p>
<p>"I had no thoughts of ever running a space company," Limp said Thursday at a space conference in Washington, DC. "I've done consumer electronics my whole life. Started at Apple and did a bunch of other things, and so when I decided to retire from Amazon, I was looking for something that I could give back a little bit, be a little bit more philanthropic in the sort of second half of my career. I didn't want to stop working, just wanted to do something different. And about that same time, Jeff was looking for a CEO."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/blue-origin-boss-government-should-forget-launch-and-focus-on-exotic-missions/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><strong>Xodiac rocket makes its final flight</strong>. Originally built by Masten Space Systems, the suborbital Xodiac rocket had flown 175 successful missions before a flight from Mojave, California, on Wednesday. But now, it will fly no more. "While the vehicle remained within its planned flight envelope, it detected an anomalous condition and commanded a flight termination," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/astrobotic_today-astrobotics-xodiacrocket-conducted-activity-7333591672246722563-LCpF/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABUQej8B_OuiHoJ7GKbJxA7FLY7wTBTMrT4">said Astrobotic</a>, which acquired Masten a couple of years ago. "This resulted in a rapid descent and caused a loss of the vehicle upon impact with its launch pad."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-northrop-backs-firefly-and-names-its-rocket-xodiac-will-fly-no-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>With streaming providers frequently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/streaming-prices-climb-in-2025-after-already-surpassing-inflation-rates/">raising prices</a>, subscribers often feel like they’re paying more for the same service—or a lesser version, depending on what’s available to watch that month. In a unique move, Disney is introducing a small, potential financial benefit to Disney+ and Hulu subscribers in the form of some third-party discounts, freebies, trials, and contests.</p>
<p>As of today, Disney+ subscribers can log into Disney’s <a href="https://perks.disneyplus.com/en_us/discover">Disney+ Perks website</a> with their streaming credentials to get access to a revolving selection of discounts and freebies. When I logged in today, I was met with options for several free trials, including a six-month one to DoorDash’s premium subscription offering, a three-month trial to Clear+, and a two-month trial to Duolingo’s premium subscription.</p>
<p>Disney+ subscribers can also get discounts, including to Adidas’ online marketplaces and “select” Disney Resorts Collection hotels (<em>if</em> you stay at least two nights, with most availability occurring between June 29 and July 31). There are also some free virtual rewards for Disney-owned games and the ability to enter sweepstakes, like for going to the premiere of the movie <em>Freakier Friday.</em></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/amid-rising-prices-disney-and-hulu-offer-subscribers-some-freebies/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's rapid adoption of AI has seen the Gemini "sparkle" icon become an omnipresent element in almost every Google product. It's there to summarize your email, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/gmail-gains-gemini-powered-add-to-calendar-button/">add items</a> to your calendar, and more—if you <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/gemini-is-an-increasingly-good-chatbot-but-its-still-a-bad-assistant/">trust it to do those things</a>. Gemini is also integrated with Google Drive, where it's gaining a new feature that could make it genuinely useful: Google's AI bot will soon be able to watch videos stored in your Drive so you don't have to.</p>
<p>Gemini is already accessible in Drive, with the ability to summarize documents or folders, gather and analyze data, and expand on the topics covered in your documents. Google says the next step is plugging videos into Gemini, saving you from wasting time scrubbing through a file just to find something of interest.</p>
<p>Using a chatbot to analyze and manipulate text doesn't always make sense—after all, it's not hard to skim an email or short document. It can take longer to interact with a chatbot, which might not add any useful insights. Video is different because watching is a linear process in which you are presented with information at the pace the video creator sets. You can change playback speed or rewind to catch something you missed, but that's more arduous than reading something at your own pace. So Gemini's video support in Drive could save you real time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/gemini-in-google-drive-may-finally-be-useful-now-that-it-can-analyze-videos/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">An accused movie pirate who stole more than 1,000 Blu-ray discs and DVDs while working for a DVD manufacturing company struck a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US-v-Hale-Plea-Agreement-5-27-25.pdf">plea deal</a> this week to lower his sentence after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fbi-nabs-worker-at-dvd-company-for-ripping-prerelease-marvel-blockbusters/">FBI claimed the man's piracy cost movie studios millions</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Hale no longer works for the DVD company. He was arrested in March, accused of "bypassing encryption that prevents unauthorized copying" and ripping pre-release copies of movies he could only access because his former employer was used by major movie studios. As alleged by the feds, his game was beating studios to releases to achieve the greatest possible financial gains from online leaks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Among the popular movies that Hale is believed to have leaked between 2021 and 2022 was <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>, which the FBI alleged was copied "tens of millions of times" at an estimated loss of "tens of millions of dollars" for just one studio on one movie. Other movies Hale ripped included animated hits like <em>Encanto</em> and <em>Sing 2</em>, as well as anticipated sequels like <em>The Matrix: Resurrections</em> and <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/man-who-stole-1000-dvds-from-employer-strikes-plea-deal-over-movie-leaks/">Read full article</a></p>

      What if you could make your dice any shape at all—not just boxes and polyhedra, but dragons or other game-relevant shapes?

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Most people are familiar with conventional cubical six-sided dice, but there are also polyhedral versions like the 20-sided dice used in ancient Rome and to play <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>. Researchers have figured out how to design dice with even more exotic shapes, like a kitten, a dragon, or an armadillo. And they are "fair" dice: Experiments with 3D-printed versions produced results that closely matched predicted random outcomes, according to a forthcoming paper currently in press at the journal ACM Transactions on Graphics.</p>
<p>Dice are examples of so-called "rigid bodies," broadly defined as shapes that move as one solid piece, with no need for bending or twisting. Such shapes "are of scientific interest because they model so many of the phenomena we encounter in our daily lives: anything from the way your dishes roll around on the floor when you drop them, to how the gears in your watch push on each other, to how a satellite tumbles around under the pull of gravity," co-author Keenan Crane of Carnegie-Mellon University told Ars. "So there's an intense focus on developing computational methods for understanding and predicting how rigid bodies are going to behave."</p>
<p>Crane and his co-authors—including lead author and CMU graduate student Hossein Baktash, as well as co-authors from Nvidia Research and Adobe Research—wanted to explore where and how a rigid body will land when tossed. They chose dice as the best (and most fun) context in which to explore that question.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/your-next-gaming-dice-could-be-shaped-like-a-dragon-or-armadillo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The ability to study ancient DNA has revolutionized our ability to understand our own species' past. It has clarified our relationship with Neanderthals and revealed the existence of Denisovans. But even in the most favorable environments, DNA degrades over time, setting a limit on how far back we can hope to resolve questions about our ancestors. And most of the species we've had trouble understanding lived in Africa, where the conditions are far less favorable for DNA's survival.</p>
<p>But a large international team has now found another way to get some information about the genetics out of far older remains. They've extracted fragments of enamel proteins from the teeth of fossils of the species <em>Paranthropus robustus</em> and used them to test whether the remains truly belonged to one species, despite dramatic differences in size. Because one of the proteins is male-specific, they also found the size of the individual wasn't necessarily related to its sex.</p>
<h2>A complicated species</h2>
<p>Remains that have been classified as <em>Paranthropus</em> show up in the fossil record nearly 3 million years ago and persist for roughly a million years. That means it overlapped both with <em>australopithecines</em> and early members of the <em>Homo</em> genus. Four different species have been assigned to this genus, but the situation is complicated. It shares a lot of similarities with some species of <em>Australopithecus</em>, raising the possibility of interbreeding. There's also a lot of variation within remains identified as <em>Paranthropus</em>, notably in the size of individuals. Some have suggested that this might be due to male/female differences in this species (termed "sexual dimorphism"), but that has been difficult to test.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/researchers-study-extinct-hominins-using-enamel-proteins-from-their-teeth/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/generative-media-models-io-2025/#veo-3">introduced Veo 3</a>, its newest video generation model that can create 8-second clips with synchronized sound effects and audio dialog—a first for the company's AI tools. The model, which generates videos at 720p resolution (based on text descriptions called "prompts" or still image inputs), represents what may be the most capable consumer video generator to date, bringing video synthesis close to a point where it is becoming very difficult to distinguish between "authentic" and AI-generated media.</p>
<p>Google also <a href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow">launched Flow</a>, an online AI filmmaking tool that combines Veo 3 with the company's Imagen 4 image generator and Gemini language model, allowing creators to describe scenes in natural language and manage characters, locations, and visual styles in a web interface.</p>

<p>Both tools are now available to US subscribers of Google AI Ultra, a plan that costs $250 a month and comes with 12,500 credits. Veo 3 videos cost 150 credits per generation, allowing 83 videos on that plan before you run out. Extra credits are available for the price of 1 cent per credit in blocks of $25, $50, or $200. That comes out to about $1.50 per video generation. But is the price worth it? We ran some tests with various prompts to see what this technology is truly capable of.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo's Switch 2 has a small handful of new releases in its launch lineup, but for the first few months after its release, the main thing you'll be able to play on it will be your existing library of Switch games. And while Nintendo has promised reasonably comprehensive backward compatibility, the company is still working through the process of testing over 15,000 third-party Switch games with the new console.</p>
<p>With a week to go until launch, Nintendo has updated its compatibility support page with the results of nearly two months of extra testing. Of the "over 15,000" third-party Switch games, Nintendo says roughly two-thirds of them either have "no issues" or have problems that will be resolved quickly at or after launch. On the original version of this support page, Nintendo had only performed its basic compatibility testing on roughly 20 percent of all third-party Switch games.</p>
<p>Nintendo says that nearly all of the roughly 5,000 remaining Switch games will launch just fine on the Switch 2 but that "further tests" are "in progress." The support page doesn't say when Nintendo will provide its next update.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/with-thousands-still-to-test-nintendo-says-no-issues-for-most-switch-games-on-switch-2/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump can't impose whatever tariffs he wants on a whim, a federal court <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VOS-Selections-v-US-Opinion-5-28-25.pdf">ruled</a> Wednesday, issuing an opinion that analysts say has only stoked more trade chaos.</p>
<p>The ruling permanently blocked some of the most controversial tariffs and reportedly scrambled Trump's ongoing trade talks with many countries pressured into negotiations by the threat of those tariffs, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/29/business/tariffs-trump-economic-plan-hnk">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The blocked tariffs—which the court found were implemented unconstitutionally under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—included tariffs the administration said were designed to stop drug and human trafficking, as well as retaliatory tariffs placed on all countries that were supposed to put an end to persistent US trade deficits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/court-blocks-trumps-retaliatory-tariffs-amplifying-trade-war-chaos/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Discord is further distancing itself from its ad-free beginnings by offering users a new virtual currency for clicking on in-platform advertisements.</p>
<p>Acoording to a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/checkpoint-3-leveling-up-discord-quests-with-orbs-and-advanced-measurement">blog post</a> this week by Peter Sellis, Discord’s SVP of product, a “small group” of Discord users around the globe can now earn "Orbs" through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/discord-starts-down-the-dangerous-road-of-ads-this-week/">Play Quests</a>, which Discord announced in March 2024 and let users earn in-game rewards by getting people to watch a stream of them playing a sponsored game. With enough Orbs, Discord users can purchase items in Discord's shop, including customization options for their profiles and credits for Nitro, a subscription add-on that offers features like 500MB uploads and HD resolution streaming.</p>
<p>The goal is to fuel Discord’s advertising business by making clicking on ads more appealing. Advertisers also benefit by associating their ads with the ability to get desirable rewards.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/discord-lures-users-to-click-on-ads-by-offering-them-new-orbs-currency/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk said he is leaving the Trump administration, attributing his departure not to any disagreement with Trump but rather to the legal limit on the number of days a special government employee may serve each year.</p>
<p>"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending," Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1927877957852266518">wrote on X</a>. "The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government."</p>
<p>Musk's "off-boarding will begin tonight," a White House official <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/elon-musk-leaving-trump-administration-white-house-official-confirms-2025-05-29/">told Reuters</a> on Wednesday. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202">US law</a>, special government employees in the executive branch are <a href="https://www.doi.gov/ethics/special-government-employees">limited</a> to serving 130 days in a 365-day period. They are subject to more lenient ethics rules than other federal employees and officials.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/elon-musk-to-exit-government-upset-that-trump-bill-undermines-doges-work/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Department of Health and Human Services—under the control of anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—has canceled millions of dollars in federal funding awarded to Moderna to produce an mRNA vaccine against <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/us-prepares-for-bird-flu-pandemic-with-176m-moderna-vaccine-deal/">influenza viruses with pandemic potential</a>, including the H5N1 bird flu currently sweeping US poultry and dairy cows.</p>
<p>Last July, the Biden administration's HHS awarded Moderna <a href="https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Receives-Project-Award-through-BARDAs-Rapid-Response-Partnership-Vehicle-Consortium-to-Accelerate-Development-of-mRNA-based-Pandemic-Influenza-Vaccine/default.aspx">$176 million</a> to "accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines." In the administration's final days in January, HHS awarded the vaccine maker an additional <a href="https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Updates-on-Pandemic-Influenza-Program/default.aspx">$590 million</a> to support "late-stage development and licensure of pre-pandemic mRNA-based vaccines." The funding would also go to the development of five additional subtypes of pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, as news broke that the Trump administration was reneging on the contract, <a href="a%20rapid,%20potent%20and%20durable%20immune%20response.">Moderna reported positive</a> results from an early trial of a vaccine targeting H5 influenza viruses. In a preliminary trial of 300 healthy adults, the vaccine candidate appeared safe and boosted antibody levels against the virus by 44.5-fold.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/rfk-jr-cancels-millions-in-funding-for-pandemic-bird-flu-vaccine/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There may never be an iOS 19 or a macOS 16, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/apple-to-rebrand-device-operating-systems-ios-26-macos-26-watchos-26">reporting</a> from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. At its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, Apple reportedly plans to shift toward version numbers based on years rather than the current numbering system. This is intended to unify the company's current maze of version numbers; instead of iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 11, and visionOS 3, we'll get iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS 26.</p>
<p>The last time Apple changed its version numbering convention for any of its operating systems was back in 2020, when it shifted from "macOS X" to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/macos-11-0-big-sur-the-ars-technica-review/">macOS 11</a>. Note that the numbering will be based not on the year of the software's release but on the year <em>after</em>; this makes a certain amount of sense since iOS 26 would be Apple's most-current version of iOS for roughly nine months of 2026 and just three months of 2025.</p>
<p>The update to the version numbering system will be accompanied by what Gurman describes as "fresh user interfaces across the operating systems," a visual overhaul that will bring Apple's iPhone, Mac, watch, and TV software more in line with some of the design conventions introduced in Apple's visionOS software in 2024. Among the changes and additions will be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/report-apple-will-take-another-crack-at-ipad-multitasking-in-ipados-19/">another crack at "Mac-like" multitasking for the iPad</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/report-apple-will-jump-straight-to-ios-26-in-shift-to-year-based-version-numbers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Several people familiar with the move said the US Department of Commerce had told so-called electronic design automation groups—which include Cadence, Synopsys, and Siemens EDA—to stop supplying their technology to China.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the US commerce department that oversees export controls, issued the directive to the companies via letters, according to the people.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of home and small office routers manufactured by Asus are being infected with a stealthy backdoor that can survive reboots and firmware updates in an attack by a nation-state or another well-resourced threat actor, researchers said.</p>
<p>The unknown attackers gain access to the devices by exploiting now-patched vulnerabilities, some of which have never been tracked through the internationally recognized CVE system. After gaining unauthorized administrative control of the devices, the threat actor installs a public encryption key for access to the device through SSH. From then on, anyone with the private key can automatically log in to the device with administrative system rights.</p>
<h2>Durable control</h2>
<p>“‍The attacker’s access survives both reboots and firmware updates, giving them durable control over affected devices,” researchers from security firm GreyNoise <a href="https://www.greynoise.io/blog/stealthy-backdoor-campaign-affecting-asus-routers">reported Wednesday</a>. “The attacker maintains long-term access without dropping malware or leaving obvious traces by chaining authentication bypasses, exploiting a known vulnerability, and abusing legitimate configuration features.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/thousands-of-asus-routers-are-being-hit-with-stealthy-persistent-backdoors/">Read full article</a></p>

Besides the high temperature, he seemed fine. So, after testing negative for COVID-19, doctors sent him home with supportive care. But the fever didn't go away.</p>
<p>In the week that followed, things got worse. He developed nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea. He also started having trouble breathing. He then went back to the hospital.</p>
<p>This time, doctors found he needed supplemental oxygen. And an X-ray of his chest was worrisome—there were diffuse ground-glass opacities in his lungs. Doctors wondered if he had an unusual case of pneumonia. The man kept getting worse; in fact, he seemed to deteriorate before their eyes. Initially, he received supplemental oxygen through a simple face mask; subsequently, doctors switched to a mask that delivers continuous oxygen. However, his blood oxygen saturation continued to fall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/healthy-man-goes-camping-lands-in-icu-for-40-days-with-respiratory-failure/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Automaker Stellantis and retail and web services behemoth Amazon have decided to put an end to a collaboration on new in-car software. The partnership dates back to 2022, part of a wide-ranging agreement that also saw Stellantis pick Amazon Web Services as its cloud platform for new vehicles and Amazon sign on as the first customer for Ram's fully electric ProMaster EV van.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the Amazon-Stellantis partnership was to be a software platform for new Stellantis vehicles called STLA SmartCockpit. Meant to debut last year, SmartCockpit was supposed to "seamlessly integrate with customers’ digital lives to create personalized, intuitive in-vehicle experiences," using Alexa and other AI agents to provide better in-car entertainment but also navigation, vehicle maintenance, and in-car payments as well.</p>
