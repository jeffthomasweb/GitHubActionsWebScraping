                            <![CDATA[<p>The annual Consumer Electronics Show is currently raging in Las Vegas, and as has become traditional over the past decade, automakers and their suppliers now use the conference to announce their technology plans. Tonight it was Ford's turn, and it is very on-trend for 2026. If you guessed that means AI is coming to the Ford in-car experience, congratulations, you guessed right.</p>
<p>Even though the company owes everything to mass-producing identical vehicles, it says that it wants AI to personalize your car to you. "Our vision for the customer is simple, but not elementary: a seamless layer of intelligence that travels with you between your phone and your vehicle," said Doug Field, Ford's chief EV, design, and digital officer.</p>
<p>"Not generic intelligence—many people can do that better than we can. What customers need is intelligence that understands where you are, what you’re doing, and what your vehicle is capable of, and then makes the next decision simpler," Field <a href="https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2026/ford-affordable-smart-vehicle-technology-strategy">wrote in a blog post</a> Ford shared ahead of time with Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/in-car-ai-assistant-coming-to-fords-and-lincolns-in-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since 2020, Samsung has been dangling a yellow ball in front of us. That sphere is a robot named Ballie that Samsung has teased and demoed for home use, including serving as a smart speaker. Today, Ballie is confirmed to be facing an eternity as vaporware.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/samsungs-ces-vaporware-keynote-details-ar-glasses-fitness-exoskeleton/#h2">CES 2020</a>, Ars Technica reported that Ballie was “the furthest-along concept” that Samsung demonstrated. At the time, we saw Ballie use facial recognition to follow its owner. A marketing video also portrayed the robot controlling smart home devices, including activating a smart vacuum when someone made a mess.</p>
<p>Ballie rolled back onto the trade show scene <a href="b.%09https:/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/samsungs-ballie-home-robot-is-back-way-bigger-and-headed-to-production/">at CES 2024.</a> This time, it had a new, more spherical, and larger build rolling upon its three wheels. Ballie also sported a light ring, and Samsung showed a video of the robot being used as a projector. The South Korean firm claimed that Ballie would provide “two to three hours of continued projector use” before needing a charge. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBfSX3QiqDM">Samsung's video</a> also demontrated Ballie connecting with a smartphone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/samsung-squashes-hopes-that-it-will-release-its-ballie-home-robot/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The program is through the state's "regulatory sandbox" framework, which allows businesses to trial "innovative" products or services with state regulations temporarily waived. The Utah Department of Commerce partnered with Doctronic, a telehealth startup with an AI chatbot.</p>
<p>Doctronic offers a nationwide service that allows patients to chat with its "<a href="https://www.doctronic.ai/">AI doctor</a>" for free, then, for $39, book a virtual appointment with a real doctor licensed in their state. But patients must go through the AI chatbot first to get an appointment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/utah-allows-ai-to-autonomously-prescribe-medication-refills/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery board has unanimously voted to rebuff Paramount's $108.4 billion offer and urged shareholders to reject the hostile takeover bid. The board is continuing to support Netflix's pending $82.7 billion purchase of its streaming and movie studios businesses along with a separate spinoff of the Warner Bros. cable TV division.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. called the Paramount bid "illusory" in a <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001437107/93976be9-de55-45c8-a448-1b4109f8dc6f.pdf">presentation</a> for shareholders today, saying the offer requires an "extraordinary amount of debt financing" and other terms that make it less likely to be completed than a Netflix merger. It would be the largest leveraged buyout ever, "with $87B of total pro forma gross debt," and is "effectively a one-sided option for PSKY [Paramount Skydance] as the offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time," Warner Bros. said.</p>
<p>The Warner Bros. presentation touted Netflix's financial strength while saying that Paramount "is a $14B market cap company with a 'junk' credit rating, negative free cash flows, significant fixed financial obligations, and a high degree of dependency on its linear business." The Paramount "offer is illusory as it cannot be completed before it is currently scheduled to expire," Warner Bros. said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/warner-bros-sticks-with-netflix-merger-calls-paramounts-108b-bid-illusory/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Bose released the Application Programming Interface (API) documentation for its SoundTouch speakers today, putting a silver lining around the impending end-of-life (EoL) of the expensive home theater devices.</p>
<p>In October, Bose announced that its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/bose-soundtouch-home-theater-systems-regress-into-dumb-speakers-feb-18/">SoundTouch Wi-Fi speakers and soundbars</a> would become dumb speakers on February 18. At the time, Bose said that the speakers would only work if a device was connected via AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth (which has higher latency than Wi-Fi).</p>
<p>After that date, the speakers would stop receiving security and software updates and lose cloud connectivity and their companion app, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said. Without the app, users would no longer be able to integrate the device with music services, such as Spotify, have multiple SoundTouch devices play the same audio simultaneously, or use or edit saved presets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/bose-open-sources-its-soundtouch-home-theater-smart-speakers-ahead-of-eol/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SteamOS's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">slow march across the Windows-dominated PC gaming landscape</a> is continuing to creep along. At CES this week, Lenovo <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-levels-up-ces-with-legion-gaming-devices/">announced</a> it will launch a version of last year's high-priced, high-powered Legion Go 2 handheld with Valve's gaming-focused, Linux-based OS pre-installed starting in June. And there are some intriguing signs from Valve that SteamOS could come to non-AMD devices in the not-too-distant future as well.</p>
<p>A new SteamOS-powered Legion Go 2 isn't exactly shocking news given how things have been going in the world of PC gaming handhelds. Lenovo became the first non-Valve hardware maker to embrace the Windows alternative when it announced a SteamOS-compatible version of the lower-end Legion Go S <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/">almost exactly a year ago</a>. When that version hit the market last spring, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">Ars testing found it actually performed better than the Windows-based version of the same hardware</a> on many popular games.</p>
<p>Valve has also been working behind the scenes to expand SteamOS's footprint beyond its own hardware. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/valve-adds-steamos-compatible-game-label-as-it-prepares-to-expand-beyond-steam-deck/">rolling out the SteamOS Compatible software label</a> last May, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/">SteamOS version 3.7</a> offered support for manual installation on AMD-powered handhelds like the ROG Ally and the original Legion Go.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/steamos-continues-its-slow-spread-across-the-pc-gaming-landscape/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority announced that it is halting the relicensing process for two reactors at the Hamaoka plant after revelations that the plant's chosen operator fabricated seismic hazard data. Japan has been slowly reactivating its extensive nuclear power plant collection after it was shut down following the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The latest scandal is especially shocking, given that the Hamaoka plant is located on the coast near an active subduction fault—just as Fukushima Daiichi is.</p>
<p>A whistleblower reportedly alerted the Nuclear Regulation Authority in February of last year, but the issue became public this week when the regulators <a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-hamaoka-nuclear-fabrication-data-893d7cf94e790ffb51cb1cf85254d658">halted</a> an evaluation process that could have led to a reactor restart at Hamaoka. This prompted the company that operates the plants, the Chubu Electric Power Co., to issue a <a href="https://www.chuden.co.jp/publicity/press/1217264_3273.html">press release</a> describing in detail how the company manipulated the seismic safety data.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www-chuden-co-jp.translate.goog/publicity/press/1217264_3273.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">an English translation</a>, it appears that seismic risks were evaluated at least in part by scaling up the ground motion using data from smaller earthquakes. This is an inexact process, so the standard approach is to create a group of 20 different upscaled earthquake motions and find the one that best represents the average among the 20.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/japanese-nuclear-plant-operator-fabricated-seismic-risk-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The electric vehicle transition might not be moving ahead with the same gusto it showed in the early 2020s, but it's still happening. According to Deloitte's 2026 Global Automotive Consumer Study, 7 percent of US car buyers want an electric vehicle for their next car. While that might sound rather meager, it's a 40 percent increase from 2025's survey, which found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/only-5-percent-of-us-car-buyers-want-an-ev-according-to-survey/">just 5 percent of car buyers wanted an EV</a>.</p>
<p>Plain old internal combustion remains Americans' first choice, with 61 percent telling the survey that's how their next ride will be powered. Twenty-one percent want a hybrid, up from 20 percent last year. Just 5 percent indicated a desire for a plug-in hybrid (down from 6 percent last year), with the remaining confused souls either unsure of what to buy next (4 percent) or some other option, presumably hydrogen (1 percent).</p>

<p>The high demand for internal combustion engines makes the US an outlier among large car-buying markets. Fewer than half of German car buyers want another gas-powered vehicle, and that number falls to just 41 percent in China, Japan, and South Korea. But those consumers aren't all fleeing internal combustion for battery EVs. Well, they mostly are in China, where EV demand is now 20 percent. But in Japan, only 5 percent of consumers want a battery EV, versus 37 percent indicating their next car would be a hybrid.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/evs-remain-a-niche-choice-in-the-us-according-to-survey/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anyone paying attention to battery research sees sulfur come up frequently. That's mostly because sulfur is a great storage material for lithium, and it could lead to lithium batteries with impressive power densities. But sulfur can participate in a wide range of chemical reactions, which has made it difficult to prevent lithium-sulfur batteries from decaying rapidly as the sulfur forms all sorts of unwanted materials. As a result, despite decades of research, very few lithium-sulfur batteries have made it to market.</p>
<p>But a team of Chinese researchers has managed to turn sulfur's complex chemistry into a strength, making it the primary electron donor in a sodium-sulfur battery that also relies on chlorine for its chemistry. The result, at least in the lab, is an impressive energy per weight with extremely inexpensive materials.</p>
<h2>Sulfur chemistry</h2>
<p>Sulfur sits immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, so you might think its chemistry would look similar. But that's not the case. Like oxygen, it can participate in covalent bonding in biological chemistry, including in two essential amino acids. Also, like oxygen, it can accept electrons from metals, as seen in some atomically thin materials that have been studied. But it's also willing to give electrons up, forming chemical compounds with things like chlorine and oxygen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/new-battery-idea-gets-lots-of-power-out-of-unusual-sulfur-chemistry/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A group of 773,000-year-old hominin fossils from Morocco may shed new light on when our species branched off from the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans.</p>
<p>A team of anthropologists recently examined a collection of fossil hominin jawbones, teeth, and vertebrae that belong to hominins who probably lived very close in time to our species’ last common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans. They reveal a little more about a murky but important moment in our evolutionary history.</p>
<h2>From predators’ quarry to rock quarry</h2>
<p>Archaeologists unearthed the 773,000-year-old bones just southwest of Casablanca in a cave aptly named Grotte à Hominidés. They’re just fragments of what used to be hominins: an adult’s lower jawbone, plus the partial lower jaw from another adult and a very young child, along with a handful of teeth and vertebrae. A hominin femur from the same layer of sediment in the cave has clear gnaw marks from sharp carnivore teeth, offering a chilling clue about how the bones got there.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/weve-got-a-fossil-closer-to-our-split-with-neanderthals-and-denisovans/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The restaurant is next to Paris’s Grand Palais, where President Emmanuel Macron kick-started 2025 by hosting an international AI summit, a glitzy showcase packed with French exceptionalism and international tech luminaries including LeCun, who is considered one of the “godfathers” of modern AI.</p>
<p>LeCun gets up to hug me in greeting, wearing his signature black Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses. He looks well rested for a man who has spent nearly a week running around town plotting world domination. Or, more precisely, “total world assistance” or “intelligent amplification, if you want.” Domination “sounds scary with AI,” he acknowledges.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/computer-scientist-yann-lecun-intelligence-really-is-about-learning/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>Stranger Things</em> has finally come to an end and left us with some big complicated feels about how it all went down. Both of us (Jennifer and Beth) are bona fide fans who have seen prior seasons multiple times, and we had remarkably similar reactions to the fifth season, especially the series finale. So we decided to co-write a review, discussing everything we liked about it as well as kvetching about the things we definitely didn't like—a shared "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRETV2oDvkM">airing of grievances</a>."</p>
<p><strong>(WARNING: Many, <em>many</em> spoilers below in the interest of a thorough analysis.)</strong></p>
<p>Season 4 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/catching-up-with-stranger-things-s4-yes-we-have-some-feels/">ended with</a> Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) opening the fourth gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We got an 18-month time jump for S5, Vol. 1, but in a way, we came full circle, since those events coincided with the third anniversary of Will’s (Noah Schnapp) original disappearance in S1.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/review-stranger-things-frustrating-finale-didnt-quite-stick-the-landing/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>For the first time in more than 54 years, astronauts are training to travel to the vicinity of the Moon, perhaps within the next couple of months. NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and other companies are poised to take major steps toward actually landing humans on the Moon, perhaps within a few years.</p>
<p>New rockets are slated to debut in 2026, and scientists hope to open new windows on the Universe. Here, we list the most anticipated space missions scheduled for this year, ranked according to our own anticipation for them. We also assess the chances of these missions actually happening in the next 12 months.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Motorola is no stranger to foldables, having revived the Razr as a flip-style foldable phone in 2020. Now that it has a few iterations of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/motorola-razr-and-razr-ultra-2025-review-cool-as-hell-but-too-much-ai/">modern flip phones</a> under its belt, Moto is embarking on a new challenge: big foldables. The new (and thoroughly leaked) Motorola Razr Fold is a book-style foldable like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Google's Pixel Fold lines, offering a smartphone-sized external display with a big foldable panel inside.</p>
<p>Motorola is taking the opportunity to reveal the phone at CES, but it's far from ready for launch. Currently, Motorola is aiming to release the Razr Fold this coming summer for an unknown amount of money—Motorola won't confirm pricing or really much of anything about the Razr Fold at this time.</p>
<p>What we do know is the device will be about as big as other large foldable phones, featuring a 6.6-inch external display and an 8.1-inch internal one. Moto says the main foldable OLED panel will have a 2K resolution, which means roughly 2,000 pixels tall. Again, this is similar to existing foldables.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/motorola-reveals-the-razr-fold-a-book-style-foldable-launching-this-summer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As a Windows system built inside of a functioning <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-keyboards-mechanical-membrane-and-buckling-springs/#toc-h1">membrane keyboard</a>, the HP EliteBoard G1a announced today is a more accessible alternative to other keyboard-PCs.</p>
<p>The Commodore 64 made the keyboard-PC famous in the 1980s, but the keyboard-PC space has been dominated by the Raspberry Pi. In 2019, the single-board computer (SBC) maker released the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/raspberry-pi-400-the-under-100-desktop-pc-you-didnt-know-you-needed/'">Raspberry Pi 400</a>, which is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 SBC inside a case that also functions as a keyboard for the system. USB, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, plus a GPIO header and native Raspberry Pi OS Linux distribution add up to a low-end desktop computer experience that only costs $100. It was followed by the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/raspberry-pi-500-updates-sub-100-desktop-pc-with-more-speed-optional-monitor/">Raspberry Pi 500,</a> with a Pi 5 powered by a quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 inside; and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/raspberry-pi-supercharges-its-keyboard-pc-with-16gb-ram-ssd-mechanical-switches/">Pi 500+</a>, which has an NVMe SSD, instead of microSD, storage and is built inside of a low-profile mechanical keyboard (it’s also twice as expensive at $200).</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the first time in years, Nvidia declined to introduce new GeForce graphics card models at CES. CEO Jensen Huang's characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0NBILspM4c4?si=XYiz9rxj0iK5LXI0&amp;t=6206">90-minute keynote</a> focused almost entirely on the company's dominant AI business, relegating the company's gaming-related announcements to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foltcapx62E">a separate video posted later in the evening</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia's basket of upscaling and frame-generation technologies.</p>
<p>DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new "second-generation transformer model" that Nvidia says has been "trained on an expanded data set" to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia's Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it's working from a lower-resolution source image.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/nvidia-leans-on-dlss-improvements-to-make-up-for-a-lack-of-gpus-at-ces/">Read full article</a></p>

The CTIA said that "jamming blocks all communications, including lawful communications such as 911 calling," and argued that the FCC "has no authority to allow jamming."</p>
<p>CTIA members AT&amp;T and Verizon expressed their displeasure in separate comments to the FCC.

<p>“It was obvious we needed to change,” Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and COO at Dell Technologies, said at a press event in New York City previewing Dell's CES 2026 announcements.</p>
<p>A year ago, Dell abandoned XPS branding, as well as its Latitude, Inspiron, and Precision PC lineups. The company replaced the reputable brands with Dell Premium, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Each series included a base model, as well as “Plus” and “Premium.” Dell isn’t resurrecting its Latitude, Inspiron, or Precision series, and it will still sell “Dell Pro” models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/dells-xps-revival-is-a-welcome-reprieve-from-the-ai-pc-fad/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Monday, US District Judge Sidney Stein <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NYT-v-OpenAI-Order-1-5-26.pdf">denied</a> objections that OpenAI raised, claiming that Magistrate Judge Ona Wang failed to adequately balance the privacy interests of ChatGPT users who are not involved in the litigation when ordering OpenAI to produce 20 million logs.</p>
<p>Instead, OpenAI wanted Stein to agree that it would be much less burdensome to users if OpenAI ran search terms to find potentially infringing outputs in the sample. That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/news-orgs-want-openai-to-dig-up-millions-of-deleted-chatgpt-logs/">Read full article</a></p>
