                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2002, Bryan Fleming helped to create pcTattletale, software for monitoring phone and computer usage. Fleming's tool would record everything done on the target device, and the videos would be uploaded to a server where they could be viewed by the pcTattletale subscriber.</p>
<p>This might sound creepy, but it can also be legal when used by a parent monitoring their child or an employee monitoring their workers. These are exactly the use cases that were once outlined on pcTattletale's website, where the software was said to have "helped tens of thousands of parents stop their daughters from meeting up with pedophiles." Businesses can "track productivity, theft, lost hours, and more." Even "police departments use it for investigating."</p>
<p>But this week, nearly 25 years after launching pcTattletale, Fleming pled guilty in federal court to having knowingly built and marketed software to spy on other adults without their consent. In other words, pcTattletale was often used to spy on romantic partners without their knowledge—and Fleming helped people do it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/michigan-man-learns-the-hard-way-that-catch-a-cheater-spyware-apps-arent-legal/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission plans to authorize a new category of wireless devices in the 6 GHz Wi-Fi band that will be permitted to operate at higher power levels than currently allowed. The FCC will also consider authorizing higher power levels for certain wireless devices that are only allowed to operate indoors.</p>
<p>The FCC said it scheduled a vote for its January 29 meeting on an order "to create a new category of unlicensed devices... that can operate outdoors and at higher power than previously authorized devices." These so-called Geofenced variable power (GVP) devices operating on the 6 GHz band will "support high data rates suitable for AR/VR, short-range hotspots, automation, and indoor navigation," and "overcome limitations of previous device classes by allowing higher power and outdoor mobility," the FCC said. They will be required to work with geofencing systems to avoid interference with fixed microwave links and radio astronomy observatories.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr attributed the FCC's planned action to President Trump in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/president-trump-unleashes-american-innovation-6-ghz-win">press release</a> titled, "President Trump Unleashes American Innovation With 6 GHz Win." That's consistent with Carr's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/fcc-deletes-independent-agency-from-website-as-carr-defends-allegiance-to-trump/">relatively new stance</a> that the FCC takes orders from the president, despite his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/no-one-loves-president-trump-more-than-fcc-chairman-brendan-carr/">insisting during the Biden era</a> that the FCC must operate independently from the White House.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fcc-to-authorize-more-powerful-wireless-devices-in-6-ghz-wi-fi-band/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins unveiled the delayed 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for America Wednesday, which is already drawing criticism for its ties to the meat and dairy industry.</p>
<p>Headlining with the advice to "eat real food," the new <a href="https://cdn.realfood.gov/DGA.pdf">guidelines</a>, which are updated every five years, are in a brisk, citation-free 10-page document. Overall, the new guidelines: lambaste added sugars and highly processed foods (though it doesn't clearly define them); ditch previous limits on alcohol while directing Americans to just drink "less"; beef up recommendations for protein, including red meat; and appear to embrace saturated fats while not actually changing the 2020–2025 recommendation for how much you should eat—which was and continues to be no more than 10 percent of total daily calories.</p>
<p>"We are ending the war on saturated fats," Kennedy said triumphantly in a White House press briefing Wednesday, despite the lack of a change. He went on to proclaim that "today, our government declares war on added sugar," though that too is questionable.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-s-dietary-guidelines-beef-tallow-is-in-but-no-booze-for-breakfast/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>When it comes to cognitive ability, not all dogs are created equal. Most dogs can learn simple action cues like “sit” or “down." But so-called “gifted word learner” (GWL) dogs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn the names of objects—for example, learning the names of specific toys so well that they can retrieve them from a large pile of toys on command. And according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq5474">new study</a> published in the journal Science, they can even learn labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. Per the authors, this suggests that GWL dogs have sociocognitive skills that are functionally comparable to those of 18-month-old human toddlers.</p>
<p>Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the <a href="https://ethology.elte.hu/gifteddogs">Genius Dog Challenge</a>.

Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels.</p>
<p>In that 2022 study, all the dogs—regardless of whether they were GWL dogs or typical dogs—successfully picked out the target toys in both light and dark conditions, though it took them longer to locate the toys in the dark. Most relied on visual cues, even though dogs possess an excellent sense of smell. However, the dogs sniffed more frequently and longer when searching for the toy in the dark.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/these-dogs-eavesdrop-on-their-owners-to-learn-new-words/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>For weeks, xAI has faced backlash over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/xai-silent-after-grok-sexualized-images-of-kids-dril-mocks-groks-apology/">undressing and sexualizing</a> images of women and children generated by Grok. One researcher conducted a 24-hour analysis of the Grok account on X and estimated that the chatbot generated over 6,000 images an hour flagged as "sexually suggestive or nudifying," Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x">reported</a>.</p>
<p>While the chatbot claimed that xAI supposedly "identified lapses in safeguards" that allowed outputs flagged as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and was "urgently fixing them," Grok has proven to be an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/no-grok-cant-really-apologize-for-posting-non-consensual-sexual-images/">unreliable spokesperson</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/">xAI has not announced any fixes.</a></p>
<p>A quick look at Grok's safety guidelines on its public <a href="https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts/blob/main/grok4_system_turn_prompt_v8.j2%20%20a7c186f">GitHub</a> shows they were last updated two months ago. The GitHub also indicates that, despite prohibiting such content, Grok maintains programming that could make it likely to generate CSAM.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/grok-assumes-users-seeking-images-of-underage-girls-have-good-intent/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/">announced</a> ChatGPT Health, a dedicated section of the AI chatbot designed for "health and wellness conversations" intended to connect a user's health and medical records to the chatbot in a secure way.</p>
<p>But mixing generative AI technology like ChatGPT with health advice or analysis of any kind has been a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/01/dont-use-chatgpt-to-diagnose-your-kids-illness-study-finds-83-error-rate/">controversial idea</a> since the launch of the service in late 2022. Just days ago, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/calif-teen-chatgpt-drug-advice-fatal-overdose-21266718.php">SFGate published an investigation</a> detailing how a 19-year-old California man died of a drug overdose in May 2025 after 18 months of seeking recreational drug advice from ChatGPT. It's a telling example of what can go wrong when chatbot guardrails <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/after-teen-suicide-openai-claims-it-is-helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/">fail</a> during long conversations and people follow erroneous AI guidance.</p>
<p>Despite the known accuracy issues with AI chatbots, OpenAI's new Health feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal so that ChatGPT can provide personalized health responses like summarizing care instructions, preparing for doctor appointments, and understanding test results.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/chatgpt-health-lets-you-connect-medical-records-to-an-ai-that-makes-things-up/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo's Switch 2 was an unmitigated market success for Nintendo following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-the-ars-technica-review/">its launch last June</a>, selling <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250611.html">a record-setting 3.5 million units worldwide</a> in its first four days and reaching over 10 million shipments <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">in just under four months</a>. But a new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over">The Game Business</a> suggests that frenzied initial sales pace may have slowed significantly in many markets during the system's crucial first holiday season.</p>
<p>The report suggests that US Switch 2 sales were down about 35 percent during November and December compared to sales of the original Switch in the same period in 2017. In the UK, Switch 2 sales were down 16 percent compared to the original Switch during the last eight weeks of the year. And in France, comparative Switch 2 sales were down 30 percent relative to the Switch for the same period, reflecting what The Game Business says is "a slowdown in Switch 2 sales momentum over the Christmas sales window" across "all major European markets."</p>
<p>The Switch 2's relative performance was a little better in Japan, where sales for the holiday period declined just 5.5 percent compared to the original Switch. For the full launch year, though, Japanese Switch 2 sales were up 11 percent compared to the Switch launch, thanks perhaps in part to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">a cheaper Japan-only version of the console</a> that isn't subject to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/will-japans-weak-enconomy-mean-a-cheaper-switch-2-in-the-us/">the vagaries of international currency valuations</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/seasonal-switch-2-sales-show-significant-slowing-as-annual-cycle-sunsets/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Prior to World War II the vast majority of telescopes built around the world were funded by wealthy people with an interest in the heavens above.</p>
<p>However, after the war, two significant developments in the mid-20th century caused the burden of funding large astronomical instruments to largely shift to the government and academic institutions. First, as mirrors became larger and larger to see deeper into the universe, their costs grew exponentially. And then, with the advent of spaceflight, the expense of space-based telescopes expanded even further.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There’s a well-worn pattern in the development of AI chatbots. Researchers discover a vulnerability and exploit it to do something bad. The platform introduces a guardrail that stops the attack from working. Then, researchers devise a simple tweak that once again imperils chatbot users.</p>
<p>The reason more often than not is that AI is so inherently designed to comply with user requests that the guardrails are reactive and ad hoc, meaning they are built to foreclose a specific attack technique rather than the broader class of vulnerabilities that make it possible. It’s tantamount to putting a new highway guardrail in place in response to a recent crash of a compact car but failing to safeguard larger types of vehicles.</p>
<h2>Enter ZombieAgent, son of ShadowLeak</h2>
<p>One of the latest examples is a vulnerability recently discovered in ChatGPT. It allowed researchers at Radware to surreptitiously exfiltrate a user's private information. Their attack also allowed for the data to be sent directly from ChatGPT servers, a capability that gave it additional stealth, since there were no signs of breach on user machines, many of which are inside protected enterprises. Further, the exploit planted entries in the long-term memory that the AI assistant stores for the targeted user, giving it persistence.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/chatgpt-falls-to-new-data-pilfering-attack-as-a-vicious-cycle-in-ai-continues/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Gmail made us all rethink how email could work when it debuted more than 20 years ago. Google thinks we're in the process of another email transformation courtesy of AI. The company has <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/gmail/gmail-gemini/">unveiled</a> a new round of AI features that will make Gemini an even more integral part of Gmail. The new Gemini experiences are coming to paying subscribers starting today, and a collection of previously premium-only AI features are rolling out widely.</p>
<p>AI Overviews first appeared in Gmail last year to summarize email chains, and now it's expanding to Gmail search. This is closer to the AI Overview experience to which you are accustomed in Google's web search. You can enter a natural language search, and the robot churns through your messages to generate a response.</p>
<figure class="video ars-wp-video">
  <div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative" style="aspect-ratio: 1.7777777777778;">
    <video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" id="video-2134368-1" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gmail-AI-Overview-search-Demo.mp4?_=1"></source>Gmail AI Overview</video>
  </div>

    <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span>
    <div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300">

    <div class="caption-content">
      Gmail AI Overview

          </div>
  </div>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the example above, the user looks up a past plumbing quote. Traditionally, Gmail would show emails that are likely matches for your search. With AI Overview, you instead get a nicely formatted AI answer that includes all the relevant information and cites the email. That sounds all well and good, assuming it works. AI Overviews in search is notoriously inaccurate when summarizing search results, but grounding it in your email could make it less likely to screw up.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Later this month, Volvo will unveil its new EX60 SUV. The Swedish automaker has adopted some of the latest trends in electric vehicle design for the EX60, like a structural battery pack and the use of very large castings. As always with automakers teasing a new car, concrete details are only emerging slowly ahead of the official reveal on January 21, but we can say that range and recharging speeds were a priority during the design process.</p>
<p>"With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car. The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety," said Anders Bell, Volvo's CTO.</p>
<p>Volvo says that its SUV will be best-in-class for range, which means 400 miles (644 km) from a fully charged battery under the EPA test cycle (although an official EPA range number isn't due yet). Fast charging should also live up to the name. Providing you plug into a 400 kW DC fast charger, the EX60 should add 168 miles (270 km) of range in 10 minutes, although we don't know how long it requires to fast charge from 10–80 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/volvo-says-new-ex60-has-400-mile-range-charges-up-to-400-kw/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The annual Consumer Electronics Show is currently raging in Las Vegas, and as has become traditional over the past decade, automakers and their suppliers now use the conference to announce their technology plans. Tonight it was Ford's turn, and it is very on-trend for 2026. If you guessed that means AI is coming to the Ford in-car experience, congratulations, you guessed right.</p>
<p>Even though the company owes everything to mass-producing identical vehicles, it says that it wants AI to personalize your car to you. "Our vision for the customer is simple, but not elementary: a seamless layer of intelligence that travels with you between your phone and your vehicle," said Doug Field, Ford's chief EV, design, and digital officer.</p>
<p>"Not generic intelligence—many people can do that better than we can. What customers need is intelligence that understands where you are, what you’re doing, and what your vehicle is capable of, and then makes the next decision simpler," Field <a href="https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2026/ford-affordable-smart-vehicle-technology-strategy">wrote in a blog post</a> Ford shared ahead of time with Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/in-car-ai-assistant-coming-to-fords-and-lincolns-in-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since 2020, Samsung has been dangling a yellow ball in front of us. That sphere is a robot named Ballie that Samsung has teased and demoed for home use, including serving as a smart speaker. Today, Ballie is confirmed to be facing an eternity as vaporware.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/samsungs-ces-vaporware-keynote-details-ar-glasses-fitness-exoskeleton/#h2">CES 2020</a>, Ars Technica reported that Ballie was “the furthest-along concept” that Samsung demonstrated. At the time, we saw Ballie use facial recognition to follow its owner. A marketing video also portrayed the robot controlling smart home devices, including activating a smart vacuum when someone made a mess.</p>
<p>Ballie rolled back onto the trade show scene <a href="b.%09https:/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/samsungs-ballie-home-robot-is-back-way-bigger-and-headed-to-production/">at CES 2024.</a> This time, it had a new, more spherical and larger build rolling upon its three wheels. Ballie also sported a light ring, and Samsung showed a video of the robot being used as a projector. The South Korean firm claimed that Ballie would provide “two to three hours of continued projector use” before needing a charge. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBfSX3QiqDM">Samsung's video</a> also demonstrated Ballie connecting with a smartphone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/samsung-squashes-hopes-that-it-will-release-its-ballie-home-robot/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The program is through the state's "regulatory sandbox" framework, which allows businesses to trial "innovative" products or services with state regulations temporarily waived. The Utah Department of Commerce partnered with Doctronic, a telehealth startup with an AI chatbot.</p>
<p>Doctronic offers a nationwide service that allows patients to chat with its "<a href="https://www.doctronic.ai/">AI doctor</a>" for free, then, for $39, book a virtual appointment with a real doctor licensed in their state. But patients must go through the AI chatbot first to get an appointment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/utah-allows-ai-to-autonomously-prescribe-medication-refills/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery board has unanimously voted to rebuff Paramount's $108.4 billion offer and urged shareholders to reject the hostile takeover bid. The board is continuing to support Netflix's pending $82.7 billion purchase of its streaming and movie studios businesses along with a separate spinoff of the Warner Bros. cable TV division.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. called the Paramount bid "illusory" in a <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001437107/93976be9-de55-45c8-a448-1b4109f8dc6f.pdf">presentation</a> for shareholders today, saying the offer requires an "extraordinary amount of debt financing" and other terms that make it less likely to be completed than a Netflix merger. It would be the largest leveraged buyout ever, "with $87B of total pro forma gross debt," and is "effectively a one-sided option for PSKY [Paramount Skydance] as the offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time," Warner Bros. said.</p>
<p>The Warner Bros. presentation touted Netflix's financial strength while saying that Paramount "is a $14B market cap company with a 'junk' credit rating, negative free cash flows, significant fixed financial obligations, and a high degree of dependency on its linear business." The Paramount "offer is illusory as it cannot be completed before it is currently scheduled to expire," Warner Bros. said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/warner-bros-sticks-with-netflix-merger-calls-paramounts-108b-bid-illusory/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In October, Bose announced that its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/bose-soundtouch-home-theater-systems-regress-into-dumb-speakers-feb-18/">SoundTouch Wi-Fi speakers and soundbars</a> would become dumb speakers on February 18. At the time, Bose said that the speakers would only work if a device was connected via AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth (which has higher latency than Wi-Fi).</p>
<p>After that date, the speakers would stop receiving security and software updates and lose cloud connectivity and their companion app, the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said. Without the app, users would no longer be able to integrate the device with music services, such as Spotify, have multiple SoundTouch devices play the same audio simultaneously, or use or edit saved presets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/bose-open-sources-its-soundtouch-home-theater-smart-speakers-ahead-of-eol/">Read full article</a></p>
