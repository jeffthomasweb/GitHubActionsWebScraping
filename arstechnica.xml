              <![CDATA[<p>The first batch of internet satellites for China's Guowang megaconstellation launched Monday on the country's heavy-lift Long March 5B rocket.</p>
<p>The satellites are the first of up to 13,000 spacecraft a consortium of Chinese companies plans to build and launch over the next decade. The Guowang fleet will beam low-latency, high-speed internet signals in an architecture similar to SpaceX's Starlink network, although Chinese officials haven't laid out any specifics, such as target markets, service specifications, or user terminals.</p>
<p>The Long March 5B rocket took off from Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan Island, China's southernmost province, at 5:00 am EST (10:00 UTC) Monday. Ten liquid-fueled engines powered the rocket off the ground with 2.4 million pounds of thrust, steering the Long March 5B on a course south from Wenchang into a polar orbit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/china-orbits-first-guowang-internet-satellites-with-thousands-more-to-come/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Matthew Decker is the former chief information officer for Penn State University’s Applied Research Laboratory. As of October, he's also $250,000 richer.</p>
<p>In his Penn State position, Decker was well placed to see that the university was not implementing all of the cybersecurity controls that were required by its various contracts with NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD). It did not, for instance, use an external cloud services provider that met the DoD's security guidelines, and it fudged some of the self-submitted "scores" it made to the government about Penn State's IT security.</p>
<p>So Decker sued the school under the False Claims Act, which lets private individuals bring cases against organizations on behalf of the government if they come across evidence of wrongdoing related to government contracts. In many of these cases, the government later "intervenes" to assist with the case (as it did here), but whether it does so or not, whistleblowers stand to collect a percentage of any fines if they win.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/in-it-need-cash-cybersecurity-whistleblowers-are-earning-big-payouts/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Correction issued for black plastic study that had people tossing spatulas.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Editors of the environmental chemistry journal Chemosphere have posted an eye-catching correction to a study reporting toxic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524022173">flame retardants from electronics wind up in some household products made of black plastic</a>, including kitchen utensils. The study sparked a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/black-plastic-spatula-health-risks-6fddfdad?mod=e2tw">flurry of media reports</a> a few weeks ago that urgently implored people to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/10/black-plastic-spatula-flame-retardants/680452/">ditch their kitchen spatulas</a> and spoons. Wirecutter even offered a buying guide for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/toxic-black-plastic-kitchen-alternatives/">what to replace them with</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565352402811X">The correction</a>, posted Sunday, will likely take some heat off the beleaguered utensils. The authors made a math error that put the estimated risk from kitchen utensils off by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Specifically, the authors estimated that if a kitchen utensil contained middling levels of a key toxic flame retardant (BDE-209), the utensil would transfer 34,700 nanograms of the contaminant a day based on regular use while cooking and serving hot food. The authors then compared that estimate to a reference level of BDE-209 considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's safe level is 7,000 ng—per kilogram of body weight—per day, and the authors used 60 kg as the adult weight (about 132 pounds) for their estimate. So, the safe EPA limit would be 7,000 multiplied by 60, yielding 420,000 ng per day. That's 12 times more than the estimated exposure of 34,700 ng per day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/huge-math-error-corrected-in-black-plastic-study-authors-say-it-doesnt-matter/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Sony launched the PlayStation Portable almost exactly 20 years ago, the value proposition was right there in the name: a PlayStation, but portable. But now modders have flipped that, introducing a PSP that can be played on a TV, console-style, and they've dubbed it the <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/">PS Placeable</a>.</p>
<p>It's a non-destructive mod to PSP-2000 and PSP-3000 systems that allows you to play PSP games on the TV off the original UMD physical media format, with a wireless controller like the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4—all wrapped in a miniature, PlayStation 2-like enclosure.</p>
<p>Let's be frank: One of the main reasons this thing gets special attention here is that its look is both clever and, well, kind of adorable. The miniaturization of the retro styling of the PlayStation 2 is a nice touch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ps-placeable-the-adorable-mod-that-turns-a-playstation-portable-into-a-console/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hackers trying to extort the Rhode Island government infiltrated the state's public benefits system, causing state officials to shut down online services that let residents apply for Medicaid and other assistance programs.</p>
<p>"As part of this investigation today, we discovered that within the Rhode Island Bridges system, a cybercriminal had installed dangerous malware that constituted an urgent threat," Governor Dan McKee said at a Friday night press conference, <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/politics/state/2024/12/13/rhode-island-computer-network-cyberattack-forces-shutdown-public-benefits-system/76975102007/">according to The Providence Journal</a>. "That is why tonight we have shut down the system. That means customers will temporarily not be able to access any customer portal related to the services on Rhode Island Bridges."</p>
<p>The vendor "Deloitte confirmed that there is a high probability that a cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable information from RIBridges," McKee's office <a href="https://governor.ri.gov/press-releases/governor-mckee-issues-update-cybersecurity-breach-ribridges-system">said</a> in a press release. Rhode Island has "proactively taken the system offline so that the State and Deloitte can work to address the threat and restore the system as quickly as possible."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/hackers-infiltrate-rhode-island-benefits-portal-forcing-state-to-shut-it-down/">Read full article</a></p>

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released a <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/amazon_investigation.pdf">report</a> accusing Amazon of operating "uniquely dangerous warehouses" that allegedly put profits over worker safety.</p>
<p>As chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Sanders started investigating Amazon in June 2023. His goal was "to uncover why Amazon’s injury rates far exceed those of its competitors and to understand what happens to Amazon workers when they are injured on the job."</p>
<p>According to Sanders, Amazon "sometimes ignored" the committee's requests and ultimately only supplied 285 documents requested. The e-commerce giant was mostly only willing to hand over "training materials given to on-site first aid staff," Sanders noted, rather than "information on how it tracks workers, the quotas it imposes on workers, and the disciplinary actions it takes when workers cannot meet those quotas, internal studies on the connection between speed and injury rates, and the company’s treatment of injured workers."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/bernie-sanders-probe-finds-amazon-hid-worker-injuries-to-prioritize-profits/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile today said it opened registration for the "T-Mobile Starlink" beta service that will enable text messaging via satellites in dead zones not covered by cell towers.</p>
<p>T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-starlink-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">announcement</a> said the service using Starlink's low-Earth orbit satellites will "provid[e] coverage for the 500,000 square miles of land in the United States not covered by earth-bound cell towers." Starlink parent SpaceX has so far launched over 300 satellites with direct-to-cell capabilities, T-Mobile noted.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">registration page</a> says, "We expect the beta to begin in early 2025, starting with texting and expanding to data and voice over time. The beta is open to all T-Mobile postpaid customers for free, but capacity is limited."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/t-mobile-opens-beta-registration-for-starlink-enabled-cell-phone-service/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The incoming Trump administration has even more plans to delay electric vehicle adoption than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/">previously thought</a>. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-team-plans-sweeping-rollback-biden-ev-emissions-policies-2024-12-16/">Reuters</a>, which has seen transition team documents, the Trump team wants to abolish EV subsidies, claw back federal funding meant for EV charging infrastructure, block EV battery imports on national security grounds, and prevent the federal government and the US military from purchasing more EVs.</p>
<p>During the campaign, candidate Trump made repeated references to ending a supposed EV mandate. In fact, policies put in place by current US President Joe Biden only call for 50 percent of all new vehicles to be electrified by 2032 under EPA rules <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/new-epa-rules-would-cut-car-emissions-56-by-2032/">meant to cut emissions by 56 percent from 2026 levels</a>.</p>
<h2>More pollution</h2>
<p>Instead, the new regime will be far more friendly to gas guzzling, as it intends to roll back EPA fuel efficiency standards to those in effect in 2019. This would increase the allowable level of emissions from cars by about 25 percent relative to the current rule set. US new vehicle efficiency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/us-vehicle-fuel-efficiency-effectively-stalled-over-the-last-10-years/">stalled between 2008 and 2019</a>, and it was only once the Biden administration began in 2021 that the EPA started instituting stricter rules on allowable limits of carbon dioxide and other pollutants from vehicle tailpipes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/on-trumps-chopping-block-evs-charger-funding-californias-emissions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Medical accounts of red wine headaches <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/head.12365">go back to Roman times</a>, but the experience is likely as old as winemaking—<a href="https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/evolution-wine/">something like 10,000 years</a>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Si-iSdEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">As chemists</a> <a href="https://waterhouse.ucdavis.edu/people/andrew-waterhouse">specializing in winemaking</a>, we wanted to try to figure out the source of these headaches.</p>
<p>Many components of red wine have been accused of causing this misery—<a href="https://farrp.unl.edu/sulfites-usa">sulfites</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/biogenic-amine">biogenic amines</a>, and <a href="https://www.wineenthusiast.com/culture/wine/tannins-wine-guide/?srsltid=AfmBOoqVhvXVvETmEHbmXswysSh8Laezc9OtARU6PqI9oGmP5OR-Dx9n">tannins</a> are the most popular. Our research suggests the most likely culprit is one you may not have considered.</p>
<h2>The common suspects</h2>
<p>Sulfites have been a popular scapegoat for all sorts of ailments since it became mandatory in the 1990s to label them on wines in the US. However, not much evidence links sulfites directly to headaches, and <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/sulfite-allergy-82911">other foods</a> contain comparable levels to wine without the same effects. White wines also contain the <a href="https://winefolly.com/deep-dive/sulfites-in-wine/">same amount of sulfites as red wines</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/researchers-hone-in-on-headache-causing-compounds-in-red-wine/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you're looking to buy a TV in 2025, you may be disappointed by the types of advancements TV brands will be prioritizing in the new year. While there's an audience of enthusiasts interested in developments in tech like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/what-tandem-oled-can-and-probably-wont-do-for-consumer-gadgets/">OLED</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/meet-qdel-the-backlight-less-display-tech-that-could-replace-oled-in-premium-tvs/">QDEL</a>, and Micro LED, plus other features like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/lg-oled-t-is-a-transparent-77-inch-tv-that-will-arrive-in-2024/">transparency</a> and improved audio, that doesn't appear to be what the industry is focused on.</p>
<p>Today's TV selection has a serious dependency on<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/"> advertisements and user tracking</a>. In 2025, we expect competition in the TV industry to center around TV operating systems (OSes) and TVs' ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to viewers.</p>
<p>That yields a complicated question for shoppers: Are you willing to share your data with retail conglomerates and ad giants to save money on a TV?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/buying-a-tv-in-2025-expect-lower-prices-more-ads-and-an-os-war/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>It is the first human H5N1 case detected in Louisiana. For now, the case is considered a "presumptive" positive until testing is confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health officials say that the risk to the public is low but caution people to stay away from any sick or dead birds. A spokesperson for Louisiana's health department told Ars that the hospitalized patient had contact with both backyard and wild birds.</p>
<p>Although the person has been hospitalized, their condition was not reported. The spokesperson said the department would not comment on the patient's condition due to patient confidentiality and an ongoing public health investigation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/person-hospitalized-in-louisiana-with-bird-flu-health-officials-report/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A sophisticated and ongoing supply-chain attack operating for the past year has been stealing sensitive login credentials from both malicious and benevolent security personnel by infecting them with Trojanized versions of open source software from GitHub and NPM, researchers said.</p>
<p>The campaign, first reported three weeks ago by security firm <a href="https://checkmarx.com/blog/dozens-of-machines-infected-year-long-npm-supply-chain-attack-combines-crypto-mining-and-data-theft/">Checkmarx</a> and again on Friday by <a href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/mut-1244-targeting-offensive-actors/">Datadog Security Labs</a>, uses multiple avenues to infect the devices of researchers in security and other technical fields. One is through packages that have been available on open source repositories for over a year. They install a professionally developed backdoor that takes pains to conceal its presence. The unknown threat actors behind the campaign have also employed spear phishing that targets thousands of researchers who publish papers on the arXiv platform.</p>
<h2>Unusual longevity</h2>
<p>The objectives of the threat actors are also multifaceted. One is the collection of SSH private keys, Amazon Web Services access keys, command histories, and other sensitive information from infected devices every 12 hours. When this post went live, dozens of machines remained infected, and an online account on Dropbox contained some 390,000 credentials for WordPress websites taken by the attackers, most likely by stealing them from fellow malicious threat actors. The malware used in the campaign also installs cryptomining software that was present on at least 68 machines as of last month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/yearlong-supply-chain-attack-targeting-security-pros-steals-390k-credentials/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog">Werner Herzog</a> has made more than 60 films over his illustrious career. His documentaries alone span an impressive topical range, from the life and death of bear enthusiast <a title="Timothy Treadwell" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Treadwell">Timothy Treadwell</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_Man"><em>Grizzly Man</em></a>) to people who choose to live and work in Antarctica (the Oscar-nominated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encounters_at_the_End_of_the_World"><em>Encounters at the End of the World</em></a>) or a haunting exploration of the oldest human paintings in France's Chauvet Cave (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Forgotten_Dreams"><em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams</em></a>). His latest offering, <em>Theater of Thought</em>, tackles what might be his most ambitious subject yet: the mysterious inner workings of the brain.</p>
<p><em>Theater of Thought</em> premiered in 2022 at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado and is now getting a theatrical release. Herzog's inspiration grew out of his conversations with <a href="https://ntc.columbia.edu/rafael-yuste/">Rafael Yuste</a>, a Columbia University neurobiologist who also served as scientific advisor on the film. "How can we read thoughts?" he writes in his director's statement. "Can you implant a chip in your brain and in my brain, and see my new film without a camera? Why is it that some young people immerse themselves in video games and become addicted to completely artificial worlds? Sometimes mice even prefer invented cartoon worlds, so who is the ghost writer of our mind, of our reality?"</p>
<p>The topic might be scientific in nature, but <em>Theater of Thought</em> is not really a science documentary, despite Herzog's use of the classic talking head format. It's more of a personal, almost quixotic quest, with plenty of random branching digressions along the way. "It was like a road movie, one Monument Valley and one Grand Canyon, then one Mount Everest after the other," Herzog told Ars. "You just couldn't stop wondering and enjoying." For the viewer, it's as much a journey through the eccentric workings of Herzog's endlessly curious, nimble mind.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/werner-herzog-muses-on-mysteries-of-the-brain-in-theater-of-thought/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk has at least one more battle to wage against Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who will be leaving the agency when President-elect Trump takes over in January.</p>
<p>Musk yesterday <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1867357433493872874">posted</a> a copy of a letter sent to Gensler by Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro. The letter dated December 12 says the SEC issued a settlement demand in its investigation into whether Musk violated federal securities laws in connection with 2022 purchases of Twitter stock, and that the SEC is investigating Neuralink. The Spiro letter said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday the Commission Staff issued a settlement demand that required Mr. Musk agree within 48 hours to either accept a monetary payment or face charges on numerous counts. They indicated that this demand was the result of a directive from their superiors and that charges would be brought imminently unless Mr. Musk acquiesced. This demand follows a multi-year investigation and more than six years of harassment of Mr. Musk by the Commission and its Staff. More recently, the Staff subpoenaed me, Mr. Musk's attorney, for testimony and threatened to send a process server if I did not immediately cooperate. I categorically refused. This week, the Commission has also reopened an investigation into Neuralink.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spiro accused the SEC of "an improperly motivated campaign" against Musk, his companies, and people associated with him. "We demand to know who directed these actions—whether it was you or the White House," Spiro wrote. "These tactics and misguided scheme will not intimidate us. We reserve all rights."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/elon-musk-slams-sec-as-agency-threatens-charges-in-twitter-stock-probe/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A bitcoin investor who went to increasingly great lengths to hide $1 million in cryptocurrency gains on his tax returns was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/early-bitcoin-investor-sentenced-filing-tax-returns-falsely-reported-his-cryptocurrency">sentenced</a> to two years in prison on Thursday.</p>
<p>It seems that not even his most "sophisticated" tactics—including using mixers, managing multiple wallets, and setting up in-person meetings to swap bitcoins for cash—kept the feds from tracing crypto trades that he believed were untraceable.</p>
<p>The Austin, Texas, man, Frank Richard Ahlgren III, started buying up bitcoins in 2011. In 2015, he upped his trading, purchasing approximately 1,366 using Coinbase accounts. He waited until 2017 before cashing in, earning $3.7 million after selling about 640 at a price more than 10 times his initial costs. Celebrating his gains, he bought a house in Utah in 2017, mostly funded by bitcoins he purchased in 2015.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/dont-use-crypto-to-cheat-on-taxes-bitcoin-bro-gets-2-years/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1’s recent popularity still feels a little strange to longtime fans of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/formula-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sport</a>, particularly in the US, where it had been so niche for so long. But the past five years have seen F1 rise meteorically, and a new, much younger fanbase infused with enthusiasm for the cutting-edge race cars and the athletes who pilot them has emerged. F1 Arcade capitalizes on that popularity, combining food and drinks—including Lewis Hamilton's agave tipple—with dozens and dozens of race simulators that let you race against friends or compete in teams against others.</p>
<p>With Washington, DC, chosen for F1 Arcade's second US location, I obviously had to go check it out.</p>
<p>My first visit to the arcade in DC's Union Market district was several weeks ago at the launch party, an affair that was packed with influencers and loud music. But I returned earlier this week, having booked a 45-minute, five-race session playing head-to-head against a friend. Prices vary depending on the number of races and whether you're that at peak time, starting at $22/player for three races off-peak and going up to $42/player for five races at peak time. There's no charge for people who are just spectating (or eating and drinking), not racing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/12/f1-arcade-trip-report-great-sims-make-for-a-compelling-experience/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>ORLANDO, Florida—Earlier this year, officials at US Space Command released a list of priorities and needs, and among the routine recitation of things like cyber defense, communications, and surveillance was a relatively new term: "integrated space fires."</p>
<p>This is a new phrase in the esoteric terminology the military uses to describe its activities. Essentially, "fires" are offensive or defensive actions against an adversary. The Army <a href="https://api.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/2021/10/06/869ca62b/afc-concept-for-fires-2028-oct21.pdf">defines fires</a> as "the use of weapon systems to create specific lethal and nonlethal effects on a target."</p>
<p>The inclusion of this term in a Space Command <a href="https://www.spacecom.mil/Portals/57/USSPACECOM%20J8%20Trifold%2014%20Aug%202024%20APPROVED.pdf">planning document</a> was another signal that Pentagon leaders, long hesitant to even mention the possibility of putting offensive weapons in space for fear of stirring up a cosmic arms race, see the taboo of talking about space warfare as a thing of the past.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/the-us-military-is-now-talking-openly-about-going-on-the-attack-in-space/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The gap of time between how long Americans live and how much of that time is spent in good health only grew wider in the last two decades, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827753">a new study published in JAMA Network Open</a>.</p>
<p>The study, which looked at global health data between 2000 and 2019—prior to the COVID-19 pandemic—found the US stood out for its years of suffering. By 2019, Americans had a gap between their lifespan and their healthspan of 12.4 years, the largest gap of any of the 183 countries included in the study. The second largest gap was Australia's, at 12.1 years, followed by New Zealand at 11.8 years and the UK at 11.3 years.</p>
<p>America also stood out for having the largest burden of noncommunicable diseases in the world, as calculated by the years lived with disease or disability per 100,000 people.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/americans-are-living-longer-but-most-of-the-extra-time-is-spent-being-sick/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.23 of the Rocket Report! We're closing in on the end of the year, with a little less than three weeks remaining in 2024. Can you believe it? I hardly can. The biggest question left in launch is whether Blue Origin will make its deadline for launching New Glenn by the end of this year. It's been a long-time goal of founder Jeff Bezos, but the clock is ticking. We wish them luck!</p>
