                            <![CDATA[<p>Tis the season when professional Santas are in peak demand, but many who choose this line of work often view it as a higher calling and maintain some aspects of the identity all year round—even those who don't fit the stereotypical popular image of Santa, according to <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2023.1161">a paper</a> published in the Academy of Management Journal.</p>
<p>Co-author <a href="https://haslam.utk.edu/people/profile/christina-hymer/">Christina Hymer</a> of the University of Tennessee <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/full/10.5465/amj.2023.1161.summary">got the idea</a> for the study during the COVID pandemic, when she spent a lot of time watching Christmas movies with her toddler. One favorite was 2003's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf_(film)"><em>Elf</em></a>, starring Will Farrell as a full-sized human raised among elves who goes to New York City to find his biological father. The film prompted her to wonder about why someone would want to be Santa Claus and what their experiences in that role would be.</p>
<p>Hymer and her co-authors partnered with the leader of a "Santa school" to analyze archival surveys of 849 professional Santas, and conducted a new survey of another 382 Santas. They also did over 50 personal interviews with professional Santas. (One subject showed up in full costume for his zoom interview, with a North Pole background, and signed off with a merry "ho! ho! ho!")</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/being-santa-claus-is-a-year-round-calling/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The House of Representatives cleared the way for a massive overhaul of the federal environmental review process last Thursday, despite last-minute changes that led clean energy groups and moderate Democrats to pull their support.</p>
<p>The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4776">SPEED Act</a>, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.</p>
<p>The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/speed-act-passes-in-house-despite-changes-that-threaten-clean-power-projects/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor’s note</strong>: Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything major, please note this list does include a few specific references to several of the listed shows that some might consider spoiler-y.</em></p>
<p>This was a pretty good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Streaming platforms reigned supreme, with Netflix and Apple TV dominating our list with seven and five selections each. Genre-wise, we've got a bit of everything: period dramas (<em>The Gilded Age</em>,<em> Outrageous</em>), superheroes (<em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>), mysteries (<em>Ludwig</em>,<em> Poker Face</em>,<em> Dept. Q</em>), political thrillers (<em>The Diplomats</em>,<em> Slow Horses</em>), science fiction (<em>Andor</em>, <em>Severance</em>,<em> Alien: Earth</em>), broody fantasy (<em>The Sandman</em>), and even an unconventional nature documentary (<em>Underdogs</em>).</p>
<p>As always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2025.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/tv-technica-our-favorite-shows-of-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AI coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/the-ars-technica-ai-coding-agent-test-minesweeper-edition/">work on</a> software projects <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/anthropic-says-its-new-ai-model-maintained-focus-for-30-hours-on-multistep-tasks/">for hours</a> at a time, writing complete apps, running tests, and fixing bugs with human supervision. But these tools are not magic and can complicate rather than simplify a software project. Understanding how they work under the hood can help developers know when (and if) to use them, while avoiding common pitfalls.</p>
<p>We'll start with the basics: At the core of every AI coding agent is a technology called a large language model (LLM), which is a type of neural network trained on vast amounts of text data, including lots of programming code. It's a pattern-matching machine that uses a prompt to "extract" compressed statistical representations of data it saw during training and provide a plausible continuation of that pattern as an output. In this extraction, an LLM can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolate</a> across domains and concepts, resulting in some useful logical inferences when done well and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">confabulation errors</a> when done poorly.</p>
<p>These base models are then further refined through techniques like fine-tuning on curated examples and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which shape the model to follow instructions, use tools, and produce more useful outputs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[It's purportedly the first of four planned teasers, one per week, showing before <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5rps3Hy73k?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>You've no doubt heard some version of the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43816/to-a-mouse-56d222ab36e33">Robert Burns adage</a> about the best-laid plans. Marvel Studios had an elaborate marketing plan in place to introduce four teaser trailers for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> as previews prior to screenings of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>, with one teaser rolling out each successive week. But the first one leaked online a few days early, revealing that (as rumored) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter.</p>
<p>So maybe you've seen a bootleg version floating around the Internet, but Marvel has now released the HD version to the public. Merry Christmas! And we can look forward to three more: one focused on Thor, one on Doctor Doom, and the final one is purportedly a more traditional teaser trailer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/robert-downey-jr-returns-to-mcu-as-doctor-doom-in-two-new-avengers-movies/">previously reported</a>, Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (<em>The Kang Dynasty</em>) around Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror (and associated variants), introduced in <em>Loki</em> and <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>. But then Majors was convicted of domestic violence, and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/steve-rogers-returns-in-avengers-doomsday-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Companies are required by law to report <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-using-sora-2-to-make-child-fetish-content/">apparent child exploitation</a> to the CyberTipline.

<p>Statistics related to NCMEC reports can be nuanced.

                            <![CDATA[<p>CBS cannot contain the online spread of a "60 Minutes" segment that its editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, tried to block from airing.</p>
<p>The episode, "Inside CECOT," featured testimonies from US deportees who were tortured or suffered physical or sexual abuse at a notorious Salvadoran prison, the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism. "Welcome to hell," one former inmate was told upon arriving, the segment reported, while also highlighting a clip of Donald Trump praising CECOT and its leadership for “great facilities, very strong facilities, and they don’t play games."</p>
<p>Weiss controversially pulled the segment on Monday, claiming it could not air in the US because it lacked critical voices, as no Trump officials were interviewed. She claimed that the segment "did not advance the ball" and merely echoed others' reporting, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cbs-news-el-salvador-cecot-prison-sharyn-alfonsi-bari-weiss-rcna250618">reported</a>.

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There's still another couple of months before the 2026 crop of F1 cars takes to the track for the first preseason test. It's a year of big change for the sport, which is adopting new power unit rules that place much more emphasis on the electric motor's contribution. The switch to the new power units was meant to attract new manufacturers to the sport, and in that regard, it has succeeded. But controversy has erupted already as loopholes appear and teams exploit them.</p>
<p>Since 2014, F1 cars have used 1,000 hp (745 kW) power units that combine a turbocharged 1.6 L V6 gasoline engine with a pair of hybrid systems. One is the MGU-H, which recovers energy from (or deploys it to) the turbocharger's turbine; the other is a 160 hp (120 kW) MGU-K that harvests and deploys energy at the rear wheels. Starting next year, the MGU-H is gone, and the less-powerful 1.6 L V6 should generate about 536 hp (400 kW). That will be complemented by a 483 hp (350 kW) MGU-K, plus a much larger battery to supply it.</p>
<p>And the new rules have already attracted new OEMs to the sport. After announcing its departure at the end of 2021—sort of— Honda changed its mind and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/perfecting-hondas-2026-f1-powertrain-is-not-so-easy-says-racing-boss/">signed on to the 2026 regs</a>, supplying Aston Martin. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/audi-goes-full-minimalism-for-its-first-ever-formula-1-livery/">Audi signed up</a> and bought the Sauber team. Red Bull decided to build its own internal combustion engines, hiring heavily from the Mercedes program, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/ford-will-return-to-f1-in-2026-as-an-engine-builder/">Ford is providing Red Bull</a> with the MGU-K and the rest of the hybrid system. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/cadillac-f1-will-be-able-to-race-from-2026-despite-previous-snub/">Cadillac</a> has started an engine program, albeit one that won't take the grid until 2029.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/f1s-new-engines-are-causing-consternation-over-compression-ratios/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since I’m fascinated by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/samsungs-micro-rgb-tv-proves-the-value-of-rgb-backlights-for-premium-displays/">new</a> display <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/hdr10-advanced-joins-dolby-vision-2-in-trying-to-make-you-like-motion-smoothing/">technologies</a> and by improving image quality, I’ve never been a fan of home projectors. Projectors lack the image quality compared to good TVs and monitors, and they’re pretty needy. Without getting into the specific requirements of different models, you generally want a darker room with a large, blank wall for a projector to look its best. That can be a lot to ask for, especially in small, densely decorated homes like mine.</p>
<p>That said, a projector can be a space-efficient alternative to a big-screen TV or help you watch TV or movies outside. A projector can be versatile when paired with the right space, especially if that projector makes sure the “right space” is included in the device.</p>

Or, you can take off the fabric shroud and use the Splay as an ultra-short-throw projector and cast a display that measures up to 80 inches diagonally onto a wall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/the-splay-is-a-subpar-monitor-but-an-exciting-portable-projector/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tory Bruno, a veteran engineer and aerospace industry executive, has resigned from the top job at United Launch Alliance after more than a decade competing against the growing dominance of SpaceX, the company announced Monday.</p>
<p>The news of Bruno's sudden resignation was unexpected. His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA's market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/ulas-vulcan-rocket-shot-for-the-moon-on-debut-launch-and-hit-a-bullseye/">successful debut of ULA's Vulcan rocket</a>, followed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/ula-aimed-to-launch-up-to-10-vulcan-rockets-this-year-it-will-fly-just-once/">struggles to ramp up</a> the new rocket's launch cadence.</p>
<p>Bruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin's ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA's leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/in-a-surprise-announcement-tory-bruno-is-out-as-ceo-of-united-launch-alliance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the better part of two months last year, most of us had no idea how serious the problems were with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft docked at the International Space Station. A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA's workforce.</p>
<p>On its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing's Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.</p>
<p>The Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore <a href="http://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/the-harrowing-story-of-what-flying-starliner-was-like-when-its-thrusters-failed/">lost his ability to control</a> the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/safety-panel-says-nasa-should-have-taken-starliner-incident-more-seriously/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The world's largest shadow library—which is increasingly funded by AI developers—shocked the Internet this weekend by <a href="https://annas-archive.li/blog/backing-up-spotify.html">announcing</a> it had "backed up Spotify" and started distributing 300 terabytes of metadata and music files in bulk torrents.</p>
<p>According to Anna's Archive, the data grab represents more than 99 percent of listens on Spotify, making it "the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks." It's also "the world’s first 'preservation archive' for music which is fully open," with 86 million music files, the archive boasted.</p>
<p>The music files supposedly represent about 37 percent of songs available on Spotify as of July 2025. The scraped files were prioritized by popularity, with Anna's Archive weeding out many songs that are never streamed or are of poor quality, such as AI-generated songs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the US Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-protects-us-national-security-pausing-offshore-wind-leases">announced</a> that it was pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the US. The move comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. In what appears to be an attempt to avoid legal scrutiny, the Interior is blaming the decisions on a classified report from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The second Trump administration announced its animosity toward offshore wind power <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/">literally on day one</a>, issuing an executive order on inauguration day that called for a temporary halt to issuing permits for new projects pending a re-evaluation. Earlier this month, however, a judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trumps-order-blocking-wind-development-thrown-out-by-court/">vacated that executive order</a>, noting that the government has shown no indication that it was even attempting to start the re-evaluation it said was needed.</p>
<p>But a number of projects have gone through the entire permitting process, and construction has started. Before today, the administration had attempted to stop these in an erratic, halting manner. Empire Wind, an 800 MW farm being built off New York, was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/us-interior-secretary-orders-offshore-wind-project-shut-down/">stopped by the Department of the Interior</a>, which alleged that it had been rushed through permitting. That <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">hold was lifted</a> following lobbying and negotiations by New York and the project developer Orsted, and the Department of the Interior never revealed why it changed its mind. When the Interior Department blocked a second Orsted project, Revolution Wind offshore of southern New England, the company took the government to court and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/judge-lets-construction-on-an-offshore-wind-farm-resume/">won a ruling</a> that let it continue construction.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/us-government-finds-new-excuse-to-stop-construction-of-offshore-wind/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Director Christopher Nolan won two well-deserved Oscars for 2023's <em>Oppenheimer</em>, and Hollywood was soon buzzing about what his next project might be. A vampire period piece, perhaps? Or maybe a reboot of 1983's <em>Blue Thunder</em> or British 1960s spy series <em>The Prisoner</em>? Instead, Nolan chose to adapt one of the greatest epic sagas in history: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">Homer's <em>Odyssey</em></a>. At long last, Universal has released the first official trailer for Nolan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey_(2026_film)"><em>The Odyssey</em></a>, starring Matt Damon as the wandering Ithacan king. Frankly, it looks appropriately epic.</p>
<p>Most of us read some version of <em>The Odyssey</em> in high school, so we're familiar with the story: Odysseus, legendary Greek king of Ithaca, begins the long journey home after 10 years of fighting in the Trojan War. (We actually catch a glimpse of the famous Trojan horse in the trailer.) But the journey does not go smoothly, as Odysseus and his men encounter the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, and an enchantress named Circe, among other obstacles. Meanwhile, his long-suffering wife Penelope is warding off hundreds of suitors eager to usurp Odysseus' position.</p>
<p>It's difficult to overestimate the tremendous influence Homer's epic has had on global culture. Nolan himself recalled seeing the <em>Odyssey</em> performed as a school play when he was just 5 or 6 years old. "I remember the Sirens and him being strapped to the mast and things like that," he recently told Empire. "I think it's in all of us, really. And when you start to break down the text and adapt it, you find that all of these other films—and all the films I've worked on—you know, they're all from the <i>Odyssey</i>. It's foundational."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/odyssey-trailer-brings-the-myth-to-vivid-life/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple was hit with a $115 million fine Monday after Italy's competition authority alleged the tech giant was abusing its dominant position to harm third-party developers in its App Store.</p>
<p>In a <a href="ttps://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2025/12/A561">press release</a>, the Italian Competition Authority said that an "App Tracking Transparency" (ATT) privacy policy that Apple introduced in 2021 forced third-party developers to seek consent twice for the same data collection.</p>
<p>Requiring such "double consent" was "extremely burdensome" and "harmful" to some developers—especially the smallest developers, the regulator <a href="https://en.agcm.it/dotcmsdoc/pressrelease/A561_SUMMARY.pdf">said</a>. Many developers struggled to earn ad revenue after the policy was introduced, as users increasingly declined to opt into personalized ads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/apple-hit-with-115m-for-extremely-burdensome-app-store-privacy-policy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>San Francisco was affected by <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/pg-e-outage-40-000-customers-without-power-21254326.php">a massive power outage</a> over the weekend. It started with a fire at a substation in the city on Saturday afternoon, causing a blackout that at times affected as much as a third of the city, leaving more than 130,000 homes without power. Among the city's affected critical systems were the traffic lights, which paralyzed Waymo's fleet of robotaxis, stopping them in their tracks and clogging traffic.</p>
<p>Any recent visitor to San Francisco can't help but notice the profusion of sensor-festooned autonomous vehicles on the roads, especially the all-white Jaguar I-Paces that belong to Waymo. The robotaxi company has more than 800 AVs in its Bay Area fleet; that can feel like a conservative estimate when you see five or six at a time—invariably with no occupants—within a block.</p>
<p>The cars navigate the city, combining high-resolution maps with inputs from lidar, optical, and other sensors on the upfitted Jags. The cars drive conservatively, but they can get confused in edge cases—earlier this month, Waymo <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/06/nx-s1-5635614/waymo-school-buses-recall">issued a recall</a> to fix a problem in which its robotaxis would illegally pass stopped school buses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/power-outage-paralyzes-waymo-robotaxis-when-traffic-lights-go-out/">Read full article</a></p>
