                            <![CDATA[<p>Motorola is no stranger to foldables, having revived the Razr as a flip-style foldable phone in 2020. Now that it has a few iterations of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/motorola-razr-and-razr-ultra-2025-review-cool-as-hell-but-too-much-ai/">modern flip phones</a> under its belt, Moto is embarking on a new challenge: big foldables. The new (and thoroughly leaked) Motorola Razr Fold is a book-style foldable like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Google's Pixel Fold lines, offering a smartphone-sized external display with a big foldable panel inside.</p>
<p>Motorola is taking the opportunity to reveal the phone at CES, but it's far from ready for launch. Currently, Motorola is aiming to release the Razr Fold this coming summer for an unknown amount of money—Motorola won't confirm pricing or really much of anything about the Razr Fold at this time.</p>
<p>What we do know is the device will be about as big as other large foldable phones, featuring a 6.6-inch external display and an 8.1-inch internal one. Moto says the main foldable OLED panel will have a 2K resolution, which means roughly 2,000 pixels tall. Again, this is similar to existing foldables.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/motorola-reveals-the-razr-fold-a-book-style-foldable-launching-this-summer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As a Windows system built inside of a functioning <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-keyboards-mechanical-membrane-and-buckling-springs/#toc-h1">membrane keyboard</a>, the HP EliteBoard G1a announced today is a more accessible alternative to other keyboard-PCs.</p>
<p>The Commodore 64 made the keyboard-PC famous in the 1980s, but the keyboard-PC space has been dominated by the Raspberry Pi. In 2019, the single-board computer (SBC) maker released the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/raspberry-pi-400-the-under-100-desktop-pc-you-didnt-know-you-needed/'">Raspberry Pi 400</a>, which is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 SBC inside a case that also functions as a keyboard for the system. USB, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, plus a GPIO header and native Raspberry Pi OS Linux distribution add up to a low-end desktop computer experience that only costs $100. Then the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/raspberry-pi-500-updates-sub-100-desktop-pc-with-more-speed-optional-monitor/">Raspberry Pi 500</a> with a Pi 5 powered by a quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 inside, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/raspberry-pi-supercharges-its-keyboard-pc-with-16gb-ram-ssd-mechanical-switches/">Pi 500+</a>, which has NVMe SSD, instead of microSD, storage, and is built inside of a low-profile mechanical keyboard (it’s also twice as expensive at $200).</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the first time in years, Nvidia declined to introduce new GeForce graphics card models at CES. CEO Jensen Huang's characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0NBILspM4c4?si=XYiz9rxj0iK5LXI0&amp;t=6206">90-minute keynote</a> focused almost entirely on the company's dominant AI business, relegating the company's gaming-related announcements to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foltcapx62E">a separate video posted later in the evening</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia's basket of upscaling and frame generation technologies.</p>
<p>DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new "second-generation transformer model" that Nvidia says has been "trained on an expanded data set" to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia's Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it's working from a lower-resolution source image.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/nvidia-leans-on-dlss-improvements-to-make-up-for-a-lack-of-gpus-at-ces/">Read full article</a></p>

The CTIA said that "jamming blocks all communications, including lawful communications such as 911 calling," and argued that the FCC "has no authority to allow jamming."</p>
<p>CTIA members AT&amp;T and Verizon expressed their displeasure in separate comments to the FCC.

                            <![CDATA[<p>After making the obviously poor decision to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/the-end-of-an-era-dell-will-no-longer-make-xps-computers/">kill its XPS laptops and desktops</a> in January 2025, Dell started selling 16- and 14-inch XPS laptops again today.</p>
<p>“It was obvious we needed to change,” Jeff Clarke, vice chairman and COO at Dell Technologies, said at a press event in New York City previewing Dell's CES 2026 announcements.</p>
<p>A year ago, Dell abandoned XPS branding, as well as its Latitude, Inspiron, and Precision PC lineups. The company replaced the reputable brands with Dell Premium, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Each series included a base model, as well as “Plus” and “Premium.” Dell isn’t resurrecting its Latitude, Inspiron, or Precision series, and it will still sell “Dell Pro” models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/dells-xps-revival-is-a-welcome-reprieve-from-the-ai-pc-fad/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Not only does it appear that OpenAI has lost its fight to keep news organizations from digging through 20 million ChatGPT logs to find evidence of copyright infringement—but also OpenAI now faces calls for sanctions and demands to retrieve and share potentially millions of deleted chats long thought of as untouchable in the litigation.</p>
<p>On Monday, US District Judge Sidney Stein <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NYT-v-OpenAI-Order-1-5-26.pdf">denied</a> objections that OpenAI raised, claiming that Magistrate Judge Ona Wang failed to adequately balance the privacy interests of ChatGPT users who are not involved in the litigation when ordering OpenAI to produce 20 million logs.</p>
<p>Instead, OpenAI wanted Stein to agree that it would be much less burdensome to users if OpenAI ran search terms to find potentially infringing outputs in the sample. That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/news-orgs-want-openai-to-dig-up-millions-of-deleted-chatgpt-logs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the first signs of what would become an ongoing attack on scientific research came when the Trump administration ordered the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/new-nih-policy-will-slash-support-money-to-research-universities/">radically reduce</a> research funding for universities. These funds, termed indirect costs, are awarded when researchers at an institution receive a grant. They cover costs that aren't directly associated with the research project, such as utilities, facilities for research animals, and building maintenance.</p>
<p>Previously, these costs had been the subject of negotiations and audits, with indirect cost rates for universities in more expensive locations exceeding half the value of the portion of the grant that goes to the researcher. The Trump administration wanted to cut this to a flat rate of 15 percent for everyone, which would be crippling for many universities.</p>
<p>A number of states, later joined by organizations representing a broad array of universities and medical schools, immediately sued to block the policy change. A district court temporarily <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/twenty-two-states-sue-to-block-new-nih-funding-policy/">blocked the new policy</a> from being implemented and later issued a permanent injunction. The government appealed that decision, but on Monday, an appeals court <a href="https://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/sites/ca1/files/opnfiles/25-1343P-01A.pdf">rejected the effort</a> because the first Trump administration had attempted the same move before—and Congress passed a rule to block it. Indirect research funding will remain intact unless the Supreme Court intervenes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/appeals-court-upholds-block-on-one-of-trumps-cuts-to-research-funds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's been almost exactly two years since Nvidia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-is-anti-blur-monitor-tech-aimed-squarely-at-your-eyeball/">announced G-Sync Pulsar</a>, its new backlight strobing technology designed to limit display motion blur caused by old images persisting on the viewer's retina. At the time, Nvidia said that technology would debut on Asus' ROG Swift PG27 Series monitors by the end of 2024. Nvidia <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-sync-pulsar-gaming-monitors-available-january-7-2026/">now says</a> the first four G-Sync Pulsar-powered monitors will be available at select retailers starting Wednesday.</p>
<p>Those first Pulsar-equipped monitors will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acer's <a href="https://news.acer.com/acer-unleashes-the-predator-xb273u-f5-gaming-monitor-featuring-new-nvidia-g-sync-pulsar-technology">Predator XB273U F5</a></li>
<li>AOC's <a href="https://aoc.com/us/gaming/products/monitors/ag276qsg2">AGON PRO AG276QSG2</a></li>
<li>Asus' <a href="https://rog.asus.com/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-strix-pulsar-xg27aqngv/">ROG Strix Pulsar XG27AQNGV</a></li>
<li>MSI's <a href="https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-272QRF-X36">MPG 272QRF X36</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Making 360 Hz seem like more</h2>
<p>All four of the fresh Pulsar-enabled IPS monitors come in at 27 inches with 1440p resolution and up to 360 Hz refresh rates. But Nvidia says the integrated G-Sync Pulsar technology means each display has the "effective motion clarity of a theoretical 1,000 Hz monitor."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/nvidias-new-g-sync-pulsar-monitors-target-motion-blur-at-the-human-retina-level/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a statement, Ørsted—the world’s largest offshore wind developer that is 50 percent owned by the Danish state—and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables, a unit of BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners, said the US government’s order to suspend the lease on its Revolution Wind project was a violation of applicable law.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/orsted-seeks-injunction-against-us-government-over-project-freeze/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Marvel Studios continues to dribble out brief teasers promoting <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, which is slated for a December 2026 release—first playing in cinemas prior to <em><a href="https://deadline.com/tag/avatar-fire-and-ash/">Avatar: Fire and Ash</a> </em>screenings before becoming publicly available.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/steve-rogers-returns-in-avengers-doomsday-teaser/">reported previously</a> on the first, which featured Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the former Captain America. Over the holidays, a second teaser highlighting Chris Hemsworth's Thor was released. Both are familiar faces in the MCU, but we now have a third teaser that brings in some new players. No, not Robert Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom as rumored. Instead, we've got Magneto (Ian McKellen), Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and Cyclops (James Marsden) from the <em>X-Men</em> franchise.</p>
<p>The film takes place 14 months after the events of this year’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/review-thunderbolts-is-a-refreshing-return-to-peak-marvel-form/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20I'll%20simply%20say,%2Dtop%20R%2Drated%20violence."><em>Thunderbolts</em>*</a>. In addition to Thor, we have the new Captain America (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Falcon (Danny Ramirez), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Then there’s the Wakandan contingent: Shuri as the new Black Panther (Letitia Wright), M’Baku (Winston Duke), and Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/latest-avengers-doomsday-teaser-highlights-x-men/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Six years after Sony <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/01/sony-stuns-ces-with-an-electric-show-car-the-vision-s/">announced</a> its automotive ambitions, everything is looking a lot more concrete. Production of the Afeela 1, the electric sedan developed by Sony Honda Mobility, is already underway in Ohio. Deliveries will begin later this year in California, expanding to Arizona and Japan in 2027. And last night, on the eve of this year's Consumer Electronics Show, it even showed off a crossover version.</p>
<p>"The way we are fusing diverse technologies to deliver a completely novel mobility experience is not limited to a single model type," said Sony Honda Mobility CEO Yasuhide Mizuno.</p>
<p>We first saw a Sony electric vehicle at CES in 2020 when the consumer electronics company showed off the Vision-S, telling the world it was mostly just a showcase for things like sensors and infotainment. Then the world caught a hot case of electric vehicle fever. Tesla's stock price went vertical, and the auto industry focused on EV optimism, even as a pandemic rewrote everyone's working rules.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/sony-wants-its-afeela-ev-to-be-heavy-on-ai-also-shows-crossover/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you are a student of space history or tracked the space industry before billionaires and venture capital changed it forever, you probably know the name Rocketdyne.</p>
<p>A half-century ago, Rocketdyne manufactured almost all of the large liquid-fueled rocket engines in the United States. The Saturn V rocket that boosted astronauts toward the Moon relied on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne_F-1">powerful engines</a> developed by Rocketdyne, as did the Space Shuttle, the Atlas, Thor, and Delta rockets, and the US military's earliest ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>Rocketdyne's dominance began to erode after the end of the Cold War. The company started in 1955 as a division of North American Aviation, then became part of Rockwell International until Boeing acquired Rockwell's aerospace division in 1996. Rocketdyne continually designed and tested large new rocket engines from the 1950s through the 1980s. Since then, Rocketdyne has developed and qualified just one large engine design from scratch<span class="s1">—the RS-68</span><span class="s1">—and it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/after-a-fiery-finale-the-delta-rocket-family-now-belongs-to-history/">retired from service</a> in 2024.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/a-private-equity-deal-reviving-rocketdyne-seems-more-like-a-corporate-breakup/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Intel will formally launch <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/ces-2026-intel-core-ultra-series-3-debut-first-built-on-intel-18a">its first Core Ultra Series 3</a> laptop processors later this month, the company announced at its CES keynote today. Codenamed Panther Lake and targeted, at least for now, at high-end ultraportable PCs, the Core Ultra 3 chips will also be the first to use Intel's 18A manufacturing process, the company's effort to catch up with the chip manufacturing technology of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC).</p>
<p>The launch will start with 14 chips across five product families, which Intel says will be used in "over 200" PC designs. The first of these will be available on January 27, with others following "throughout the first half of this year."</p>
<ul>
<li>The Core Ultra X9 and Core Ultra X7 processors include all of Intel's latest CPU and GPU architectures, plus a fully enabled 12-core Intel Arc B390 integrated GPU and support for slightly faster LPDDR5x-9600.</li>
<li>The Core Ultra 9 and 7 processors will use all of the same technologies, but with just four GPU cores and support for either LPDDR5x-8533 or DDR5-7200 DIMMs. But they will offer 20 PCI Express lanes, up from 12 for the X9 and X7, meaning they'll pair better with dedicated GPUs.</li>
<li>The Core Ultra 5 chips are mostly lower-end models with fewer CPU cores, and either 4- or 2-core GPUs. But Intel being Intel, there is one oddball that muddies the waters: the Core Ultra 5 338H, which has 12 CPU cores and a 10-core Intel Arc B370 GPU.</li>
</ul>

<p>We wrote about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/intels-next-generation-panther-lake-laptop-chips-could-be-a-return-to-form/">the basic building blocks of Panther Lake</a> when Intel released details late last year. In many ways the chip is a retreat from the Lunar Lake design, sold as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/testing-intels-next-gen-core-ultra-200v-cpus-ok-performance-great-battery-life/">Core Ultra 200V</a>, which used chiplets manufactured mostly outside the company and on-package RAM rather than memory in a DIMM slot or soldered to the mainboard. At the time, Intel said these moves were made in the interest of saving power and extending battery life, as were decisions like removing Hyperthreading support from the P-cores.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/intel-launches-core-ultra-series-3-cpus-made-using-its-long-awaited-18a-process/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and other chip companies usually have some kind of news to announce at CES to kick off the year, but some of those announcements are more interesting than others. Sometimes you see new chips with significant speed boosts and other new technologies, and sometimes you get rebranded versions of old silicon meant to fill out a lineup or make an existing architecture seem newer and more exciting than it is.</p>
<p>AMD's Ryzen CPU announcements this year fall firmly into the latter camp—these are all gently tweaked variants of chips that launched in 2024 and 2025.</p>
<h2>"New," for certain values of "new"</h2>

<p>Let's start with the Ryzen AI 400 series. Officially the follow-up to the Ryzen AI 300 chips <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/amds-ryzen-ai-300-series-laptop-cpus-are-its-first-for-new-copilot-pcs/">announced in June 2024</a>, these processors offer some modest clock speed improvements and faster memory support. The new Ryzen AI 9 HX 470 has a peak boost clock speed of 5.2 GHz and support for LPDDR5x-8533, for example, up from 5.1 GHz and LPDDR5x-8000 for the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, and its built-in neural processing unit (NPU) is capable of 60 trillion operations per second (TOPS) rather than 50 TOPS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/amd-reheats-last-years-ryzen-ai-and-x3d-cpus-for-2026s-laptops-and-desktops/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In June, the White House released a budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 that slashed funding for NASA's science programs by nearly 50 percent. Then, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/trump-administration-moves-to-tighten-the-noose-around-nasa-science-missions/">in July</a>, the Trump administration began telling the leaders of dozens of space science missions to prepare "closeout" plans for their spacecraft.</p>
<p>Things looked pretty grim for a while, but then Congress stepped in. Congress, of course, sets the federal government's budget. In many ways, Congress abdicated authority to the Trump administration last year. But not so, it turns out, with federal spending.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer and fall, as the White House and Congress wrangled over various issues, lawmakers made it clear they intended to fund most of NASA's science portfolio. Preliminary efforts to shut down active missions <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/amid-budget-uncertainty-nasa-gets-some-good-news-use-house-funding-levels/">were put on hold</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-science-budget-wont-be-a-train-wreck-after-all/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., federal health officials on Monday announced a sweeping and unprecedented overhaul of federal vaccine recommendations, abruptly paring down recommended immunizations for children from 17 to 11.</p>
<p>Officials claimed the rationale for the change was to align US vaccine recommendations more closely with those of other high-income countries, namely Denmark, a small, far less diverse country of around 6 million people (smaller than the population of New York City) that has universal health care. The officials also claim the change is necessary to address the decline in public trust in vaccinations, which has been driven by anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy.</p>
<p>"This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health," Kennedy said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/under-anti-vaccine-rfk-jr-cdc-slashes-childhood-vaccine-schedule/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><a href="https://privacy.ca.gov/drop/about-drop-and-the-delete-act/">According to</a> the California Privacy Protection Agency, more than 500 companies actively scour all sorts of sources for scraps of information about individuals, then package and store it to sell to marketers, private investigators, and others.</p>
<p>The nonprofit Consumer Watchdog <a href="https://consumerwatchdog.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Data-Stalkers-September-Report-.pdf">said</a> in 2024 that brokers trawl automakers, tech companies, junk-food restaurants, device makers, and others for financial info, purchases, family situations, eating, exercising, travel, entertainment habits, and just about any other imaginable information belonging to millions of people.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/data-broker-hoarding-is-rampant-new-law-lets-consumers-fight-back/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The primary domain of Shadow library Anna's Archive was taken offline, with annas-archive.org being put under the serverHold status. While Anna's Archive recently made waves with a massive "backup" of Spotify, the shadow library's operator said the music pirating doesn't appear to be connected to the .org domain suspension. Anna's Archive remains available at several other domains.</p>
<p>Anna's Archive <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-opens-the-door-to-z-library-and-other-pirate-libraries-221118/">launched in 2022</a> in response to the US Department of Justice <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/feds-arrest-russians-accused-of-running-the-largest-pirated-ebook-library/">seizure of domains</a> used by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/feds-arrest-russians-accused-of-running-the-largest-pirated-ebook-library/">e-book pirate site Z-Library</a>. Acting as a shadow library and a search engine for other shadow libraries, <a href="https://annas-archive.li/datasets">Anna's Archive aims</a> to archive books and other written materials and make them widely available via torrents. Its data sets have also been <a href="https://annas-archive.li/blog/ai-copyright.html">heavily used</a> by AI companies to train large language models.</p>
<p>In addition to mirroring shadow libraries such as Sci-Hub, Library Genesis, and Z-Library, Anna's Archive made a major move into music pirating two weeks ago with an announcement that it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">scraped Spotify and made a 300TB copy</a> of the most streamed songs. Despite that development, the person behind Anna's Archive said the domain suspension doesn't seem to be related to the Spotify scraping.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-says-suspension-likely-unrelated-to-spotify-piracy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anyone can now try Alexa+, Amazon’s generative AI assistant, through a free early access program at Alexa.com. The website frees the AI, which Amazon released via early access in February, from hardware and makes it as easily accessible as more established chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/gemini-expands-on-google-tv-bringing-nano-banana-and-veo-models-to-your-tv/">Gemini</a>.</p>
<p>Until today, you needed a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/alexas-survival-hinges-on-you-buying-more-expensive-amazon-devices/">supporting device to access Alexa+</a>. Amazon hasn’t said when the early access period will end, but when it does, Alexa+ will be included with Amazon Prime memberships, which start at $15 per month, or cost $20 per month on its own.</p>
<p>The above pricing suggests that Amazon wants Alexa+ to drive people toward Prime subscriptions. By being interwoven with Amazon’s shopping ecosystem, including Amazon's e-commerce platform, grocery delivery business, and Whole Foods, Alexa+ can make more money for Amazon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/amazon-alexa-released-to-the-general-public-via-an-early-access-website/">Read full article</a></p>
