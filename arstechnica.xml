<p>Christopher Sweet was introduced to HUD employees as being originally from San Francisco and, most recently, a third-year student at the University of Chicago, where he was studying economics and data science, in an email sent to staffers earlier this month.</p>
<p>“I'd like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,’” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hud-systems-access-ai-proptech-real-estate-mobile-home/">Scott Langmack</a>, a DOGE staffer and chief operating officer of an AI real estate company, wrote in an email widely shared within the agency and reviewed by WIRED. “With family roots from Brazil, Chris speaks Portuguese fluently.

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.42 of the Rocket Report! For about a decade now, we've been following the development of the Starbase facility in South Texas. Up until 2019, progress was slow, but then the Starship program kicked into high gear, and SpaceX built up a production site beneath tents. The area has come a long way since then, and as soon as this weekend, there may be a new municipality, Starbase, in Texas.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Firefly's Alpha rocket fails again</strong>. Firefly Aerospace launched its two-stage Alpha rocket from California early Tuesday, but something went wrong about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight, rendering the vehicle unable to deploy an experimental satellite into orbit for Lockheed Martin, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/fireflys-rocket-suffers-one-of-the-strangest-launch-failures-weve-ever-seen/">Ars reports</a>. The booster stage jettisoned from Alpha's upper stage two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, and that's when things went awry. A bright cloud of white vapor appeared high in the sky, indicating an explosion—or something close to it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-starbase-the-city-is-coming-soon-alpha-remains-in-beta/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If at some point over the last 20 years you’ve found yourself in an Internet argument or had a question in your head you just couldn’t seem to get rid of, chances are good that you’ve relied on an online wiki.</p>
<p>And you probably used <i>the </i>online wiki: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. But for video games, Wikipedia provides a more general, top-down view, painting in broad strokes what a game is about, how it was made, when it was released, and how it was received by players.</p>
<p>In addition, many games and franchises have their own dedicated wikis that go a step further; these wikis are often part game guide, part lore book, and part historical record.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/video-game-wikis-are-massive-community-led-efforts-heres-how-one-was-built/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5219933">new study</a> analyzing the Danish labor market in 2023 and 2024 suggests that generative AI models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> have had almost no significant impact on overall wages or employment yet, despite rapid adoption in some workplaces. The findings, detailed in a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5219933">working paper</a> by economists from the University of Chicago and the University of Copenhagen, provide an early, large-scale empirical look at AI's transformative potential.</p>
<p>In "Large Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects," economists <a href="https://www.andershumlum.com/">Anders Humlum</a> and <a href="https://www.economics.ku.dk/staff/phd_kopi/?pure=en/persons/655200">Emilie Vestergaard</a> focused specifically on the impact of AI chatbots across 11 occupations often considered vulnerable to automation, including accountants, software developers, and customer support specialists. Their analysis covered data from 25,000 workers and 7,000 workplaces in Denmark.</p>
<p>Despite finding widespread and often employer-encouraged adoption of these tools, the study concluded that "AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation" during the period studied. The confidence intervals in their statistical analysis ruled out average effects larger than 1 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/time-saved-by-ai-offset-by-new-work-created-study-suggests/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>An entire cottage industry has formed around phishing attacks that bypass some of the most common forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) and allow even non-technical users to quickly create sites that defeat the protections against account takeovers.</p>
<p>MFA works by requiring an additional factor of authentication besides a password, like a fingerprint, face scan, or the possession of a digital key. In theory, this prevents attackers from accessing an account even after they phish a victim’s username and password. Most often, the second form of authentication comes in the form of a one-time passcode that is sent to the user by text message or email or is generated by an authentication app that the user has already set up.</p>
<h2>Adversary in the middle</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/state-of-the-art-phishing-mfa-bypass/">detailed on Thursday</a> by Cisco Talos, an entire ecosystem has cropped up to help criminals defeat these forms of MFA. They employ an attack technique known as an adversary in the middle. The tools provide phishing-as-a-service toolkits that are marketed in online crime forums using names like Tycoon 2FA, Rockstar 2FA, Evilproxy, Greatness, and Mamba 2FA.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/phishing-attacks-that-defeat-mfa-are-easier-than-ever-so-what-are-we-to-do/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The rapid proliferation of AI chatbots has made it difficult to know which models are actually improving and which are falling behind. Traditional academic benchmarks only tell you so much, which has led many to lean on vibes-based analysis from LM Arena. However, a new study claims this popular AI ranking platform is rife with unfair practices, favoring large companies that just so happen to rank near the top of the index. The site's operators, however, say the study draws the wrong conclusions.</p>
<p>LM Arena was created in 2023 as a research project at the University of California, Berkeley. The pitch is simple—users feed a prompt into two unidentified AI models in the "Chatbot Arena" and evaluate the outputs to vote on the one they like more. This data is aggregated in the LM Arena leaderboard that shows which models people like the most, which can help <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/turing-test-on-steroids-chatbot-arena-crowdsources-ratings-for-45-ai-models/">track improvements</a> in AI models.</p>
<p>Companies are paying more attention to this ranking as the AI market heats up. Google noted when it released Gemini 2.5 Pro that the model debuted at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, where it remains to this day. Meanwhile, DeepSeek's strong performance in the Chatbot Arena earlier this year helped to catapult it to the upper echelons of the LLM race.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/researchers-claim-lm-arenas-ai-leaderboard-is-biased-against-open-models/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Military-grade infrared vision goggles use detectors made of mercury cadmium telluride, a semiconducting material that’s particularly sensitive to infrared radiation. Unfortunately, you need to keep detectors that use this material extremely cool—roughly at liquid nitrogen temperatures—for them to work. “Their cooling systems are very bulky and very heavy,” says Xinyuan Zhang, an MIT researcher and the lead author of a new study that looked for alternative IR-sensitive materials.</p>
<p>Added weight was a sacrifice the manufacturers of high-end night-vision systems were mostly willing to make because cooling-free alternatives offered much worse performance. To fix this, the MIT researchers developed a new ultra-thin material that can sense infrared radiation without any cooling and outperforms cooled detectors at the same time. And they want to use it to turn thermal vision goggles into thermal vision spectacles.</p>
<h2>Staying cool</h2>
<p>Cooling-free <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article/133/8/080902/2872468/Pyroelectric-infrared-detectors-and-materials-A">infrared detectors</a> have been around since before World War II and mostly relied on pyroelectric materials like tourmaline that change their temperature upon absorbing infrared radiation. This temperature change, in turn, generates an electric current that can be measured to get a readout from the detector. Although these materials worked, they had their issues. Operating at room temperature caused a lot of random atomic motion in the pyroelectric material, which introduced electrical noise that made it difficult to detect faint infrared signals.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/new-material-may-help-us-build-predator-style-thermal-vision-specs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I'm not sure I can remember another car that took as long to get comfortable with as the 2025 Aston Martin Vantage. It's an achingly beautiful machine, from the outside at least. And by the week's end, I had my first glimpses into how it can deliver driver engagement with the best of them. By then I'd also gotten over my disappointment with the interior and, sadly yet again, had the "British cars with crap electronics" stereotype confirmed once more.</p>
<p>Painted the same striking shade of Podium Green as one of Formula 1's safety cars, the Vantage is one of the most eye-catching cars we've tested in a while. In person, that giant front grille dominates things, but all around the car you see the influence of the aerodynamicists and engineers who want to bend the airflow to their needs; cutting drag here, adding downforce there, feeding a cooling duct or venting waste heat. The way the wheel arches stretch out from the doors reminds me of the One-77 supercar from a few years ago, but it's all a thoroughly modern shape here.</p>
<p>That sculpted and vented hood contains the Vantage's 4.0 L twin-turbo V8. With 656 hp (490 kW) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm), it's the most powerful Vantage to date, eclipsing the time the company <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/retro/eaton-best-driving-200mph-aston-martin-vantage-v600">bolted some Eaton superchargers to a 2-ton Chesterfield sofa on wheels</a>. ZF's <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a23367341/automatic-transmission-best-zf-eight-speed/">excellent 8HP automatic transmission</a> sends that power and torque to the rear wheels, which arrived wearing Vantage-specific versions of Michelin's latest Pilot Sport 5 tires.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-aston-martin-vantage-great-but-frustrating/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Archaeologists recently unearthed a bone projectile point someone dropped on a cave floor between 70,000 and 80,000 years ago—which, based on its location, means that said <i>someone</i> must have been a Neanderthal.</p>
<p>The point (or in paleoarchaeologist Liubov V. Golovanova and colleagues’ super-technical archaeological terms, “a unique pointy bone artifact”) is the oldest bone tip from a hunting weapon ever found in Europe. It’s also evidence that Neanderthals figured out how to shape bone into smooth, aerodynamic projectiles on their own, without needing to copy those upstart <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Along with the bone tools, jewelry, and even rope that archaeologists have found at other Neanderthal sites, the projectile is one more clue pointing to the fact that Neanderthals were actually pretty sharp.</p>
<h2><b>Getting to the point</b></h2>
<p>Archaeologists found the bone point in Mezmaiskaya Cave, high in the Caucasus Mountains (Mezmaiskaya is also home to the remains of three Neanderthals who lived around 90,000 years ago; anthropologists sequenced samples of their DNA in earlier studies). Herbivore teeth from the same layer of sediment dated to around 70,000 years old, and the bone point’s position near the bottom of that layer probably makes it closer to 80,000 or 70,000 years old. That makes it the oldest bone projectile point ever found in Europe (so far).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/neanderthals-invented-their-own-bone-weapon-technology-by-80000-years-ago/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google has built an enormously successful business around the idea of putting ads in search results. Its most recent quarterly results showed the company made more than $50 billion from search ads, but what happens if AI becomes the dominant form of finding information? Google is preparing for that possibility by testing chatbot ads, but you won't see them in Google's Gemini AI—at least not yet.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/google-places-ads-inside-chatbot-conversations-with-ai-startups">Bloomberg</a> describes how Google began working on a plan in 2024 to adapt AdSense ads to a chatbot experience. Usually, AdSense ads appear in search results and are scattered around websites. Google ran a small test of chatbot ads late last year, partnering with select AI startups, including AI search apps iAsk and Liner.</p>
<p>The testing must have gone well because Google is now allowing more chatbot makers to sign up for AdSense. "AdSense for Search is available for websites that want to show relevant ads in their conversational AI experiences," said a Google spokesperson.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/google-is-quietly-testing-ads-in-ai-chatbots/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Vox Media has sold video game specialist website Polygon to <a href="https://www.valnetinc.com/our-brands">Internet brand aggregator Valnet</a>, the publisher of content-churning sites including Game Rant, OpenCritic, Android Police, and Comic Book Resources. The move comes alongside significant layoffs for veteran journalists at the 13-year-old outlet, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">co-founder and editor-in-chief Chris Plante</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mmcwhertor.bsky.social/post/3lo4lsc3pqk2c">Senior Writer Michael McWhertor</a>.</p>
<p>The sudden job cuts appear to have been completely unexpected for those affected. Polygon Senior Reporter Nicole Carpenter, for instance, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/576255/fortnite-ios-app-store-return-court-ruling">published a story about the <em>Epic vs. Apple</em> case</a> at 10 am Eastern time this morning before sharing news of her layoff less than two hours later on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"Along with just about everyone else at Polygon, I am now out of a job, ending over a decade at Vox Media for me," Curation Editor Pete Volk <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petevolk.bsky.social/post/3lo4mxxnyms2j">wrote on Bluesky</a>. "Working at Polygon was a wonderful experience, and I'm proud of the work we did there."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/gaming-news-site-polygon-gutted-by-massive-layoffs-amid-sale-to-valnet/">Read full article</a></p>

      Sulo Roukka is this year's overall winner of the Dance Your PhD contest, plus the winner of the chemistry category.

          </div>

</div>
<p>It's time again to honor the winners of the annual Dance Your PhD contest, where eager young scientists attempt to convey the concepts of their doctoral theses through dance. This year's <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/winner-2025-dance-your-ph-d-contest">overall winner</a> is the University of Helsinki's Sulo Roukka, who researches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemesthesis#:~:text=Some%20of%20these%20sensations%20may,beverages%20is%20a%20trigeminal%20stimulant.">chemesthesis</a>, specifically how people experience different sensory food compounds like capsaicin (hot) or menthol (cool).</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/dance-your-phds-2018-winner-mixes-superconductivity-and-swing-dancing/" data-uri="55cdadefa2fe642d4238c03d46f57a8b">we've reported previously</a>, the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/page/announcing-annual-dance-your-ph-d-contest">Dance Your PhD</a> contest was established in 2008 by science journalist John Bohannon, who is now a data scientist at South Park Commons. Bohannon <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2011/10/dance-your-ph-d-winners-of-the-annual-interpretive-dance-contest-for-scientists-videos.html" data-uri="855ac03c66405fc5ff73f16be7e49903">told Slate in 2011</a> that he came up with the idea while trying to figure out how to get a group of stressed-out PhD students, who were in the middle of defending their theses, to let off a little steam. So he put together a dance party at Austria's <a href="https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at" data-uri="b120aa687b94181760e84cc645a31682">Institute of Molecular Biotechnology</a>, including a contest for whichever candidate could best explain their thesis topics through interpretive dance.</p>
<p>The contest was such a hit that Bohannon started getting emails asking when the next one would be—and Dance Your PhD has continued ever since. It's now in its 17th year. There are four broad categories: physics, chemistry, biology, and social science, with a fairly liberal interpretation of what topics fall under each. All category winners receive $750. Roukka won the chemistry category and, as the overall champion, will receive an additional $2,750.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/meet-the-winners-of-the-2025-dance-your-phd-contest/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Tesla today denied a report that its board contacted executive search firms to find a replacement for CEO Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-musk-ceo-search-board-0ce61af9">reported</a> last night that about a month ago, "Tesla's board got serious about looking for Musk's successor" and that board "members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla's next chief executive."</p>
<p>Tesla's official X account then posted a <a href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1917812113315074055">statement</a> attributed to board chairperson Robyn Denholm saying that "there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company."</p>
<p>"This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published). The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead," Denholm's statement said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/tesla-and-elon-musk-deny-wsj-report-that-tesla-opened-search-for-new-ceo/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is increasing the recommended asking price of Xbox hardware and accessories worldwide starting today and will start charging $79.99 for some new first-party games this holiday season. <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">The announcement</a> comes after "careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development," Microsoft said.</p>
<p>In the United States, this means Microsoft's premiere Xbox Series X will now cost $599.99 for a unit with a disc drive (up from $499.99), while the Digital version will cost $549.99 (up from $449.99). On the lower end, a 1 TB Xbox Series S will now cost $429.99 (up from $349.99), while a 512GB unit will cost $379.99 (up from $299.99).</p>
<p>The new prices are already reflected on Microsoft's official online store, and Microsoft says it will "provide updated recommended pricing to local retailers." That might leave a small window where you can get Xbox hardware and accessories from those retailers at the older, lower price while supplies remain available.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>NASA's Psyche spacecraft, located nearly 150 million miles from Earth on the way to an unexplored metal asteroid, has stopped firing its engines after detecting a problem in its propulsion system.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/psyche/2025/04/29/nasas-psyche-mission-looking-into-propulsion-system/">published an update Tuesday</a> revealing that the robotic spacecraft shut off its plasma thrusters earlier this month. The news wasn't widely shared until Wednesday, when NASA science chief <a href="https://x.com/NASAScienceAA/status/1917609893927772384">Nicky Fox posted it on X</a>.</p>
<p>"Engineers with NASA’s Psyche mission are working to determine what caused a recent decrease in fuel pressure in the spacecraft’s propulsion system," the agency said. The spacecraft detected the drop in pressure April 1 inside the line that feeds xenon fuel to the spacecraft's four plasma thrusters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/engineers-probe-pressure-drop-in-psyche-spacecrafts-propulsion-system/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said in a Zoom call with press Wednesday night that the company is "going to do everything we can to bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the iOS App Store next week." That decision comes after a federal district court <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Contempt-order.pdf">found late Wednesday</a> that Apple was in "willful violation" of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/">a 2021 injunction</a> designed to allow iOS developers to steer customers to alternate payment processors for in-app purchases.</p>
<p>That 2021 injunction wound its way through years of appellate review until January 2024, when the Supreme Court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/supreme-court-denies-epic-v-apple-petitions-opening-up-ios-payment-options/">declined to hear a final attempt by Apple</a> to overturn it. Since then, the District Court for Northern California has been holding a series of evidentiary hearings examining the internal development of Apple's so-called "compliance plan" for the injunction.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Contempt-order.pdf">a scathing Wednesday night order</a>, District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers determined that Apple had engaged in a plan to "thwart the injunction's goals," and then engaged in an "obvious cover-up" to prevent that plan from being revealed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-after-court-slams-apples-obvious-cover-up/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Color E Ink in its current state requires a whole lot of compromises, as we've found when reviewing devices like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/new-color-e-ink-remarkable-tablet-tries-to-catch-up-with-and-leapfrog-kindle-scribe/">reMarkable's Paper Pro</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/">Amazon's Kindle Colorsoft</a>, including washed-out color, low refresh rates, and a grainy look that you don't get with regular black-and-white E Ink. But that isn't stopping device manufacturers from exploring the technology, and today, Onyx International has announced that it has a $1,900 color E Ink monitor that you can connect to your PC or Mac.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/mira">Boox Mira Pro</a> is a 25.3-inch monitor with a 3200×1800 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio, and it builds on the company's previous black-and-white Mira Pro monitors. The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658705/boox-mira-pro-color-e-ink-desktop-monitor">reports</a> that the screen uses E Ink Kaleido 3 technology, which can display up to 4,096 colors. Both image quality and refresh rate will vary based on which of the monitor's four presets you use (the site isn't specific about the exact refresh rate but does note that "E Ink monitors' refresh speed is not as high as conventional monitors', and increased speed will result in more ghosting").</p>
<p>The monitor's ports include one full-size HDMI port, a mini HDMI port, a USB-C port, and a DisplayPort. Its default stand is more than a little reminiscent of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/studio-display-review-an-apple-monitor-where-5k-doesnt-describe-the-price/">Apple's Studio Display</a>, but it also supports VESA mounting.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/e-ink-android-tablet-maker-onyx-boox-is-making-a-1900-color-e-ink-monitor/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A thousand years ago, the people living in Chaco Canyon were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pueblo_Bonito">building massive structures</a> of intricate masonry and trading with locations as far away as Mexico. Within a century, however, the area would be largely abandoned, with little indication that the same culture was re-established elsewhere. If the people of Chaco Canyon migrated to new homes, it's unclear where they ended up.</p>
<p>Around the same time that construction expanded in Chaco Canyon, far smaller pueblos began appearing in the northern Rio Grande Valley hundreds of kilometers away. These have remained occupied to the present day in New Mexico; although their populations shrank dramatically after European contact, their relationship to the Chaco culture has remained ambiguous. Until now, that is. People from one of these communities, Picuris Pueblo, worked with specialistsancient DNA to show that they are the closest relatives of the Chaco people yet discovered, confirming aspects of the pueblo's oral traditions.</p>
<h2>A pueblo-driven study</h2>
<p>The list of authors of the new paper describing this genetic connection includes members of the Pueblo government, including its present governor. That's because the study was initiated by the members of the Pueblo, who worked with archeologists to get in contact with DNA specialists at the Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen. In a press conference, members of the Pueblo said they'd been aware of the power of DNA studies via their use in criminal cases and ancestry services. The leaders of Picuris Pueblo felt that it could help them understand their origin and the nature of some of their oral history, which linked them to the wider Pueblo-building peoples.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/dna-links-modern-pueblo-dwellers-to-chaco-canyon-people/">Read full article</a></p>
