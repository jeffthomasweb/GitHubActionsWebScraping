<p>Starting today, electric vehicles made by General Motors gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network for the first time. GM signed a deal with Tesla <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/gms-evs-will-get-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-in-2024/">last June</a> to allow its customers access to more than 17,000 DC fast chargers around North America, following a similar deal by archrival Ford.</p>
<p>"Enabling access to even more publicly available fast chargers represents yet another way GM is focused on further improving the customer experience and making the transition to electric more seamless," said Wade Shaffer, VP of GM Energy.</p>
<p>GM's EVs, which include the bestselling Chevrolet Bolt as well as more recent Ultium-based EVs from Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC, will require an adapter to connect the Tesla J3400 (originally NACS) plug to their CCS1 charge ports.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050531#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050531&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Given the flood of photorealistic AI-generated images washing over social media networks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/musks-new-grok-upgrade-allows-x-users-to-create-largely-uncensored-ai-images/">like X</a> and <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/">Facebook</a> these days, we're seemingly entering a new age of media skepticism: the era of what I'm calling "deep doubt." While questioning the authenticity of digital content <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/magazine/photography-s-new-bag-of-tricks.html">stretches back</a> decades—and analog media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph_manipulation">long before</a> that—easy access to tools that generate convincing fake content has led to a new wave of liars using AI-generated scenes to deny real documentary evidence. Along the way, people's existing skepticism toward online content from strangers may be reaching new heights.</p>

<p>Deep doubt is skepticism of real media that stems from the existence of generative AI. This manifests as broad public skepticism toward the veracity of media artifacts, which in turn leads to a notable consequence: People can now more credibly claim that real events did not happen and suggest that documentary evidence was fabricated using AI tools.</p>
<p>The concept behind "deep doubt" isn't new, but its real-world impact is becoming increasingly apparent. Since the term "deepfake" first surfaced in 2017, we've seen a rapid evolution in AI-generated media capabilities. This has led to recent examples of deep doubt in action, such as conspiracy theorists claiming that President Joe Biden has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/08/the-conspiracy-theorists-who-think-biden-has-been-replaced-by-ai/">replaced by an AI-powered hologram</a> and former President Donald Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/08/the-many-many-signs-that-kamala-harris-rally-crowds-arent-ai-creations/">baseless accusation</a> in August that Vice President Kamala Harris used AI to fake crowd sizes at her rallies. And on Friday, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/06/now-trump-says-photo-him-with-e-jean-carroll-is-ai/">cried "AI" again</a> at a photo of him with E. Jean Carroll, a writer who successfully sued him for sexual assault, that contradicts his claim of never having met her.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042584#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042584&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A massive wave of pager explosions across Lebanon and Syria beginning at 3:30 pm local time today killed at least 11 people and injured more than 2,700, according to local officials. Many of the injured appear to be Hezbollah members, although a young girl is said to be among the dead.</p>
<p>Anonymous officials briefed on the matter are now describing it as a supply chain attack in which Israel was able to hide small amounts of explosives inside Taiwanese pagers shipped to Lebanon. The explosive was allegedly triggered by a small switch inside the pagers that would be activated upon receiving a specific code. Once that code was received, the pagers beeped for several seconds—and then detonated.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has temporarily paused the rollout of the iPadOS 18 update for M4 iPad Pros. The company <a href="https://ipsw.dev/signing/?identifier=iPad16%2C5">has stopped signing</a> the update for these iPads, meaning it will no longer be offered to users when they check, and Apple's servers won't activate the update if it's installed some other way.</p>
<p>Apple confirmed to Ars that it had "temporarily removed" the update in order to "resolve an issue that is impacting a small number of devices."</p>

<p>The update has supposedly been "bricking" devices for some M4 iPad Pro users; anecdotal reports from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadOS/comments/1figlrs/ipados_18_bricked_my_m4_ipad/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-ipados-18-for-m4-ipad-pro-after-bricking-complaints.2436726/">MacRumors forum users</a> suggest that some users have installed the update without issue, and others have ended up with unresponsive devices. Apple is apparently offering hardware replacements to users who have been affected, which points to a pretty serious bug—usually devices can be put into recovery (or DFU) mode as a last resort in the event of a botched software update.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050551#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050551&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T agreed to pay a $13 million fine because it gave customer bill information to a vendor in order to create personalized videos, then allegedly failed to ensure that the vendor destroyed the data when it was no longer needed. In addition to the fine, AT&amp;T agreed in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-892A1.pdf">consent decree</a> announced today by the Federal Communications Commission to stricter controls on sharing data with vendors.</p>
<p>In January 2023, years after the data was supposed to be destroyed, the vendor suffered a breach "when threat actors accessed the vendor's cloud environment and ultimately exfiltrated AT&amp;T customer information," the FCC said. Information related to 8.9 million AT&amp;T wireless customers was exposed.</p>
<p>Phone companies are required by law to protect customer information, and AT&amp;T should not have merely relied on third-party firms' assurances that they destroyed data when it was no longer needed, the FCC said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050523#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050523&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Earlier today, Lotus Cars revealed its idea of an "intelligent performance vehicle." The wedge-shaped concept, called Theory 1, is meant to be Lotus' new design manifesto for all its future cars and combines some eye-popping technical specs along with an adaptive driving experience that uses haptics and binaural sound to enhance driver feedback.</p>
<p>"With Theory 1, we’ve built on everything Lotus has achieved so far in its 76-year history, to push the boundaries for what it means to drive a performance vehicle. We want to demonstrate that you don’t need to compromise—with both digital and analog capabilities working harmoniously in the future car. In doing this, we are able to bring drivers the best possible immersive driving experience with raw emotion, functionality and connectivity, at the core," said Ben Payne, vice president of design at Lotus Group.</p>
<p>In profile, the Theory 1 has more than a little resemblance to the Lamborghini Huracan, although that impression starts to fade as you see the car from other angles. The doors are something entirely new. Forget butterflies, dihedrals, or even gull wings; here, they open in reverse, allowing the occupants to step right into the car. The new design also allows the doors to open even in the tightest of parking spaces.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050488#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050488&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">On Tuesday, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gen-ai-content-transparency-c2pa/">announced plans</a> to implement content authentication technology across its products to help users distinguish between human-created and AI-generated images. Over several upcoming months, the tech giant will integrate the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/adobe-launches-new-symbol-to-tag-ai-generated-content-but-will-anyone-use-it/">C2PA</a>) standard, a system designed to track the origin and editing history of digital content, into its search, ads, and potentially YouTube services. However, it's an open question of whether a technological solution can address the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347391074_Cuneiform_Fakes_A_Long_History_from_Antiquity_to_the_Present_Day">ancient social issue</a> of trust in recorded media produced by strangers.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://c2pa.org/">group</a> of tech companies created the C2PA system beginning in 2019 in an attempt to combat misleading, realistic synthetic media online. As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent and realistic, experts have worried that it may be difficult for users to determine the authenticity of images they encounter. The C2PA standard creates a digital trail for content, backed by an online signing authority, that includes metadata information about where images originate and how they've been modified.</p>
<p>Google will incorporate this C2PA standard into its search results, allowing users to see if an image was created or edited using AI tools. The tech giant's "About this image" feature in Google Search, Lens, and Circle to Search will display this information when available.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050363#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050363&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TCL has come <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/tcl-under-fire-report-suggests-its-qled-tvs-might-not-have-any-quantum-dots">under scrutiny</a> this month after <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20240905000299">testing</a> that claimed to examine three TCL TVs marketed as quantum dot TVs <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/tcl-under-fire-report-suggests-its-qled-tvs-might-not-have-any-quantum-dots">reportedly</a> showed no trace of quantum dots.</p>
<p>Quantum dots are semiconductor particles that are several nanometers large and emit different color lights when struck with light of a certain frequency. The color of the light emitted by the quantum dot depends on the wavelength, which is impacted by the quantum dot's size. Some premium TVs (and computer monitors) use quantum dots so they can display a wider range of colors.</p>
<p>Quantum dots have become a large selling point for LCD-LED, Mini LED, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/explaining-qd-oled-samsungs-display-tech-thats-wowing-ces/#:~:text=QD%2DOLED%20stands%20for%20%22quantum,started%20mass%20production%20in%20November.">QD-OLED</a> TVs, and quantum dot TVs command higher prices. A TV manufacturer pushing off standard TVs as quantum dot TVs would create a scandal significant enough to break consumer trust in China's biggest TV manufacturer and could also result in legal ramifications.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050037#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050037&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2515020/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI/">finally arrives on Windows PCs today</a>, over a year after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/final-fantasy-xvi-hands-on-preview-a-stark-break-from-series-tradition/">its launch on the PlayStation 5</a>. That means expanded access for a game that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-sales-did-not-meet-high-expectations-says-square-enix-president">sold below Square Enix's expectations on console</a>. But it also means the first opportunity for modders to add their own content to the game.</p>
<p>For game producer Naoki Yoshida, though, that new opportunity comes along with a plea for the user community to behave themselves when modifying the game. In <a>a recent interview with PC Gamer</a>, Yoshida felt the need to step in when director Hiroshi Takai was asked about what "goofy mods" he would like to see in the game.</p>
<p>"If we said, 'It'd be great if someone made xyz,' it might come across as a request, so I'll avoid mentioning any specifics here!" Yoshida told PC Gamer. "The only thing I will say is that we definitely don't want to say anything offensive or inappropriate, so please don't make or install anything like that."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050416#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050416&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Axiom Space is facing significant financial headwinds as the company attempts to deliver on two key commercial programs for NASA—the development of a private space station in low-Earth orbit and spacesuits that could one day be worn by astronauts on the Moon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2024/09/17/axiom-space-station/">Forbes reports</a> that Axiom Space, which was founded by billionaire Kam Ghaffarian and NASA executive Mike Suffredini in 2016, has been struggling to raise money to keep its doors open and has had difficulties meeting its payroll dating back to at least early 2023. In addition, the Houston-based company has fallen behind on payments to key suppliers, including Thales Alenia Space for its space station and SpaceX for crewed launches.</p>
<p>"The lack of fresh capital has exacerbated long-standing financial challenges that have grown alongside Axiom’s payroll, which earlier this year was nearly 1,000 employees," the publication reports. "Sources familiar with the company’s operations told Forbes that co-founder and CEO Michael Suffredini, who spent 30 years at NASA, ran Axiom like a big government program instead of the resource-constrained startup it really was. His mandate to staff up to 800 workers by the end of 2022 led to mass hiring so detached from product development needs that new engineers often found themselves with nothing to do."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050287#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050287&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Zynga must pay IBM nearly $45 million in damages after a jury <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IBM-v-Zynga-Redacted-Verdict-Form-9-13-2024.pdf">ruled</a> that popular games in its <em>FarmVille </em>series, as well as individual hits like <em>Harry Potter: Puzzles and Spells,</em> infringed on two early IBM patents.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/946581/000119312524219235/d893212d8k.htm">SEC filing</a>, Zynga reassured investors that "the patents at issue have expired and Zynga will not have to modify or stop operating any of the games at issue" as a result of the loss. But the substantial damages owed will likely have financial implications for Zynga parent company Take-Two Interactive Software, <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/taketwo-subsidiary-faces-449m-patent-infringement-verdict-93CH-3617854">analysts said</a>, unless Zynga is successful in its plans to overturn the verdict.</p>

<p>Meta yesterday announced a ban on Russian state media outlets RT (formerly Russia Today) and Rossiya Segodnya, taking action three days after the US government imposed sanctions on the outlets for covert influence activities.</p>
<p>"After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity," Meta said in a statement provided to Ars. Meta is the owner of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.</p>
<p>Meta already blocked RT and Rossiya Segodnya's Sputnik network across Europe in March 2022, following a ban imposed by European Union government officials. YouTube <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/youtube-blocks-russian-state-funded-media-channels-globally-2022-03-11/">blocked the channels worldwide</a>. At the time, Vladimir Putin's government was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/youtube-blocks-rt-and-sputnik-as-russia-tells-media-not-to-say-invasion/">telling Russian media outlets</a> not to call the invasion of Ukraine "an attack," "invasion," or "declaration of war."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050328#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050328&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fans of ultra-viral mobile gaming hit <em>Flappy Bird</em> who were stunned by the game's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/at-height-of-popularity-creator-pulls-flappy-bird-from-app-stores/">sudden removal from the iOS App Store</a> 10 years ago were probably even more stunned by last week's <a href="https://x.com/flappy_bird/status/1834241698781630485">equally sudden announcement that <em>Flappy Bird</em> is coming back</a> with a raft of new characters and game modes. Unfortunately, the new version of <em>Flappy Bird</em> seems to be the result of a yearslong set of legal maneuvers by a crypto-adjacent game developer intent on taking the "Flappy Bird" name from the game's original creator, Dong Nguyen.</p>
<p>"No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything," Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328">wrote on social media</a> over the weekend in his first post <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/825935290430742528">since 2017</a>. "I also don't support crypto," Nguyen added.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"<em>Flappy Bird</em> was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed," Nguyen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/creator-cites-addictiveness-discomfort-in-pulling-down-flappy-bird/">said in a 2014 interview</a> after removing the game from mobile app stores. "But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it’s best to take down <em>Flappy Bird</em>. It's gone forever."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050199#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050199&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Vincent van Gogh's most famous painting is <em>The Starry Night</em> (1889), created (along with several other masterpieces) during the artist's stay at an asylum in Arles following his breakdown in December 1888. Where some have seen the swirling vortices of the night sky depicted in <em>Starry Night</em> as a reflection of van Gogh's own inner turmoil, physicists often see a masterful depiction of atmospheric turbulence. According to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0213627">new paper</a> published in the journal Physics of Fluids, the illusion of movement in van Gogh's blue sky is also due to the scale of the paint strokes—a second kind of "hidden turbulence" at the microscale that diffuses throughout the entire canvas.</p>
<p>“It reveals a deep and intuitive understanding of natural phenomena,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1057862?">said co-author Yongxiang Huang</a> of Xiamen University in China. “Van Gogh’s precise representation of turbulence might be from studying the movement of clouds and the atmosphere or an innate sense of how to capture the dynamism of the sky.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/what-starry-night-has-in-common-with-gassy-clouds-where-stars-are-born/">previously reported</a>, in a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/natalya_st_clair_the_unexpected_math_behind_van_gogh_s_starry_night?language=en">2014 TED-Ed talk</a>, Natalya St. Clair, a <a href="https://concord.org/about/staff/natalya-st-clair/">research associate</a> at the Concord Consortium and coauthor of <em>The Art of Mental Calculation</em>, used <em>Starry Night</em> to illuminate the concept of turbulence in a flowing fluid. In particular, she talked about how van Gogh's technique allowed him (and other Impressionist painters) to represent the movement of light across water or in the twinkling of stars. We see this as a kind of shimmering effect, because the eye is more sensitive to changes in the intensity of light (a property called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance">luminance</a>) than to changes in color.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050040#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050040&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The seductive lure of cars that drive themselves has led to an awful lot of hype over the past decade. Not everyone enjoys driving, after all, and the idea of freeing up the occupant to read their emails or watch a movie as their car grinds its way to their job led to billions in investments and a whole heck of a lot of GPU sales. We're still a long way from being able to buy a car with fully autonomous driving, but every OEM <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/ai-good-passenger-infotainment-screens-bad-says-car-technology-survey/">wants to sell you</a> some level of partial automation that accelerates, brakes, and steers for you. There's just one problem—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/partial-automated-driving-systems-dont-make-driving-safer-study-finds/">study</a> after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/drivers-woefully-overestimate-hands-free-driver-tech-study-shows/">study</a> shows these systems make us less safe on the road.</p>
<p>The latest data points come from a pair of studies just published by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), <a href="https://www.iihs.org/api/datastoredocument/bibliography/2311">one studying drivers</a> using Tesla's Autopilot, <a href="https://www.iihs.org/api/datastoredocument/bibliography/2312">the other focusing</a> on Volvo's Pilot Assist. Both found that when drivers use partially automated driving systems, they pay less attention to the road and start multitasking instead.</p>
<p>The studies were conducted by IIHS together with the Center for Transportation and Logistics at MIT's AgeLab. The studies used Volvo S90 sedans and 2020 Tesla Model 3s, equipped with an array of cameras and sensors to monitor and record driver behavior.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050292#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050292&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For most people, an extinct species is an abstraction, a set of bones they might have seen on display in a museum. For Gennady Boeskorov, they are things he has interacted with directly, studying their fur, their skin, their internal organs—experiencing these animals much as they existed thousands of years ago. Some of the well-preserved Pleistocene animals he has worked with include the mummified remains of woolly mammoths (<i>Mammuthus primigenius</i>), an extinct form of rabbit (<i>Lepus tanaiticus</i>), and cave lion cubs (<i>Panthera spelaea).</i></p>
<p>His latest paper also makes it clear that woolly rhinoceroses belong on this list. Boeskorov is a senior researcher at the Diamond and Precious Metals Geology Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as a professor at the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk. This July, he and his colleagues described the relatively recent discovery of three woolly rhinoceros mummies, one of which is new to science, in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1028334X24602438">paper</a> published in the journal Doklady Earth Sciences.</p>
<p>Woolly rhinos (<i>Coelodonta antiquitatis</i>) were stocky, long-haired, two-horned denizens that inhabited Eurasia during the Pleistocene, a period that includes the most recent glacial expansion. They coexisted with woolly mammoths, placing second on the list of largest animals in this ecosystem (behind their tusked proboscidean coevals), and shared a similar dense coat of hair to protect against the cold.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050239#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050239&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon has told staff they must return to the office five days a week from the start of next year, one of the strictest corporate crackdowns on remote working that has become commonplace since the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’ve decided that we’re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID,” chief executive Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to employees globally on Monday. “We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective.</p>
<p>“Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward,” Jassy said. He added exceptions would be made for employees with a sick child, family emergencies, or coding projects that needed a more isolated environment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050274#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050274&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apart from the much-ballyhooed (and delayed) Apple Intelligence, a big change to home screen customization and app icon placement is one of iOS 18’s flagship features, alongside an overhauled Control Center.</p>
<p>With the public launch of iOS 18 this week, we’ll be delving into those flagship features one by one, and I’m starting with the home screen because I have often criticized the iPhone’s home screen experience in the past. iOS 18 promises the biggest update to home screen customization since, well, ever.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through how to use the new features, explore how they work, and try to answer the most important question: does the iPhone finally offer the kind of home screen flexibility that users have been asking for?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050070#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050070&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Space is more accessible than ever thanks to the proliferation of small satellites and more affordable launch prices, which opened the door to bespoke applications like global pollution monitoring, crop observations, and new ways of collecting weather and climate data.</p>
<p>Now you can add wildfire detection to the list. Satellites have observed wildfires from space for decades, but a new initiative partially funded by Google's philanthropic arm aims to deploy more than 50 small satellites in low-Earth orbit to pinpoint flare-ups as small as a classroom anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The FireSat constellation, managed by a nonprofit called Earth Fire Alliance (EFA), will be the first satellite fleet dedicated to detecting and tracking wildfires. Google announced a fresh investment of $13 million in the FireSat constellation Monday, building on the tech giant's previous contributions to support the development of custom infrared sensors for the FireSat satellites.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050160#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050160&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>OpenAI truly does not want you to know what its latest AI model is "thinking." Since the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">launched</a> its "Strawberry" AI model family last week, touting so-called reasoning abilities with o1-preview and o1-mini, OpenAI has been sending out warning emails and threats of bans to any user who tries to probe how the model works.</p>

<p>Unlike previous AI models from OpenAI, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>, the company trained o1 specifically to work through a step-by-step problem-solving process before generating an answer. When users ask an "o1" model a question in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, users have the option of seeing this chain-of-thought process written out in the ChatGPT interface. However, by design, OpenAI hides the raw chain of thought from users, instead presenting a filtered interpretation created by a second AI model.</p>
<p>Nothing is more enticing to enthusiasts than information obscured, so the race has been on among hackers and red-teamers to try to uncover o1's raw chain of thought using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/sob-story-about-dead-grandma-tricks-microsoft-ai-into-solving-captcha/">jailbreaking</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/twitter-pranksters-derail-gpt-3-bot-with-newly-discovered-prompt-injection-hack/">prompt injection</a> techniques that attempt to trick the model into spilling its secrets. There have been early reports of some successes, but nothing has yet been strongly confirmed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049959#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049959&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
