<p>Award-winning British TV writer Sally Wainwright is best known for the dramatic series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Valley_(TV_series)"><em>Happy Valley</em></a> (2014–2023) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jack_(TV_series)"><em>Gentleman Jack</em></a> (2019–2022), the latter produced jointly by BBC and HBO. Wainwright partnered with Disney+ for her latest series, the resolutely PG-13 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renegade_Nell"><em>Renegade Nell</em></a>, which is a different beast altogether: a good old-fashioned, swashbuckling comic adventure with a supernatural twist, featuring a sassy cross-dressing heroine forced to turn to highway robbery to survive.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>Set in 1705 during the reign of Queen Anne (Jodi May, <em>Gentleman Jack</em>), the series stars Louisa Harland (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_Girls"><em>Derry Girls</em></a>) as Nell Jackson. Nell is a headstrong young woman with tomboy flair and a taste for adventure who returns home to her village of Tottenham after running off five years before to marry one Captain Jackson against her father's wishes. She's now widowed and possessed of occasional supernatural skills whenever someone threatens her, courtesy of a fairy sprite named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Blind">Billy Blind</a> (Nick Mohammed, aka Nathan from <em>Ted Lasso</em>), who has been tasked to protect Nell. Nell's family thought she'd been killed on the battlefield alongside her husband, so her homecoming is a bit of a shock.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017126#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017126&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A 28-year-old Delaware woman, Hadja Kone, was arrested after cops linked her to an international sextortion scheme targeting thousands of victims—mostly young men and including some minors, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/delaware-woman-arrested-international-sextortion-and-money-laundering-scheme">announced</a> Friday.</p>
<p>Citing a recently unsealed indictment, the DOJ alleged that Kone and co-conspirators "operated an international, financially motivated sextortion and money laundering scheme in which the conspirators engaged in cyberstalking, interstate threats, money laundering, and wire fraud."</p>
<p>Through the scheme, conspirators allegedly sought to extort about $6 million from "thousands of potential victims," the DOJ said, and ultimately successfully extorted approximately $1.7 million.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017299#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017299&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Federal prosecutors indicted a Nebraska man on charges he perpetrated a cryptojacking scheme that defrauded two cloud providers—one based in Seattle and the other in Redmond, Washington—out of $3.5 million.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1348006/dl">indictment</a>, filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of New York and unsealed on Monday, charges Charles O. Parks III—45 of Omaha, Nebraska—with wire fraud, money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions in connection with the scheme. Parks has yet to enter a plea and is scheduled to make an initial appearance in federal court in Omaha on Tuesday. Parks was arrested last Friday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/nebraska-man-indicted-multi-million-dollar-cryptojacking-scheme">allege</a> that Parks defrauded “two well-known providers of cloud computing services” of more than $3.5 million in computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. The indictment says the activity was in furtherance of a cryptojacking scheme, a term for crimes that generate digital coin through the acquisition of computing resources and electricity of others through fraud, hacking, or other illegal means.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017285#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017285&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google has been doing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/android-15-gets-satellite-messaging-starts-foldable-cover-app-support/">a lot of work</a> in Android to support satellite-based messaging, and it sure would be nice if someone actually shipped some hardware it could use. Despite the feature launching with the iPhone 14 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/apples-satellite-emergency-service-launches-in-the-us-and-canada/">in 2022</a>, Android manufacturers haven't been super receptive to copying the idea of satellite messaging. Qualcomm and satellite company Iridium built a working solution and incorporated it into Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, only for <em>zero</em> Android manufacturers to support the feature, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/qualcomm-kills-its-copy-of-apples-satellite-sos-after-ten-months/">the dissolution</a> of the partnership. If Google wants an Android satellite SMS phone to play with, it seems like it will need to build the device itself.</p>
<p>Reliable leaker Kamila Wojciechowska over at <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-sos-satellite-connectivity-3433498/">Android Authority</a> says Google is working on doing just that. It looks like the Pixel 9 will be getting emergency satellite SOS. Since the Pixel 6, Pixel phones have been the rare devices that don't use Qualcomm modems. Google partners with Samsung and bases its Pixel Tensor chips on Samsung Exynos chips, and that means using Samsung's (usually much maligned) modems, too. Citing a source, Wojciechowska says the Pixel 9 would use the new <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/news-events/tech-blog/exynos-modem-5400-1-worlds-first-11-2gbps-5g-speeds-with-only-fr1/">Exynos Modem 5400,</a> along with its optional NTN (non-terrestrial network) capabilities, allowing the phone to be "the first to support Android’s native satellite implementation." The initial service provider would be T-Mobile (just like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/10/android-g1-review/">the good old days</a>).</p>
<p>The move would make sense. The whole original point of the Nexus/Pixel line was to give Google something to build Android on. By incorporating the latest hardware features into the next Pixel, Android gets a target to program for and test on. Otherwise, we'd have a chicken-and-egg problem where no one makes the hardware because there's no software support, and no one makes software because there's no hardware to program for. Google just does it all at once.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017214#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017214&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A judge has preliminarily <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MMFA-v-Paxton-Opinion-4-12-2024.pdf">blocked</a> what Media Matters for America (MMFA) <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/angelo-carusone/media-matters-statement-winning-injunction-against-texas-ag-ken-paxton-federal">described</a> as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's attempt to "rifle through" confidential documents to prove that MMFA fraudulently manipulated X (formerly Twitter) data to ruin X's advertising business, as Elon Musk has alleged.</p>
<p>After Musk accused MMFA of publishing reports that Musk claimed were designed to scare advertisers off X, Paxton promptly <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-opens-investigation-media-matters-potential-fraudulent-activity">launched his own investigation</a> into MMFA last November.</p>

<p>From ‘80s new wave to ‘90s grunge to the latest pop single, music has changed a lot over the decades. Those changes have come not only in terms of sound, though; lyrics have also evolved as time has passed.</p>
<p>So what has changed about the lyrics we can’t get out of our heads? After analyzing 12,000 English-language pop, rock, rap, R&amp;B, and country songs released between 1970 and 2020, researcher Eva Zangerle of Innsbruck University and her team have found that lyrics have been getting simpler and more repetitive over time. This trend is especially evident in rap and rock, but it applies to other genres as well. Another thing Zangerle’s team discovered is that lyrics tend to be more personal and emotionally charged now than they were over 50 years ago.</p>
<h2>Know the words…</h2>
<p>“Just as literature can be considered a portrayal of society, lyrics also provide a reflection of a society’s shifting norms, emotions, and values over time,” the researchers wrote in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55742-x">study</a> recently published in Scientific Reports.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017225#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017225&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Over the weekend, developer Mattia La Spina <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240413221558/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/igba-gba-gbc-retro-emulator/id6482993626">launched iGBA</a> as one of the first retro game emulators legitimately available on the iOS App Store following Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/">rules change regarding such emulators</a> earlier this month. As of Monday morning, though, iGBA has been pulled from the App Store following controversy over the unauthorized reuse of source code from a different emulator project.</p>
<p>Shortly after iGBA's launch, some people on social media <a href="https://mastodon.social/@maczydeco/112268422489536936">began noticing</a> that the project appeared to be based on the code for GBA4iOS, a nearly decade-old emulator that developer Riley Testut and a partner developed as high-schoolers (and distributed via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/10/ios-8-1-plugs-security-hole-that-made-it-easy-to-install-emulators/">a temporary security hole in the iOS App Store</a>). Testut <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/112268412745806214">took to social media Sunday morning</a> to call iGBA a "knock-off" of GBA4iOS. "I did not give anyone permission to do this, yet it’s now sitting at the top of the charts (despite being filled with ads + tracking)," he wrote.</p>
<p>GBA4iOS is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rileytestut/gba4ios/src/master/">an open source program</a> released under the GNU GPLv2 license, with licensing terms that let anyone "use, modify, and distribute my original code for this project without fear of legal consequences." But those expansive licensing terms only apply "unless you plan to submit your app to Apple’s App Store, in which case written permission from me is explicitly required."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017203#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017203&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Times are starting to get tough for Tesla. The electric vehicle automaker had been riding high, with quarter after quarter of successive growth and plenty of profits in the process. But lately, that success has mostly been due to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/tesla-drops-prices-up-to-20-percent-in-attempt-to-drive-sales/">series</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/tesla-drops-its-prices-once-again-this-year/">price cuts</a> meant to tempt customers to buy into an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/tesla-cuts-models-s-and-x-prices-for-the-second-time-in-eight-weeks/">aging lineup</a>. This March, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-deliveries-drop-8-5-percent-year-over-year-in-first-decline-since-2020/">the company reported its first quarterly decline</a> since 2020.</p>
<p>Now, it plans to lay off more than 10 percent of its workforce, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-lay-off-more-than-10-its-staff-electrek-reports-2024-04-15/">according to an internal memo seen by Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>"As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity," Tesla CEO Elon Musk told employees in the memo.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017193#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017193&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Tesla's troubled Cybertruck appears to have hit yet another speed bump. Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/canceled-delivery.14584/">dozens of waiting customers reported</a> that their impending deliveries had been canceled due to "an unexpected delay regarding the preparation of your vehicle."</p>
<p>Tesla has not announced an official stop sale or recall, and as of now, the reason for the suspended deliveries is unknown. But it's possible the electric pickup truck has a problem with its accelerator.</p>
<p>Tesla has been accused of making cars that have sudden unintended acceleration problems. In 2017, the company was the subject of a class-action lawsuit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/tesla-says-there-is-no-legal-duty-to-design-a-failsafe-car/">based on at least 23 accounts</a> of Tesla Models S and X suffering from this problem. Tesla vehemently denied any such problem, and in 2020, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration declined to investigate.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017178#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017178&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since Framework showed off its first prototypes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/framework-startup-designed-a-thin-modular-repairable-13-inch-laptop/">in February 2021</a>, we've generally been fans of the company's modular, repairable, upgradeable laptops.</p>

<p>As if we didn’t have enough reasons to get at least eight hours of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/08/can-coffee-or-a-nap-make-up-for-sleep-deprivation/">sleep</a>, there is now one more. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/a-dish-of-neurons-may-have-taught-itself-to-play-pong-badly/">Neurons</a> are still active during sleep. We may not realize it, but the brain takes advantage of this recharging period to get rid of junk that was accumulating during waking hours.</p>
<p>Sleep is something like a soft reboot. We knew that slow brainwaves had something to do with restful sleep; researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have now found out why. When we are awake, our neurons require energy to fuel complex tasks such as problem-solving and committing things to memory. The problem is that debris gets left behind after they consume these nutrients. As we sleep, neurons use these rhythmic waves to help move cerebrospinal fluid through brain tissue, carrying out metabolic waste in the process.</p>
<p>In other words, neurons need to take out the trash so it doesn’t accumulate and potentially contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. “Neurons serve as master organizers for brain clearance,” the WUSTL research team said in a study recently published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07108-6">Nature</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017030#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017030&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Like many of the researchers who study how people find their way from place to place, David Uttal is a poor navigator. “When I was 13 years old, I got lost on a Boy Scout hike, and I was lost for two and a half days,” recalls the Northwestern University cognitive scientist. And he’s still bad at finding his way around.</p>
<p>The world is full of people like Uttal—and their opposites, the folks who always seem to know exactly where they are and how to get where they want to go. Scientists sometimes measure navigational ability by asking someone to point toward an out-of-sight location—or, more challenging, to imagine they are someplace else and point in the direction of a third location—and it’s immediately obvious that some people are better at it than others.</p>
<p>“People are never perfect, but they can be as accurate as single-digit degrees off, which is incredibly accurate,” says Nora Newcombe, a cognitive psychologist at Temple University who coauthored a look at <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-devpsych-121020-031846">how navigational ability develops</a> in the 2022 Annual Review of Developmental Psychology. But others, when asked to indicate the target’s direction, seem to point at random. “They have literally no idea where it is.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017072#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017072&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For months, Change Healthcare has faced an immensely messy <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> debacle that has left hundreds of pharmacies and medical practices across the United States unable to process claims. Now, thanks to an apparent dispute within the ransomware criminal ecosystem, it may have just become far messier still.</p>
<p>In March, the ransomware group AlphV, which had claimed credit for encrypting Change Healthcare’s network and threatened to leak reams of the company’s sensitive health care data, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alphv-change-healthcare-ransomware-payment/">received a $22 million payment</a>—evidence, publicly captured on bitcoin’s blockchain, that Change Healthcare had very likely caved to its tormentors’ ransom demand, though the company has yet to confirm that it paid. But in a new definition of a worst-case ransomware, a <em>different</em> ransomware group claims to be holding Change Healthcare’s stolen data and is demanding a payment of its own.</p>

<p>Glistening in the dry expanses of the Nevada desert is an unusual kind of power plant that harnesses energy not from the sun or wind, but from the Earth itself.</p>
<p>Known as Project Red, it pumps water thousands of feet into the ground, down where rocks are hot enough to roast a turkey. Around the clock, the plant sucks the heated water back up to power generators. Since last November, this carbon-free, Earth-borne power has been flowing onto a local grid in Nevada.</p>
<p>Geothermal energy, though it’s continuously radiating from Earth’s super-hot core, has long been a relatively niche source of electricity, largely limited to volcanic regions like Iceland where hot springs bubble from the ground. But geothermal enthusiasts have dreamed of sourcing Earth power in places without such specific geological conditions—like Project Red’s Nevada site, developed by energy startup Fervo Energy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017050#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017050&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Drug shortages in the US have reached an all-time high, with 323 active and ongoing shortages already tallied this year, according to <a href="https://www.ashp.org/drug-shortages/shortage-resources/drug-shortages-statistics">data collected by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists</a> (ASHP).</p>
<p>The current drug shortage total surpasses the previous record of 320, set in 2014, and is the highest recorded since ASHP began tracking shortages in 2001.</p>
<p>"All drug classes are vulnerable to shortages," ASHP CEO Paul Abramowitz said in <a href="https://www.ashp.org/about-ashp/ceo-blogs/recent-blogs/ashp-calls-for-policy-solutions-as-drug-shortages-reach-all-time-high?loginreturnUrl=SSOCheckOnly">a statement</a> Thursday. "Some of the most worrying shortages involve generic sterile injectable medications, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/dire-shortage-of-cancer-drugs-in-us-forces-doctors-to-ration-doses/2/">cancer chemotherapy drugs</a> and emergency medications stored in hospital crash carts and procedural areas. Ongoing national shortages of therapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] also remain a serious challenge for clinicians and patients."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017093#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017093&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Western Digital plans to release the first 4TB SD card next year. On Thursday, the storage firm announced plans to demo the product in person next week.</p>
<p>Western Digital will launch the SD card, which follows the SD Association's Secure Digital Ultra Capacity (SDUC) standard, under its SanDisk brand and market it toward "complex media and entertainment workflows," such as those involving cameras and laptops that use high-resolution video with high framerates, the announcement said.</p>
<p>The spacious card will use the Ultra High Speed-1 (UHS-1) bus interface, supporting max theoretical transfer rates of up to 104 MB per second. It will support minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21349/western-digital-rollsout-4-tb-sd-card-worlds-highestcapacity">AnandTech </a>reported. Minimum sequential write speeds are expected to reach 30 MB/s, the publication said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016986#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016986&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Highly capable hackers are rooting multiple corporate networks by exploiting a maximum-severity zero-day vulnerability in a firewall product from Palo Alto Networks, researchers said Friday.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, which has been under active exploitation for at least two weeks now, allows the hackers with no authentication to execute malicious code with root privileges, the highest possible level of system access, researchers said. The extent of the compromise, along with the ease of exploitation, has earned the CVE-2024-3400 vulnerability the maximum severity rating of 10.0. The ongoing attacks are the latest in a rash of attacks aimed at firewalls, VPNs, and file-transfer appliances, which are popular targets because of their wealth of vulnerabilities and direct pipeline into the most sensitive parts of a network.</p>
<h2>“Highly capable” UTA0218 likely to be joined by others</h2>
<p>The zero-day is present in PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, and/or PAN-OS 11.1 firewalls when they are configured to use both the GlobalProtect gateway and device telemetry. Palo Alto Networks has yet to patch the vulnerability but is urging affected customers to follow the workaround and mitigation guidance provided <a href="https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-3400">here</a>. The advice includes enabling Threat ID 95187 for those with subscriptions to the company’s Threat Prevention service and ensuring vulnerability protection has been applied to their GlobalProtect interface. When that’s not possible, customers should temporarily disable telemetry until a patch is available.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017043#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017043&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Some weeks in AI news are eerily quiet, but during others, getting a grip on the week's events feels like trying to hold back the tide. This week has seen three notable large language model (LLM) releases: Google Gemini Pro 1.5 hit <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemini-15-pro-in-public-preview-with-new-features.html">general availability</a> with a free tier, OpenAI shipped a <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1777772582680301665">new version</a> of GPT-4 Turbo, and Mistral released a new openly licensed LLM, <a href="https://x.com/sophiamyang/status/1777945947764297845">Mixtral 8x22B</a>. All three of those launches happened within 24 hours starting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With the help of software engineer and independent AI researcher Simon Willison (who also <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/10/weeknotes-llm-releases/">wrote about</a> this week's hectic LLM launches on his own blog), we'll briefly cover each of the three major events in roughly chronological order, then dig into some additional AI happenings this week.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>An accomplished and prominent transplant surgeon in Texas allegedly falsified patient data in a government transplant waiting list, which may have prevented his own patients from receiving lifesaving liver transplants, according to media reports and hospital statements.</p>
<p>Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center halted its liver transplant program on April 3 after finding "irregularities" with donor acceptance criteria, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/health/article/memorial-hermann-stops-liver-transplants-19386403.php">the Houston Chronicle reported</a> based on a statement from the hospital. At the time there were 38 patients on the hospital's wait list for a liver. Earlier this week, the hospital also halted its kidney transplant program, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/health/article/houston-s-memorial-hermann-hospital-stops-kidney-19393554.php">telling the Chronicle</a> that it was pausing operations to "evaluate a new physician leadership structure."</p>
<p>Memorial Hermann has not named the surgeon behind the "inappropriate changes," but The New York Times identified him as Dr. Steve Bynon, a surgeon who has received numerous accolades and, at one point, appears to have been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/uthealth-houston_dr-steve-bynon-of-mcgovern-medical-school-activity-6222488620519997440-njsY/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">featured on a billboard.</a> Bynon oversaw both the liver and kidney transplant programs at Memorial Hermann.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017017#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017017&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Epic Games has filed a <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lgpdnbeenpo/Epic%20v%20Google%20-%20injunction%20proposal%20-%2020240411.pdf">proposed injunction</a> that would stop Google from restricting third-party app distribution outside Google Play Store on Android devices after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">proving that Google had an illegal monopoly</a> in markets for Android app distribution.</p>
<p>Epic is suggesting that competition on the Android mobile platform would be opened up if the court orders Google to allow third-party app stores to be distributed for six years in the Google Play Store and blocks Google from entering any agreements with device makers that would stop them from pre-loading third-party app stores. This would benefit both mobile developers and users, Epic argued in a wide-sweeping proposal that would greatly limit Google's control over the Android app ecosystem.</p>
<p>US District Court Judge James Donato will ultimately decide the terms of the injunction. Google has until May 3 to respond to Epic's filing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016966#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016966&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
