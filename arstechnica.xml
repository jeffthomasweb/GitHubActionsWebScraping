              <![CDATA[<p>Lobby groups for Internet service providers claim that ISPs' customer service is so good already that the government shouldn't consider any new regulations to mandate improvements. They also claim ISPs face so much competition that market forces require providers to treat their customers well or lose them to competitors.</p>
<p>Cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association told the Federal Communications Commission in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1122573117031/1">filing</a> that "providing high-quality products and services and a positive customer experience is a competitive necessity in today's robust communications marketplace. To attract and retain customers, NCTA's cable operator members continuously strive to ensure that the customer support they provide is effective and user-friendly. Given these strong marketplace imperatives, new regulations that would micromanage providers’ customer service operations are unnecessary."</p>
<p>Lobby groups filed comments in response to an FCC review of customer service that was <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-review-customer-support-offered-consumers">announced last month</a>, before the presidential election. While the FCC's current Democratic leadership is interested in regulating customer service practices, the Republicans who will soon take over opposed the inquiry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/isps-say-their-excellent-customer-service-is-why-users-dont-switch-providers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Virtual reality (VR) technology has long sought to incorporate the human senses into virtual and mixed-reality environments. In addition to sight and sound, researchers have been trying to add the sensation of human touch and smell via various user interfaces, as well as taste. But the latter has proved to be quite challenging. A team of Hong Kong scientists has now developed a handheld user interface shaped like a lollipop capable of re-creating several different flavors in a virtual environment, according to a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2412116121">new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>
<p>It's well established that human taste consists of sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami—five basic flavors induced by chemical stimulation of the tongue and, to a lesser extent, in parts of the pharynx, larynx, and epiglottis. Recreating those sensations in VR has resulted in a handful of attempts at a flavor user interface, relying on such mechanisms as chemical, thermal, and electrical stimulation, as well as iontophoresis.</p>
<p>The chemical approach usually involves applying flavoring chemicals directly onto the tongue, but this requires room for bulk storage of said chemicals, and there is a long delay time that is not ideal for VR applications. Thermal variations applied directly to the tongue can stimulate taste sensations but require a complicated system incorporating a cooling subsystem and temperature sensors, among other components.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/licking-this-lollipop-will-let-you-taste-virtual-flavors/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like a lot of children of the '80s, my early gaming nostalgia has a huge hole where the Atari 7800 might have lived. While <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/retro-colored-glasses/">practically everyone I knew had an NES</a> during my childhood—and a few uncles and friends' older siblings even had an Atari 2600 gathering dust in their dens—I was only vaguely aware of the 7800, Atari's backward compatible, late '80s attempt to maintain relevance in the quickly changing console market.</p>
<p>Absent that kind of nostalgia, the Atari 7800+ comes across as a real oddity. Fiddling with the system's extremely cumbersome controllers and pixelated, arcade-port-heavy software library from a modern perspective is like peering into a fallen alternate universe, one where Nintendo wasn't able to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/war-stories-how-nintendo-sold-the-nes-to-a-skeptical-country/">swoop in and revive a flailing Western home video game industry</a> with the NES.</p>
<p>Even for those with fond memories of Atari 7800-filled childhoods, I'm not sure that this bare-bones package justifies its $130 price. There are many more full-featured ways to get your retro gaming fix, even for those still invested in the tail end of Atari's dead-end branch of the gaming console's evolutionary tree.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-atari-7800-is-a-no-frills-glimpse-into-a-forgotten-gaming-era/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When you compare SpaceX to the world's other space enterprises, it's probably easier to list the things SpaceX hasn't done instead of reciting all of the company's achievements.</p>
<p>One of these is the launch of nuclear materials. SpaceX has launched a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/nasa-launches-mission-to-explore-the-frozen-frontier-of-jupiters-moon-europa/">handful of planetary science missions</a> for NASA, but these spacecraft have all used solar arrays to generate electricity. In this century, NASA's probes relying on nuclear power have all flown on rockets built by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>This is about to change with a $256.6 million contract NASA awarded to SpaceX on Monday. The contract covers launch services and related costs for SpaceX to launch Dragonfly, a rotorcraft designed to explore the alien environment of Saturn's largest moon, Titan.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/with-dragonfly-contract-nasa-will-certify-spacex-for-nuclear-powered-payloads/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A recent firmware pushed to QNAP network attached storage (NAS) devices left a number of owners unable to access their storage systems. The company has pulled back the firmware and issued a fixed version, but the company's response has left some users feeling less confident in the boxes into which they put all their digital stuff.</p>
<p>As seen on <a href="https://community.qnap.com/t/firmware-qts-5-2-2-2950-build-20241114-released/254">a QNAP community thread</a>, and as <a href="https://www.qnap.com/en-us/news/2024/qnap-addresses-recent-qts-5-2-2-operating-system-update-issues">announced by QNAP itself</a>, the QNAP operating system, QTS, received update 5.2.2.2950, build 20241114, at some point around November 19. After QNAP "received feedbacks from some users reporting issues with device functionality after installation," the firm says it withdrew it, "conducted a comprehensive investigation," and re-released a fixed version "within 24 hours."</p>
<p>The community thread sees many more users of different systems having problems than the shortlist ("limited models of TS-x53D series and TS-x51 series") released by QNAP. Issues reported included owners being rejected as an authorized user, devices reporting issues with booting, and claims of Python not being installed to run some apps and services.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/qnap-firmware-update-leaves-nas-owners-locked-out-of-their-boxes/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Intel awarded nearly $8B to “supercharge” US semiconductor innovation.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the Biden-Harris administration finalized a CHIPS award of up to $7.865 billion to help fund the expansion of Intel's commercial fabs in the US. By the end of the decade, these fabs are intended to decrease reliance on foreign adversaries and fill substantial gaps in America's domestic semiconductor supply chain.</p>
<p>Initially, Intel was awarded $8.5 billion, but it was decreased after Intel won a $3 billion subsidy from the Pentagon to expand Department of Defense semiconductor manufacturing. In a <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-chips-incentives-award-intel">press release</a>, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo boasted that the substantial award would set up "Intel to drive one of the most significant semiconductor manufacturing expansions in US history" and "supercharge American innovation" while making the US "more secure."</p>
<p>For Intel, the CHIPS funding supports an expected investment of nearly $90 billion by 2030 to expand projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. Approximately 10,000 manufacturing jobs and 20,000 construction jobs will be created "across all four states," the Commerce Department's press release said. Additionally, Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-chips-act.html#gs.ir2gfr">estimated </a>that the funding will create "more than 50,000 indirect jobs with suppliers and supporting industries."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/workers-demand-more-transparency-after-intel-secures-8b-chips-funding/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal agents briefly detained infamous ex-hospital CEO Ralph de la Torre early last week and seized his phone, according to an investigative report from the Boston Globe.</p>
<p>De la Torre is the ultra-wealthy former CEO of the now-bankrupt hospital chain Steward, once the largest for-profit health care company in the country. Steward and de la Torre have been accused of being "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/ceo-of-health-care-terrorists-sues-senators-after-contempt-of-congress-charges/">health care terrorists</a>" and practicing "third-world medicine" that killed and maimed patients as executives extracted millions in payouts, stripping the company of assets.</p>
<p>In September, de la Torre was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/senate-holds-rich-ceo-of-third-world-medicine-hospitals-in-contempt/">held in criminal contempt of Congress</a> for failing to abide by a congressional subpoena to attend a Senate hearing over the alleged corruption.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/things-arent-looking-good-for-infamous-ceo-of-health-care-terrorists/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has said he will impose tariffs of 25 percent on all imports from Canada and Mexico, and an extra 10 percent on Chinese goods, accusing the countries of permitting illegal migration and drug trafficking.</p>
<p>In a post on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said he would impose the tariffs on Canada and Mexico on his first day in office “on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous open borders,” which would remain in place “until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country.”</p>
<p>Trump said the tariffs on China would apply to all imports and would come on top of existing levies, as he criticized Beijing for failing to follow through on promises to impose the death penalty for people dealing fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-targets-mexico-and-canada-with-tariffs-plus-an-extra-10-for-china/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Four years later, that hasn't really happened—either from third-party accessory makers or Apple's own lineup of branded MagSafe products.</p>
<p>Instead, we have a lineup of accessories that matches pretty much what was available at launch in 2020: chargers, cases, and just a couple more unusual applications.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/are-any-of-apples-official-magsafe-accessories-worth-buying/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At this point, anyone who has been following AI research is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-can-now-generate-cd-quality-music-from-text-and-its-only-getting-better/">long familiar</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/googles-new-ai-model-creates-songs-from-text-descriptions-of-moods-sounds/">generative models</a> that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">synthesize speech</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">melodic music</a> from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/mit-license-text-becomes-viral-sad-girl-piano-ballad-generated-by-ai/">nothing but text prompting</a>. Nvidia's <a href="https://d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net/publications/FUGATTO.pdf">newly revealed "Fugatto" model</a> looks to go a step further, using new synthetic training methods and inference-level combination techniques to "transform any mix of music, voices, and sounds," including the synthesis of sounds that have never existed.</p>
<p>While Fugatto isn't available for public testing yet, <a href="https://fugatto.github.io/">a sample-filled website</a> showcases how Fugatto can be used to dial a number of distinct audio traits and descriptions up or down, resulting in everything from the sound of saxophones barking to people speaking underwater to ambulance sirens singing in a kind of choir. While the results on display can be a bit hit or miss, the vast array of capabilities on display here helps support Nvidia's description of Fugatto as "a Swiss Army knife for sound."</p>
<h2>You’re only as good as your data</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net/publications/FUGATTO.pdf">an explanatory research paper</a>, over a dozen Nvidia researchers explain the difficulty in crafting a training dataset that can "reveal meaningful relationships between audio and language." While standard language models can often infer how to handle various instructions from the text-based data itself, it can be hard to generalize descriptions and traits from audio without more explicit guidance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/nvidias-new-ai-audio-model-can-synthesize-sounds-that-have-never-existed/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court signaled it may take up a case that could determine whether Internet service providers must terminate users who are accused of copyright infringement. In an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112524zor_8m58.pdf">order</a> issued today, the court invited the Department of Justice's solicitor general to file a brief "expressing the views of the United States."</p>
<p>In <em>Sony Music Entertainment v. Cox Communications</em>, the major record labels argue that cable provider Cox should be held liable for failing to terminate users who were repeatedly flagged for infringement based on their IP addresses being connected to torrent downloads. There was a mixed ruling at the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit as the appeals court affirmed a jury's finding that Cox was guilty of willful contributory infringement but reversed a verdict on vicarious infringement "because Cox did not profit from its subscribers' acts of infringement."</p>
<p>That ruling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/court-blocks-1-billion-copyright-ruling-that-punished-isp-for-its-users-piracy/">vacated</a> a $1 billion damages award and ordered a new damages trial. Cox and Sony are both seeking a Supreme Court review. Cox wants to overturn the finding of willful contributory infringement, while Sony wants to reinstate the $1 billion verdict.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/supreme-court-may-decide-whether-isps-must-terminate-users-accused-of-piracy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI keeps deleting data that could allegedly prove the AI company violated copyright laws by training ChatGPT on authors' works. Apparently largely unintentional, the sloppy practice is seemingly dragging out early court battles that could determine whether AI training is fair use.</p>
<p>Most recently, The New York Times <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NYT-v-OpenAI-Data-Deletion-11-20-24.pdf">accused</a> OpenAI of unintentionally erasing programs and search results that the newspaper believed could be used as evidence of copyright abuse.</p>
<p>The NYT apparently spent more than 150 hours extracting training data, while following a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/openai-accused-of-trying-to-profit-off-ai-model-inspection-in-court/">model inspection protocol that OpenAI set up</a> precisely to avoid conducting potentially damning searches of its own database. This process began in October, but by mid-November, the NYT discovered that some of the data gathered had been erased due to what OpenAI called a "glitch."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/tech-problems-plague-openai-court-battles-judge-rejects-a-key-fair-use-defense/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Bird flu virus has been found in a batch of raw—unpasteurized—milk sold in California, prompting a recall issued at the state's request, <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-039.aspx">health officials announced</a> over the weekend.</p>
<p>No illnesses have yet been linked to the contaminated milk, made by <a href="https://rawfarmusa.com/press-release">Raw Farm, LLC</a> of Fresno County. The contamination was found in testing by health officials in nearby Santa Clara County, who detected the virus in milk from a retail store. The state laboratory has confirmed the finding.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o6COUza-wLU">a YouTube message from Raw Farm</a>, a company representative called the contamination "not a big deal" and emphasized that the recall is only being done out of an abundance of caution.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/raw-milk-recalled-for-containing-bird-flu-virus-california-reports/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court will hear appeals of a 5th Circuit ruling that called Universal Service fees on phone bills an illegal tax.</p>
<p>The US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/5th-circuit-court-upends-fcc-universal-service-fund-ruling-it-an-illegal-tax/">ruled in July</a> that the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund is unconstitutional and that the fees on phone bills are a "misbegotten tax." The FCC and several non-government groups challenged the ruling, and the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112224zr1_7l48.pdf">agreed to take up the case</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>The Universal Service Fund is an <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/027-5183">$8 billion-a-year</a> system that subsidizes the expansion of telecom networks with grants to Internet service providers and makes access more affordable through programs such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/poor-americans-will-get-9-a-month-to-buy-broadband-or-mobile-data/">Lifeline</a> discounts.

      Ben Schwartz voices the titular character in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>.

<p>Some lucky folks got a heads-up last week that a trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3_(film)"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a> was about to drop when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paramount-made-a-sega-genesis-cartridge-just-to-tease-a-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-next-week">Paramount Pictures released</a> a playable Sega Genesis gaming cartridge to select individuals. Hidden among a mini-game and character posters and accessible by entering a cheat code was the trailer release date. True to its word, Paramount just dropped the final trailer for the third film in the successful franchise. All our favorite characters are back, as well as a couple of new ones, most notably a new villain familiar to fans of the games: Shadow, voiced by Keanu Reeves.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first two films below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/our-fave-speedy-blue-hedgehog-proves-his-worthiness-in-sonic-2-final-trailer/">previously reported</a>, in the first film, Sonic (Ben Schwartz) teamed up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) to stop the sinister mad scientist <a title="Doctor Eggman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Eggman">Dr. Robotnik</a> (Jim Carrey). Robotnik wanted to catch and experiment on the hedgehog, and if he could also frame Tom as a domestic terrorist, even better.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/keanu-reeves-voices-arch-villain-shadow-in-sonic-3-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

The device is still "likely years away from launch," according to "people familiar with its development" that spoke to Bloomberg anonymously.</p>
<p>The report comes less than a year after the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">the PlayStation Portal</a>, a Sony portable device designed to stream PS5 games running on a console on the same local network. Recently, Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">updated the Portal firmware</a> to let PlayStation Plus subscribers also stream PS5 games from Sony's centralized servers at up to 1080p and 60 fps.</p>
<p>Sony's reported PS5 portable plans also come after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">months of rumors</a> that Microsoft has also been working on a new Xbox console with a portable form factor. In June, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer added fuel to those rumors by directly saying, "I think we should have a handheld, too... I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck... I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/sony-is-reportedly-working-on-a-ps5-portable/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Fears about stretched budgets around the world and the election of Donald Trump as US president, who has described climate change as a “hoax,” drove the developing countries into acceptance of the slightly improved package after Sunday 2:30 am local time in Baku.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Neutrinos are some of nature’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/neutrinos-are-infuriating-but-we-still-have-to-study-them/">most elusive particles</a>. One hundred trillion fly through your body every second, but each one has only a tiny chance of jostling one of your atoms, a consequence of the incredible weakness of the weak nuclear force that governs neutrino interactions. That tiny chance means that reliably detecting neutrinos takes many more atoms than are in your body. To spot neutrinos colliding with atoms in the atmosphere, experiments have buried <a href="https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/">1,000 tons</a> of heavy water, woven cameras through a <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/about-us/overview/">cubic kilometer</a> of Antarctic ice, and planned to deploy <a href="https://grand.cnrs.fr/">200,000 antennas</a>.</p>
<p>In a field full of ambitious plans, a recent proposal by <a href="https://physics.ku.edu/people/prohira-steven">Steven Prohira</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, is especially strange. Prohira suggests that instead of using antennas, we could detect the tell-tale signs of atmospheric neutrinos <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14454">by wiring up a forest of trees</a>. His suggestion may turn out to be impossible, but it could also be an important breakthrough. To find out which it is, he'll need to walk a long path, refining prototypes and demonstrating his idea’s merits.</p>
<p>Prohira’s goal is to detect so-called ultra-high-energy neutrinos. Each one of these tiny particles carries more than fifty million times the energy released by uranium during nuclear fission. Their origins are not fully understood, but they are expected to be produced by some of the most powerful events in the Universe, from collapsing stars and pulsars to the volatile environments around the massive black holes at the centers of galaxies. If we could detect these particles more reliably, we could learn more about these extreme astronomical events.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/how-physics-moves-from-wild-ideas-to-actual-experiments/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It should have been a routine mission to ferry about three tons of food, fuel, and supplies to the International Space Station, but when Russian cosmonauts opened the hatch to a cargo spacecraft on Saturday, they got a surprise—a toxic smell.</p>
<p>"After opening the Progress spacecraft's hatch, the Roscosmos cosmonauts noticed an unexpected odor and observed small droplets, prompting the crew to close the Poisk hatch to the rest of the Russian segment," <a href="https://x.com/Space_Station/status/1860798995905540336">NASA said in a statement</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p>According to the space agency, air scrubbers and contaminant sensors on board the orbiting laboratory monitored the station’s atmosphere following the observation of the aberrant smell. By Sunday, flight controllers in Mission Control in Houston determined air quality inside the space station was at normal levels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/after-russian-ship-docks-to-space-station-astronauts-report-a-foul-smell/">Read full article</a></p>
