              <![CDATA[<p>I don’t know who needs to hear this, but your connected gadgets need software updates to retain not just their security but also, frequently, key features. If you read Ars Technica regularly, you probably don’t need to hear that. You already know that smart device manufacturers have a reputation for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/smart-gardening-firms-shutdown-a-reminder-of-internet-of-things-fickle-nature/">ending support</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/800-kids-robot-due-for-bricking-sees-potential-open-source-second-life/">often-expensive devices</a>, making them insecure and/or not work as intended. But, per a survey from Consumer Reports of 2,130 consumers, many Americans are buying into the Internet of Things (IoT) without understanding the risks involved in losing vendor support: wasted money when devices are bricked and cyber and physical security threats.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports’ <a href="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/image/upload/v1736806650/prod/content/dam/surveys/Consumer_Reports_AES_December_2024.pdf">American Experiences Survey</a>, taken from December 6–16, claims the margin of error for its survey is +/- 2.59 percentage points, with 95 percent confidence. The publication said that 36 percent of respondents were four-year college graduates, 63 percent have a household income of at least $50,000, and the median age of respondents was 47 (you can find more information about Consumer Reports’ methodology <a href="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/image/upload/v1736806650/prod/content/dam/surveys/Consumer_Reports_AES_December_2024.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>Consumer Reports' subsequent report, released today, revealed a worrying potential education gap around IoT devices and the importance of ongoing software support:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/many-americans-still-dont-understand-how-easily-iot-devices-can-get-bricked/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last time we checked in on terrifying drone developments in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainians were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/ukrainian-drones-now-spray-2500-c-thermite-streams-right-into-russian-trenches/">dropping molten thermite along Russian trench lines</a> and <a href="https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/historic-strike-ukrainian-intelligence-destroys-1735632746.html">attaching surface-to-air missiles to naval drones</a>.</p>
<p>Possessing a far smaller population than Russia, Ukraine has pinned its hopes in significant part on drone warfare, and hundreds of companies and organizations across the country are building everything from tiny aerial attack drones to massive ground-crawling, machine gun-toting minelayers. (And this is to say nothing of all the innovation happening in Western defense companies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroVironment">AeroVironment</a>.)</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the drone warfare innovations that have appeared in public sources over the last few months.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/from-motherships-to-shotguns-drone-war-evolves-rapidly-in-ukraine/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">When thousands of pages started disappearing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website late last week, public health researchers quickly moved to archive deleted public health data.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, researchers discovered that the Internet Archive (IA) offers one of the most effective ways to both preserve online data and track changes on government websites. For decades, IA crawlers have collected snapshots of the public Internet, making it easier to compare current versions of websites to historic versions. And IA also allows users to upload digital materials to further expand the web archive. Both aspects of the archive immediately proved useful to researchers assessing how much data the public risked losing during a rapid purge following a pair of President Trump's executive orders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Part of a small group of researchers who managed to download the entire CDC website within days, virologist Angela Rasmussen helped create a <a href="https://acasignups.net/archiveorg">public resource</a> that combines CDC website information with <a href="https://archive.org/details/20250128-cdc-datasets">deleted CDC datasets</a>. Those datasets, many of which were previously in the public domain for years, were uploaded to IA by an anonymous user, "SheWhoExists," on January 31. Moving forward, Rasmussen told Ars that IA will likely remain a go-to tool for researchers attempting to closely monitor for any unexpected changes in access to public data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/internet-archive-played-crucial-role-in-tracking-shady-cdc-data-removals/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We've covered the Framework Laptop 13 primarily as a consumer Windows laptop, reviewing versions with multiple Intel and AMD processors. But the system's modular nature makes it possible to expand it beyond Windows PC hardware, as we've seen with experiments like the (now-discontinued) <a href="https://frame.work/products/laptop-chromebook-12-gen-intel">Chromebook Edition of the laptop</a>.</p>
<p>Today Framework is expanding to something even more experimental: a <a href="https://frame.work/products/deep-computing-risc-v-mainboard">DeepComputing RISC-V Mainboard</a> targeted primarily at developers. RISC-V is a fully open source and royalty-free instruction set, making it possible for anyone to adopt and use it without having to license it (unlike x86, which is a maze of cross-licensed Intel and AMD technologies that other companies can't really buy into; or Arm, which is licensed by the company of the same name).</p>
<p>First announced <a href="https://frame.work/blog/introducing-a-new-risc-v-mainboard-from-deepcomputing">in June 2024</a>, the board is available to order today for $199. The board is designed to fit in a Framework Laptop 13 chassis, which means that people who would prefer a desktop can also put it into <a href="https://frame.work/products/cooler-master-mainboard-case">the $39 Cooler Master Mainboard Case</a> that Framework offers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-laptop-expands-beyond-x86-with-its-first-ever-risc-v-based-motherboard/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It is not difficult to understand the unease on the European continent about the rise of SpaceX and its controversial founder, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>SpaceX has surpassed the European Space Agency and its institutional partners in almost every way when it comes to accessing space and providing secure communications. Last year, for example, SpaceX launched 134 orbital missions. Combined, Europe had three. SpaceX operates a massive constellation of more than 7,000 satellites, delivering broadband Internet around the world. Europe hopes to have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/finally-a-sign-of-life-for-europes-sovereign-satellite-internet-constellation/">a much more modest capability online</a> by 2030 serving the continent at a cost of $11 billion.</p>
<p>And Europe has good reasons for being wary about working directly with SpaceX. First, Europe wants to maintain sovereign access to space, as well as a space-based communication network. Second, buying services from SpaceX undermines European space businesses. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Musk has recently begun attacking governments in European capitals such as Berlin and London, taking up the "Make Europe Great Again" slogan. This seems to entail throwing out the moderate coalitions governing European nations and replacing them with authoritarian, hard-right leaders.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/europe-has-the-worst-imaginable-idea-to-counter-spacexs-launch-dominance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When you look at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/customers">the "customer stories" page on Anthropic's website</a>, you'll find plenty of corporations reportedly using Anthropic's Claude LLM to help employees communicate more effectively. When it comes to Anthropic's own employee recruitment process, though, the company politely asks users to "please ... not use AI assistants," so that Anthropic can evaluate their "non-AI-assisted communication skills."</p>
<p>The ironic application clause—which comes before a "Why do you want to work here?" question in <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic">most of Anthropic's current job postings</a>—was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/2/anthropic/">recently noticed by AI researcher Simon Willison</a>. But the request appears on most of Anthropic's job postings at least as far back as last May, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240521171933/https://boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4019847008">according to Internet Archive captures</a>.</p>
<p>"While we encourage people to use AI systems during their role to help them work faster and more effectively, please do not use AI assistants during the application process," Anthropic writes on its online job applications. "We want to understand your personal interest in Anthropic without mediation through an AI system, and we also want to evaluate your non-AI-assisted communication skills."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/irony-alert-anthropic-says-applicants-shouldnt-use-llms/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://worldbicyclerelief.org/s2/">Buffalo Bicycle Utility S2</a> has won an award from Eurobike and earned a <a href="https://www.german-design-award.com/en/the-winners/gallery/detail/51456-world-bicycle-relief-buffalo-bicycle-utility-s2.html">German Design Award</a>. With components designed by cycling industry giant SRAM and made from heavy steel, the bike has rim brakes, two gears, two chainrings, and two separate chains. And that makes total sense.</p>
<p>The S2 is the second bike developed by <a href="https://worldbicyclerelief.org/s2/">World Bicycle Relief</a>, which aims to bring bicycle-based mobility to the nearly 1 billion people who otherwise must walk long distances for basic needs. YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnSWDKfT7FQ">Berm Peak recently featured (and rode) an S2</a> (as <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/02/03/bicycle-adds-reliability-with-second-chain/">first seen at Hackaday</a>) and explains why a bike with two chains makes sense. Short answer: redundancy, reliable shifting, and far more simple repair.</p>

<p>Buffalo bicycles are meant to take people a long way over tough terrain, hauling whatever they need to haul. Given that the rear rack is rated for 200 pounds, that "whatever" can range from cargo to humans. The original Buffalo bike had a single gear and coaster brakes, which as both kids and minimalist bike fans can attest, make it simple to stop and go. Buffalo bikes can generally be fixed with the single included wrench, but World Bicycle Relief has also been training mechanics (over 3,300 now) and setting up some 200 Buffalo-focused bike shops.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/why-it-makes-perfect-sense-for-this-bike-to-have-two-gears-and-two-chains/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>More than ever, automakers are clamoring to be part of Formula 1. Buoyed by <em>Drive to Survive</em>, the sport's reach rivals its popularity at any time in the past, despite having to compete with myriad more demands for our time. The carmakers get cachet from their participation, and just occasionally, something they build for the racetrack trickles down into something you can buy in the showroom. Such is the case with today's car, the (deep breath) Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S E Performance four-door.</p>
<p>Although the team hasn't had the same amount of success since the introduction of ground effects in 2022, Mercedes-AMG won seven championships on the trot between 2014 and 2020. High Performance Powertrains, based in Brixworth, got the hybrid formula just right, eclipsing the power and drivability of rivals at Ferrari, Renault, and Honda and helping Lewis Hamilton secure more Grands Prix wins than anyone else in history.</p>
<p>The boffins at Brixworth <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/real-f1-to-road-car-tech-the-mercedes-amg-performance-hybrid/">got together</a> with their counterparts at Affalterbach, where the AMG gets applied to Mercedes. The result: This plug-in hybrid powertrain uses the same 2170 cylindrical cells in its battery pack as cars like the Mercedes AMG F1 W10 EQ Power+, albeit slightly more of them, as the road car has a capacity of 6.1 kWh (4.8 kWh net). The pack feeds an electric motor with a nominal 94 hp (70 kW) and 236 lb-ft (310 Nm), but it's capable of 201 hp (150 kW) for 10-second bursts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/f1-hybrid-tech-is-the-star-of-the-mercedes-amg-gt-63-s-e-performance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Gecko feet have inspired many intriguing applications, including a sticky tape, adhesives, a "<a href="http://bdml.stanford.edu/twiki/bin/view/Rise/StickyBot">stickybot</a>" climbing robot, and even a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/super-sticky-gecko-feet-inspire-strapless-bra-design-1741835334">strapless bra design</a>. Now, scientists have developed a new kind of anti-slip polymer that sticks to ice, inspired by the humble gecko. Incorporating these polymers into shoe soles could reduce the number of human slip-and-fall injuries, according to <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.4c14496">a paper</a> published in the journal ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/scientists-gain-fresh-insight-into-the-secret-of-how-gecko-feet-stay-sticky/">previously reported</a>, geckos are known for being expert climbers; they're able to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/super-sticky-gecko-feet-inspire-strapless-bra-design-1741835334" data-uri="4aea4e0d29c1227a6fd1aac42ffe3f10">stick to any surface</a> thanks to tiny hair-like structures on the bottoms of their feet. Those microscopic hairs are called setae, each of which splits off into hundreds of even smaller bristles called spatulae. It has long been known that at microscopic size scales, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force">van der Waals forces</a>—the attractive and repulsive forces between two dipole molecules—become significant.</p>
<p>Essentially, the tufts of tiny hairs on gecko feet get so close to the contours in walls and ceilings that electrons from the gecko hair molecules and electrons from the wall molecules interact with each other and create an <a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html" data-url="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html" data-component-tracked="1">electromagnetic attraction</a>. That's what enables geckos to climb smooth surfaces like glass effortlessly. Spiders, cockroaches, beetles, bats, tree frogs, and lizards all have varying-sized sticky footpads that use these same forces.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/gecko-feet-inspire-anti-slip-shoe-soles/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Flu cases had previously peaked this season at the very end of December. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2024-week-52.html">At week 52</a>—ending on December 28—the percentage of outpatient visits related to influenza-like illnesses (ILI) hit about 6.76 percent, then ticked down the first week of 2025 (week 1). The percentage of ILI visits is the standard metric for tracking flu activity, which tends to peak at around 7 percent or lower in a given season. The 2009–2010 flu season—when the novel H1N1 (aka swine flu) emerged—stands out for hitting a decades' high of 7.7 very early in the season (week 42).</p>

      Marvel's teaser for <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, coming to theaters in July.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>We haven't heard much lately about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantastic_Four:_First_Steps"><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em></a> apart from last year at San Diego Comic-Con, when attendees were treated to an exclusive preview teaser set in a 1960s retro-futuristic New York City, with the foursome blasting off into space for an unspecified mission. But Marvel Studios just dropped a one-minute teaser for the film, which will kick off the MCU's Phase Six this summer.</p>
<p>Marvel Comics' "First Family" hasn't been seen on the big screen since 2015's disastrous reboot of the moderately successful films from the 2000s. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Set against the vibrant backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> introduces Marvel’s First Family—Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ben Grimm/The Thing as they face their most daunting challenge yet. Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer (Julia Garner). And if Galactus’ plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren’t bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pedro Pascal plays Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic; Vanessa Kirby plays Sue Storm/Invisible Woman; Joseph Quinn plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch; and Ebon Moss-Bachrach plays Ben Grimm/The Thing. His Thing appearance is a combination of motion capture and CGI rather than heavy prosthetics, and director Matt Shakman consulted scientists and drew inspiration from desert rocks for the character's design. The cast also includes Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, Natasha Lyonne, and Sarah Niles in as-yet-undisclosed roles, and the character of Mole Man is expected to appear.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/marvels-first-family-faces-galactus-in-fantastic-four-first-steps-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>China has revived antitrust investigations into Google and Nvidia, while considering a new probe against Intel, as Beijing looks for leverage in talks with US President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>China’s State Administration for Market Regulation announced on Tuesday that it had opened a competition investigation into Google, which two people familiar with the matter said would focus on dominance of the US group’s Android operating system and any harm caused to Chinese phonemakers, such as Oppo and Xiaomi, which use the software.</p>
<p>Chinese regulators, who announced a similar antitrust investigation into Nvidia in December, were now also looking at launching a formal probe into Intel, said two people familiar with the situation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/china-responds-to-tariffs-with-antitrust-investigations-of-google-nvidia/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Boeing announced Monday it lost $523 million on the Starliner crew capsule program last year, putting the aerospace company $2 billion in the red on its NASA commercial crew contract since late 2019.</p>
<p>The updated numbers are included in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000012927/000001292725000015/ba-20241231.htm#fact-identifier-1552">quarterly filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods," Boeing wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>In 2014, NASA picked Boeing and SpaceX to develop and certify two commercial crew transporter vehicles. Like SpaceX, Boeing's contract, now worth up to $4.6 billion, is structured as a fixed-price deal, meaning the contractor is on the hook to pay for cost overruns that go over NASA's financial commitment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/boeing-has-now-lost-2b-on-starliner-but-still-silent-on-future-plans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal prosecutors have indicted a man on charges he stole $65 million in cryptocurrency by exploiting vulnerabilities in two decentralized finance platforms and then laundering proceeds and attempting to extort swindled investors.</p>
<p>The scheme, alleged in an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1388021/dl">indictment</a> unsealed on Monday, occurred in 2021 and 2023 against the DeFI platforms KyberSwap and Indexed Finance. Both platforms provide automated services known as “liquidity pools” that allow users to move cryptocurrencies from one to another. The pools are funded with user-contributed cryptocurrency and are managed by smart contracts enforced by platform software.</p>
<h2>“Formidable mathematical prowess”</h2>
<p>The prosecutors said Andean Medjedovic, now 22 years old, exploited vulnerabilities in the KyberSwap and Indexed Finance smart contracts by using “manipulative trading practices.” In November 2023, he allegedly used hundreds of millions of dollars in borrowed cryptocurrency to cause artificial prices in the KyberSwap liquidity pools. According to the prosecutors, he then calculated precise combinations of trades that would induce the KyberSwap smart contract system—known as the AMM, or automated market makers—to “glitch,” as he wrote later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/man-indicted-for-two-alleged-defi-hacks-that-stole-65-million/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In what is becoming a sadly regular occurrence, two popular free software projects, X.org/Freedesktop.org and Alpine Linux, need to rally some of their millions of users so that they can continue operating.</p>
<p>Both services have largely depended on free server resources provided by <a href="https://www.equinix.com/">Equinix</a> (formerly Packet.net) and its Metal division for the past few years. Equinix announced recently that it was <a href="https://deploy.equinix.com/blog/sunsetting-equinix-metal/">sunsetting its bare-metal sales and services</a>, or renting out physically distinct single computers rather than virtualized and shared hardware. As <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Alpine-Linux-Infra-Crisis">reported by the Phronix blog</a>, both free software organizations have until the end of April to find and fund new hosting, with some fairly demanding bandwidth and development needs.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/-/issues/655">issue ticket</a> on Freedesktop.org's GitLab repository provides the story and the nitty-gritty needs of that project. Both the X.org foundation (home of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-x-window-system-is-40-archaic-as-heck-and-still-relevant/">the 40-year-old window system</a>) and Freedesktop.org (a shared base of specifications and technology for free software desktops, including Wayland and <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/">many more</a>) used Equinix's donated space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/popular-linux-orgs-freedesktop-and-alpine-linux-are-scrambling-for-new-web-hosting/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like a lot of the rest of the federal government right now, NASA is reeling during the first turbulent days of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The last two weeks have brought a change in leadership in the form of interim administrator Janet Petro, whose ascension was a surprise. Her first act <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/nasa-moves-swiftly-to-end-dei-programs-ask-employees-to-report-violations/">was to tell agency employees</a> to remove diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility contracts and to "report" on anyone who did not carry out this order. Soon, civil servants began receiving emails from the US Office of Personnel Management that some perceived as an effort to push them to resign.</p>
<p>Then there are the actions of SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Last week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/why-did-elon-musk-just-say-trump-wants-to-bring-two-stranded-astronauts-home/">he sowed doubt</a> by claiming NASA had "stranded" astronauts on the space station. (The astronauts are perfectly safe and have a ride home.) Perhaps more importantly, he owns the space agency's most important contractor and, in recent weeks, has become deeply enmeshed in operating the US government through his Department of Government Efficiency. For some NASA employees, whether or not it is true, there is now an uncomfortable sense that they are working for Musk and to dole out contracts to SpaceX.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/as-nasa-flies-into-turbulence-the-agency-could-use-a-steady-hand/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A lot of human society requires what's called a "theory of mind"—the ability to infer the mental state of another person and adjust our actions based on what we expect they know and are thinking. We don't always get this right—it's easy to get confused about what someone else might be thinking—but we still rely on it for everything from navigating complicated social situations to avoiding bumping into people on the street.</p>
<p>There's some mixed evidence that other animals have a limited theory of mind, but there are alternate interpretations for most of it. So two researchers at Johns Hopkins, Luke Townrow and Christopher Krupenye, came up with a way of testing whether some of our closest living relatives, the bonobos, could infer the state of mind of a human they were cooperating with. The work clearly showed that the bonobos could tell when their human partner was ignorant.</p>
<h2>Now you see it...</h2>
<p>The experimental approach is quite simple and involves a setup familiar to street hustlers: a set of three cups, with a treat placed under one of them. Except in this case, there's no sleight-of-hand in that the chimp can watch as one experimenter places the treat under a cup, and all of the cups remain stationary throughout the experiment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/bonobos-know-when-youre-clueless/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Even the most permissive corporate AI models have sensitive topics that their creators would prefer they not discuss (e.g., weapons of mass destruction, illegal activities, or, uh, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/the-questions-the-chinese-government-doesnt-want-deepseek-ai-to-answer/">Chinese political history</a>). Over the years, enterprising AI users have resorted to everything from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/08/researchers-figure-out-how-to-make-ai-misbehave-serve-up-prohibited-content/">weird text strings</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/researchers-use-ascii-art-to-elicit-harmful-responses-from-5-major-ai-chatbots/">ASCII art</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/sob-story-about-dead-grandma-tricks-microsoft-ai-into-solving-captcha/">stories about dead grandmas</a> in order to jailbreak those models into giving the "forbidden" results.</p>
<p>Today, Claude model-maker Anthropic has <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers">released a new system of Constitutional Classifiers</a> that it says can "filter the overwhelming majority" of those kinds of jailbreaks. And now that the system has held up to over 3,000 hours of bug bounty attacks, Anthropic is inviting the wider public to <a href="https://claude.ai/constitutional-classifiers">test out the system</a> to see if it can fool it into breaking its own rules.</p>
<h2>Respect the constitution</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18837">a new paper</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers">accompanying blog post</a>, Anthropic says its new Constitutional Classifier system is spun off from the similar <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073">Constitutional AI system</a> that was used to build its Claude model. The system relies at its core on a "constitution" of natural language rules defining broad categories of permitted (e.g., listing common medications) and disallowed (e.g., acquiring restricted chemicals) content for the model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/anthropic-dares-you-to-jailbreak-its-new-ai-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Artemiy Pavlov, the founder of a small but mighty music software brand called Sinevibes, spent more than 15 years building a YouTube channel with all original content to promote his business' products. Over all those years, he never had any issues with YouTube's automated content removal system—until Monday, when YouTube, without issuing a single warning, abruptly deleted his entire channel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"What a 'nice' way to start a week!" Pavlov <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sinevibes.bsky.social/post/3lhazuyn5as2t">posted</a> on Bluesky. "Our channel on YouTube has been deleted due to 'spam and deceptive policies.' Which is the biggest WTF moment in our brand's history on social platforms. We have only posted demos of our own original products, never anything else...."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Officially, YouTube told Pavlov that his channel violated YouTube's "spam, deceptive practices, and scam policy," but Pavlov could think of no videos that might be labeled as violative.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/youtube-briefly-banned-15-year-old-channel-with-no-strikes-and-wont-say-why/">Read full article</a></p>
