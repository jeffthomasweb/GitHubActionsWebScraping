              <![CDATA[<p>Signal, as an encrypted messaging app and protocol, remains relatively secure. But Signal's growing popularity as a tool to circumvent surveillance has led agents affiliated with Russia to try to manipulate the app's users into surreptitiously linking their devices, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger/">according to Google's Threat Intelligence Group</a>.</p>
<p>While Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine is likely driving the country's desire to work around Signal's encryption, "We anticipate the tactics and methods used to target Signal will grow in prevalence in the near-term and proliferate to additional threat actors and regions outside the Ukrainian theater of war," writes Dan Black at Google's Threat Intelligence blog.</p>
<p>There was no mention of a Signal vulnerability in the report. Nearly all secure platforms can be overcome by some form of social engineering. Microsoft 365 accounts were recently revealed to be the target of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">"device code flow" OAuth phishing</a> by Russia-related threat actors. Google notes that <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059212-How-do-I-ensure-Signal-is-up-to-date">the latest versions of Signal</a> include features designed to protect against these phishing campaigns.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russia-aligned-hackers-are-targeting-signal-users-with-device-linking-qr-codes/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, the Trump administration fired several frontline responders to the ongoing H5N1 bird flu outbreak—then quickly backpedaled, rescinding those terminations and attempting to reinstate the critical staff.</p>
<p>The termination letters went out to employees at the US Department of Agriculture, one of the agencies leading the federal response to the outbreak that continues to plague US dairy farms and ravage poultry operations, affecting over 160 million birds and sending egg prices soaring. As the virus continues to spread, infectious disease experts fear it could evolve to spread among humans and cause more severe disease. So far, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html">68 cases in humans</a>, one of which was fatal.</p>
<p>Prior to Trump taking office, health experts had criticized the country's response to H5N1 for lack of transparency at times, sluggishness, inadequate testing, and its inability to halt transmission among dairy farms, which was once considered containable. To date, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">972 herds across 17 states</a> have been infected since last March, including 36 herds in the last 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/trump-admin-fires-usda-staff-working-on-bird-flu-immediately-backpedals/">Read full article</a></p>

      Scientists can now explain the prevailing unpredictability of contact electrification, unveiling order from what has long been considered chaos.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity">Static electricity</a>—specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboelectric_effect">triboelectric effect</a>, aka contact electrification—is ubiquitous in our daily lives, found in such things as a balloon rubbed against one's hair or styrofoam packing peanuts sticking to a cat's fur (as well as human skin, glass tabletops, and just about anywhere you don't want packing peanuts to be). The most basic physics is well understood, but long-standing mysteries remain, most notably how different materials exchange positive and negative charges—sometimes ordering themselves into a predictable series, but sometimes appearing completely random.</p>
<p>Now scientists at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) have identified a critical factor explaining that inherent unpredictability: It's the contact history of given materials that controls how they exchange charges in contact electrification. They described their findings in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08530-6">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature.</p>
<p>Johan Carl Wilcke published the first so-called "triboelectric series" in 1757 to describe the tendency of different materials to self-order based on how they develop a positive or negative charge. A material toward the bottom of the list, like hair, will acquire a more negative charge when it comes into contact with a material near the top of the list, like a rubber balloon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/scientists-unlock-vital-clue-to-strange-quirk-of-static-electricity/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, Google has embarked on a quest to jam generative AI into every product and initiative possible. Google has robots summarizing search results, interacting with your apps, and analyzing the data on your phone. And sometimes, the output of generative AI systems can be surprisingly good despite lacking any real knowledge. But can they do science?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Research is now angling to turn AI into a scientist—well, a "co-scientist." The company has a new multi-agent AI system based on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Gemini 2.0</a> aimed at biomedical researchers that can supposedly point the way toward new hypotheses and areas of biomedical research. However, Google's AI co-scientist boils down to a fancy chatbot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A flesh-and-blood scientist using Google's co-scientist would input their research goals, ideas, and references to past research, allowing the robot to generate possible avenues of research. The AI co-scientist contains multiple interconnected models that churn through the input data and access Internet resources to refine the output. Inside the tool, the different agents challenge each other to create a "self-improving loop," which is similar to the new raft of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">reasoning AI models</a> like Gemini Flash Thinking and OpenAI o3.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/googles-new-ai-generates-hypotheses-for-researchers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Trump yesterday issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/">executive order</a> declaring sweeping power over agencies that were created to operate independently from the White House. The order declares that "officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people's elected President," and that "it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch."</p>
<p>An accompanying <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reins-in-independent-agencies-to-restore-a-government-that-answers-to-the-american-people/">fact sheet</a> issued by the White House said the order applies to "so-called independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)." The Federal Election Commission is also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-signs-order-giving-white-house-control-over-independent-agencies-a46091e0">expected</a> to be affected by the order.</p>
<p>The White House said it will require independent agencies to submit draft regulations for review, except for the monetary policy functions of the Federal Reserve. Independent agencies are also ordered to "consult with the White House on their priorities and strategic plans." The order claims more White House control over how agencies spend their budgets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/trump-declares-sweeping-power-over-independent-agencies-such-as-fcc-and-sec/">Read full article</a></p>

Most of the people who bought an AI Pin will not get refunds for the devices, which <a href="1.%09Debut%20https:/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-a-700-voice-command-box-definitely-wont-replace-your-phone/">debuted at $700</a>, dropped to $500, and will be bricked on February 28 at noon PT.</p>
<p>At that time, AI Pins, which are lapel pins with an integrated AI voice assistant, camera, speaker, and laser projector, “will no longer connect to Humane’s servers,” and “all customer data, including personal identifiable information... will be permanently deleted from Humane’s servers,” according to Humane’s <a href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34243204841997-Ai-Pin-Consumers-FAQ">FAQ page</a>. Humane also stopped selling AI pins as of yesterday and canceled any orders that had been made but not yet fulfilled. Humane said it is discontinuing the AI Pin because it’s “moving onto new endeavors.”</p>
<p>Those new endeavors include selling off key assets, including the AI Pin’s CosmOS operating system and intellectual property, including over 300 patents and patent applications, to HP for $116 million, HP announced on Tuesday. HP expects the acquisition to close this month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/truly-a-middle-finger-humane-bricking-700-ai-pins-with-limited-refunds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-genie-model-creates-interactive-2d-worlds-from-a-single-image/">a while now</a>, many AI researchers have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-model-can-hallucinate-a-game-of-1993s-doom-in-real-time/">working</a> to integrate a so-called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">"world model"</a> into their systems. Ideally, these models could infer a simulated understanding of how in-game objects and characters should behave based on video footage alone, then create fully interactive video that instantly simulates new playable worlds based on that understanding.</p>
<p>Microsoft Research's new World and Human Action Model (WHAM), <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/">revealed today</a> in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3">a paper published in the journal Nature</a>, shows how quickly those models have advanced in a short time. But it also shows how much further we have to go before the dream of AI crafting complete, playable gameplay footage from just some basic prompts and sample video footage becomes a reality.</p>
<h2>More consistent, more persistent</h2>
<p>Much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">Google's Genie model</a> before it, WHAM starts by training on "ground truth" gameplay video and input data provided by actual players. In this case, that data comes from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1189800/Bleeding_Edge/"><em>Bleeding Edge</em></a>, a four-on-four online brawler released in 2020 by Microsoft subsidiary Ninja Theory. By collecting actual player footage since launch (as allowed under the game's user agreement), Microsoft gathered the equivalent of seven player-years' worth of gameplay video paired with real player inputs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/microsofts-new-interactive-ai-world-model-still-has-a-long-way-to-go/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Valve's updates to its classic games evoke Hemingway's two kinds of going bankrupt: gradually, then suddenly. Nothing is heard, little is seen, and then, one day, <em>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch</em>, <em>Day of Defeat</em>, and other Source-engine-based games get a bevy of modern upgrades. Now, the entirety of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> (<em>TF2</em>) client and server game code, a boon for modders and fixers, is also being released.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013">source code</a> allows for more ambitious projects than have been possible thus far, <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">Valve wrote in a blog post</a>. "Unlike the Steam Workshop or local content mods, this SDK gives mod makers the ability to change, extend, or rewrite <em>TF2</em>, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions possible." The SDK license restricts any resulting projects to "a non-commercial basis," but they can be published on Steam's store as their own entities.</p>
<p>Since it had the tools out, Valve also poked around the games based on that more open source engine and spiffed them up as well. Most games got 64-bit binary support, scalable HUD graphics, borderless window options, and the like. Many of these upgrades come from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/valve-celebrates-25-years-of-half-life-with-feature-packed-steam-update/">the big 25-year anniversary update made to <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>, which included "overbright lighting," gamepad configurations, Steam networking support, and the like.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/valve-releases-full-team-fortress-2-game-code-to-encourage-new-free-versions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft released an update on its efforts to build quantum computing hardware based on the physics of quasiparticles that have largely been the domain of theorists. The information coincides with the release of a paper in Nature that provides evidence that Microsoft's hardware can actually measure the behavior of a specific hypothesized quasiparticle.</p>
<p>Separately from that, the company announced that it has built hardware that uses these quasiparticles as the foundation for a new type of qubit, one that Microsoft is betting will allow it to overcome the advantages of companies that have been producing qubits for years.</p>
<h2>The zero mode</h2>
<p>Quasiparticles are collections of particles (and, in some cases, field lines) that can be described mathematically as if they were a single particle with properties that are distinct from their constituents. The best-known of these are probably the Cooper pairs that electrons form in superconducting materials.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/microsoft-builds-its-first-qubits-lays-out-roadmap-for-quantum-computing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As expected, Apple has released a new low-end iPhone into its lineup to replace the aging iPhone SE. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">iPhone 16e</a> is a 6.1-inch phone with an edge-to-edge OLED screen and a display notch, an Apple A18 processor inside (similar to, though not exactly the same as, the regular iPhone 16), a USB-C port and Action Button, and Apple's first in-house cellular modem, dubbed the Apple C1.</p>
<p>The iPhone 16e <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16e">starts at $599 for 128GB</a> and will be available for preorder on February 21. The phone will be available on February 28. A 256GB version and a 512GB version will run you $699 and $899, respectively.</p>
<p>At $599, the iPhone 16e's starting price is $200 less than the iPhone 16 but $170 more than the old 64GB iPhone SE and $120 more than the 128GB version of the iPhone SE. The 16e is a more direct replacement for the iPhone 14, which Apple started selling for $599 when the standard iPhone 16 was released. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have both been discontinued, which means that Apple is no longer selling any new phones that use Lightning ports instead of USB-C.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/apple-announces-iphone-16e-to-replace-iphone-se-starts-at-599-for-128gb/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1 racing turns 75 this year. The sport has been under new management for a few years and is now owned by an American entertainment company that's interested in trying new things to grow the sport—a refreshing change from the previous regime that did little but get rich at everyone else's expense. Among the new things it's not afraid to try was last night's F1 75 Live event, a star-studded extravaganza held under the dome of London's O2 Arena.</p>
<p>The idea behind F1 75 was to gather all 10 teams together to reveal each one's new look to the fans and make something of a splash about it. It's the first time the sport has attempted such a thing. In years past, teams would simply wait until the start of preseason testing to reveal that year's livery, although more recently, individual teams have started holding season launch events themselves.</p>
<p>F1 has started broadcasting some of that preseason testing on its streaming platform, but evidently, the bosses don't want to wait that long to start recapturing the attention of the fanbase, hence F1 75 Live in mid-February.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/f1-celebrates-75-years-with-10-team-launch-event-in-london/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Windows 11 made our recent roundup of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/as-internet-enshittification-marches-on-here-are-some-of-the-worst-offenders/">our least favorite "enshittified" products</a>, which will come as no surprise to those of you who have followed our coverage of it over the years. What began as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/">a more visually cohesive coat of paint</a> for Windows 10 has given way to a user experience that has gradually coasted downhill even as it has picked up new features—a "clean install" of the operating system is pretty annoying, at a baseline, even before you consider extra software irritations from your PC, motherboard maker, or Microsoft's all-encompassing push into generative AI.</p>
<p>We'll never stop asking Microsoft to put out a consumer version of Windows that acts more like the Enterprise versions it gives to businesses, with no extra unasked-for apps and less pushiness about Microsoft's other products and services. But given that most of us are saddled with the current consumer-facing versions of Windows—Home and Pro, which treat their users basically the same way despite the difference in cost and branding—we're updating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">our guide</a> to cleaning up a "clean install" to account for Windows 11 24H2 and any other changes Microsoft has made in the last year.</p>
<p>As before, this is <em>not</em> a guide about creating an extremely stripped-down, telemetry-free version of Windows; we stick to the things that Microsoft officially supports turning off and removing. There are plenty of experimental hacks that take it a few steps farther—NTDev's <a href="https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder">Tiny11 project</a> is one—but removing built-in Windows components can cause unexpected compatibility and security problems, and Tiny11 has historically had issues with basic table-stakes stuff like "installing security updates."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An asteroid discovered late last year is continuing to stir public interest as its odds of striking planet Earth less than eight years from now continue to increase.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/thanks-to-nasa-you-probably-wont-have-to-worry-about-this-asteroid-killing-you/">Ars first wrote about</a> the asteroid, designated 2024 YR4, NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies estimated a 1.9 percent chance of an impact with Earth in 2032. NASA's most recent estimate has the likelihood of a strike <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/details.html#?des=2024%20YR4">increasing to 3.2 percent</a>. Now that's not particularly high, but it's also not zero.</p>
<p>Naturally the prospect of a large ball of rock tens of meters across striking the planet is a little worrisome. This is large enough to cause localized devastation near its impact site, likely on the order of the Tunguska event of 1908, which leveled some 500 square miles (1,287 square kilometers) of forest in remote Siberia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/the-odds-of-a-city-killer-asteroid-impact-in-2032-keep-rising-should-we-be-worried/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Hyundai provided flights from Washington, DC, to Palm Springs and accommodation so Ars could drive the new Ioniq 5. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>PALM SPRINGS, Calif.—After a very pleasant morning getting acquainted with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better/">the model-year 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, it was time to meet the new addition to the range: the $55,400 Ioniq 5 XRT. It's the latest example of an automotive trend, quietly simmering in the background, suddenly taking off. And in this case, that trend is when a carmaker takes something that's normally meant to be driven on the road and makes it a bit more... rugged.</p>
<p>No, it's not a new idea—Audi Allroads and Volvo Cross Countries have played this game for years and years. More recently, companies like Porsche and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/a-frozen-lake-and-several-lamborghinis-provide-lessons-on-traction-control/">Lamborghini</a> have gotten into the act, creating supercars with six-figure price tags that aren't fazed by a little sand or snow.</p>
<p>But the Ioniq 5 isn't a supercar—it's just a super car. The XRT treatment was done by Hyundai's California design team, and it involves new, more protective cladding at the front and rear. The black plastic looks at first glance like it might be forged carbon—in fact it's a pixelated camo pattern that calls out to the "Parametric Pixel" design language that underpins the Ioniq 5's blocky look. The twin red-accented tow hooks are almost whimsical.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/our-favorite-ev-goes-mad-max-the-2025-ioniq-5-xrt/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>PALM SPRINGS, Calif.—Can it really have been four(ish) years since we first drove the Hyundai Ioniq 5? With looks like a scaled-up hatchback from the 1980s, and one of the most advanced electric vehicle powertrains on the market, the Ioniq 5 was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/">an instant hit with Ars</a> and car buyers. Since then, Hyundai has begun building Ioniq 5s at its new plant in Georgia, and for model year 2025, it has made some tweaks that have turned a great EV into an even better one.</p>
<p>The Ioniq 5 was the first EV to use Hyundai's new E-GMP platform, designed for mid-to-large EVs with rear- or all-wheel drive. The powertrain uses an 800 V architecture, which endows it with a number of advantages, some obvious, like very fast DC fast charging, some less obvious, such as less mass (and expense) given over to high-voltage cabling. On the road, it proved highly efficient, not to mention stylish and practical.</p>
<p>The tweaks for model year 2025 are subtle as far as midlife upgrades go. There's a new wheel design, and some of the details at the front and rear bumper are more pronounced. The idea was to "accentuate the CUVness" of the car, according to Brad Arnold, head of exterior design at Hyundai Design—perhaps broadening the appeal to those who have no affection for late '80s hatchback vibes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Unlike workers at many other federal agencies this week, probationary employees at NASA were not terminated on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For much of the day employees at the space agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/by-the-end-of-today-nasas-workforce-will-be-about-10-percent-smaller/">anticipated a directive</a> from the White House Office of Personnel Management to fire these employees, but it never came. "We were on pins and needles throughout the day," said one senior official at Johnson Space Center in Houston on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>However, by late in the afternoon, several field center directors received confirmation from the White House that their probationary employees—of which there are more than 1,000 across the agency's headquarters and 10 field centers—would not be terminated. NASA had sought exemptions for all of these employees, who comprise about 6 percent of NASA's workforce. Ars could not confirm whether the reprieve applied to some field centers or all 10 of them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-receives-11th-hour-reprieve-from-probationary-employee-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Most PC games that you can play on a modern PC would run faster on an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/">Nvidia RTX 5080 or 5090</a> than, say, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/nvidia-gtx-1070-ti-review/">GTX 1070</a>. But some games, from a particular phase of enthusiasm for particles, destructible environments, and smooth-moving hair, will take a notable hit if their owners upgrade to the latest Nvidia cards.</p>
<p>That's because <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk">PhysX</a>, once a dedicated physics simulation tool and card that became a selling point for Nvidia's gear, has been largely deprecated on Nvidia 50-series cards. The transition was announced in January, but it seems to have taken some time for someone to notice the impact on 32-bit, PhysX-enabled games (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/geforce-rtx-50-series-cards-physx-support">as seen by PCGamesN</a>). The most recent of these affected games, <em>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,</em> came out in 2013.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief primer on PhysX: what it was, what it did, and why it's left out of Nvidia's road map.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/batman-arkham-games-among-those-losing-physx-powers-on-newer-nvidia-gpus/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Elon Musk's AI company, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/musk-announces-new-ai-company-that-seeks-to-understand-the-universe/">xAI</a>, released Grok 3, a new AI model family set to power chatbot features on the social network X. This latest release adds image analysis and simulated reasoning capabilities to the platform's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/elon-musks-xai-releases-grok-source-and-weights-taunting-openai/">existing text-</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/musks-new-grok-upgrade-allows-x-users-to-create-largely-uncensored-ai-images/">image-generation tools</a>.</p>
<p>Grok 3's release comes after the model went through months of training in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/elon-musk-claims-he-is-training-the-worlds-most-powerful-ai-by-every-metric/">xAI's Memphis data center</a> containing a reported 200,000 GPUs. During a livestream presentation on Monday, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875357350393246114">echoed previous social media posts</a> describing Grok 3 as using 10 times more computing power than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/musks-new-grok-upgrade-allows-x-users-to-create-largely-uncensored-ai-images/">Grok 2</a>.</p>
<p>Since news of Grok 3's imminent arrival <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/elon-musk-says-grok-3-final-stages-outperforming-all-chatbots-2025-02-13/">emerged</a> last week, Musk began to hint that Grok <a href="https://x.com/GaryMarcus/status/1891151083747393585">may serve</a> as a tool to represent his worldview in AI form. On Sunday he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891112681538523215">posted</a> "Grok 3 is so based" alongside a screenshot—perhaps sharing a joke designed to troll the media—that purportedly asks Grok 3 for its opinion on the news publication called The Information. In response, Grok seems to reply:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/new-grok-3-release-tops-llm-leaderboards-despite-musk-approved-based-opinions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you know just one thing about FromSoft's recent history of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soulslikes/">so-called "Soulslike" games,</a> you probably know that they have a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/dark-souls-3-review-marching-towards-masochism/">well-earned</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/learning-how-to-die-in-dark-souls-ii/">reputation</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">absolutely brutal difficulty</a>. But these titles apparently just weren't difficult enough for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dinossindgeil">streamer dinossindgeil</a> (aka <a href="https://x.com/dinossindgeil">Nico</a>) who spent the weekend beating seven of FromSoft's most punishing titles without taking a single hit or leveling up even once.</p>
<p>Nico's conquest of what he calls "The God Run 3" <a href="https://x.com/dinossindgeil/status/1592208311344037888">dates back to 2022</a>, when he took down all three Dark Souls games as well as <em>Demon's Souls</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> live on his Twitch stream without sustaining any damage from enemies. Back then, though, Nico relied at least a little bit on grinding leveled-up characters and high-end gear to make the game's most difficult bosses a bit more manageable. Even with that advantage, though, a successful God Run 3 completion took Nico 120 days of real-time effort due to frequent restarts whenever he took a single hit.</p>
<p>This time around, Nico cranked up the difficulty even further by deciding not to level his characters even once (though he was able to increase his stats and abilities in some games with level 1-accessible items and weapons). After <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2331460758">his first level 1 God Run attempt two months ago</a>, Nico's efforts culminated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ripk0RYwEgo">roughly 11-hour</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whMssrH1uX4">multi-day marathon run</a> over the weekend, which saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgMBmsNiUJY">Nico break down in tears</a> at the end of the ordeal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-god-run-dark-souls-player-beats-seven-games-at-level-1-without-taking-a-hit/">Read full article</a></p>
