                            <![CDATA[<p>A problem with the main engine on Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL spacecraft will keep it from delivering 11,000 pounds of supplies and experiments to the International Space Station as scheduled on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, NASA said ground teams are evaluating backup plans that might still allow the Cygnus spacecraft to reach the space station, just not on schedule. The problem arose early Tuesday when the spacecraft's main engine shut down earlier than expected during two burns to boost the ship's orbit for its rendezvous with the ISS, according to NASA.</p>
<p>Officials didn't release any other details about the engine problem, but all other systems on the Cygnus XL spacecraft are performing as designed, NASA said. The agency said a new arrival date and time at the space station is "under review."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/a-record-supply-load-wont-reach-the-international-space-station-as-scheduled/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>TikTok will not shut down on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump inches nearer to closing a deal with China that will most likely see the app's majority ownership shift to US owners and US-based users shift to a new app.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump confirmed that he has extended the deadline to December 16 for TikTok owner ByteDance to divest ownership to comply with a law designed to block China from spying on US users or manipulating TikTok's algorithm to influence Americans.</p>
<p>The president claimed that the extension allows time to finalize a deal that sources <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/details-emerge-on-u-s-china-tiktok-deal-594e009f">told The Wall Street Journal</a> would shift 80 percent ownership to "an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz." Existing ByteDance investors will also join the consortium, including Susquehanna International, KKR, and General Atlantic, the WSJ reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/china-keeps-the-algorithm-critics-attack-trumps-tiktok-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Congressional lawmakers are skeptical that the Boar's Head deli meat plant at the center of a deadly <em>Listeria </em>outbreak last year will be fit to reopen after recent inspections at three other Boar's Head facilities turned up similarly alarming sanitation problems—including mold, condensation on ceilings, overflowing trash, meat residue caked onto equipment and walls, and employees failing to wash their hands.</p>
<p><a href="https://delauro.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/delauro.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/food-safety-caucus-letter-boar-s-head-plant-reopening-09.15.25.pdf">In a letter dated September 15</a>, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and nine other Congress members noted reports that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/boars-head-to-reopen-plant-as-mold-and-funky-meat-problems-pop-up-elsewhere/">Boar's Head plans to reopen the Jarratt, Virginia, facility in the coming months</a>. The plant—and particularly the liverwurst product made there—was determined to be the source of a <em>Listeria</em> outbreak that spanned May to September of last year, sickening <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24/investigation.html">at least 61 people across 19 states</a>. Of those 61 people, 60 were hospitalized and 10 died. The company recalled <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/">more than 7 million pounds of meat</a>.</p>
<p>Amid the outbreak, it came to light that inspectors with the US Department of Agriculture had found dozens of stomach-turning sanitation violations at the plant, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/blood-puddles-mold-tainted-meat-bugs-boars-head-inspections-are-horrifying/">including mold, condensation dripping on meats, insects, and puddles of blood</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/repeat-creepy-meat-problems-at-boars-head-plants-draw-congressional-scrutiny/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Although cars are much safer—for their occupants at least—than they used to be, that has come at a cost: added weight. The problem is exacerbated in electric vehicles and their heavy battery packs; rare is the EV we've driven that weighs less than 5,000 lbs (2,267 kg).</p>
<p>Hence my interest in the Altair Enlighten award, an annual prize for advances in lightweighting and sustainability given out by the AI company together with the Center for Automotive Research, which offers a look at some of the avenues automakers and suppliers are exploring to take some of the weight and carbon footprint out of tomorrow's new cars.</p>
<p>Lucid Motors has won in two separate categories. It takes the Sustainable Computing prize for speeding up new car development with a way for engineers to test iterated designs within their existing CAD environment rather than having to switch to a different tool. Lucid also won the Responsible AI prize for using AI to help predict crash testing well before the physical prototype stage—this let Lucid reduce the number of iterations it went through and the test waste and materials it used.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/an-antidote-to-fat-heavy-cars-check-out-these-lightweighting-awards/">Read full article</a></p>

<h2>New limits on how many subreddits users can moderate</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1ncn0go/evolving_moderation_on_reddit_reshaping_boundaries/">A recent post</a> on the r/modnews subreddit announced plans for new restrictions on how many subreddits users can moderate. Those who currently don’t meet those restrictions will be asked to leave their post(s) or seek an exemption(s). Reddit hasn’t finalized the requirements for exemptions but says it’s working on them with moderators.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/mods-react-as-reddit-kicks-some-of-them-out-again-this-will-break-the-site/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/building-towards-age-prediction/">announced plans</a> to develop an automated age-prediction system that will determine whether ChatGPT users are over or under 18, automatically directing younger users to a restricted version of the AI chatbot. The company also confirmed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-announces-parental-controls-for-chatgpt-after-teen-suicide-lawsuit/">parental controls</a> will launch by the end of September.</p>
<p>In a companion blog post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://openai.com/index/teen-safety-freedom-and-privacy/">acknowledged</a> the company is explicitly "prioritizing safety ahead of privacy and freedom for teens," even though it means that adults may eventually need to verify their age to use a more unrestricted version of the service.</p>
<p>"In some cases or countries we may also ask for an ID," Altman wrote. "We know this is a privacy compromise for adults but believe it is a worthy tradeoff." Altman admitted that "not everyone will agree with how we are resolving that conflict" between user privacy and teen safety.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/chatgpt-may-soon-require-id-verification-from-adults-ceo-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon agreed to offer $20-per-month broadband service to people with low incomes in California in exchange for a merger approval.</p>
<p>In a bid to complete its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/frontiers-3-million-users-to-become-verizon-users-in-latest-telco-merger/">$9.6 billion purchase</a> of Frontier Communications, Verizon committed to offering $20 fiber-to-the-home service with symmetrical speeds of 300Mbps. Verizon also committed to offering a $20 fixed wireless service with download speeds of 100Mbps and upload speeds of 20Mbps.</p>
<p>Verizon would be required to offer the plans for at least 10 years, according to a <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M578/K765/578765845.PDF">joint motion</a> to approve the settlement agreement. After three years, Verizon would need to "make commercially reasonable efforts" to increase the speeds "while retaining the $20 price point." The joint motion filed by Verizon and the California Public Advocates Office seeks approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/verizon-to-offer-20-broadband-in-california-to-obtain-merger-approval/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has so many products that it can be near-impossible to keep track. And yet, the company has rarely created desktop apps to go with those services. There are a handful, like Drive and Quick Share, but the company's flagship product is only now coming to the desktop. The new Google app for Windows is available now, allowing you to search the web, Google Drive, and even your local files.</p>
<p>The company stresses that <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-app-windows-labs/">the new app is experimental</a>—it's limited to personal Google accounts, and you may encounter some bugs. The core functionality appears to be solid because it's not trying to do too much. After installation, you can press Alt+Space (or a shortcut of your choice) at any time to bring up a floating Google search bar. Just type your query, and the results page appears in a small window directly below the bar. It can also pull in select Knowledge Graph content, so you may not even have to type the whole query to get the information you need.</p>
<p>Microsoft's built-in Windows search functionality is notoriously crummy, and even in this experimental form, Google's Chrome OS-style search experience is better. It's fast, pulling up local files, Drive documents, and installed apps in a single interface. Both local files and Drive are optional, so you can use them only for search if you prefer. The app also includes Google Lens, which allows you to select anything on your PC's screen for image search or translation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/experimental-google-app-brings-web-and-local-search-to-your-windows-pc/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As Jonathan Roll neared completion of a master's degree in science and technology policy at Arizona State University three years ago, he did some research into recent developments by China's ascendant space program. He came away impressed by the country's growing ambitions.</p>
<p>Now a full-time research analyst at the university, Roll was recently asked to take a deeper dive into Chinese space plans.</p>
<p>"I thought I had a pretty good read on this when I was finishing grad school," Roll told Ars. "That almost everything needed to be updated, or had changed three years later, was pretty scary. On all these fronts, they've made pretty significant progress. They are taking all of the cues from our Western system about what's really galvanized innovation, and they are off to the races with it."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/a-new-report-finds-chinas-space-program-will-soon-equal-that-of-the-us/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I recently learned of a rather interesting pilot study undertaken by Nissan together with the Contra Costa Transportation Authority and UC Berkeley that leverages the automaker's partially automated driving system, ProPilot Assist, to ease traffic congestion. The idea is called "Cooperative Congestion Management," which works by letting a car in traffic inform vehicles behind it.</p>
<p>Researchers from Nissan's advanced technology center in Silicon Valley have trialed CCM on I-680 in the Bay Area, logging about 600 miles. Starting with Nissan vehicles equipped with ProPilot Assist, which combines adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, they added the ability for those cars to communicate with each other, informing other cars about their speed and any hazards. On the road, they were able to show that the system reduced hard-braking events by 85 percent and cut time spent stationary in traffic by 70 percent.</p>
<p>But we're not talking about platooning—the idea of having road trains of autonomously driven semitrucks networked together and driving in convoy was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/platooning/#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=platooning&amp;gsc.sort=">all the rage a decade ago</a>, but mostly fell from favor once people realized the human truck drivers were needed for more than just the steering, accelerating, and braking bits of the job.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/how-nissan-leveraged-its-driver-assist-to-cut-traffic-jams/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Jaguar Land Rover’s dealers and suppliers fear the British carmaker’s operations will take another few months to normalize after a cyber attack that experts estimate could wipe more than £3.5 billion off its revenue.</p>
<p>JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, had been forced to shut down its systems and halt production across its UK factories since August 31, wreaking havoc across the country’s vast supply chain involving roughly 200,000 workers.</p>
<p>JLR on Tuesday said it would extend its production halt until at least next Wednesday as it continued its investigation. In a statement, the company also cautioned that “the controlled restart of our global operations… will take time.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/when-will-jaguar-land-rover-restart-production-no-one-actually-knows/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/us/chatbot-god.html">reported</a> that tens of millions of people are confessing secrets to AI chatbots trained on religious texts, with apps like <a href="https://thebiblechat.com/">Bible Chat</a> reaching over 30 million downloads and Catholic app <a href="https://hallow.com/">Hallow</a> briefly topping Netflix, Instagram, and TikTok in Apple's App Store. In China, people are using DeepSeek to try to decode their fortunes. In her report, Lauren Jackson examined "faith tech" apps that cost users up to $70 annually, with some platforms claiming to channel divine communication directly.</p>
<p>Some of the apps address what creators describe as an accessibility problem. "You don't want to disturb your pastor at three in the morning," Krista Rogers, a 61-year-old Ohio resident, told the Times about using the <a href="https://www.youversion.com/the-bible-app/">YouVersion Bible app</a> and ChatGPT for spiritual questions.</p>
<p>The report also examines platforms that go beyond simple scriptural guidance. While a service like <a href="https://www.chatwithgod.ai/">ChatwithGod</a> operates as a "spiritual advisor," its conversational nature is convincing enough that users often question whether they are speaking directly with a divine being. As its chief executive told the Times, the most frequent question from users is, "Is this actually God I am talking to?"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/millions-turn-to-ai-chatbots-for-spiritual-guidance-and-confession/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The first flight of Northrop's upgraded Cygnus spacecraft, called Cygnus XL, is on its way to the international research lab after launching Sunday evening from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. This mission, known as NG-23, is set to arrive at the ISS early Wednesday with 10,827 pounds (4,911 kilograms) of cargo to sustain the lab and its seven-person crew.</p>
<p>By a sizable margin, this is the heaviest cargo load transported to the ISS by a commercial resupply mission. NASA astronaut Jonny Kim will use the space station's Canadian-built robotic arm to capture the cargo ship on Wednesday, then place it on an attachment port for crew members to open hatches and start unpacking the goodies inside.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/northrop-grummans-new-spacecraft-is-a-real-chonker/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In June, Kennedy purged all 17 highly qualified and thoroughly vetted members of the committee, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on setting vaccine policy. Kennedy quickly repopulated ACIP with seven hand-picked allies, most of whom also have questionable qualifications and have expressed anti-vaccine or contrarian public health views.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The companies seeking to build larger AI models have been increasingly stymied by a lack of high-quality training data. As tech firms scour the web for more data to feed their models, they could increasingly rely on potentially sensitive user data. A team at Google Research is exploring new techniques to make the resulting large language models (LLMs) less likely to "memorize" any of that content.</p>
<p>LLMs have non-deterministic outputs, meaning you can't exactly predict what they'll say. While the output varies even for identical inputs, models do sometimes regurgitate something from their training data—if trained with personal data, the output could be a violation of user privacy. In the event copyrighted data makes it into training data (either accidentally or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-rejects-metas-claim-that-torrenting-is-irrelevant-in-ai-copyright-case/">on purpose</a>), its appearance in outputs can cause a different kind of headache for devs. Differential privacy can prevent such memorization by introducing calibrated noise during the training phase.</p>
<p>Adding differential privacy to a model comes with drawbacks in terms of accuracy and compute requirements. No one has bothered to figure out the degree to which that alters the scaling laws of AI models until now. The team worked from the assumption that model performance would be primarily affected by the noise-batch ratio, which compares the volume of randomized noise to the size of the original training data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/google-releases-vaultgemma-its-first-privacy-preserving-llm/">Read full article</a></p>

More details may come in the next 45 days, when parties must submit filings to officially dismiss the lawsuit, but it's unlikely the settlement amount will be publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>Days before the settlement was announced, record labels had indicated that everyone but the Internet Archive and its founder, Brewster Kahle, had agreed to sign a joint settlement, seemingly including the Great 78 Project's recording engineer George Blood, who was also a target of the litigation. But in the days since, IA has gotten on board, posting a <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/09/15/an-update-on-the-great-78s-lawsuit/">blog</a> confirming that "the parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/internet-archives-big-battle-with-music-publishers-ends-in-settlement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As someone who writes about the AI industry relatively frequently for this site, there is one question that I find myself constantly asking and being asked in turn, in some form or another: What do you actually use large language models for?</p>
<p>Today, OpenAI's Economic Research Team went a long way toward answering that question, on a population level, releasing <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34255">a first-of-its-kind National Bureau of Economic Research working paper</a> (in association with Harvard economist David Denning) detailing how people end up using ChatGPT across time and tasks. While other research has sought to estimate this kind of usage data using self-reported surveys, this is the first such paper with direct access to OpenAI's internal user data. As such, it gives us an unprecedented direct window into reliable usage stats for what is still the most popular application of LLMs by far.</p>
<p>After digging through the dense 65-page paper, here are seven of the most interesting and/or surprising things we discovered about how people are using OpenAI today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/seven-things-we-learned-from-openais-first-study-on-chatgpt-usage/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Ars spoke with the Consumer Technology Association's vice president of international trade, Ed Brzytwa, to check in and see how tech firms have navigated Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff regimes so far.</p>
<p>Brzytwa has led CTA's research helping tech firms prepare for Trump's trade war, but during our talk, he confirmed that "the reality has been a lot more difficult and far worse, because of not just the height of the tariffs, but the variability, the tariffs on, tariffs off."</p>

<p>Currently, every tech company is in a "slightly different position," depending on its specific supply chains, he explained. However, until semiconductor tariffs are announced, "it's impossible" for any tech company to make the kind of long-term plans that could help keep consumer prices low as Trump's negotiations with foreign partners and investigations into various products drag on, Brzytwa said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/ars-live-cta-policy-expert-explains-why-tariff-stacking-is-a-nightmare/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday proposed fines of $3.1 million against Boeing for various safety violations related to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/four-bolts-were-missing-from-boeing-737-before-door-plug-blew-off-ntsb-says/">January 2024 door plug blowout</a> and what the FAA called "interference with safety officials' independence."</p>
<p>An FAA <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-proposes-31-million-fines-against-boeing">statement</a> said the proposed fine covers "safety violations that occurred from September 2023 through February 2024," and is the "maximum statutory civil penalty authority consistent with law." Boeing, which <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/2Q25-Press-Release.pdf">reported</a> $22.7 billion in revenue and a net loss of $612 million last quarter, has 30 days to file a response with the agency.</p>
<p>"The FAA identified hundreds of quality system violations at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, and Boeing subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems' 737 factory in Wichita, Kansas. Additionally, Boeing presented two unairworthy aircraft to the FAA for airworthiness certificates and failed to follow its quality system," the FAA said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/boeing-faces-3-1m-fine-for-door-plug-blowout-hundreds-of-safety-violations/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The last time Apple gave macOS a fresh design was in 2020's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/macos-11-0-big-sur-the-ars-technica-review/">macOS 11 Big Sur</a>.</p>
<p>That release was relatively light on new features and heavy on symbolism. Big Sur is also when Apple finally jettisoned the "10" in Mac OS X after two decades. More importantly, it was the first release installed on then-new Apple Silicon Macs, the culmination of a decade-plus of in-house chip design that began with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A4">single-core, low-power iPhone and iPad chips</a> and culminated in something <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/this-is-the-new-apple-silicon-mac-pro/">powerful enough for the Mac Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Today's macOS 26 Tahoe release holds up a translucent, glassy mirror to the Big Sur update. It comes with an all-new look, one that further unifies Apple's design language across all its operating systems. And it even throws out the old version numbering system and introduces a new one.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/macos-26-tahoe-the-ars-technica-review/">Read full article</a></p>
