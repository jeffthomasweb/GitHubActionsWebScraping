<p>A strategy document released by the Pentagon this week lays out where the US military can most effectively rely on the commercial space industry and what missions should remain in government hands.</p>
<p>"This marks a new effort to harness the remarkable innovation of the commercial space sector to enhance our resilience and strengthen integrated deterrence as a department," said John Plumb, assistant secretary of defense for space policy.</p>
<p>The Space Force already buys a lot from the commercial space industry. The military doesn't build or own satellite launch vehicles—those come from commercial companies. While the Space Force operates government-owned reconnaissance and surveillance satellites, it also buys supplementary data and imagery from the commercial industry.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014655#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014655&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google might start charging for access to search results that use generative artificial intelligence tools. That's according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4bfeb4-6579-4819-9f5f-b3a46ff59ed1">a new Financial Times report</a> citing "three people with knowledge of [Google's] plans."</p>
<p>Charging for any part of the search engine at the core of its business would be a first for Google, which has funded its search product solely with ads <a href="https://instapage.com/blog/google-adwords-infographic/">since 2000</a>. But it's far from the first time Google would charge for AI enhancements in general; the "AI Premium" tier of a Google One subscription <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans">costs $10 more per month</a> than a standard "Premium" plan, for instance, while "Gemini Business" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2024/02/google-launches-gemini-business-ai-adds-20-to-the-6-workspace-bill/">adds $20 a month</a> to a standard Google Workspace subscription.</p>
<p>While those paid products offer access to Google's high-end "Gemini Advanced" AI model, Google also <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">offers free access to its less performant, plain "Gemini" model</a> without any kind of paid subscription.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014756#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014756&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The flare-up of highly pathogenic bird flu continues to widen in US livestock after federal officials confirmed last week that the virus has spread to US cows for the first time. The virus has now been <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-dairy-herd-idaho">detected in dairy cows in at least five states</a>, a single person in Texas exposed to infected cows, and an egg farm in Texas, all spurring yet more intense monitoring and biosecurity vigilance as the situation continues to evolve.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, seven dairy herds in Texas, two in Kansas, and one each in Idaho, Michigan, and New Mexico had tested positive for the virus. The affected dairy herd in Michigan had recently received cows from one of the infected herds in Texas. It remains unclear if there is cow-to-cow transmission of the flu virus.</p>
<p>The virus—a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza or HPAI—has been devastating wild birds worldwide for the past several years. Throughout the devastating outbreak, the flu virus has spilled over <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals">to various species</a>, including big cats in zoos, river otters, bears, dolphins, seals, squirrels, and foxes. While cows were an unexpected addition to the list, federal officials noted last week that affected dairy farms had found dead wild birds on their farms, suggesting that wild birds introduced the virus to the cows, not an intermediate host.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014743#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014743&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Spotify Premium subscriptions include up to 15 hours of audiobook listening. But starting in April, the company will charge an extra $1 to $2 per month for the feature, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/spotify-is-changing-how-it-charges-customers-with-new-plans-and-prices?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> reported today, citing anonymous “people familiar with the matter.” The reported price hike would be the second that Spotify customers have faced in nine months.</p>
<p>Currently, Spotify charges nothing for its free plan with ads, $5.99/month for students, $10.99/month for its Premium plan, $14.99/month for its Duo Premium plan for two users, and $16.99/month for its Family Premium plan with up to six users.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that individual plan prices will go up by approximately $1 per month and multi-member plans will increase by $2 per month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014721#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014721&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A high-level Iowa hospital systems administrator, Matthew Kierans, has admitted to stealing a coworker's identity and posing as William Donald Woods for more than 30 years, The Register <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/03/sysadmin_33_year_id_theft/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>On top of using Woods' identity to commit crimes and rack up debt, Kierans' elaborate identity theft scheme led to Woods' incarceration after Kierans' accused his victim of identity theft and Los Angeles authorities failed to detect which man was the true William Donald Woods. Kierans could face up to 32 years in prison, The Register reported, and must pay a $1.25 million fine.</p>
<p>According to a proposed <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/US-v-Kierans-Notice-of-Intent-to-Plead-Guilty-4-1-2024.pdf">plea agreement</a> with the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Iowa, Kierans met Woods "in about 1988" when they worked together at a hot dog stand in New Mexico. "For the next three decades," Kierans used Woods' "identity in every aspect of his life," including when obtaining "employment, insurance, a social security number, driver's licenses, titles, loans, and credit," as well as when paying taxes. Kierans even got married and had a child using Woods' name.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014676#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014676&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In January, Microsoft introduced a new key to Windows PC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-keyboards-mechanical-membrane-and-buckling-springs/">keyboards</a> for the first time in 30 years. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ai-comes-for-your-pcs-keyboard-as-microsoft-adds-dedicated-copilot-key/">Copilot key</a>, dedicated to launching Microsoft's eponymous generative AI assistant, is already on some Windows laptops released this year. On Monday, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/windows-copilot-key-is-secretly-from-the-ibm-era-but-you-can-remap-it-with-the-right-tools">Tom’s Hardware</a> dug into the new addition and determined exactly what pressing the button does, which is actually pretty simple. Pushing a computer's integrated Copilot button is like pressing left-Shift + Windows key + F23 simultaneously.</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware confirmed this after wondering if the Copilot key introduced a new scan code to Windows or if it worked differently. Using the scripting program AuthoHotkey with a new laptop with a Copilot button, Tom's Hardware discovered the keystrokes registered when a user presses the Copilot key. The publication confirmed with Dell that “this key assignment is standard for the Copilot key and done at Microsoft's direction.”</p>
<h2>F23</h2>
<p>Surprising to see in that string of keys is F23. Having a computer keyboard with a function row or rows that take you from F1 all the way to F23 is quite rare today. When I try to imagine a keyboard that comes with an F23 button, vintage keyboards come to mind, more specifically <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-keyboards-mechanical-membrane-and-buckling-springs/6/#h1">buckling spring keyboards</a> from IBM.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014584#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014584&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Icy ocean worlds like Europa or Enceladus are some of the most promising locations for finding extra-terrestrial life in the Solar System because they host liquid water. But to determine if there is something lurking in their alien oceans, we need to get past ice cover that can be dozens of kilometers thick. Any robots we send through the ice would have to do most of the job on their own because communication with these moons takes as much as 155 minutes.</p>
<p>Researchers working on NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's technology development project called Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS) might have a solution to both those problems. It involves using an AI-guided space snake robot. And they actually built one.</p>
<h2>Geysers on Enceladus</h2>
<p>The most popular idea to get through the ice sheet on Enceladus or Europa so far has been thermal drilling, a technique used for researching glaciers on Earth. It involves a hot drill that simply melts its way through the ice. “Lots of people work on different thermal drilling approaches, but they all have a challenge of sediment accumulation, which impacts the amount of energy needed to make significant progress through the ice sheet,” says Matthew Glinder, the hardware lead of the EELS project.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014207#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014207&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/ulas-vulcan-rocket-shot-for-the-moon-on-debut-launch-and-hit-a-bullseye/">impressive debut</a> of the Vulcan rocket in January, it is unclear when the heavy lift vehicle will fly again. The uncertainty is due to a couple of factors, including the rocket's readiness and, perhaps more critically, what will fly on top of it.</p>
<p>United Launch Alliance, which assembles and launches the Vulcan rocket, has long maintained that it would launch the Dream Chaser spacecraft for Sierra Space on the rocket's second mission. This would allow the rocket company to obtain enough data about the performance of Vulcan to earn certification for national security payloads.</p>
<p>An indication of the emphasis the company has put on earning certification from the Space Force—launching military payloads is the primary justification for the existence of Vulcan—comes from the names it chose for the first two launches, Cert-1 and Cert-2.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014568#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014568&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap">





<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ef0heKtiuvQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Explore the chemistry behind making a cocktail with curdled milk, aka milk washing—like Ben Franklin's fave, milk punch. </p></div>
<p>It's well-known that Benjamin Franklin was a Founding Father who enjoyed a nice tipple or two (or three). One of his favorite alcoholic beverages was <a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/263">milk punch</a>, a heady concoction of brandy, lemon juice, nutmeg, sugar, water, and hot whole milk—the latter nicely curdled thanks to the heat, lemon juice, and alcohol. It employs a technique known as "milk washing," used to round out and remove harsh, bitter flavors from spirits that have been less than perfectly distilled, as well as preventing drinks from spoiling (a considerable benefit in the 1700s).</p>
<p>Some versions of milk punch also incorporate tea, and in the mixed drink taxonomy, it falls somewhere between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posset">posset</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabub">syllabub</a>. The American Chemical Society's George Zaidan decided to delve a bit deeper into the chemistry behind milk washing in a new <em>Reactions</em> video after tasting the difference between a Tea Time cocktail made with the milk washing method and one made without it. The latter was so astringent, it was "like drinking a cup of tea that's been brewed for 6,000 years," per Zaidan. In the process, he ended up stumbling onto a flavorful new twist on the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_martini">espresso martini</a> (although <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2005/11/21/three-and-im-under-the-table/">martini purists</a> probably wouldn't consider either to be a true martini).</p>
<p>There isn't anything in the scientific literature about milk washing as it specifically pertains to cocktails, so Zaidan broke the process down into three simple experiments, armed with all the necessary ingredients and his trusty centrifuge. First, he combined whole milk with Coke, a highly acidic beverage that curdles the milk. Per Zaidan, this happens because of the casein proteins in milk, which typically have an overall negative charge that keeps them from clumping. Adding the acid (Coke) adds protons to the mix so that it is electrically neutral (usually at a pH of 4.6).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014499#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014499&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Depending on who you ask about AI (and how you define it), the technology may or may not be useful, but one thing is for certain: AI hype is dominating corporate marketing these days—even in fast food. According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/taco-bell-and-pizza-hut-are-going-ai-first-yums-new-tech-chief-says-2f423d5e">a report</a> in The Wall Street Journal, corporate fast food giant Yum Brands is embracing an "AI-first mentality" across its restaurant chains, including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC, and Habit Burger Grill. The company's chief digital and technology officer, Joe Park, told the WSJ that AI will shape nearly every aspect of how these restaurants operate.</p>

<p>"Our vision of [quick-service restaurants] is that an AI-first mentality works every step of the way," Park said in an interview with the outlet. "If you think about the major journeys within a restaurant that can be AI-powered, we believe it’s endless."</p>
<p>As we've discussed in the past, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> is a nebulous term. It can mean many different things depending on the context, including computer-controlled ghosts in <em>Pac-Man</em>, algorithms that play checkers, or large language models that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/nycs-government-chatbot-is-lying-about-city-laws-and-regulations/">give terrible advice</a> on major city websites. But most of all in this tech climate, it means money, because even talking about AI tends to make corporate share prices <a href="https://www.wallstreetzen.com/blog/ai-mention-moves-stock-prices-2023/">go up</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014492#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014492&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A federal Cyber Safety Review Board has issued its report on what led to last summer's capture of hundreds of thousands of emails by Chinese hackers from cloud customers, including federal agencies. It cites "a cascade of security failures at Microsoft" and finds that "Microsoft's security culture was inadequate" and needs to adjust to a "new normal" of cloud provider targeting.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">report</a>, mandated by President Biden in the wake of the far-reaching intrusion, details the steps that Microsoft took before, during, and after the breach and in each case finds critical failure. The breach was "preventable," even though it cites Microsoft as not knowing precisely how Storm-0558, a "hacking group assessed to be affiliated with the People's Republic of China," got in.</p>
<p>"Throughout this review, the board identified a series of Microsoft operational and strategic decisions that collectively points to a corporate culture that deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management," the report reads.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014535#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014535&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission has scheduled an April 25 vote to restore net neutrality rules similar to the ones introduced during the Obama era and repealed under former President Trump.</p>
<p>"After the prior administration abdicated authority over broadband services, the FCC has been handcuffed from acting to fully secure broadband networks, protect consumer data, and ensure the Internet remains fast, open, and fair," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-vote-restoring-net-neutrality">said today</a>. "A return to the FCC's overwhelmingly popular and court-approved standard of net neutrality will allow the agency to serve once again as a strong consumer advocate of an open Internet."</p>
<p>The text of the pending net neutrality order wasn't released today. The FCC press release said it will prohibit broadband providers "from blocking, slowing down, or creating pay-to-play Internet fast lanes" and "bring back a national standard for broadband reliability, security, and consumer protection."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014570#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014570&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon is giving up on the cashier-less "Just Walk Out" technology at its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazons-grocery-stores-to-drop-just-walk-out-checkout-tech">The Information</a> reports that new stores will be built without computer-vision-powered surveillance technology, and "the majority" of existing stores will have the tech removed. In the early days, Amazon's ambitions included selling Just Walk Out to other brick-and-mortar stores. The problem was that the technology never really worked.</p>
<p>As it says on the tin, Just Walk Out was supposed to let customers grab what they wanted from a store and just <em>leave</em>, skipping any kind of checkout process. Amazon wanted to track what customers took with them purely via AI-powered video surveillance; the system just took a phone scan at the door, and shoppers would be billed later via their Amazon accounts.</p>
<p>When the technology was announced in 2016, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc">Amazon's sales pitch</a> asked, "What if we could weave the most advanced machine learning, computer vision, and AI into the very fabric of a store so you never had to wait in line?" The store was filled with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/we-test-the-worlds-first-amazon-go-watch-you-shop-grocery-store/">100-plus cameras</a> and rigid item locations, all designed to try to make AI-powered computer vision checkout possible.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014502#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014502&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TSMC says that workers were evacuated as part of its earthquake safety protocols and that they have already returned to work. Bloomberg reports that the company is still "examining impact" to its operations, but it "expects to resume production overnight."</p>

<p>The quake's epicenter was on Taiwain's east coast and has prompted tsunami warnings in Japan, China, and the Philippines, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/world/asia/taiwan-earthquake.html">The New York Times</a>. The quake was followed by a long series of over 200 aftershocks, including one 6.5-magnitude aftershock. It's the strongest earthquake to affect Taiwan since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Jiji_earthquake">the 7.7-magnitude Jiji earthquake</a> in 1999. As of this writing, the NYT reports that at least nine people have died, and 1,011 have reported injuries.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014488#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014488&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>X has <a href="https://twitter.com/Safety/status/1775202997284282543">named</a> a new head of safety about nine months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/twitter-safety-chief-resigns-after-musk-criticizes-decision-to-restrict-film/">Ella Irwin resigned last June</a>, following Elon Musk's criticism of Irwin's team's decision to restrict a transphobic documentary. Shortly after Irwin left, former head of brand safety AJ Brown similarly resigned. And that regime notably took over where former safety chief Yoel Roth—who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/former-musk-ally-explains-resignation-from-twitter-cites-dictatorial-edict/">also clashed with Musk</a>—left off.</p>
<p>Stepping into the safety chief role next is Kylie McRoberts, who was promoted after leading X "initiatives to increase transparency in our moderation practices through labels" and "improve security with passkeys," X's announcement said.</p>
<p>As head of safety, McRoberts will oversee X's global safety team, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/Safety/status/1767275266613645597">rebranded</a> last month to drop "trust" from its name. On X, Musk had <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1767273166374633895">said</a> that "any organization that puts ‘Trust’ in their name cannot [be] trusted, as that is obviously a euphemism for censorship."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014505#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014505&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The George Carlin estate has settled its lawsuit with Dudesy, the podcast that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/did-an-ai-write-that-hour-long-george-carlin-special-im-not-convinced/">purportedly used a "comedy AI" to produce an hour-long stand-up special</a> in the style and voice of the late comedian.</p>
<p>Dudesy's "George Carlin: Dead and Loving It" special, which was first uploaded in early January, gained hundreds of thousands of views and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/george-carlin-ai-generated-comedy-special-1235868315/">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/technology/george-carlin-resurrected-without-permission-by-self-described-comedy-ai">media attention</a> for its presentation as a creation of an AI that had "listened to all of George Carlin’s material... to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today." But even before the Carlin estate lawsuit was filed, there were numerous signs that the special was not actually written by an AI, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/did-an-ai-write-that-hour-long-george-carlin-special-im-not-convinced/">Ars laid out in detail</a> in a feature report.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Carlin estate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/george-carlins-heirs-sue-comedy-podcast-over-ai-generated-impression/">filed its lawsuit</a> against Dudesy in late January, a representative for Dudesy host Will Sasso <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/arts/carlin-lawsuit-ai-podcast-copyright.html">told The New York Times</a> that the special had actually been "completely written by [Dudesy co-host] Chad Kultgen."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014494#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014494&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Today's quantum computing hardware is severely limited in what it can do by errors that are difficult to avoid. There can be problems with everything from setting the initial state of a qubit to reading its output, and qubits will occasionally lose their state while doing nothing. Some of the quantum processors in existence today can't use all of their individual qubits for a single calculation without errors becoming inevitable.</p>
<p>The solution is to combine multiple hardware qubits to form what's termed a logical qubit. This allows a single bit of quantum information to be distributed among multiple hardware qubits, reducing the impact of individual errors. Additional qubits can be used as sensors to detect errors and allow interventions to correct them. Recently, there have been a number of demonstrations that logical qubits <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/01/quantum-computing-startup-says-it-will-beat-ibm-to-error-correction/">work in principle</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft and Quantinuum announced that logical qubits work in more than principle. "We've been able to demonstrate what's called active syndrome extraction, or sometimes it's also called repeated error correction," Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ksvore/">Krysta Svore</a> told Ars. "And we've been able to do this such that it is better than the underlying physical error rate. So it actually works."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014489#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014489&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the first time, scientists are attempting to grow a new, miniature liver inside of a person. It sounds like science fiction; in fact, the idea was the plot of a <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> episode that aired in 2018. Now, biotech company LyGenesis is trying to turn the concept into reality.</p>
<p>Today, LyGenesis announced that an initial volunteer has received an injection of donor cells to turn one of their lymph nodes into a second liver. The procedure was carried out in Houston on March 25 as part of a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04496479">clinical trial</a> that will test the experimental treatment in 12 adults with end-stage liver disease.</p>
<p>These patients usually require a liver transplant, but donor organs are in short supply. LyGenesis is hoping to spur the growth of enough healthy liver tissue that patients don’t need a transplant. “We’re using the lymph node as a living bioreactor,” says Michael Hufford, cofounder and CEO of Pittsburgh-based LyGenesis. He says just 10 to 30 percent in additional liver mass could have meaningful effects for patients with end-stage liver disease.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014481#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014481&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While AI assistants like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> have taken the world by storm, a growing body of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">research</a> shows that it's also possible to generate useful outputs from what might be called "human language models," or people. Much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work">large language models</a> (LLMs) in AI, HLMs have the ability to take information you provide and transform it into meaningful responses—if you know how to craft effective instructions, called "prompts."</p>
