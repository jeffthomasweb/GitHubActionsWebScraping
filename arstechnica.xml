                            <![CDATA[<p>Android devices are vulnerable to a new attack that can covertly steal 2FA codes, location timelines, and other private data in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The new attack, named Pixnapping by the team of academic researchers who devised it, requires a victim to first install a malicious app on an Android phone or tablet. The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed.</p>
<h2>Like taking a screenshot</h2>
<p>Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side channel</a> that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/no-fix-yet-for-attack-that-lets-hackers-pluck-2fa-codes-from-android-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Health officials in South Carolina are warning that the highly infectious measles virus is spreading undetected in communities in the northern part of the state, specifically Spartanburg and Greenville counties.</p>
<p>Last week, officials in Greenville identified an eighth measles case that is potentially linked to the outbreak. Seven outbreak cases had been confirmed since September 25 in neighboring Spartanburg, where transmission was identified in two schools: Fairforest Elementary and Global Academy, a public charter school.</p>
<p>Across those two schools, at least 153 unvaccinated children were exposed to the virus and have been put in a 21-day quarantine, during which they are barred from attending school, state officials said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOoDM-Bn2g">a press conference</a>. Twenty-one days is the maximum incubation period, spanning from when a person is exposed to when they would develop a rash if infected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/over-150-unvaccinated-kids-quarantined-for-21-days-in-sc-measles-outbreak/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">experimenting with conversational image editing</a> earlier this year in the dev-focused AI studio, but the feature didn't remain experimental for long. Over the summer, Google rolled out the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/google-improves-gemini-ai-image-editing-with-nano-banana-model/">Nano Banana</a>" image-editing model in Gemini 2.5 Flash. You can use this feature to modify images with just a prompt, and now you don't even need to go to Gemini to use it. Google says Nano Banana is now coming to search, Google Photos, and NotebookLM.</p>
<p>The AI image editor is coming to search via Lens and AI Mode. For Lens, you can simply open the app (iOS and Android) and snap a photo to get started. When the rollout is complete, you'll see a "Create" button at the bottom, with a banana icon. Tap that to enter a prompt, telling the AI how you'd like the photo changed.</p>

  </div>

    <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span>
      </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When you begin an edit in Lens, the Google app will display the results and offer the chance for follow-up edits in the AI Mode interface. Google is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/at-i-o-2025-google-leaves-no-doubt-that-ai-mode-is-the-future-of-search/">always looking</a> for more ways to get people plugged into its conversational search bot, so there's also a separate way to access Nano Banana there. Simply select the "Create image" tool and enter your prompt to create an image. You can then continue the conversation to have Nano Banana change the image.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/googles-nano-banana-ai-image-editor-is-coming-to-search-photos-and-notebooklm/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Liftoff of the Super Heavy booster with the Starship upper stage is scheduled for 6:15 pm CDT (7:15 pm EDT; 23:15 UTC). SpaceX has a 75-minute window to launch Monday. You can watch a livestream of the flight <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-11">here</a>.</p>
<p>SpaceX's control team, positioned a couple of miles away from the launch pad at Starbase, Texas, will oversee the loading of more than 10.5 million pounds of super-cold methane and liquid oxygen into the two-stage rocket beginning about an hour before liftoff. In the final minutes of the countdown, the world's largest rocket will undergo a steering check, and the launch director will give a final "go" for launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/starships-elementary-era-ends-today-with-mega-rockets-11th-test-flight/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple has lightly rebranded its video-on-demand streaming service. The Netflix rival that has brought us critically acclaimed shows and movies like <em>Slow Horses</em> and <em>The Lost Bus</em> has gone from Apple TV+ to Apple TV.</p>
<p>Apple announced the name change today in a press release that was primarily about the film <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/f1-the-movie-takes-motorsport-into-the-imax-age/">F1: The Movie</a> </em>coming to its streaming service on December 12. Unlike previous announcements, however, today’s release referred to the streaming service as Apple TV, instead of Apple TV+. The announcement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple didn’t specify how its streaming service’s “identity” has changed at all. As of this writing, accessing Apple’s streaming service via a browser or smart TV app still shows the original Apple TV+ branding.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/10/apple-tv-streaming-service-is-renamed-to-just-apple-tv/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The encryption protecting communications against criminal and nation-state snooping is under threat. As private industry and governments get closer to building useful quantum computers, the algorithms protecting Bitcoin wallets, encrypted web visits, and other sensitive secrets will be useless. No one doubts the day will come, but as the now-common joke in cryptography circles observes, experts have been forecasting this cryptocalypse will arrive in the next 15 to 30 years for the past 30 years.</p>
<p>The uncertainty has created something of an existential dilemma: Should network architects spend the billions of dollars required to wean themselves off quantum-vulnerable algorithms now, or should they prioritize their limited security budgets fighting more immediate threats such as ransomware and espionage attacks? Given the expense and no clear deadline, it’s little wonder that <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than half</a> of all TLS connections made inside the Cloudflare network and only <a href="https://trustfour.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 percent</a> of Fortune 500 networks support quantum-resistant TLS connections. It's all but certain that many fewer organizations still are supporting quantum-ready encryption in less prominent protocols.</p>
<h2>Triumph of the cypherpunks</h2>
<p>One exception to the industry-wide lethargy is the engineering team that designs the Signal Protocol, the open source engine that powers the world’s most robust and resilient form of end-to-end encryption for multiple private chat apps, most notably the <a href="https://signal.org/download/">Signal Messenger</a>. Eleven days ago, the nonprofit entity that develops the protocol, Signal Messenger LLC, published a 5,900-word write-up describing its latest updates that bring Signal a significant step toward being fully quantum-resistant.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/why-signals-post-quantum-makeover-is-an-amazing-engineering-achievement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A battle over the United Kingdom's Online Safety Act (OSA) heated up Monday as UK regulator Ofcom fined the notorious image-hosting board 4chan about $26,000 for failing to provide a risk assessment detailing the potential harms of illegal content hosted on its forum.</p>
<p>In a press release provided to Ars, Ofcom said 4chan refused to respond to two requests for information that the regulator considered "routine." The first asked for the risk assessment and the second for 4chan's "qualifying worldwide revenue."</p>
<p>4chan was anticipating the Monday fine, noting in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4chan-Kiwi-varms-v-Ofcom-Complaint-8-27-25.pdf">lawsuit</a>—which was jointly filed with the online trolling forum <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/cloudflare-explains-why-kiwi-farms-was-its-most-dangerous-customer-ever/">Kiwi Farms</a> in August and seeks to permanently enjoin Ofcom from enforcing OSA—that Ofcom had made it clear that because 4chan ignored Ofcom's emails, the fine was coming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/4chan-fined-26k-for-refusing-to-assess-risks-under-uk-online-safety-act/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>When Elon Musk started the company in 2002, he was joined by two other "founding" employees, Tom Mueller in propulsion and Chris Thompson in structures. Koenigsmann was the next hire, brought on to develop avionics for the Falcon 1 rocket.</p>
<p>Koenigsmann remained at the company for two decades before leaving SpaceX in late 2021. During that time, he transitioned from avionics to lead mission assurance and safety while also spearheading every major failure investigation of the Falcon 9 rocket.

<p>Numbers are still sketchy, but reports from Friday indicate that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trumps-budget-director-says-layoffs-begun-government-shutdown-rcna236923">more than 4,000</a> federal workers overall were initially targeted for layoffs. The Trump administration linked the firings to the ongoing government shutdown, which legal experts have suggested is illegal. Unions representing federal workers have <a href="https://www.afge.org/publication/trump-administrations-plan-for-mass-firing-of-federal-workers-during-government-shutdown-violates-law-unions-say/">already filed a lawsuit</a> challenging the move.</p>
<p>Of the reported 4,000 terminations, about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-administration-reverses-layoffs-cdc-staff-rcna237136">1,100 to 1,200</a> were among employees in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS is a massive department that houses critical federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, among others. Before Trump's second term, the HHS workforce was about 82,000, but that was slashed to about 62,000 earlier this year amid initial cuts and efforts to push civil servants out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/mass-firings-at-us-health-dept-partially-reversed-but-still-devastating/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I came across possibly one of the weirdest official automotive accessories this morning, courtesy of a friend's social media feed. It's called the "Truckle," and it's a hand-crafted silver and bronze belt buckle that might be the envy of every other cowboy out there, since this one has a place to keep your F-150's key fob without ruining the lines of your jeans.</p>
<p>The Truckle was designed by Utah-based A Cut Above Buckles, with a hand-engraved F-150 on the bump in the front. Behind the truck? Storage space for a Ford truck key fob, which should fit any F-150 from model year 2018 onward.</p>
<p>"You can put your key fob in the buckle—all your remote features work while it’s in the buckle," designer Andy Andrews told the <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2025/10/10/ford-truckle-wearable-belt-buckle-lost-key-fobs/86608915007/">Detroit Free Press</a>. "Once you have it in there, you're not going to lose that key fob. You’re not going to be scratching your head (wondering) where it’s at. It's right there with you in the Truckle."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/keep-losing-your-key-fob-fords-new-truckle-is-the-answer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Owners of some Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids have been left stranded after installing an over-the-air software update this weekend. The automaker pushed out a telematics update for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/hands-on-with-stellantis-new-android-based-uconnect-5-infotainment/">Uconnect</a> infotainment system that evidently wasn't ready, resulting in cars losing power while driving and then becoming stranded.</p>
<p>Stranded Jeep owners have been detailing their experiences in forum and Reddit posts, as well as on YouTube. The buggy update doesn't appear to brick the car immediately. Instead, the failure appears to occur while driving—a far more serious problem. For some, this happened close to home and at low speed, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/1o47064/jeep_4xe_shut_off_mid_highway/">others claim</a> to have experienced a powertrain failure at highway speeds.</p>
<p>Jeep pulled the update after reports of problems, but the software had already downloaded to many owners' cars by then. A member of Stellantis' social engagement team told 4xe owners <a href="https://www.4xeforums.com/threads/wrangler-4xe-ota-update-10-10-2025.8078/?nested_view=1&amp;post_id=103140&amp;ref=thestack.technology#post-103140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a Jeep forum</a> to ignore the update pop-up if they haven't installed it yet.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/software-update-bricks-some-jeep-4xe-hybrids-over-the-weekend/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The <em>Star Trek</em> universe panel at New York Comic Con (NYCC) this weekend concluded with a brand-new trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Starfleet_Academy_(TV_series)"><em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy.</em></a> The 10-episode series will follow the exploits of the first new crop of cadets in a century.</p>
<p>Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em> introduces viewers to a young group of cadets who come together to pursue a common dream of hope and optimism. Under the watchful and demanding eyes of their instructors, they discover what it takes to become Starfleet officers as they navigate blossoming friendships, explosive rivalries, first loves and a new enemy that threatens both the Academy and the Federation itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new cadets include Sandro Rosta as human orphan Caleb Mir; Karim Diané as a Klingon cadet, Jay-Den Kraag; Kerrice Brooks as Sam (Series Acclimation Mil), the first Kasquain to attend the Academy; George Hawkins as Darem Reymi, a Khionian cadet who wants to be a captain; Bella Shepard as Genesis Lythe, a Dar-Sha cadet; and Zoë Steiner as Tarima Sadal, daughter of the president of Betazed. In addition, Holly Hunter plays Academy chancellor Captain Nahla Ake; Gina Yashere plays Cadet Master Lura Thok; Becky Lynch plays a member of Starfleet bridge crew; and Paul Giamatti plays a half-Klingon, half-Tellarite character named Nus Braka, the series' chief villain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/new-starfleet-academy-trailer-debuts-at-nycc/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Cards Against Humanity (CAH) this week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/to-avoid-tariffs-cards-against-humanity-becomes-information-material-not-a-game/">announced its newest stunt</a>: a "Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke" edition that ditches the game's rules and adds explanatory notes to each card in the box. This makes the project "informational material" rather than a "game," and therefore CAH can avoid import tariffs. All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship.</p>
<p>While a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week's news did raise a question I've heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn't it print the game in the US? I mean, it's just a box of cards! How hard can it be?</p>
<p>In the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it's often not possible. Complex board games today may feature cardboard creations like constructible dice towers, custom-shaped and painted wooden markers, multicolored jewel pieces, plastic bits of nearly every possible variety, custom-printed component bags, molded miniatures, cards in multiple sizes, metallic coins, dry-erase boards, fancy box inserts, massive dual-sided playing boards, and long manuals. The only manufacturers capable of doing all this work are generally in China or central Europe (Germany still has good manufacturing, and there are also sites in Poland and the Czech Republic).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/why-doesnt-cards-against-humanity-print-its-game-in-the-us-its-complicated/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since launching its bug bounty program nearly a decade ago, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a> has always touted notable maximum payouts—<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/apples-finally-offering-bug-bounties-highest-rewards-ever/">$200,000</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-hacker-iphone-bug-bounty-macos/">$1 million</a> in 2019. Now the company is upping the stakes again. At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-spyware-investment/">spyware</a>.</p>
<p>The move reflects how valuable exploitable vulnerabilities can be within Apple's highly protected mobile environment—and the lengths the company will go to to keep such discoveries from falling into the wrong hands. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-lockdown-mode-hands-on/">extra secure Lockdown Mode </a>as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. Taken together, the maximum award for what would otherwise be a potentially catastrophic exploit chain will now be $5 million. The changes take effect next month.</p>
<p>“We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there’s a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. “We want to make sure that for the hardest categories, the hardest problems, the things that most closely mirror the kinds of attacks that we see with mercenary spyware—that the researchers who have those skills and abilities and put in that effort and time can get a tremendous reward."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/apple-ups-the-reward-for-finding-major-exploits-to-2-million/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every few weeks, it seems, yet another lab proclaims yet another breakthrough in the race to perfect solid-state batteries: next-generation power packs that promise to give us electric vehicles (EVs) so problem-free that we’ll have no reason left to buy gas-guzzlers.</p>
<p>These new solid-state cells are designed to be lighter and more compact than the lithium-ion batteries used in today’s EVs. They should also be much safer, with nothing inside that can burn like those rare but hard-to-extinguish lithium-ion fires. They should hold a lot more energy, turning range anxiety into a distant memory with consumer EVs able to go four, five, six hundred miles on a single charge.</p>
<p>And forget about those “fast” recharges lasting half an hour or more: Solid-state batteries promise EV fill-ups in minutes—almost as fast as any standard car gets with gasoline.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/how-close-are-we-to-solid-state-batteries-for-electric-vehicles/">Read full article</a></p>

<media:credit>Mercedes-Benz Group</media:credit><media:text>In early 2025, Mercedes-Benz ran its first road tests of an electric passenger car powered by a prototype solid-state battery pack. The carmaker predicts the next-gen battery will increase the electric vehicle’s driving range to over 620 miles (1,000 kilometers).

                            <![CDATA[<p>An unknown number of federal health employees received termination notifications Friday afternoon as part of a mass reduction in force by the Trump administration that senior officials and federal employment lawyers say is almost certainly illegal.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services has taken <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-bloodbath-at-hhs-blowback-grows-as-losses-become-clearer/">heavy hits</a> since Trump came to office. Early in the year, the Trump administration pushed out 10,000 employees through early retirements, deferred resignations, and other efforts while laying off 10,000 more, slashing the HHS workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 in all. In the current government shutdown—which hinges on a dispute over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/most-americans-want-aca-tax-credits-extended-even-57-of-maga-supporters/">Affordable Care Act tax credits that 80 percent of Americans support</a>—more than 32,000 HHS employees are furloughed.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement to Ars Technica, HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said that HHS employees "across multiple divisions" have received termination notices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/more-federal-health-employees-axed-amid-shutdown-linked-terminations/">Read full article</a></p>

In the last few years, Russia has cut back on the number of Soyuz crew missions it is sending to the International Space Station, and a replacement for the nearly 60-year-old Soyuz spacecraft remains elusive.</p>
<p>While the United States and China are launching more space missions than ever before, Russia's once-dominant launch cadence is on a downhill slide.</p>
<p>Russia's access to global markets dried up after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The fallout from the invasion killed several key space partnerships between Russia and Europe.

<p>Marvel Studios dropped the first trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Man_(miniseries)"><em>Wonder Man</em></a>, an eight-episode miniseries slated for a January release, at New York Comic Con this weekend.</p>
<p>Part of the MCU's Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton (<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings</em>) and Andrew Guest (<em>Hawkeye</em>), with Guest serving as showrunner. It has been in development since 2022.</p>
<p>The comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries.
