<p>Thanks to the vaccination program that began in 1995, chickenpox is now relatively rare. Cases of the miserable, itchy condition have fallen more than 97 percent. But, while children have largely put the oatmeal baths and oven mitts behind them, doctors have apparently let their diagnostic skills get a little crusty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7311a3.htm?s_cid=mm7311a3_w">According to a study published Thursday</a>, public health researchers in Minnesota found that 55 percent of people diagnosed with chickenpox based on their symptoms were actually negative for the varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes chickenpox. The study noted that the people were all diagnosed in person by health care providers in medical facilities. But, instead of chickenpox, lab testing showed that some of the patients were actually infected with an enterovirus, which can cause a rash, or the herpes simplex virus 1, which causes cold sores.</p>
<p>The study, published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, supports expanding laboratory testing for suspected chickenpox cases in the state's program and highlights that diagnoses based on symptoms are "unreliable."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012079#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012079&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Upgrades at SpaceX's most-used launch pad in Florida got a trial run Thursday with the liftoff of a Falcon 9 rocket with a Dragon cargo ship heading for the International Space Station.</p>
<p>SpaceX's Cargo Dragon spacecraft launched at 4:55 pm EDT (20:55 UTC) Thursday from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This mission, known as CRS-30, is SpaceX's 30th resupply mission to the space station since 2012.</p>
<p>The automated Dragon supply ship took off on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, heading for a monthlong stay at the International Space Station, where it will deliver more than 6,000 pounds of hardware, fresh food, and experiments for the lab's seven-person crew.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011649#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011649&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147831">consented to adopt</a> what some call the first global resolution on AI, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/un-adopts-first-global-artificial-intelligence-resolution-2024-03-21/">Reuters</a>. The resolution aims to foster the protection of personal data, enhance privacy policies, ensure close monitoring of AI for potential risks, and uphold human rights. It emerged from a proposal by the United States and received backing from China and 121 other countries.</p>

<p>Being a nonbinding agreement and thus effectively toothless, the resolution seems broadly popular in the AI industry. On X, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1770854291521126617?s=20">wrote</a>, "We fully support the @UN's adoption of the comprehensive AI resolution. The consensus reached today marks a critical step towards establishing international guardrails for the ethical and sustainable development of AI, ensuring this technology serves the needs of everyone."</p>
<p>The resolution, titled "<a href="https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/ltd/n24/065/92/pdf/n2406592.pdf?token=hD5fXbnj2VZHJd5ZEF&amp;fe=true">Seizing the opportunities of safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems for sustainable development</a>," resulted from three months of negotiation, and the stakeholders involved <a href="https://usun.usmission.gov/joint-statement-on-the-proposed-unga-resolution-on-seizing-the-opportunities-of-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-ai-systems-for-sustainable-development/">seem pleased</a> at the level of international cooperation. "We're sailing in choppy waters with the fast-changing technology, which means that it's more important than ever to steer by the light of our values," one senior US administration official told Reuters, highlighting the significance of this "first-ever truly global consensus document on AI."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012004#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012004&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Department of Justice is angry about green message bubbles. Announcing today's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/us-sues-apple-alleging-it-illegally-monopolized-the-smartphone-market/">antitrust lawsuit</a> against Apple, US Attorney General Merrick Garland devoted a portion of his <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-lawsuit-against-apple-monopolizing">speech</a> to the green bubbles that appear in conversations between users of iPhones and other mobile devices such as Android smartphones.</p>
<p>"As any iPhone user who has ever seen a green text message, or received a tiny, grainy video can attest, Apple's anticompetitive conduct also includes making it more difficult for iPhone users to message with users of non-Apple products," Garland said while announcing the suit that alleges Apple illegally monopolized the smartphone market.</p>
<p>The attorney general accused Apple of "diminishing the functionality of its own messaging app" and that of messaging apps made by third parties. "By doing so, Apple knowingly and deliberately degrades quality, privacy, and security for its users," Garland said. "For example, if an iPhone user messages a non-iPhone user in Apple Messages, the text appears not only as a green bubble, but incorporates limited functionality."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012027#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012027&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It probably hasn't escaped notice that electric vehicles, having captured everyone's attention, are having a bit of a slide into what Gartner calls "<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-s-new-in-the-2023-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies">the trough of depression</a>." But as skeptics push back on battery EVs, another style of electrified car looks set to travel back up the slope of enlightenment. Plug-in hybrids are finding their second wind, as automakers and regulators look to PHEVs as a way to reduce transport-related carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Lincoln's Corsair Grand Touring is not a particularly new PHEV, but since we hadn't tested one yet and there was an example on the local press fleet, it seemed prudent to schedule a week with this compact crossover from one of America's luxury brands.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that, despite the way it might look in photos, this is not a huge land barge. The Corsair is 181.4 inches (4,608 mm) long, 76.4 inches (1,941 mm) wide, and 64.1 inches (1,628 mm) tall, so about the same size as a Toyota RAV4, or six inches shorter than a Tesla Model Y. The shape uses plenty of curved edges, dominated by the large Lincoln grille up front, with a hint of late-teens Audi SUV to it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011994#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011994&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We've been following the saga of Ranga Dias since he first burst onto the scene with reports of a high-pressure, room-temperature superconductor, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/high-pressure-superconductors-reach-room-temperature/">published in Nature</a> in 2020. Even as that paper was being retracted due to concerns about the validity of some of its data, Dias published a second paper claiming a similar breakthrough: a superconductor that works at high temperatures but somewhat lower pressures. Shortly afterward, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/nature-retracts-a-second-high-temperature-superconductor-study/">that got retracted as well</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the University of Rochester, where Dias is based, announced that it had concluded an investigation into Dias and found that he had committed research misconduct. (The outcome was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/physics/superconductor-scientist-engaged-in-research-misconduct-probe-finds-d692898c">first reported</a> by The Wall Street Journal.)</p>
<p>The outcome is likely to mean the end of Dias' career, as well as the company he founded to commercialize the supposed breakthroughs. But it's unlikely we'll ever see the full details of the investigation's conclusions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011983#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011983&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Android 15 continues its march toward release with the <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15">Android 15 Developer Preview 2</a>. Android 15 won't be out until around October, but the first preview shipped a month ago. It's time for another one!</p>
<p>Android's satellite messaging support has been in the works for about a year now, and it sounds like Android 15 is going to launch the feature for apps. The new OS is including notifications and better status bar indicators for when you're connected to space. A "NonTerrestrialNetwork" API will let apps know when they're limited to barely there satellite connectivity. Google says Android 15 will let third-party SMS and MMS applications tap into the satellite connectivity APIs, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/apple-announces-rcs-support-for-imessage/">enhanced messaging</a> with RCS support will be limited to "preloaded" applications only. It seems incredible that Google doesn't have public APIs for third-party RCS apps, but here's your confirmation that Android 15 will continue locking out Play Store apps from RCS.</p>

<p>Android's PDF support can be all over the place depending on what device you have, so Android 15 is including making some big improvements to the built-in PDF render. First it's going to end up as a module so it can be updated via the Play Store. Google says this Android 15 version is getting "advanced features such as rendering password-protected files, annotations, form editing, searching, and selection with copy."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011931#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011931&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors have suggested the sentence should be between 40 and 50 years, but Bankman-Fried claimed such a sentence painted him as a "depraved supervillain," Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-20/sbf-says-50-year-sentence-only-suitable-for-a-super-villain">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The lightest sentence was appropriate, Bankman-Fried claimed, because the "most reasonable estimate of loss" and "harm" to customers, lenders, and investors is "zero."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011956#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011956&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5JTfKhwWNR4?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">This short teaser for S2 of HBO's <em>House of the Dragon</em> lets you choose between two full trailers. </p></div>
<p>It's been a long wait for the second season of HBO's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-house-of-the-dragon-prequel-series-makes-a-solid-debut/"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>, in which House Targaryen descends into civil war over the heir to the Iron Throne. It's set to premiere in June, and HBO is ramping up its marketing with a rather clever twist: not one official trailer, but two, each presenting the perspective of one side in the bloody conflict. And we get to choose which trailer we'd like to view—although if you're like us, you'll elect to watch both.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first season below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tensions-rise-between-targaryens-in-first-teaser-for-house-of-the-dragon-s2/">I've written</a> previously, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-house-of-the-dragon-prequel-series-makes-a-solid-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYsYeoAxKH8LCwgEAAAOR" data-ml-id="1" data-ml="true" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1711040987089hch" data-uri="08a1f7819cdb947f66dcaf9832209e9b" data-xid="fr1711040987089hch">HBO's <em>House of the Dragon</em></a> debuted in 2022 with a solid, promising pilot episode, and the remainder of the season lived up to that initial promise. The series is set nearly 200 years before the events of <em>Game of Thrones </em>and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen's reign. The primary source material is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-uri="1e4524e735173b30ff50f2f666a28acc"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a>, a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011934#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011934&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last summer, AMD debuted the latest version of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/amds-fps-doubling-fsr-3-is-coming-soon-and-not-just-to-radeon-graphics-cards/">FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling technology</a>. While version 2.x focused mostly on making lower-resolution images look better at higher resolutions, version 3.0 focused on AMD's "Fluid Motion Frames," which attempt to boost FPS by generating interpolated frames to insert between the ones that your GPU is actually rendering.</p>
<p>Today, the company is <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/amd-fsr-3-1-announced-at-gdc-2024-fsr-3-available-and-upcoming/ba-p/674027">announcing FSR 3.1</a>, which among other improvements decouples the upscaling improvements in FSR 3.x from the Fluid Motion Frames feature. FSR 3.1 will be available "later this year" in games whose developers choose to implement it.</p>

<p>Fluid Motion Frames and Nvidia's equivalent DLSS Frame Generation usually work best when a game is already running at a high frame rate, and even then can be more prone to mistakes and odd visual artifacts than regular FSR or DLSS upscaling. FSR 3.0 was an all-or-nothing proposition, but version 3.1 should let you pick and choose what features you want to enable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011893#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011893&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Scientists are keen to develop new materials for lightweight, flexible, and affordable wearable electronics so that, one day, dropping our smartphones won't result in irreparable damage. One team at the University of California, Merced, has made conductive polymer films that actually toughen up in response to impact rather than breaking apart, much like mixing corn starch and water in appropriate amounts produces a slurry that is liquid when stirred slowly but hardens when you punch it (i.e., "oobleck"). They described their work in a talk at this week's meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans.</p>
<div>
<p>"Polymer-based electronics are very promising," said Di Wu, a postdoc in materials science at UCM. "We want to make the polymer electronics lighter, cheaper, and smarter. [With our] system, [the polymers] can become tougher and stronger when you make a sudden movement, but... flexible when you just do your daily, routine movement. They are not constantly rigid or constantly flexible. They just respond to your body movement."</p>
</div>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/unlocking-the-secrets-of-oobleck-strange-stuff-thats-both-liquid-and-solid/">we've previously reported</a>, oobleck is simple and easy to make. Mix one part water to two parts corn starch, add a dash of food coloring for fun, and you've got oobleck, which behaves as either a liquid or a solid, depending on how much stress is applied. Stir it slowly and steadily and it's a liquid. Punch it hard and it turns more solid under your fist. It's a classic example of a non-Newtonian fluid.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_fluid">an ideal fluid</a>, the viscosity largely depends on temperature and pressure: Water will continue to flow regardless of other forces acting upon it, such as being stirred or mixed. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the viscosity changes in response to an applied strain or shearing force, thereby straddling the boundary between liquid and solid behavior. Stirring a cup of water produces a shearing force, and the water shears to move out of the way. The viscosity remains unchanged. But for non-Newtonian fluids like oobleck, the viscosity changes when a shearing force is applied.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011450#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011450&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft is debuting major updates to two of its Surface PCs today: both the Surface Pro 10 and the 13.5- and 15-inch Surface Laptop 6 are major internal upgrades to Microsoft's mainstream Surface devices. Both were last updated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/review-surface-pro-9-makes-some-things-better-without-screwing-most-things-up/">nearly a year and a half ago</a>, and they're both getting new Intel chips with significantly faster integrated GPUs, upgraded webcams, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ai-comes-for-your-pcs-keyboard-as-microsoft-adds-dedicated-copilot-key/">the Copilot key</a>, and better battery life (according to Microsoft's spec sheets).</p>

<p>The catch is that both of these Surfaces are being sold exclusively to businesses and commercial customers; as of this writing, regular people will not be able to buy one directly from Microsoft, and they won't show up in most retail stores.</p>
<p>These aren't the first Surface products released exclusively for businesses. Microsoft introduced a new business-exclusive Surface Go 3 tablet last fall, and <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2021/01/11/introducing-surface-pro-7-for-business-purpose-built-to-empower-people-teams-and-classrooms-in-the-new-digital-age/">a Surface Pro 7+ variant</a> for businesses in early 2021. It is, however, the first time Microsoft has introduced new versions of its flagship tablet and laptop without also making them available to consumers. You can find some of these business-only PCs <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=Microsoft%20Surface%20Go%20For%20Business">for sale at some third-party retailers</a>, but usually with extended shipping times and higher prices than consumer systems.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011458#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011458&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, author David Brin announced that Vernor Vinge, sci-fi author, former professor, and father of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">technological singularity</a> concept, died from Parkinson's disease at age 79 on March 20, 2024, in La Jolla, California. The announcement came in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AUTHORDAVIDBRIN/posts/804165974862720">Facebook tribute</a> where Brin wrote about Vinge's deep love for science and writing.</p>
<p>"A titan in the literary genre that explores a limitless range of potential destinies, Vernor enthralled millions with tales of plausible tomorrows, made all the more vivid by his polymath masteries of language, drama, characters, and the implications of science," wrote Brin in his post.</p>

<p>As a sci-fi author, Vinge won Hugo Awards for his novels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep"><em>A Fire Upon the Deep</em></a> (1993), <em>A Deepness in the Sky</em> (2000), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End_(Vinge_novel)"><em>Rainbows End</em></a> (2007). He also won Hugos for novellas <em>Fast Times at Fairmont High</em> (2002) and <em>The Cookie Monster</em> (2004). As Mike Glyer's <a href="https://file770.com/vernor-vinge-1944-2024/">File 770 blog</a> notes, Vinge's novella <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Names"><em>True Names</em></a> (1981) is <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466893191/truenamesandtheopeningofthecyberspacefrontier">frequency cited</a> as the first presentation of an in-depth look at the concept of "cyberspace."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011838#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011838&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO—When thinking about what makes 2D Mario games special, <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> director Shiro Mouri recalled the excitement he felt playing the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, discovering things like the warp zone and hidden vine blocks for the first time. Across decades of 2D Mario games with similar designs, though, it has been harder and harder to make a game that feels like it's "full of secrets and mysteries," as he said during a Game Developers Conference presentation this week.</p>
<p>"At some point, all of this has become normal," Mouri said of once-fantastical Mario game elements like mushrooms and coin blocks that have now become staples of the games.</p>
<p>Recapturing a world full of "secrets and mysteries" was the guiding principle for the development of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, Mouri said, but it took a while to figure out the new perspective necessary to get to that point. When Mouri prototyped an item that warped Mario to a new location, for instance, producer Takashi Tezuka said the effect "isn't so different from how it's always been. What if we changed the environment instead?"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011859#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011859&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>X has locked and suspended the accounts of journalists and researchers who shared the alleged identity of a neo-Nazi cartoonist known as Stonetoss after the cartoonist appealed to site owner <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lawsuit-hate-speech-x/">Elon Musk</a>.</p>
<p>The incident, critics say, highlights once again how Musk has not only welcomed extremists onto his platform but has repeatedly boosted their conspiracies, engaged with their accounts, and seems to have protected them from scrutiny.</p>
<p>A lengthy X thread posted by the antifascist research group Anonymous Comrades Collective last week claimed that Stonetoss is a man named <a href="https://accollective.noblogs.org/post/2024/03/12/stonetoss-redpanels/">Hans Kristian Graebener</a> from Spring, Texas. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/stonetoss-doxxing">Stonetoss cartoons</a>, which feature simple and colorful imagery coupled with racist, homophobic, and antisemitic language, have become hugely popular among right-wing communities since they were first published at least seven years ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011854#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011854&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US Department of Justice sued Apple today, alleging that the company violated antitrust laws by restricting rivals' access to iPhone features and monopolizing the smartphone market.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.544402/gov.uscourts.njd.544402.1.0_3.pdf">lawsuit</a> in US District Court for the District of New Jersey alleged that "Apple suppresses... innovation through a web of contractual restrictions that it selectively enforces through its control of app distribution and its 'app review' process, as well as by denying access to key points of connection between apps and the iPhone's operating system (called Application Programming Interfaces or 'APIs'). Apple can enforce these restrictions due to its position as an intermediary between product creators such as developers on the one hand and users on the other."</p>
<p>The DOJ is seeking an order determining that Apple has illegally monopolized the smartphone market in the US. The agency also wants the requested order to block Apple from continuing its allegedly anticompetitive practices.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011858#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011858&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A newly discovered vulnerability baked into Apple’s M-series of chips allows attackers to extract secret keys from Macs when they perform widely used cryptographic operations, academic researchers have revealed in a paper published Thursday.</p>
<p>The flaw—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side channel</a> allowing end-to-end key extractions when Apple chips run implementations of widely used cryptographic protocols—can’t be patched directly because it stems from the microarchitectural design of the silicon itself. Instead, it can only be mitigated by building defenses into third-party cryptographic software that could drastically degrade M-series performance when executing cryptographic operations, particularly on the earlier M1 and M2 generations. The vulnerability can be exploited when the targeted cryptographic operation and the malicious application with normal user system privileges run on the same CPU cluster.</p>
<h2>Beware of hardware optimizations</h2>
<p>The threat resides in the chips’ data memory-dependent prefetcher, a hardware optimization that predicts the memory addresses of data that running code is likely to access in the near future. By loading the contents into the CPU cache before it’s actually needed, the DMP, as the feature is abbreviated, reduces latency between the main memory and the CPU, a common bottleneck in modern computing. DMPs are a relatively new phenomenon found only in M-series chips and Intel's 13th-generation Raptor Lake microarchitecture, although older forms of prefetchers have been common for years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011812#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011812&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday a crew of three people was due to launch on a Soyuz rocket, bound for the International Space Station.</p>
<p>However, the launch scrubbed at about 20 seconds before the planned liftoff time, just before the sequence to ignite the rocket's engines was initiated, due to unspecified issues. Shortly after the abort, there were <a href="https://twitter.com/katlinegrey/status/1770808586928591246">unconfirmed reports</a> of an issue with the ground systems supporting the Soyuz rocket.</p>
<p>The three people inside the Soyuz spacecraft, on top of the rocket, were NASA astronaut Tracy C. Dyson, Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy, and spaceflight participant Marina Vasilevskaya of Belarus. This Soyuz MS-25 mission had been planned for liftoff from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 13:21 UTC (6:21 pm local time in Baikonur).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011840#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011840&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CASCAIS, Portugal—BMW is one of the more advanced automakers when it comes to electrification. Its current portfolio of electric vehicles includes the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/forget-the-looks-love-the-tech-the-83200-bmw-ix-electric-suv/">iX</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/testing-bmws-biggest-and-best-sedan-now-fully-electric-the-2023-i7/">i7</a>, both of which have the edge on the competition in their respective classes—not bad for cars that use an underlying architecture that was designed to be powertrain-agnostic. Engineers back at the corporate base in Munich have been hard at work on its next platform, though, which will be just for battery EVs and will debut with next year's Neue Klasse.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/bmws-neue-klasse-points-to-a-radical-reinvention-for-future-sedans/">we saw a preview</a> of what the Neue Klasse sedan should look like when it goes on sale in 2025. Now, we've seen the Vision Neue Klasse X, which will morph next year into BMW's next electric crossover, probably with the iX3 nameplate. It will be an important car for the German automaker; crossovers and SUVs fail to get any less popular with the car-buying public, and demand for the production version of the Neue Klasse X will surely outstrip that of the four-door car.</p>
<p>BMW would prefer to call its X cars "Sports Activity Vehicles" rather than SUVs or crossovers and argues that it invented the breed with the original X5. That car was a handsome machine, and the Neue Klasse X keeps those classic two-box proportions and adorns them with bold angular creases that emphasize the wheel arches and create some negative space lower down the car's side that has the effect of reducing its visual bulk.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011748#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011748&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Antibodies are incredibly useful. Lots of recently developed drugs rely on antibodies that bind to and block the activity of specific proteins. They're also great research tools, allowing us to identify proteins within cells, purify both proteins and cells, and so on. Therapeutic antibodies have provided our first defenses against emerging viruses like Ebola and SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>But making antibodies can be a serious pain, because it involves getting animals to make antibodies for us. You need to purify the protein you want the antibodies to stick to, inject it into an animal, and get the animal to produce antibodies as part of an immune response. From there, you either purify the antibodies or purify the cells that produce them. It's time-consuming, doesn't always work, and sometimes produces antibodies with properties that you're not looking for.</p>
<p>But thanks to developments in AI-based protein predictions, all that hassle might become unnecessary. A recently developed diffusion model for protein structures has been adapted to antibody production and has successfully designed antibodies against flu virus proteins.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011766#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011766&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
