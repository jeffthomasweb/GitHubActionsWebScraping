                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Vinay Prasad—the Food and Drug Administration’s chief medical and scientific officer and its top vaccine regulator—emailed <a href="https://www.biocentury.com/article/657740">a stunning memo</a> to staff that quickly leaked to the press. Without evidence, Prasad claimed COVID-19 vaccines have killed 10 children in the US, and, as such, he announced unilateral, sweeping changes to the way the agency regulates and approves vaccines, including seasonal flu shots.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, a dozen former FDA commissioners, who collectively oversaw the agency for more than 35 years, responded to the memo with <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2517497?query=featured_home">a scathing rebuke</a>. Uniting to publish their response in the New England Journal of Medicine, the former commissioners said they were “deeply concerned” by Prasad’s memo, which they framed as a “threat” to the FDA’s work and a danger to Americans’ health.</p>
<p>In his memo, Prasad called for abandoning the FDA’s current framework for updating seasonal flu shots and other vaccines, such as those for COVID-19. Those updates currently involve studies that measure well-characterized immune responses (called immunobridging studies). Prasad dismissed this approach as insufficient and, instead, plans to require expensive randomized trials, which can take months to years for each vaccine update.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/12-former-fda-chiefs-unite-to-say-agency-memo-on-vaccines-is-deeply-stupid/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Security defenders are girding themselves in response to the disclosure of a maximum-severity vulnerability disclosed Wednesday in React Server, an open-source package that’s widely used by websites and in cloud environments.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is easy to exploit and allows hackers to execute malicious code on servers that run it. Exploit code is now <a href="https://github.com/ejpir/CVE-2025-55182-poc/tree/main">publicly available</a>.</p>
<p>React is embedded into web apps running on servers so that remote devices render JavaScript and content more quickly and with fewer resources required. React is used by an estimated <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/critical-vulnerability-in-react-cve-2025-55182">6 percent</a> of all websites and 39 percent of cloud environments. When end users reload a page, React allows servers to re-render only parts that have changed, a feature that drastically speeds up performance and lowers the computing resources required by the server.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/12/admins-and-defenders-gird-themselves-against-maximum-severity-server-vulnerability/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[The first of BMW's clean-sheet "Neue Klasse" EVs hits it out of the park.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">BMW provided flights from Washington, DC, to Malaga, Spain, and accommodation so Ars could drive the iX3. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>The new BMW iX3 is an important car for the automaker. It’s the first of a new series of vehicles that BMW is calling the Neue Klasse, calling back to a range of cars that helped define the brand in the 1960s. Then, as now, propulsion is provided by the best powertrain BMW’s engineers could design and build, wrapped in styling that heralds the company’s new look. Except now, that powertrain is fully electric, and the cabin features technology that would have been scarcely believable to the driver of a new 1962 BMW 1500.</p>
<p>In fact, the iX3 is only half the story when it comes to BMW’s neue look for the Neue Klasse—there’s an all-electric 3 series sedan on the way, too. The sedan will surely appeal to enthusiasts, particularly the version that the M tuning arm has worked its magic upon, but you’ll have to wait until early 2026 to read about that stuff. Which makes sense: crossovers and SUVs—or “sports activity vehicles” in BMW-speak—are what the market wants these days, so that’s what comes first.</p>
<h2>The technical stuff</h2>
<p>As we learned <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/how-bmw-slashed-the-carbon-footprint-of-its-next-ev-the-2026-ix3/">earlier this summer</a>, BMW leaned heavily into sustainability when it designed the iX3. There’s extensive use of recycled battery minerals, interior plastics, and aluminum, and the automaker has gone for a monomaterial approach where possible to make recycling the car a lot easier. There’s also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/neue-klasse-bmws-tech-filled-ix3-electric-suv-is-unveiled/">an all-new EV powertrain</a>, BMW’s sixth-generation. When it goes on sale here next summer, the launch model will be the iX3 50 xDrive, which pairs an asynchronous motor at the front axle and an electrically excited synchronous motor at the rear for a combined output of 463 hp (345 kW) and 475 lb-ft (645 Nm).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/great-handling-advanced-ev-tech-we-drive-the-2026-bmw-ix3/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Donald Trump-backed push has failed to wedge a federal measure that would block states from passing AI laws for a decade into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told reporters Tuesday that a sect of Republicans is now “looking at other places” to potentially pass the measure. Other Republicans opposed including the AI preemption in the defense bill, The Hill <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5630709-ai-preemption-republican-leaders/">reported</a>, joining critics who see value in allowing states to quickly regulate AI risks as they arise.</p>
<p>For months, Trump has pressured the Republican-led Congress to block state AI laws that the president claims could bog down innovation as AI firms waste time and resources complying with a patchwork of state laws. But Republicans have continually failed to unite behind Trump’s command, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/ted-cruz-gives-up-on-ai-law-moratorium-joins-99-1-vote-against-his-own-plan/">first voting against </a>including a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">similar measure in the “Big Beautiful” budget bill</a> and then this week failing to negotiate a solution to pass the NDAA measure.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/republicans-once-again-thwart-trumps-push-to-block-state-ai-laws/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The fossil and genetic evidence agree that modern humans originated in Africa. The most genetically diverse human populations—the groups that have had the longest time to pick up novel mutations—live there today. But the history of what went on within Africa between our origins and the present day is a bit murky.</p>
<p>That’s partly because DNA doesn’t survive long in the conditions typical of most of the continent, which has largely limited us to trying to reconstruct the past using data from present-day populations. The other part is that many of those present-day populations have been impacted by the vast genetic churn <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/05/how-the-bantu-people-surged-across-two-thirds-of-africa/">caused by the Bantu expansion</a>, which left its traces across most of the populations south of the Sahara.</p>
<p>But a new study has managed to extract genomes from ancient samples in southern Africa. While all of these are relatively recent, dating from after the end of the most recent glacial period, they reveal a distinct southern African population that was relatively large, outside of the range of previously described human variation, and it remained isolated until only about 1,000 years ago.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/ancient-genomes-from-southern-africa-reveal-distinct-human-lineage/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Micron Technology <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">announced</a> it will exit the consumer RAM business in 2026, ending 29 years of selling RAM and SSDs to PC builders and enthusiasts under the Crucial brand. The company cited heavy demand from AI data centers as the reason for abandoning its consumer brand, a move that will remove one of the most recognizable names in the do-it-yourself PC upgrade market.</p>
<p>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,” Sumit Sadana, EVP and chief business officer at Micron Technology, said in a statement. “Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.”</p>
<p>Micron said it will continue shipping Crucial consumer products through the end of its fiscal second quarter in February 2026 and will honor warranties on existing products. The company will continue selling Micron-branded enterprise products to commercial customers and plans to redeploy affected employees to other positions within the company.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/after-nearly-30-years-crucial-will-stop-selling-ram-to-consumers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Sony Pictures has dropped a new trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later:_The_Bone_Temple"><em>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple</em></a>, slated for release early next year and directed by Nia DaCosta, teasing a possible cure for the zombie outbreak that has devastated human populations for three decades. It’s the sequel to this year’s critically acclaimed <em>28 Years Later</em>, the third film in a franchise credited with sparking the 21st-century revival of the zombie genre.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the first three films below.)</strong></p>
<p>As previously reported, in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later">28 Days Later</a>,</em> a highly contagious “Rage Virus” was accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turned into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attacked the uninfected—so-called “fast zombies”—and the virus spread rapidly, effectively collapsing society. The sequel, <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, featured a new cast of characters living on the outskirts of London. But all it takes is one careless person getting infected for the virus to spread uncontrollably again. So naturally, that’s what happened.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/new-28-years-later-bone-temple-trailer-teases-a-cure/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Gas and electric utility Eversource Energy completed the first phase of its geothermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04062024/massachusetts-geothermal-heating-cooling-system/">in 2024</a>. Eversource is a co-recipient of the award along with the city of Framingham and HEET, a Boston-based nonprofit that focuses on geothermal energy and is the lead recipient of the funding.</p>
<p>Geothermal networks are widely considered among the most energy-efficient ways to heat and cool buildings. The federal money will allow Eversource to add approximately 140 new customers to the Framingham network and fund research to monitor the system’s performance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/rare-win-for-renewable-energy-trump-admin-funds-geothermal-network-expansion/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has lowered sales growth targets for its AI agent products after many salespeople missed their quotas in the fiscal year ending in June, according to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-lowers-ai-software-sales-quotas-customers-resist-newer-products">report</a> Wednesday from The Information. The adjustment is reportedly unusual for Microsoft, and it comes after the company missed a number of ambitious sales goals for its AI offerings.</p>
<p>AI agents are specialized implementations of AI language models designed to perform multistep tasks autonomously rather than simply responding to single prompts. So-called “agentic” features have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsofts-vision-for-ai-pcs-looks-a-lot-like-another-crack-at-cortana/">central</a> to Microsoft’s 2025 sales pitch: At its Build conference in May, the company <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/05/19/microsoft-build-2025-the-age-of-ai-agents-and-building-the-open-agentic-web/">declared</a> that it has entered “the era of AI agents.”</p>
<p>The company has promised customers that agents could automate complex tasks, such as generating dashboards from sales data or writing customer reports. At its Ignite conference in November, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-ignite-2025-copilot-and-agents-built-to-power-the-frontier-firm/">announced</a> new features like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot, along with tools for building and deploying agents through Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio. But as the year draws to a close, that promise has proven harder to deliver than the company expected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/microsoft-slashes-ai-sales-growth-targets-as-customers-resist-unproven-agents/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amazon Prime Video has scaled back an experiment that created laughable anime dubs with generative AI.</p>
<p>In March, Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-ai-dubbing-english-spanish?tag=futurism0b-20&amp;asc_source=browser&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffuturism.com%2Famazon-deploying-ai-dubs-movies&amp;ascsubtag=0000FUT00003452961057103602025120310312">announced</a> that its streaming service would start including “AI-aided dubbing on licensed movies and series that would not have been dubbed otherwise.” In late November, some AI-generated English and Spanish dubs of anime popped up, including dubs for the <em>Banana Fish</em> series and the movie <em>No Game No Life: Zero</em>. The dubs appear to be part of a beta launch, and users have been able to select “English (AI beta)” or “Spanish (AI beta)” as an audio language option in supported titles.</p>
<h2>“Absolutely disrespectful”</h2>
<p>Not everyone likes dubbed content. Some people insist on watching movies and shows in their original language to experience the media more authentically, with the passion and talent of the original actors. But you don’t need to be against dubs to see what’s wrong with the ones Prime Video tested.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/prime-video-pulls-eerily-emotionless-ai-generated-anime-dubs-after-complaints/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T told the Federal Communications Commission that it has eliminated DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policies and programs, complying with demands from Chairman Brendan Carr.</p>
<p>The FCC boss has refused to approve mergers and other large transactions involving companies that don’t agree to drop support for DEI. On Monday, AT&amp;T filed a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1201120484909/1">letter</a> disowning its former DEI initiatives in the FCC docket for its $1 billion <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-25-276A1.pdf">purchase</a> of US Cellular spectrum licenses.</p>
<p>“We have closely followed the recent Executive Orders, Supreme Court rulings, and guidance issued by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and have adjusted our employment and business practices to ensure that they comply with all applicable laws and related requirements, including ending DEI-related policies as described below, not just in name but in substance,” AT&amp;T’s letter to Carr said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/fcc-boss-brendan-carr-claims-another-victory-over-dei-as-att-drops-programs/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>LandSpace, a decade-old company based in Beijing, launched its new Zhuque-3 rocket for the first time at 11 pm EST Tuesday (04:0 UTC Wednesday), or noon local time at the Jiuquan launch site in northwestern China.</p>
<p>Powered by nine methane-fueled engines, the Zhuque-3 (Vermillion Bird-3) rocket climbed away from its launch pad with more than 1.7 million pounds of thrust. The 216-foot-tall (66-meter) launcher headed southeast, soaring through clear skies before releasing its first stage booster about two minutes into the flight.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/a-little-known-chinese-company-nearly-landed-a-rocket-from-space-on-its-first-try/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A sprawling infrastructure that has been bilking unsuspecting people through fraudulent gambling websites for 14 years is likely a dual operation run by a nation-state-sponsored group that is targeting government and private-industry organizations in the US and Europe, researchers said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Researchers have previously tracked smaller pieces of the enormous infrastructure. Last month, security firm Sucuri <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2025/11/slot-gacor-the-rise-of-online-casino-spam.html">reported</a> that the operation seeks out and compromises poorly configured websites running the WordPress CMS. Imperva in January <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/how-hackers-use-php-backdoors-and-gsocket-to-facilitate-illegal-gambling-in-indonesia/">said</a> the attackers also scan for and exploit web apps built with the PHP programming language that have existing webshells or vulnerabilities. Once the weaknesses are exploited, the attackers install a GSocket, a backdoor that the attackers use to compromise servers and host gambling web content on them.</p>
<p>All of the gambling sites target Indonesian-speaking visitors. Because Indonesian law prohibits gambling, many people in that country are drawn to illicit services. Most of the 236,433 attacker-owned domains hosting the gambling sites are hosted on Cloudflare. Most of the 1,481 hijacked subdomains were hosted on Amazon Web Services, Azure, and GitHub.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/12/fraudulent-gambling-network-may-be-a-nation-state-spying-operation/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>One of big surprise hits of 2019 was the delightful horror comedy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/review-pitch-perfect-ready-or-not-is-a-sharp-and-witty-blood-soaked-delight/"><em>Ready or Not</em></a>, in which Samara Weaving’s blushing bride must play a deadly game of Hide and Seek on her wedding night. Searchlight Pictures just released the trailer for its sequel: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_or_Not_2:_Here_I_Come"><em>Ready or Not 2: Here I Come</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Ready or Not</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Ready or Not</em>, Grace (Weaving) falls in love with Alex Le Domas (Mark O’Brien), a member of a wealthy gaming dynasty. After a picture-perfect wedding on the family estate, Alex informs Grace that there’s just one more formality to be observed: At midnight, she has to draw a card from a mysterious box and play whatever game is named there.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/samara-weaving-levels-up-in-ready-or-not-2-here-i-come-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, three NASA astronomers released an analysis showing that several planned orbital telescopes would see their images criss-crossed by planned satellite constellations, such as a fully expanded Starlink and its competitors. While the impact of these constellations on ground-based has been widely considered, orbital hardware was thought to be relatively immune from their interference. But the planned expansion of constellations, coupled with some of the features of upcoming missions, will mean that at least one proposed observatory will see an average of nearly 100 satellite tracks in every exposure.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, some of the planned measures meant to minimize the impact on ground-based telescopes will make things worse for those in orbit.</p>
<h2>Constellations vs. astronomy</h2>
<p>Satellite constellations are a relatively new threat to astronomy; prior to the drop in launch costs driven by SpaceX’s reusable rockets, the largest constellations in orbit consisted of a few dozen satellites. But the rapid growth of the Starlink system caused problems for ground-based astronomy that are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/spacex-satellites-effect-on-night-sky-cant-be-eliminated-astronomers-say/">not easy to solve</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/planned-satellite-constellations-may-swamp-future-orbiting-telescopes/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s an incredible time to be a guitarist who <em>doesn’t</em> want to own a bunch of $2,000 amps and an expensive pedalboard of gear. Amp and pedal simulators, which have been around for decades, have in the last few years finally come into their own as nearly indistinguishable sonic replacements. Even John Mayer is now <a href="https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/guitarists/john-mayer-neural-dsp-quad-cortex-coachella-2025">willing to ditch his beloved tube amps for digital models</a>.</p>
<p>I certainly don’t have Mayer’s chops or gear budget, but I do love messing with this sort of tech and have purchased everything from <a href="https://neuraldsp.com">NeuralDSP</a>‘s Archetypes series to <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitube5/?pkey=amplitube-5-max-v2">Amplitube</a> and <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/shop/guitar-rig-7-pro/">Guitar Rig</a>. Last week, as part of an early Black Friday sale, I picked up two amp/effects suites from British developer Polychrome DSP—<a href="https://www.polychromedsp.com/nunchuck/">Nunchuck</a> (Marshall amps) and <a href="https://www.polychromedsp.com/lumos/">Lumos</a> (clean through mid-gain tones). They are both excellent.</p>
<p>Any reasonable person should be satisfied with this tech stack, which models gear that collectively costs as much as my house. After my Polychrome DSP purchases, I reminded myself that I am a reasonable person, and that I could therefore ignore any further amp sims that might tempt my wandering eye.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/guitar-amp-sims-have-gotten-astonishingly-good/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The top drug regulator at the Food and Drug Administration, Richard Pazdur, has decided to retire from the agency just three weeks after taking the leading position, according to multiple media outlets.</p>
<p>Pazdur, an oncologist who has worked at the FDA since 1999, was seen as a stabilizing force for an agency that has been mired in turmoil during the second Trump administration. He took over the role of leading the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research on November 11, after the previous leader, George Tidmarsh, left the agency amid an investigation and a lawsuit regarding allegations that he used his position to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/fda-described-as-clown-show-amid-latest-scandal-top-drug-regulator-is-out/">exact petty revenge</a> on a former business partner. In light of the scandal, one venture capital investor called the agency a “<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/04/fda-in-disarray-expert-analysis-george-tidmarsh-scandal/">clown show</a>.” Drug industry groups, meanwhile, called the FDA <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/21/fda-regulator-richard-pazdur-concerns/">erratic and unpredictable</a>.</p>
<p>Pazdur’s selection was seen as a positive sign by agency insiders, drug industry representatives, and patient advocacy groups, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/02/rick-pazdur-fda-resigns/">according to reporting by The Washington Post</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/more-fda-drama-top-drug-regulator-calls-it-quits-after-3-weeks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There’s a race in China among several companies vying to become the next to launch and land an orbital-class rocket, and the starting gun could go off as soon as tonight.</p>
<p>LandSpace, one of several maturing Chinese rocket startups, is about to launch the first flight of its medium-lift Zhuque-3 rocket. Liftoff could happen around 11 pm EST tonight (04:00 UTC Wednesday), or noon local time at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China.</p>
<p>Airspace warning notices advising pilots to steer clear of the rocket’s flight path suggest LandSpace has a launch window of about two hours. When it lifts off, the Zhuque-3 (Vermillion Bird-3) rocket will become the largest commercial launch vehicle ever flown in China. What’s more, LandSpace will become the first Chinese launch provider to attempt a landing of its first stage booster, using the same tried-and-true return method pioneered by SpaceX and, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/blue-origin-caps-second-heavy-lift-launch-with-first-offshore-landing/">more recently, Blue Origin</a> in the United States.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/this-chinese-company-could-become-the-countrys-first-to-land-a-reusable-rocket/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The shoe is most certainly on the other foot. On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” at the company to improve ChatGPT, delaying advertising plans and other products in the process,  The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-declares-code-red-combat-threats-chatgpt-delays-ads-effort">reported</a> based on a leaked internal memo. The move follows Google’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/">release</a> of its Gemini 3 model last month, which has outperformed ChatGPT on some industry benchmark tests and sparked high-profile praise on social media.</p>
<p>In the memo, Altman wrote, “We are at a critical time for ChatGPT.” The company will push back work on advertising integration, AI agents for health and shopping, and a personal assistant feature called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/chatgpt-pulse-delivers-morning-updates-based-on-your-chat-history/">Pulse</a>. Altman encouraged temporary team transfers and established daily calls for employees responsible for enhancing the chatbot.</p>
<p>The directive creates an odd symmetry with events from December 2022, when Google management <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/fearing-chatgpt-google-enlists-founders-brin-and-page-in-ai-fight/">declared</a> its own “code red” internal emergency after ChatGPT <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/">launched</a> and rapidly gained in popularity. At the time, Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-management-issues-code-red-over-chatgpt-report-2022-12">reassigned</a> teams across the company to develop AI prototypes and products to compete with OpenAI’s chatbot. Now, three years later, the AI industry is in a very different place.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/openai-ceo-declares-code-red-as-gemini-gains-200-million-users-in-3-months/">Read full article</a></p>
