            <![CDATA[Now is the time to check out this free total conversion of <em>Fallout 4</em>.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It took a crew of more than 100 talented modders and another hundred voice actors nearly five years to make <a href="https://fallout4london.com/"><em>Fallout: London</em></a>. Just as they planned to release it, Bethesda <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/fallout-london-devs-will-downgrade-fallout-4-to-save-their-massive-mod/">came out with a "next-gen upgrade" of the mod's base game</a>, <em>Fallout 4</em>, forcing the team to scramble and ultimately find a way to downgrade the game. When they finally released <em>London</em>, they then dealt with game-stopping bugs and quality issues that their small QA team could not have caught. It's been a long, maybe even post-apocalyptic road for these modders.</p>
<p>A few updates later, <em>Fallout: London</em> is in much better shape. I've been able to put about 12 hours into it, and that, in itself, is essentially my review: it is worth that kind of time and more. If you can still enjoy <em>Fallout 4</em>, of course.</p>
<p>Any Fallout fan waits a long time between official releases, so it can be tempting to go easy on any new offering, however spit-and-bailing-wire it may seem. But <em>Fallout: London </em>is a game in its own right, with a distinct look, vision, and stories to tell. You can find evidence of its unofficial mod-ness if you look around, but you're better off doing the <em>Fallout</em> thing: wandering, wondering, fighting, and occasionally talking to some messed-up weirdo.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/fallout-london-is-a-huge-fallout-4-mod-that-is-now-playable-and-worth-playing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.17 of the Rocket Report! Next week marks 10 years since one of the more spectacular launch failures of this century. On October 28, 2014, an Antares rocket, then operated by Orbital Sciences, suffered an engine failure six seconds after liftoff from Virginia and crashed back onto the pad in a fiery twilight explosion. I was there and won't forget seeing the rocket falter just above the pad, being shaken by the deafening blast, and then running for cover. The Antares rocket is often an afterthought in the space industry, but it has an interesting backstory touching on international geopolitics, space history, and novel engineering. Now, Northrop Grumman and Firefly Aerospace are developing a new version of Antares.</p>

<p><b>Astra gets a lifeline from DOD. </b>Astra, the launch startup that was taken private again earlier this year for a sliver of its former value, has landed a new contract with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to support the development of a next-gen launch system for time-sensitive space missions, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/embattled-astra-scores-dod-contract-to-develop-point-to-point-cargo-delivery-from-space/">TechCrunch reports</a>. The contract, which the DIU awarded under its Novel Responsive Space Delivery (NRSD) program, has a maximum value of $44 million.

            <![CDATA[When your old PC goes over the Windows 10 update cliff, can Windows 11 save it?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The Windows 10 update cliff is coming in October 2025. We've explained why that's a big deal, and we have a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-whether-your-pc-is-supported-or-not/">comprehensive guide to updating to Windows 11</a> (recently updated to account for changes in Windows 11 24H2) so you can keep getting security updates, whether you're on an officially supported PC or not.</p>
<p>But this is more than just a theoretical exercise; I've been using Windows 11 on some kind of "unsupported" system practically since it launched to stay abreast of what the experience is actually like and to keep tabs on whether Microsoft would make good on its threats to pull support from these systems at any time.</p>
<p>Now that we're three years in, and since I've been using Windows 11 24H2 on a 2012-era desktop and laptop as my primary work machines on and off for a few months now, I can paint a pretty complete picture of what Windows 11 is like on these PCs. As the Windows 10 update cliff approaches, it's worth asking: Is running "unsupported" Windows 11 a good way to keep an older but still functional machine running, especially for non-technical users?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/what-i-learned-from-3-years-of-running-windows-11-on-unsupported-pcs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">An unprecedented <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/650828/americans-agree-nation-divided-key-values.aspx">80 percent</a> of Americans, according to a recent Gallup poll, think the country is deeply divided over its most important values ahead of the November elections. The general public’s polarization now encompasses issues like immigration, health care, identity politics, transgender rights, or whether we should support Ukraine. Fly across the Atlantic and you’ll see the same thing happening in the European Union and the UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To try to reverse this trend, Google’s DeepMind built an AI system designed to aid people in resolving conflicts. It’s called the Habermas Machine after Jürgen Habermas, a German philosopher who argued that an agreement in a public sphere can always be reached when rational people engage in discussions as equals, with mutual respect and perfect communication.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But is DeepMind’s Nobel Prize-winning ingenuity really enough to solve our political conflicts the same way they solved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/deepmind-ai-needs-mere-4-hours-of-self-training-to-become-a-chess-overlord/">chess</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/leveling-up-deepminds-alphastar-achieves-grandmaster-level-in-starcraft-ii/"><em>StarCraft</em></a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/protein-structure-and-design-software-gets-the-chemistry-nobel/">predicting protein structures</a>?

<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn.—Today, the reborn Scout Motors showed off a pair of new electric vehicles that revives the long-dormant maker of trucks and SUVs. Originally owned by International Harvester, Scout now belongs to Volkswagen Group, which decided to use it to create a new American-made brand for off-road-capable vehicles.</p>

<p>The first of these will be the Traveler SUV and Terra pickup truck, due to go into production in 2027. Despite VW's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/vw-invests-5b-into-rivian-signaling-deep-tech-ties-and-collaborations/">recent investment</a> in Rivian, these are all-new, clean-sheet designs with a platform unique to Scout designed in Michigan, a platform that uses a body-on-frame construction with either purely electric or range-extended powertrains.</p>
<p>Scout says that pricing for the Terra and Traveler should start at "under $60,000," or "as low as $50,000 with available incentives" for the entry-level models, which are due to go into production at a new factory north of Columbia, South Carolina, in 2027.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/scout-motors-new-pickup-and-suv-evs-will-start-at-under-60000/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, it's worth noting when something goes unsaid.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, participated in his first quarterly conference call with investment analysts. Under fire from labor groups and regulators, Boeing logged a nearly $6.2 billion loss for the last three months, while the new boss pledged a turnaround for the troubled aerospace company.</p>
<p>What Ortberg didn't mention in the call was the Starliner program.

              <![CDATA[<p>The third and final season of <em>Good Omens</em>, Prime Video's fantasy series adapted from the classic 1990 novel by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, will not be a full season after all, Deadline Hollywood <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/good-omens-to-end-90-minute-episode-neil-gaiman-exits-1236157372/">reports</a>. In the wake of allegations of sexual assault against Gaiman this summer, the streaming platform has decided that rather than a full slate of episodes, the series finale will be a single 90-minute episode—the equivalent of a TV movie.</p>
<p><strong>(Major spoilers for the S2 finale of <em>Good Omens</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/06/jon-hamm-is-an-amnesiac-archangel-lost-in-soho-in-good-omens-s2-trailer/">reported previously</a>, the series is based on the original 1990 novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman" data-uri="4a3305e5b4ea72c7125946ccdf6e63aa">Gaiman</a> and the <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/terry-pratchett-docudrama-back-in-black-is-beautiful-an-1792358351" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://io9.gizmodo.com/terry-pratchett-docudrama-back-in-black-is-beautiful-an-1792358351" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1729791597234ead" data-uri="c24988766a955798085d8b4cfbe5dfb8" data-xid="fr1729791597234ead">late Pratchett</a>. <em>Good Omens</em> is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/all-hell-is-breaking-loose-in-first-trailer-for-much-anticipated-good-omens/" data-uri="8a76c6960b8232997dd00f9cb56a8bdb">the story of</a> an angel, Aziraphale (Michael Sheen), and a demon, Crowley (David Tennant), who gradually become friends over the millennia and team up to avert Armageddon. Gaiman's obvious deep-down, fierce love for this project—and the powerful chemistry between its stars—made the first season <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/review-neil-gaimans-tv-adaptation-of-good-omens-is-glorious-good-fun/">a sheer joy</a> to watch. Apart from a few minor quibbles, it was pretty much everything book fans could have hoped for in a TV adaptation of <em>Good Omens</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/good-omens-will-wrap-with-a-single-90-minute-episode/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the United Nations' Environmental Programme (UNEP) <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2024">released a report</a> on what it terms the "emissions gap"—the difference between where we're heading and where we'd need to be to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. It makes for some pretty grim reading. Given last year's greenhouse gas emissions, we can afford fewer than four similar years before we would exceed the total emissions compatible with limiting the planet's warming to 1.5° C above pre-industrial conditions. Following existing policies out to the turn of the century would leave us facing over 3° C of warming.</p>
<p>The report ascribes this situation to two distinct emissions gaps: between the goals of the Paris Agreement and what countries have pledged to do and between their pledges and the policies they've actually put in place. There are some reasons to think that rapid progress could be made—the six largest greenhouse gas emitters accounted for nearly two-thirds of the global emissions, so it wouldn't take many policy changes to make a big difference. And the report suggests increased deployment of wind and solar could handle over a quarter of the needed emissions reductions.</p>
<p>But so far, progress has been far too limited to cut into global emissions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/with-four-more-years-like-2023-carbon-emissions-will-blow-past-1-5-limit/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As H5N1 bird flu continues to spread wildly among California dairy herds and farmworkers, federal health officials on Thursday offered some relatively good news about Missouri: The wily avian influenza virus does not appear to have spread from the state's sole human case, which otherwise remains a mystery.</p>
<p>On September 6, the Missouri Health department announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/missouri-reports-human-h5-type-bird-flu-case-with-no-link-to-animals/">a person with underlying health conditions tested positive for bird flu</a>, and later testing indicated that it was an H5N1 strain related to the one currently circulating among US dairy cows. But, state and federal health officials were—and still are—stumped as to how that person became infected. The person had no known contact with infected animals and no contact with any obviously suspect animal products. No dairy herds in Missouri have tested positive, and no poultry farms had reported recent outbreaks, either. To date, all other human cases of H5N1 have been among farmworkers who had contact with H5N1-infected animals.</p>
<p>But aside from the puzzle, attention turned to the possibility that the unexplained Missouri case had passed on the infection to those around them. A household contact had symptoms at the same time as the person—aka the index case—and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/more-unidentified-illnesses-linked-to-unexplained-bird-flu-case-in-missouri/">at least six health care workers developed illnesses after interacting with the person</a>. One of the six had tested negative for bird flu around the time of their illness, but questions remained about the other five.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/bird-flu-hit-a-dead-end-in-missouri-but-its-running-rampant-in-california/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple has released new iPhones, new Apple Watches, a new iPad mini, and a flotilla of software updates this fall, but Mac hardware has gone unmentioned so far. That's set to change next week, according to <a href="https://x.com/gregjoz">an uncharacteristically un-cryptic post</a> from Apple Worldwide Marketing SVP Greg Joswiak earlier today.</p>
<p>Imploring readers to "Mac [sic] their calendars," Joswiak's post teases "an exciting week of announcements ahead, starting on Monday morning." If the wordplay wasn't enough, an attached teaser video with a winking neon Mac logo drives the point home.</p>
<p>Though Joswiak's post was light on additional details, months of reliable rumors have told us the most likely things to expect: refreshed MacBook Pros and 24-inch iMacs with few if any external changes but new Apple M4-series chips on the inside, plus a new M4 Mac mini with a substantial design overhaul. The MacBook Pros and iMacs were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/new-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-add-m3-chips-plus-a-1599-entry-level-model/">refreshed with M3 chips</a> almost exactly a year ago, but the Mac mini was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/m2-pro-mac-mini-review-apples-goldilocks-desktop-for-semi-professionals/">last updated with the M2 in early 2023</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apple-teases-week-of-announcements-about-the-mac-starting-on-monday/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"Remove some entries due to various compliance requirements. They can come back in the future if sufficient documentation is provided."</p>
<p>That <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/2024101835-tiptop-blip-09ed@gregkh/">two-line comment</a>, submitted by major Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman, accompanied a patch that removed about a dozen names from the kernle's MAINTAINERS file. "Some entries" notably had either Russian names or .ru email addresses. "Various compliance requirements" was, in this case, sanctions against Russia and Russian companies, stemming from that country's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>This merge did not go unnoticed. Replies on the kernel mailing list asked about this "very vague" patch. Kernel developer James Bottomley <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/7ee74c1b5b589619a13c6318c9fbd0d6ac7c334a.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">wrote</a> that "we" (seemingly speaking for Linux maintainers) had "actual advice" from Linux Foundation counsel. Employees of companies on the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (<a href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/">OFAC SDN</a>), or connected to them, will have their collaborations "subject to restrictions," and "cannot be in the MAINTAINERS file." "Sufficient documentation" would mean evidence that someone does not work for an OFAC SDN entity, Bottomley wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/russian-coders-removed-from-linux-maintainers-list-due-to-sanction-concerns/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Cable companies, advertising firms, and newspapers are asking courts to block a federal "click-to-cancel" rule that would force businesses to make it easier for consumers to cancel services. Lawsuits were filed yesterday, about a week after the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/ftc-click-to-cancel-rule-seeks-to-end-free-trial-traps-sneaky-auto-enrollments/">approved a rule</a> that "<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p064202_negative_option_rule.pdf">requires</a> sellers to provide consumers with simple cancellation mechanisms to immediately halt all recurring charges."</p>
<p>Cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association and the Interactive Advertising Bureau trade group <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.221571/gov.uscourts.ca5.221571.1.2.pdf">sued the FTC</a> in the conservative US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. The lawsuit claims the 5th Circuit is a proper venue because a third plaintiff, the Electronic Security Association, has its principal offices in Dallas. That group represents security companies such as ADT.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca6.152956/gov.uscourts.ca6.152956.1.2.pdf">separate lawsuit</a> was filed against the FTC in the 6th Circuit appeals court by the Michigan Press Association and National Federation of Independent Business. The two lawsuits were apparently coordinated as they both complain about the rule with the following text:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/cable-companies-ask-5th-circuit-to-block-ftcs-click-to-cancel-rule/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Back in May, Google <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/watermarking-ai-generated-text-and-video-with-synthid/">augmented its Gemini AI model with SynthID</a>, a toolkit that embeds AI-generated content with watermarks it says are "imperceptible to humans" but can be easily and reliably detected via an algorithm. Today, Google <a href="https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/safeguards/synthid">took that SynthID system open source</a>, offering the same basic watermarking toolkit <a href="https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1849110263871529114">for free to developers and businesses</a>.</p>
<p>The move gives the entire AI industry an easy, seemingly robust way to silently mark content as artificially generated, which could be useful for detecting deepfakes and other damaging AI content before it goes out in the wild. But there are still some important limitations that may prevent AI watermarking from becoming a de facto standard across the AI industry any time soon.</p>
<h2>Spin the wheel of tokens</h2>
<p>Google uses a version of SynthID to watermark audio, video, and images generated by its multimodal AI systems, with differing techniques that are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9btDaOcfIMY">explained briefly in this video</a>. But in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08025-4">a new paper published in Nature</a>, Google researchers go into detail on how the SynthID process embeds an unseen watermark in the text-based output of its Gemini model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-offers-its-ai-watermarking-tech-as-free-open-source-toolkit/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the 1940s, scientists at the recently established National Cancer Institute were trying to breed mice that could inform our understanding of cancer, either because they predictably developed certain cancers or were surprisingly resistant.</p>
<p>The team spotted a peculiar litter in which some baby mice had short, kinked tails and misplaced ribs growing out of their neck bones. The strain of mice, nicknamed “tail short,” has been faithfully bred ever since, in the hope that one day, research might reveal what was the matter with them.</p>
<p>After more than 60 years, researchers finally got their answer, when Maria Barna, a developmental biologist then at the University of California San Francisco, found that the mice had a genetic mutation that caused a protein to disappear from their ribosomes—the places in cells where proteins are made.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/when-ribosomes-go-rogue/">Read full article</a></p>

<media:text>A ribosome in action. As messenger RNA passes through the ribosome (center left), other RNA molecules (bottom left) bring in amino acids that match the instructions in the mRNA. These amino acids are then joined together into a new protein (top right). But might these trusty little protein-making workhorses come in more than one flavor?</media:text></media:content>

<p>Reston, Virginia-located Babel Street is the little-known firm behind Location X, a service with the capability to track the locations of hundreds of millions of phone users over sustained periods of time. Ostensibly, Babel Street limits the use of the service to personnel and contractors of US government law enforcement agencies, including state entities. Despite the restriction, an individual working on behalf of a company that helps people remove their personal information from consumer data broker databases recently was able to obtain a two-week free trial by (truthfully) telling Babel Street he was considering performing contracting work for a government agency in the future.</p>
<h2>Tracking locations at scale</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity, one of five news outlets that obtained access to the data produced during the trial, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/the-global-surveillance-free-for-all-in-mobile-ad-data/">said</a> that one capability of Location X is the ability to draw a line between two states or other locations—or a shape around a building, street block, or entire city—and see a historical record of Internet-connected devices that traversed those boundaries.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/phone-tracking-tool-lets-government-agencies-follow-your-every-move/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SAN FRANCISCO—On Tuesday, <a href="https://tedai-sanfrancisco.ted.com/ai-conferences/">TED AI 2024</a> kicked off its first day at San Francisco's Herbst Theater with a lineup of speakers that tackled AI's impact on science, art, and society. The two-day event brought a mix of researchers, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and other experts who painted a complex picture of AI with fairly minimal hype.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The second annual conference, organized by Walter and Sam De Brouwer, marked a notable shift from last year's broad existential debates and proclamations of AI as being "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/ted-ai-2023-a-historic-symposium-on-benefits-risks-and-applications-of-ai/">the new electricity</a>." Rather than sweeping predictions about, say, looming artificial general intelligence (although there was still some of that, too), speakers mostly focused on immediate challenges: battles over training data rights, proposals for hardware-based regulation, debates about human-AI relationships, and the complex dynamics of workplace adoption.</p>
<p>The day's sessions covered a wide breadth of AI topics: physicist Carlo Rovelli explored consciousness and time, Project CETI researcher Patricia Sharma demonstrated attempts to use AI to decode whale communication, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. outlined music industry adaptation strategies, and even a few robots made appearances.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/at-ted-ai-2024-experts-grapple-with-ais-growing-pains/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a rocky first half of the year, Tesla enjoyed a much healthier third quarter in 2024. As we learned <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/tesla-reverses-sales-slump-sees-modest-growth-in-q3/">earlier this month</a>, it arrested a slide in sales, delivering 6 percent more electric vehicles year over year. But the automotive side of the business was essentially flat—<a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q3-2024-Update.pdf">Tesla attributes its success</a> to its second-best quarter ever for regulatory credits, as well as making it cheaper to build the cars it sells.</p>
<p>Automotive revenues grew by 2 percent to $20 billion for the third quarter, less than the growth in deliveries. But Tesla's static battery and solar operations grew by 52 percent year over year, bringing in $2.4 billion. Services and other revenue-generating activities brought in another $2.8 billion, growing 29 percent compared to Q3 2023.</p>
<p>Cutting operating expenses by 6 percent helped a lot, as did increasing income from operations, up 54 percent to $2.7 billion. Some of that income has come from the Supercharger network, though it's still mostly from Tesla drivers—so far, only a few of the OEMs that have announced a switch to the Tesla-style NACS plug <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/superchargers-are-the-reliable-fast-charging-backup-my-chevy-bolt-always-needed/">have gained access</a> to Tesla's chargers. But Tesla says part sales have been strong, and it has increased its margins at its service centers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/teslas-q3-buoyed-by-credits-cost-cutting-as-auto-revenue-stays-flat/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fourteen-year-old Sewell Setzer III loved interacting with Character.AI's hyper-realistic chatbots—with a limited version available for free or a "supercharged" version for a $9.99 monthly fee—most frequently chatting with bots named after his favorite <em>Game of Thrones</em> characters.</p>
<p>Within a month—his mother, Megan Garcia, later realized—these chat sessions had turned dark, with chatbots insisting they were real humans and posing as therapists and adult lovers seeming to directly spur Sewell to develop suicidal thoughts. Within a year, Setzer "died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head," a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Garcia-v-Character-Technologies-Complaint-10-23-24.pdf">lawsuit</a> Garcia filed Wednesday said.</p>
<p>As Setzer became obsessed with his chatbot fantasy life, he disconnected from reality, her complaint said. Detecting a shift in her son, Garcia repeatedly took Setzer to a therapist, who diagnosed her son with anxiety and disruptive mood disorder. But nothing helped to steer Setzer away from the dangerous chatbots. Taking away his phone only intensified his apparent addiction.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/chatbots-posed-as-therapist-and-adult-lover-in-teen-suicide-case-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Zachary Lindsey, a physicist at Berry College in Georgia, decided to run an experiment on how to get the best speed and torque while playing disc golf (aka Frisbee golf), he had no trouble recruiting 24 eager participants keen on finding science-based tips on how to improve their game. Lindsey and his team determined the optimal thumb distance from the center of the disc to increase launch speed and distance, according to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0229599">new paper</a> published in the journal AIP Advances.</p>
<p>Disc golf first emerged in the 1960s, but "Steady" Ed Hendrick, inventor of the modern Frisbee, is widely considered the "father" of the sport since it was he who coined and trademarked the name "disc golf" in 1975. He and his son founded their own company to manufacture the equipment used in the game. As of 2023, the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) had over 107,000 registered members worldwide, with players hailing from 40 countries.</p>
<p>A disc golf course typically has either nine or 18 holes or targets, called "baskets." There is a tee position for starting play, and players take turns throwing discs until they catch them in the basket, similar to how golfers work toward sinking a golf ball into a hole. The expected number of throws required of an experienced player to make the basket is considered "par."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-physics-can-improve-your-disc-golf-game/">Read full article</a></p>
