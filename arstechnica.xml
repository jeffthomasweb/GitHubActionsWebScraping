<p>Liftoff aboard a Long March 3B rocket at 1:31 pm EDT (17:31 UTC) from the Xichang launch base kicked off the second mission in a series of Chinese probes to explore the Solar System. This mission, designated Tianwen-2, follows <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/china-is-about-to-attempt-a-highly-ambitious-landing-on-mars/">the Tianwen-1 mission</a>, which became the first Chinese spacecraft to land on Mars in 2021.</p>
<p>Chinese officials confirmed the 2.1-metric ton Tianwen-2 spacecraft unfurled its fan-shaped solar arrays shortly after launch, marking an auspicious start to a decade-long tour of the Solar System.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/china-extends-its-reach-into-the-solar-system-with-launch-of-asteroid-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of home and small office routers manufactured by Asus are being infected with a stealthy backdoor that can survive reboots and firmware updates in an attack by a nation-state or another well-resourced threat actor, researchers said.</p>
<p>The unknown attackers gain access to the devices by exploiting now-patched vulnerabilities, some of which have never been tracked through the internationally recognized CVE system. After gaining unauthorized administrative control of the devices, the threat actor installs a public encryption key for access to the device through SSH. From then on, anyone with the private key can automatically log in to the device with administrative system rights.</p>
<h2>Durable control</h2>
<p>“‍The attacker’s access survives both reboots and firmware updates, giving them durable control over affected devices,” researchers from security firm GreyNoise <a href="https://www.greynoise.io/blog/stealthy-backdoor-campaign-affecting-asus-routers">reported Wednesday</a>. “The attacker maintains long-term access without dropping malware or leaving obvious traces by chaining authentication bypasses, exploiting a known vulnerability, and abusing legitimate configuration features.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/thousands-of-asus-routers-are-being-hit-with-stealthy-persistent-backdoors/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An otherwise-healthy 52-year-old office worker showed up to a hospital emergency department in Buenos Aires with an unshakable fever he developed the week before. Besides the high temperature, he seemed fine. So, after testing negative for COVID-19, doctors sent him home with supportive care. But the fever didn't go away.</p>
<p>In the week that followed, things got worse. He developed nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea. He also started having trouble breathing. He then went back to the hospital.</p>
<p>This time, doctors found he needed supplemental oxygen. And an X-ray of his chest was worrisome—there were diffuse ground-glass opacities in his lungs. Doctors wondered if he had an unusual case of pneumonia. The man kept getting worse; in fact, he seemed to deteriorate before their eyes. Initially, he received supplemental oxygen through a simple face mask; subsequently, doctors switched to a mask that delivers continuous oxygen. However, his blood oxygen saturation continued to fall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/healthy-man-goes-camping-lands-in-icu-for-40-days-with-respiratory-failure/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Automaker Stellantis and retail and web services behemoth Amazon have decided to put an end to a collaboration on new in-car software. The partnership dates back to 2022, part of a wide-ranging agreement that also saw Stellantis pick Amazon Web Services as its cloud platform for new vehicles and Amazon sign on as the first customer for Ram's fully electric ProMaster EV van.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the Amazon-Stellantis partnership was to be a software platform for new Stellantis vehicles called STLA SmartCockpit. Meant to debut last year, SmartCockpit was supposed to "seamlessly integrate with customers’ digital lives to create personalized, intuitive in-vehicle experiences," using Alexa and other AI agents to provide better in-car entertainment but also navigation, vehicle maintenance, and in-car payments as well.</p>
<p>But 2024 came and went without the launch of SmartCockpit, and now the joint work has wound down, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/amazons-in-car-software-deal-with-stellantis-fizzles-2025-05-28/">according to Reuters</a>, although not for any particular reason the news organization could discern. Rather, the companies said in a statement that they "will allow each team to focus on solutions that provide value to our shared customers and better align with our evolving strategies."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/amazon-and-stellantis-abandon-project-to-create-a-digital-smartcockpit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">In some ways, Getty Images has emerged as one of the most steadfast defenders of artists' rights in AI copyright fights. Starting in 2022, when some of the most sophisticated image generators today <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/midjourney-turns-heads-with-quality-leap-in-new-ai-image-generator-version/">first started testing new models offering better compositions</a>, Getty <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/fearing-copyright-issues-getty-images-bans-ai-generated-artwork/">banned AI-generated uploads to its service</a>. And by the next year, Getty released a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/getty-images-built-a-socially-responsible-ai-tool-that-rewards-artists/">"socially responsible" image generator</a> to prove it was possible to build a tool while rewarding artists, while suing an AI firm that refused to pay artists.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But in the years since, Getty Images CEO Craig Peters recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/getty-ceo-stability-ai-lawsuit-doesnt-cover-industry-mass-theft.html">told CNBC</a> that the media company has discovered that it's simply way too expensive to fight every AI copyright battle.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Peters, Getty has dumped millions into just one copyright fight against Stability AI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/extraordinarily-expensive-costs-force-getty-to-pick-its-ai-legal-battles/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration is backing cable company Cox in a battle that could determine whether Internet service providers are forced to disconnect users accused of piracy.</p>
<p>Cox, which says ISPs shouldn't have to terminate customers based on unproven allegations of copyright infringement, has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/isp-to-supreme-court-we-shouldnt-have-to-disconnect-users-accused-of-piracy/">seeking Supreme Court review</a> of Sony's victory in the underlying lawsuit. The court asked the US solicitor general to file a brief expressing the views of the United States government. Solicitor General John Sauer, a Trump nominee, filed a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-171/359730/20250527172556075_Cox-Sony.CVSG.pdf">brief</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court "should grant certiorari to address the first question presented in Cox's petition: whether an ISP materially contributes to copyright infringement by continuing to provide Internet access to particular subscribers after receiving notice that copyright infringement has occurred on their accounts," Sauer wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/trump-admin-tells-scotus-isps-shouldnt-be-forced-to-boot-alleged-pirates/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The next version of Android is expected to hit Pixel phones in June, but it'll take longer for devices from other manufacturers to see the new OS. However, Samsung is making unusually good time this cycle. Owners of the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/samsungs-galaxy-s25-event-was-an-ai-presentation-with-occasional-phone-hardware/">Galaxy S25 phones</a> can get an early look at One UI 8 (based on Android 16) in the new open beta program. Samsung promises a lot of upgrades, but it may not feel that way.</p>
<p>Signing up for the beta is a snap—just open the Samsung Members app, and the beta signup should be right on the main landing page. From there, the OTA update should appear on your device within a few minutes. It's pretty hefty at 3.4GB, but the installation is quick, and none of your data should be affected. That said, backups are always advisable when using beta software.</p>
<p>You must be in the US, Germany, Korea, or the UK to join the beta, and US phones must be unlocked or the T-Mobile variants. The software is compatible with the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra—the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/form-over-function-samsung-unveils-the-super-slim-galaxy-s25-edge/">S25 Edge</a> need not apply (for now).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/samsung-drops-android-16-beta-for-galaxy-s25-with-more-ai-you-probably-dont-want/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge has given Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees access to US Treasury payment systems as long as they meet training and vetting requirements but denied the Trump administration's motion to completely dissolve a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>US District Judge Jeannette Vargas of the Southern District of New York is overseeing a case filed against President Trump by 19 states led by New York. In February, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.636609/gov.uscourts.nysd.636609.76.0_2.pdf">Vargas issued</a> a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Treasury Department from granting DOGE access to systems containing personally identifiable information or confidential financial information.</p>
<p>In April, Vargas <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.636609/gov.uscourts.nysd.636609.139.0_1.pdf">allowed</a> DOGE employee Ryan Wunderly to access the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) system, after government declarations said "that Wunderly has undergone the same vetting and security clearance process that applies to any other Treasury Department employee provided with access to BFS payment systems." In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.636609/gov.uscourts.nysd.636609.156.0.pdf">order yesterday</a>, Vargas ruled that four more employees can access the system.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/judge-lets-four-more-doge-employees-access-us-treasury-payment-systems/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The current incarnation of Google Photos was not Google's first image management platform, but it's been a big success. Ten years on, Google Photos remains one of Google's most popular products, and it's getting a couple of new features to celebrate its 10th year in operation. You'll be able to share albums a bit more easily, and editing tools are getting a boost with, you guessed it, AI.</p>
<p>Google Photos made a splash in 2015 when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/05/google-photos-leaves-google-launches-as-a-standalone-service/">broke free</a> of the spiraling Google+ social network, offering people supposedly unlimited free storage for compressed images. Of course, that was too good to last. In 2021, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/google-photos-wants-money-stricter-storage-limitations-kick-in-next-week/">began limiting photo uploads</a> to 15GB for free users, sharing the default account level storage with other services like Gmail and Drive. Today, Google encourages everyone to pay for a Google One subscription to get more space, which is a bit of a bummer. Regardless, people still use Google Photos extensively.</p>
<p>According to the company, Photos has more than 1.5 billion monthly users, and it stores more than 9 trillion photos and videos. When using the Photos app on a phone, you are prompted to automatically upload your camera roll, which makes it easy to keep all your memories backed up (and edge ever closer to the free storage limit). Photos has also long offered almost magical search capabilities, allowing you to search for the content of images to find them. That may seem less impressive now, but it was revolutionary a decade ago. Google says users perform over 370 million searches in Photos each month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-photos-turns-10-celebrates-with-new-ai-infused-photo-editor/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Late on Friday, Amazon announced that it was <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-wheel-of-time-canceled-amazon-prime-video-1236408524/">canceling</a> its TV adaptation of Robert Jordan’s <em>Wheel of Time</em> series, after several uncomfortable weeks of silence that followed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/recap-wheel-of-times-third-season-balefires-its-way-to-a-hell-of-a-finish/">the show’s third season finale</a>.</p>
<p>Fans of the series can take some cold comfort in the fact that it <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/the-wheel-of-time-canceled-prime-video-1236409657/">apparently wasn’t an easy decision to make</a>. But as we speculated in our write-up of what ended up being the show’s series finale, an expensive show with a huge cast, tons of complicated costuming and effects, and extensive location shooting only makes mathematical sense if it’s a megahit, and <em>The Wheel of Time</em> was never a megahit.</p>
<h2>Adapting the unadaptable</h2>
<p>I was sad about the cancellation announcement because I believe this season was the one where the show found its footing, both as an adaptation of a complex book series and as a fun TV show in its own right. But I wasn't <em>surprised</em> by it. The only thing I found surprising was that it took this long to happen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/it-was-probably-always-going-to-end-this-way-for-amazons-wheel-of-time-show/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">After weeks of arguments in the Federal Trade Commission's monopoly trial, Meta is done defending its decade-plus-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp—at least for now.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The seven-week trial ended Tuesday, with the FTC urging Judge James Boasberg to rule that a breakup is necessary to end Meta's alleged monopoly in the "personal social networking services" market, where Meta currently faces sparse competition among other apps connecting friends and family. As alleged by the FTC, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/ftcs-monopoly-case-hinges-on-zuckerbergs-damaging-texts-emails/">Meta's internal emails laid bare</a> that Meta's motive in acquiring both Instagram and WhatsApp was to pay whatever it took to snuff out dominant rivals threatening to lure users away from Facebook—Mark Zuckerberg's jewel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Talking <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/meta-s-future-lies-with-judge-as-ftc-antitrust-trial-ends">to Bloomberg</a>, Meta has maintained that the FTC's case is weak, seeking to undo deals that the FTC approved long ago while ignoring the competition Meta faces from rivals in the broader social media market, like TikTok. But Meta's attempt to shut down the case mid-trial was rebuffed by Boasberg, who has signaled he will take months to weigh his decision.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/meta-confident-monopoly-trial-will-end-with-win-experts-arent-so-sure/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Uranus, the seventh planet in the Solar System, located between Saturn and Neptune, has long been a mystery. But by analyzing observations made by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope over a 20-year period, a research team from the University of Arizona and other institutions has <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/20-year-hubble-study-of-uranus-yields-new-atmospheric-insights/">provided new insights</a> into the composition and dynamics of the planet’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Information about Uranus is limited. What we know is that the planet is composed mainly of water and ammonia ice, its diameter is about 51,000 kilometers, about four times that of the Earth, and its mass is about 15 times greater than Earth’s. Uranus also has <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/uranus/facts/#h-rings">13 rings and 28 satellites</a>.</p>
<p>In January 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 space probe successfully completed what has been, to date, the only exploration of the planet, conducting a flyby as part of its mission to study the outer planets of the Solar System.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/we-now-have-a-good-idea-about-the-makeup-of-uranus-atmosphere/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[
<p>At this point, <em>Elden Ring</em> is well-known for its epic sense of scale, offering players dozens of hours of meticulous exploration, gradual character progression, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">unforgiving enemy encounters</a> that require deliberate care and strategy. On its face, this doesn't seem like the best basis for a semi-randomized multiplayer action game spin-off with strict time limits and an ever-encroaching physical border in a tightly constrained map.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> makes the combination work. The game condenses all the essential parts of <em>Elden Ring</em> down to their barest essence, tweaking things just enough to distill the flavor of a full-fledged <em>Elden Ring</em> playthrough into zippy runs of less than an hour each. The result is a fast-paced, quick-hit shot of adventuring that is well suited to repeated play with friends.</p>
<h2>Fort-elden Ring-nite</h2>
<p>The initial moments of each <em>Nightreign</em> run draw an almost comical comparison to <em>Fortnite</em>, with each player dropping into the game's singular map by hanging off the talons of a great spectral eagle. Once on the ground, players have to stay inside a circular "safe zone" that will slowly contract throughout each of two quick in-game days, forcing your party toward an eventual encounter with a mini-boss at the end of each day. If you survive both days, you take on one of the several extremely punishing Nightlords you chose to face at the beginning of that run.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/elden-ring-nightreign-is-an-epic-rpg-squeezed-into-delicious-bite-size-capsules/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the last three months or so, I've been learning to use (and love) a Bambu Labs A1 3D printer, a big, loud machine that sits on my desk and turns pictures on my computer screen into real-world objects.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-my-first-few-months-with-a-bambu-lab-a1-3d-printer-part-1/">the first part</a> of my series about diving into the wild world of 3D printers, I covered what I'd learned about the different types of 3D printers, some useful settings in the Bambu Studio app (which should also be broadly useful to know about no matter what printer you use), and some initial, magical-feeling successes in downloading files that I turned into useful physical items using a few feet of plastic filament and a couple hours of time.</p>
<p>For this second part, I'm focusing on what I learned when I embarked on my first major project—printing upgrade parts for the A1 <em>with </em>the A1. It was here that I made some of my first big 3D printing mistakes, mistakes that prompted me to read up on the different kinds of 3D printer filament, what each type of filament is good for, and which types the A1 is (and is not) good at handling as an un-enclosed, bed-slinging printer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-a-bambu-labs-a1-3d-printer-part-2-upgrades-and-mistakes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX made some progress on another test flight of the world's most powerful rocket Tuesday, finally overcoming technical problems that plagued the program's two previous launches.</p>
<p>But minutes into the mission, SpaceX's Starship lost control as it cruised through space, then tumbled back into the atmosphere somewhere over the Indian Ocean nearly an hour after taking off from Starbase, Texas, the company's privately owned spaceport near the US-Mexico border.</p>
<p>SpaceX's next-generation rocket is designed to eventually ferry cargo and private and government crews between the Earth, the Moon, and Mars. The rocket is complex and gargantuan, wider and longer than a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, and after nearly two years of steady progress since its first test flight in 2023, this has been a year of setbacks for Starship.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-may-have-solved-one-problem-only-to-find-more-on-latest-starship-flight/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In recent weeks, Musk has dialed back his focus on politics and said he wants to devote the majority of his time to SpaceX and his other companies. So what does that mean?</p>
<p>The conversation came just ahead of the opening of Starship's launch window, at 6:30 pm CT (23:30 UTC) in South Texas.

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, independent AI researcher <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/join-ars-live-nov-19-to-dissect-microsofts-rogue-ai-experiment/">Simon Willison</a> published a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/">detailed analysis</a> of Anthropic's newly released system prompts for Claude 4's Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 models, offering insights into how Anthropic controls the models' "behavior" through their outputs. Willison examined both the published prompts and leaked internal tool instructions to reveal what he calls "a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools."</p>
<p>To understand what Willison is talking about, we'll need to explain what system prompts are. Large language models (LLMs) like the AI models that run Claude and ChatGPT process an input called a "prompt" and return an output that is the most likely continuation of that prompt. System prompts are instructions that AI companies feed to the models before each conversation to establish how they should respond.</p>
<p>Unlike the messages users see from the chatbot, system prompts typically remain hidden from the user and tell the model its identity, behavioral guidelines, and specific rules to follow. Each time a user sends a message, the AI model receives the full conversation history along with the system prompt, allowing it to maintain context while following its instructions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/hidden-ai-instructions-reveal-how-anthropic-controls-claude-4/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Currently, there are no nuclear power plants scheduled for construction in the US. Everybody with plans to build one hasn't had a reactor design approved, while nobody is planning to use any of the approved designs. This follows a period in which only three new reactors have entered service since 1990. Despite its extremely low carbon footprint, nuclear power appears to be dead in the water.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders intended to revive the US nuclear industry. These include plans to streamline the reactor approval process and boost the construction of experimental reactors by the Department of Energy. But they also contain language that's inconsistent with other administration priorities and fundamentally misunderstands the use of nuclear power. Plus, some timelines might be, shall we say, unrealistic: three new experimental reactors reaching criticality in just over a year.</p>
<h2>Slow nukes</h2>
<p>The heyday of nuclear plant construction in the US was in the 1970s and 80s. But the 1979 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident">partial meltdown</a> at the Three Mile Island plant soured public sentiment toward nuclear power. This also came at a time when nuclear plants typically generated <a href="https://nuclear.duke-energy.com/2021/05/18/capacity-factor-it-s-a-measure-of-reliability">only half of their rated capacity</a>, making them an expensive long-term bet. As a result, plans for many plants, including some that were partially constructed, were canceled.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trump-signs-executive-orders-meant-to-resurrect-us-nuclear-power/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>National Public Radio sued President Trump and his administration today over Trump's move to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/blatantly-unlawful-trump-slammed-for-trying-to-defund-pbs-npr/">block funding</a> for public broadcasting. NPR said Trump acted illegally, and that losing federal funding could force it to shut newsrooms and dramatically scale back news coverage.</p>
<p>On May 1, Trump issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ending-taxpayer-subsidization-of-biased-media/">executive order</a> titled, "Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media," in which he ordered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and all US agencies to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS. The White House had previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/white-house-aims-to-defund-npr-and-pbs-in-move-slammed-as-cultural-sabotage/">alleged</a> that NPR and PBS "spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'"</p>
<p>NPR's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.280953/gov.uscourts.dcd.280953.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> in US District Court for the District of Columbia asked the court to declare Trump's executive order and all actions to implement it unconstitutional. NPR's lawsuit said that Trump "has no authority under the Constitution to take such action. On the contrary, the power of the purse is reserved to Congress, and the President has no inherent authority to override Congress's will on domestic spending decisions. By unilaterally imposing restrictions and conditions on funds in contravention of Congress, the Order violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause of the Constitution."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/npr-sues-trump-over-blocked-funding-says-it-may-have-to-shutter-newsrooms/">Read full article</a></p>
