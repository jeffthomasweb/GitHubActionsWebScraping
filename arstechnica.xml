              <![CDATA[<p>Anyone who has suffered the indignity of splinter, a blister, or a paper cut knows that small things can sometimes be hugely annoying. You aren't going to die from any of these conditions, but it's still hard to focus when, say, the back of your right foot is rubbing a new blister against the inside of your not-quite-broken-in-yet hiking boots.</p>
<p>I found myself in the computing version of this situation yesterday, when I was trying to work on a new Mac Mini and was brought up short by the fact that my third mouse button (that is, clicking on the scroll wheel) did nothing. This was odd, because I have for many years assigned this button to "Mission Control" on macOS—a feature that tiles every open window on your machine, making it quick and easy to switch apps. When I got the new Mini, I immediately added this to my settings. Boom!</p>
<p>And yet there I was, a couple hours later, clicking the middle mouse button by reflex and getting no result. This seemed quite odd—had I only <em>imagined</em> that I made the settings change? I made the alteration again in System Settings and went back to work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/sometimes-its-the-little-tech-annoyances-that-sting-the-most/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Measles has arrived in Kansas and is spreading swiftly in communities with very low vaccination rates. Since last week, the state has tallied 10 cases across three counties with more pending.</p>
<p>On March 13, <a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483">health officials announced the state's first measles case</a> since 2018. The case was reported in Stevens County, which sits in the southwest corner of the state. As of now, it's unclear if the case is connected to the mushrooming outbreak that began in West Texas.</p>
<p>That initial case in Kansas already shows potential to mushroom on its own. Stevens County contains two school districts, both of which have extremely low vaccination rates among kindergartners. By the time children enter kindergarten, they should have their two doses of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, which together are 97 percent effective against measles. In the 2023–2024 school year, rates of kindergartners with their two shots stood at 83 percent in the Hugoton school district and 80 percent in the Moscow school district, <a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2016/Kindergarten-Immunization-Data">according to state data</a>. Those rates are significantly below the 95 percent threshold needed to block the onward community spread of measles—one of the most infectious viruses known to humankind.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/measles-takes-off-in-kansas-amid-low-vaccination-at-least-10-cases-reported/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, web infrastructure provider Cloudflare announced a new feature called "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/">AI Labyrinth</a>" that aims to combat unauthorized AI data scraping by serving fake AI-generated content to bots. The tool will attempt to thwart AI companies that crawl websites without permission to collect training data for large language models that power AI assistants like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>Cloudflare, founded in 2009, is probably best known as a company that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare">provides</a> infrastructure and security services for websites, particularly protection against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS_mitigation">distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) attacks and other malicious traffic.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Instead of simply blocking bots, Cloudflare's new system lures them into a "maze" of realistic-looking but irrelevant pages, wasting the crawler's computing resources. The approach is a notable shift from the standard block-and-defend strategy used by most website protection services. Cloudflare says blocking bots sometimes backfires because it alerts the crawler's operators that they've been detected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A proposed state law in California would force Internet service providers to offer $15 monthly plans to people with low incomes. The bill is similar to a New York law that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/new-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill/">took effect in January</a> but has a higher minimum speed requirement: The proposed $15 plans for low-income California residents would have to come with download speeds of 100Mbps and upload speeds of 20Mbps.</p>
<p>Broadband lobby groups <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/isps-fear-wave-of-state-laws-after-new-yorks-15-broadband-mandate/">fear that many states</a> will enact such requirements after New York won a multiyear court battle to enforce its law. The Supreme Court has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/isps-lose-yet-another-attempt-to-kill-new-yorks-15-broadband-mandate/">rejected</a> telecom industry challenges to the New York law twice.</p>
<p>The California bill was proposed in January by Democratic Assemblymember Tasha Boerner, but the original version simply declared an intent to require affordable home Internet service and contained no specifics on required speeds or prices. The requirement for specific speeds and a $15 price is being added to the bill with an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/california-broadband-affordability-bill.pdf">amendment</a> that was provided to Ars today by Boerner's office. The amendment should be in the official record by early next week, a Boerner spokesperson said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/california-bill-would-force-isps-to-offer-100mbps-plans-for-15-a-month/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[A lawsuit claims Google has not blocked football streams as required in Italy.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Italy is using its Piracy Shield law to go after Google, with a court ordering the Internet giant to immediately begin poisoning its public DNS servers. This is just the latest phase of a campaign that has also targeted Italian ISPs and other international firms like Cloudflare. The goal is aimed at preventing illegal football streams, but the effort has already caused collateral damage. Regardless, Italy's communication regulator praises the ruling and hopes to continue sticking it to international tech firms.</p>
<p>The Court of Milan issued this ruling in response to a complaint that Google failed to block pirate websites after they were identified by the national communication regulator, known as AGCOM. The court found that the sites in question were involved in the illegal streaming of Series A football matches, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/bulk-block-pirate-streaming-sites-ordered-italian-court/">has been a focus</a> of anti-piracy crusaders in Italy for years. Since Google offers a <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns">public DNS service</a>, it is subject to the site-blocking law.</p>
<p>Piracy Shield is often labeled as draconian by opponents because blocking content via DNS is messy. It blocks the entire domain, which has led to confusion when users rely on popular platforms to distribute pirated content. Just last year, Italian ISPs briefly blocked the entire Google Drive domain because someone, somewhere used it to share copyrighted material. This is often called DNS poisoning or spoofing in the context of online attacks, and the outcome is the same if it's being done under legal authority: a DNS record is altered to prevent someone typing a domain name from being routed to the correct IP address.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/italian-court-orders-google-to-block-iptv-pirate-sites-at-dns-level/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[It looks like humans actively suppress our earliest memories.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>For many of us, memories of our childhood have become a bit hazy, if not vanishing entirely. But nobody really remembers much before the age of 4, because nearly all humans experience what's termed "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia">infantile amnesia</a>," in which memories that might have formed before that age seemingly vanish as we move through adolescence. And it's not just us; the phenomenon appears to occur in a number of our fellow mammals.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation for this would be that the systems that form long-term memories are simply immature and don't start working effectively until children hit the age of 4. But a recent animal experiment suggests that the situation in mice is more complex: the memories are there, they're just not normally accessible, although they can be re-activated. Now, a study that put human infants in an MRI tube suggests that memory activity starts by the age of 1, suggesting that the results in mice may apply to us.</p>
<h2>Less than total recall</h2>
<p>Mice are one of the species that we know experience infantile amnesia. And, thanks to over a century of research on mice, we have some sophisticated genetic tools that allow us to explore what's actually involved in the apparent absence of the animals' earliest memories.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/infants-can-form-memories-starting-at-1-but-they-dont-last-until-later/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Anthropic Claude just caught up with a ChatGPT feature from 2023—but will it be accurate?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search">introduced</a> web search capabilities for its AI assistant Claude, enabling the assistant to access current information online. Previously, the latest AI model that powers Claude could only rely on data absorbed during its neural network training process, having a "knowledge cutoff" of October 2024.</p>
<p>Claude's web search is currently available in feature preview for paid users in the United States, with plans to expand to free users and additional countries in the future. After users enable the feature in their profile settings, Claude will automatically determine when to use web search to answer a query or find more recent information.</p>
<p>The new feature works with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a> and requires a paid subscription. The addition brings Claude in line with competitors like Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT, which already offer similar functionality. ChatGPT <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-eyes-and-ears-with-plugins-that-can-interface-ai-with-the-world/">first added</a> the ability to grab web search results as a plugin in March 2023, so this new feature is a long time coming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/anthropics-new-ai-search-feature-digs-through-the-web-for-answers/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge yesterday issued a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE's access to Social Security Administration records, saying the DOGE agency created by President Donald Trump "is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion."</p>
<p>Plaintiffs are likely to win their case alleging that DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) and other government defendants are violating the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, said a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321/gov.uscourts.mdd.577321.49.0.pdf">ruling</a> by US District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander in the District of Maryland. Social Security officials "provided members of the SSA DOGE Team with unbridled access to the personal and private data of millions of Americans, including but not limited to Social Security numbers, medical records, mental health records, hospitalization records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income history, work history, birth and marriage certificates, and home and work addresses," Hollander wrote.</p>
<p>Trump and Musk have <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-social-security-all-scam-2034985">claimed</a> there is widespread Social Security fraud, with Musk <a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/social-security-ponzi-scheme-elon-musk-joe-rogan/">calling</a> it "the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time." But there's no evidence to justify the DOGE access purportedly needed to root out fraud, Hollander wrote:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/judge-orders-musk-and-doge-to-delete-personal-data-taken-from-social-security/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>About five years ago, the Trump-appointed administrator of NASA, Jim Bridenstine, revealed the name of the program that would return humans to the Moon. It was to be Artemis, from a Greek goddess who was the twin sister of Apollo.</p>
<p>The symbolism was clear. NASA’s second human program to the Moon would be different: We were going to stay this time, there would be more international partnership, and instead of being all-male, the crews would include women. Shortly thereafter, NASA began to refer to Artemis as a program that would land the "first woman" on the Moon. Soon, an additional bit of diversity was added: “and the first person of color.”</p>
<p>One of the very last acts of the first Trump administration in regard to space was to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/09/us/nasa-artemis-astronauts-pence-scn-trnd/index.html">name a cadre of astronauts</a> that would fly as part of the Artemis Program. This subset of 18 people within NASA’s corps of four dozen active astronauts skewed significantly more female and minority than the general corps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/trump-white-house-drops-diversity-plan-for-moon-landing-it-created-back-in-2019/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Today, it emerged that Boeing has won its bid to supply the United States Air Force with its next jet fighter. As with the last fighter aircraft design procurement in recent times, the Department of Defense was faced with a choice between awarding Boeing or Lockheed the contract for the Next Generation Air Dominance program, which will replace the Lockheed F-22 Raptor sometime in the 2030s.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the NGAD, which the Air Force actually refers to as a "family of systems," as its goal of owning the skies requires more than just a fancy airplane. The program has been underway for a decade, and a prototype designed by the Air Force <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2020/09/15/the-us-air-force-has-built-and-flown-a-mysterious-full-scale-prototype-of-its-future-fighter-jet/">first flew in 2020</a>, breaking records in the process (although what records and by how much was not disclosed).</p>
<p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/why-the-air-force-paused-ngad-and-whats-next/">the Pentagon paused the program</a> as it reevaluated whether the NGAD would still meet its needs and whether it could afford to pay for the plane, as well as a new bomber, a new early warning aircraft, a new trainer, and a new ICBM, all at the same time. But in late December, <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/exclusive-new-air-force-review-supports-manned-6th-gen-ngad-fighter-concept/">it concluded that, yes</a>, a crewed replacement for the F-22 was in the national interest.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/boeing-will-build-the-us-air-forces-next-air-superiority-fighter/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240511122402/https://kubient.com/">May 2024</a>, the website of ad-tech firm Kubient touted that the company was "a perfect blend" of ad veterans and developers, "committed to solving the growing problem of fraud" in digital ads. Like many corporate sites, it also linked old blog posts from its home page, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240315021936/https://kubient.com/ad-fraud/how-to-create-a-world-free-of-fraud-kubients-secret-sauce/">a May 2022 post</a> on "How to create a world free of fraud: Kubient's secret sauce."</p>
<p>These days, Kubient's website cannot be reached, the team is no more, and CEO Paul Roberts is <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-ceo-kubient-inc-sentenced-prison-connection-accounting-fraud-scheme">due to serve one year and one day in prison</a>, having pled guilty Thursday to creating his own small world of fraud. Roberts, according to federal prosecutors, schemed to create $1.3 million in fraudulent revenue statements to bolster Kubient's initial public offering (IPO) and significantly oversold "KAI," Kubient's artificial intelligence tool.</p>
<p>The core of the case is an I-pay-you, you-pay-me gambit that Roberts initiated with an unnamed "Company-1," according to prosecutors. Kubient and this firm would each bill the other for nearly identical amounts, with Kubient purportedly deploying KAI to find instances of ad fraud in the other company's ad spend.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/ceo-of-ai-ad-tech-firm-pledging-world-free-of-fraud-sentenced-for-fraud/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What do we have in common with fish, besides being vertebrates? The types of joints we (and most vertebrates) share most likely originated from the same common ancestor. But it’s not a feature that we share with all vertebrates.</p>
<p>Humans, other land vertebrates, and jawed fish have synovial joints. The lubricated cavity within these joints makes them more mobile and stable because it allows for bones or cartilage to slide against each other without friction, which facilitates movement.</p>
<p>The origin of these joints was uncertain. Now, biologist Neelima Sharma of the University of Chicago and her colleagues have taken a look at which fish form this type of joint. Synovial joints are known to be present in jawed but not jawless fish. This left the question of whether they are just a feature of bony skeletons in general or if they are also found in fish with cartilaginous skeletons, such as sharks and skates (there are no land animals with cartilaginous skeletons).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/we-probably-inherited-our-joints-from-a-fish/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Andrew Cunningham and Lee Hutchinson have spent decades of their lives with Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson's <em>Wheel of Time</em> books, and they previously brought that knowledge to bear as they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/the-wheel-of-time-season-one/">recapped each first season episode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/the-wheel-of-time-season-two/">second season episode</a> of Amazon's <em>WoT</em> TV series. Now we're back in the saddle for season 3—along with insights, jokes, and the occasional wild theory.</p>
<p>These recaps won't cover every element of every episode, but they will contain major spoilers for the show and the book series. We'll do our best to not spoil major future events from the books, but there's always the danger that something might slip out. <strong>If you want to stay completely unspoiled and haven't read the books, these recaps aren't for you</strong>.</p>
<p>New episodes of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0D2VH77R1"><em>The Wheel of Time</em> season three</a> will be posted for <a href="https://amzn.to/3Es0B7q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Prime</a> subscribers every Thursday. This write-up covers episode four, "The Road to the Spear," which was released on March 20.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/at-the-halfway-point-of-season-3-the-wheel-of-time-is-getting-it-done/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When companies advertise job openings, they often use buzzwords like “ambitious” and “self-reliant” to describe their ideal candidate. These traits sound appealing—what hiring manager wouldn’t want a driven employee?</p>
<p>But there’s a catch. In my latest study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2024.05254">published in the journal Management Science</a> with co-authors <a href="https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/directory/jackson_scott.php">Scott Jackson</a> and <a href="https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/nick-seybert">Nick Seybert</a>, I found that these terms may attract job applicants <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2005.03.002">with more narcissistic tendencies</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://olemiss.edu/profiles/jlgay">behavioral researchers</a> in accounting, we are interested in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-679X.12176">executives who bend the rules</a>. We decided to study job postings after noticing that the language used to describe an “ideal candidate” often included traits linked to narcissism. For example, narcissists tend to see themselves as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167210385109">highly creative</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.890">and persuasive</a>. Prior research also shows that narcissistic employees are more innovative and willing to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11142-017-9427-x">take risks to get the success</a> and admiration they crave, even if it means bending the rules.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-the-language-of-job-postings-can-attract-rule-bending-narcissists/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In recent months, the AI industry's biggest boosters have started converging on a public expectation that we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-general-intelligence/">on the verge of “artificial general intelligence”</a> (AGI)—virtual agents that can match or surpass "human-level" understanding and performance on most cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>OpenAI is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/what-does-phd-level-ai-mean-openais-rumored-20000-agent-plan-explained/">quietly seeding expectations for a "PhD-level" AI agent</a> that could operate autonomously at the level of a "high-income knowledge worker" in the near future. Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/elon-musk-ai-will-be-smarter-than-any-human-around-the-end-of-next-year/">says</a> that "we'll have AI smarter than any one human probably" by the end of 2025. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei thinks it might take a bit longer but similarly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">says</a> it's plausible that AI will be "better than humans at almost everything" by the end of 2027.</p>

<p>Last month, Anthropic presented its “Claude Plays Pokémon” experiment as a waypoint on the road to that predicted AGI future. It's a project the company <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978">said</a> shows "glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning." Anthropic made headlines by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/visible-extended-thinking">trumpeting</a> how Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s "improved reasoning capabilities" let the company's latest model make progress in the popular old-school Game Boy RPG in ways "that older models had little hope of achieving."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Things have gotten a little wild in the Chicago suburb of Orland Park, Illinois, where local cops accused a former cop of impersonating a current cop on Facebook. The department also noted that a top police official had "a glitter bomb sent to him anonymously at the Police Department" and "was contacted by a suicide prevention hotline as a result of a spoofed call."</p>
<p>So, in a bit of a freak-out over this alleged harassment and impersonation, the Orland Park police investigated and eventually sought charges against the former cop—who said that all he had done was to create a parodic Facebook page critiquing the current departmental leadership.</p>
<p>The whole case was eventually tossed by a judge, who said that the Facebook page wasn't criminal, and now the former cop is suing the current cops for going after him.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/after-glitter-bomb-cops-arrested-former-cop-who-criticized-current-cops-online/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is making it easier for telcos to turn off old copper phone and DSL networks with four changes that relax requirements related to copper shutoffs. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr—who is also pushing a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-democrat-to-resign-cementing-republican-majority-for-chairman-carr/">Delete, Delete, Delete</a>" initiative to get rid of as many rules as possible—said in an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-cutting-red-tape-unleash-new-infrastructure-investments">announcement today</a> that agency rules have prevented providers from upgrading to faster networks.</p>
<p>"Outdated FCC rules have left Americans sitting in the slow lane for far too long," Carr said. "Those FCC rules have forced providers to pour resources into maintaining aging and expensive copper line networks instead of investing in the modern, high-speed infrastructure that Americans want and deserve."</p>
<p>The key question for people using old copper service is whether they will ever get a big upgrade to fiber lines for phone and Internet access or if they'll have to make do with wireless replacements that vary greatly in quality and speed. As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/att-says-it-wont-build-fiber-home-internet-in-half-of-its-wireline-footprint/">previously reported</a>, AT&amp;T is aiming to eliminate copper phone and DSL lines from its 21-state wireline network but will not deploy fiber in the more sparsely populated half of that territory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-chairman-brendan-carr-starts-granting-telecom-lobbys-wish-list/">Read full article</a></p>
