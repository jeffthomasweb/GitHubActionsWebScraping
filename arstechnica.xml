<p>With a zap of electricity from well-placed electrodes on the back of the neck, patients with <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/tetraplegia">tetraplegia</a> can regain some modest yet potentially "life-changing" functioning of their hands and arms, according to data from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02940-9">a small clinical trial published Monday in Nature Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The relatively simple stimulation method—which requires no surgery—offers an accessible, more affordable, non-invasive means for those living with paralysis to regain some meaningful function, the researchers behind the trial say. However, the therapy's further potential remains limited given that scientists have yet to fully understand exactly why it works.</p>
<p>For the trial, 60 patients with tetraplegia underwent the stimulation therapy over at least 24 sessions during a two-month period. At the end, 72 percent (43 patients) saw clinically meaningful improvements in both strength and functional performance. Further, 90 percent (54 patients) saw improvement from at least one strength or functional outcome. There were no serious adverse events reported.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026123#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026123&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, Google sent a cashier's check to the US government that it claimed in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/US-v-Google-Memo-in-Support-of-Motion-to-Dismiss-5-16-2024.pdf">court filing</a> covers "every dollar the United States could conceivably hope to recover" in damages during the Google <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies">adtech monopoly trial</a> scheduled to start this September.</p>
<p>According to Google, sending the check moots the government's sole claim for damages, which in turn foils the government's plan to seek a jury trial under its damages claim. While Google disputes liability for any of the government's claims, the payment serves to "prevent the tail from wagging the dog," the court filing said.</p>
<p>It's unclear just how big the check was. The court filing redacted key figures to protect Google's trade secrets. But Google claimed that testimony from US experts "shrank" the damages estimate "considerably" from initial estimates between $100 million and $300 million, suggesting that the current damages estimate is "substantially less" than what the US has paid so far in expert fees to reach those estimates.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026097#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026097&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It doesn't take a lot of energy to dig up coal or pump oil from the ground. In contrast, most renewable sources of energy involve obtaining and refining resources, sophisticated manufacturing, and installation. So, at first glance, when it comes to the energy used to get more energy—the energy return on investment—fossil fuels seem like a clear winner. That has led some to argue that transitioning to renewables will create an overall drop in net energy production, which nobody is interested in seeing.</p>
<p>A new study by researchers at the UK's University of Leeds, however, suggests that this isn't a concern at all—in most countries, renewables already produce more net energy than the fossil fuels they're displacing. The key to understanding why is that it's much easier to do useful things with electricity than it is with a hunk of coal or a glob of crude oil.</p>
<h2>Energy efficiency and utility</h2>
<p>The basic idea behind the new work is that while it's energetically cheap to extract fossil fuels, the stuff that comes out of the ground isn't ready to be put to use. There are energetic costs to making it into a useful form and transporting it to where it's needed, and then there is lost energy when it's being put to use. That's especially notable for uses like internal combustion engines, where significantly less than half of the energy available in gasoline actually gets converted into motion.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026106#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026106&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After three test flights, SpaceX has shown that the world's most powerful rocket can reach space. Now, engineers must demonstrate the company's next-generation Starship vehicle can get back home.</p>
<p>This will be the central objective for the fourth Starship test flight, which could happen as soon as early June, according to Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to enjoy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, beyond the core attack/dodge/survive gameplay. You can obsess over builds, appreciate the mastery of speedrunners and grand masters like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23198342/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-fromsoftware-bandai-namco-gift-box">Let Me Solo Her</a>, or mix and match the huge variety of armor in pursuit of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionsouls/">Fashion Souls</a>. And then there is lore. There is so much of it, and most of it has the consistency of campfire smoke.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring</em> tells its backstory (written <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135223/elden-ring-did-george-r-r-martin-write-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">in part by George R.R. Martin</a>) primarily through item descriptions and environmental hints. The scraps of narrative that do exist stand unsteadily against unreliable narrators, contradictions, <a href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-cut-content-shadow-erdtree-miquella-dreams-st-trina/">cut content</a>, and lovably enthusiastic fans who take small hints to their illogical extremes. Developer FromSoftware and primary creator Hidetaka Miyazaki do almost nothing to disprove misunderstandings or reward accurate conclusions, although they appreciate the energy. Miyazaki will just <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-look-back-interview-profile">casually tell IGN</a> that there's a "small element" that hasn't been discovered, offer nothing more on that, and leave fans like me craven with an unmet need for conclusion.</p>

<p>I love this and cherish the way FromSoftware will never in my lifetime confirm my hopes or expectations. So with the surprise arrival of an honest-to-goodness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uT8wGtB3yQ">story-based trailer for the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion</a>, due out June 21, I was given yet another feast of vague notions and evocative images.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025855#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025855&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malware recently spotted in the wild uses sophisticated measures to disable antivirus protections, destroy evidence of infection, and permanently infect machines with cryptocurrency-mining software, researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Key to making the unusually complex system of malware operate is a function in the main payload, named GhostEngine, that disables Microsoft Defender or any other antivirus or endpoint-protection software that may be running on the targeted computer. It also hides any evidence of compromise. “The first objective of the GhostEngine malware is to incapacitate endpoint security solutions and disable specific Windows event logs, such as Security and System logs, which record process creation and service registration,” <a href="https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/invisible-miners-unveiling-ghostengine">said</a> researchers from Elastic Security Labs, who discovered the attacks.</p>
<p>When it first executes, GhostEngine scans machines for any EDR, or endpoint protection and response, software that may be running. If it finds any, it loads drivers known to contain vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain access to the kernel, the core of all operating systems that’s heavily restricted to prevent tampering. One of the vulnerable drivers is an anti-rootkit file from Avast named aswArPots.sys. GhostEngine uses it to terminate the EDR security agent. A malicious file named smartscreen.exe then uses a driver from IObit named iobitunlockers.sys to delete the security agent binary.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026052#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026052&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After months of rumors and leaks, audio brand Sonos has announced and revealed its first foray into personal audio with the <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-ace">Sonos Ace</a>, pricey wireless over-ear headphones that compete with the likes of Apple's AirPods Max and Sony's popular WH-1000XM5.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth 5.4 headphones were shown to select press outlets in New York this week. It's too early to judge their sound quality, but they're priced at the high end, and Sonos has a good reputation on that front.</p>
<p>Each cup has a 40 mm driver, and there are a total of eight microphones for noise control. Notably, the headphones weigh less than Apple's AirPods Max.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025957#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025957&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Tesla shareholder group yesterday urged other shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $46 billion pay package, saying the Tesla board is dysfunctional and "overly beholden to CEO Musk." The group's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000121465924009597/o520243px14a6g.htm">letter</a> also urged shareholders to vote against the reelection of board members Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch.</p>
<p>"Tesla is suffering from a material governance failure which requires our urgent attention and action," and its board "is stacked with directors that have close personal ties to CEO Elon Musk," the letter said. "There are multiple indications that these ties, coupled with excessive director compensation, prevent the level of critical and independent thinking required for effective governance."</p>
<p>Tesla shareholders approved Elon Musk's pay package in 2018, but it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/">nullified by a court ruling</a> in January 2024. After a lawsuit filed by a shareholder, Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the pay plan was unfair to Tesla shareholders and must be rescinded.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026015#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026015&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

(credit: Getty Images)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Disaggregation is so 2010s, so Comcast, facing intense pressure from streaming services, is bringing back the old bundle-it-up playbook. Its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/comcast-hemorrhaging-subscribers-to-bundle-apple-tv-netflix-peacock-cable/">previously announced bundle</a> of Netflix, Peacock, and Apple TV+, only to Comcast/Xfinity cable or broadband subscribers, will cost $15 per month. It's a big discount on paper, but the fine print needs reading.</p>
<p>The "<a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/digital-cable-tv/streaming-services">StreamSaver" bundle</a> is considered a "companion to broadband," Comcast's CEO David Watson said at a conference today, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/comcast-prices-peacock-netflix-apple-tv-streaming-bundle-15-month-2024-05-21/">according to Reuters</a>. It cuts more than 30 percent off the separate price of certain tiers of each service and can be bundled with Comcast's own "<a href="https://www.xfinity.com/nowtv">NOW TV</a>," which has 40 other cable channels streaming. The service is due out May 29 in the US.</p>
<p>Take note that Comcast's bundle gives you Netflix's "<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">Standard with ads</a>" plan (which also locks you in at "Full HD" resolution and two devices), Peacock's "<a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/">Premium</a>" (which also has ads), and Apple TV+, which has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23614183/apple-tv-plus-ads-ad-supportied-tier-hire">made some recent moves</a> toward an advertising infusion. The things that people liked about streaming—being able to pick and choose TV and movie catalogs, pay to avoid advertisements, and not be beholden to their cable company for entertainment—are effectively countered by StreamSaver. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/comcast-hemorrhaging-subscribers-to-bundle-apple-tv-netflix-peacock-cable/">The lines get blurrier</a>, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/the-tv-streaming-apps-broke-their-promises-and-now-theyre-jacking-the-price/2/">prices go up</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025975#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025975&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

(credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/">Google</a>)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's unclear how much life is left in the 4-year-old Nest Audio or 8-year-old Google Home speakers, but Google is at least bringing back a feature it stripped away from users after losing a legal case. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-loses-sonos-patent-case-starts-stripping-functionality-from-speakers/">In 2022,</a> Google lost a patent case brought by Sonos, and rather than pay a licensing fee, Google reached into customer homes and removed the ability to control speaker volume as a group. Some of Sonos' patent wins were <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-home-sonos-patent-update/">thrown out</a> in October 2023, and now <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-speaker-group-volume-control-3445010/">Android Authority's</a> Mishaal Rahman reports that the feature is back in Android 15 Beta 2.</p>
<p>Google's "group speaker volume" feature is a fairly simple idea. Several Google Home/Nest Audio speakers can work together to seamlessly play music throughout your entire house, using onboard microphones to fix tricky multi-speaker issues like syncing the audio delay. When you're casting from your phone to a bunch of speakers, it would make sense that you want them all at the same volume instead of one being screaming loud and one being very quiet. While casting, the phone's volume button would control a unified volume bar for all active speakers. When Google killed the feature, the only option for controlling speaker volume from your phone became opening the app and adjusting a slider for each speaker.</p>
<p>Sonos and Google's history with connected speakers has been a contentious one. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/sonos-sues-google.html">Sonos' side</a> of the story is that Google got an inside look at its operations in 2013 as part of a sales pitch to bring Google Play Music support to Sonos speakers. Three years later, Google launched its first smart speaker. Sonos claims Google used that access to "blatantly and knowingly" copy Sonos' features for the Google Home speaker line. <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-home-sonos-patent-update/">Google says</a> it developed its smart speaker features independently of Sonos, and for some of Sonos' patents, it had the features shipped to consumers years before Sonos filed for a patent. Some of Sonos' patents were overturned because they were filed <em>in 2019</em>, after everyone had already released all of this smart speaker stuff to market.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025913#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025913&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft and Qualcomm are both making a concerted effort to make Windows-on-Arm happen after years of slow progress and false starts. One thing the companies have done to get software developers on board is to offer mini PC developer kits, which can be connected to a software developer's normal multi-monitor setup and doesn't require the same cash outlay as an equivalently specced Surface tablet or laptop.</p>

<p>Qualcomm has announced the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/05/qualcomm-accelerates-development-for-copilot--pcs-with-snapdrago">Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows</a>, a small black plastic mini PC with the same internal hardware as the new wave of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">Copilot+ PCs</a> with Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite processors in them. The box is fairly generously specced, with a slightly faster-than-normal version of the Snapdragon X Elite that can boost up to 4.3 GHz, 32GB of RAM, and a 512GB NVMe SSD.</p>
<p>Unlike the Windows Dev Kit 2023, which appeared to be a repurposed Surface Pro 9 motherboard thrown into a black plastic box, the Snapdragon Dev Kit appears to be purpose-built. It has a single USB-C port on the front and two USB-C ports, an HDMI port, two USB-A ports, a headphone/speaker jack, and an Ethernet port in the back. This isn't an overwhelming complement of ports, but it's in line with what Apple offers in the Mac mini.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025919#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025919&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Department of Justice has started cracking down on the use of AI image generators to produce child sexual abuse materials (CSAM).</p>
<p>On Monday, the DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-arrested-producing-distributing-and-possessing-ai-generated-images-minors-engaged">arrested</a> Steven Anderegg, a 42-year-old "extremely technologically savvy" Wisconsin man who allegedly used Stable Diffusion to create "thousands of realistic images of prepubescent minors," which were then distributed on Instagram and Telegram.</p>
<p>The cops were tipped off to Anderegg's alleged activities after Instagram flagged direct messages that were sent on Anderegg's Instagram account to a 15-year-old boy. Instagram reported the messages to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which subsequently alerted law enforcement.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025952#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025952&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Longtime gamers (and/or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamegrumps">Game Grumps fans</a>) likely know that even single-player games can be a lot more fun with a friend hanging out nearby to offer advice, shoot the breeze, or just offer earnest reactions to whatever's happening on screen. Now, Microsoft is promising that its GhatGPT-4o-powered Copilot system will soon offer an imitation of that pro-social experience even for <em>Minecraft</em> players who don't have any human friends available to watch them play.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792625882634281231">pair</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342">social media posts</a> Monday, Microsoft highlighted how "real-time conversations with your AI companion copilot" can enhance an otherwise solitary <em>Minecraft</em> experience. In the first demo, the disembodied copilot voice tells the player how to craft a sword, walking him through the process of gathering some wood or stone to go with the sticks sitting in his inventory. In another, the AI identifies a zombie in front of the player and gives the (seemingly obvious) advice to run away from the threat and "make sure it can't reach you" by digging underground or building a tower of blocks.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Real time conversations with your AI companion Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o. <a href="https://t.co/Ug7EWv2sah">pic.twitter.com/Ug7EWv2sah</a></p>
<p>— Microsoft Copilot (@MSFTCopilot) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These kinds of in-game pointers aren't the most revolutionary use of conversational AI—even a basic in-game tutorial/reference system or online walkthrough could deliver the same basic information, after all. Still, the demonstration stands out for just <em>how</em> that information is delivered to the player through a natural language conversation that doesn't require pausing the gameplay even briefly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025917#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025917&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/heres-how-volvo-is-making-its-long-haul-trucks-safer-more-efficient/">we took a look at Volvo's VNL new Class 8 heavy truck</a> developed for the North American market. Last night at the ACT Expo trade show, the company debuted a new variant, called the VNL Autonomous. The name should give it away—this truck has been designed to drive itself using autonomous tech from the startup Aurora.</p>
<p>The VNL Autonomous has been designed for SAE level 4 autonomy and combines long-range lidar with radar, cameras, and other sensors. Input from these sensors is processed by a redundant pair of computers running Aurora's AI software. Aurora has been a partner with Volvo Autonomous Solutions for some years now, working on hub-to-hub driverless freight systems for the North American market.</p>
<p>"Our platform engineering approach prioritizes safety by incorporating high-assurance redundancy systems designed to mitigate potential emergency situations," said Volvo Autonomous Solutions' chief product officer Shahkh Kazmi. "We built the Volvo VNL Autonomous from the ground up, integrating these redundancy systems to ensure that every safety-critical component is intentionally duplicated, thereby significantly enhancing both safety and reliability."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025836#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025836&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When you look at the northern sky, you can follow the arm of the Big Dipper as it arcs around toward the bright star called Arcturus. Roughly in the middle of that arc, you'll find the Northern Crown constellation, which looks a bit like a smiley face. Sometime between now and September, if you look to the left-hand side of the Northern Crown, what will look like a new star will shine for five days or so.</p>
<p>This star system is called T. Coronae Borealis, also known as the Blaze Star, and most of the time, it is way too dim to be visible to the naked eye. But once roughly every 80 years, a violent thermonuclear explosion makes it over 10,000 times brighter. The last time it happened was in 1946, so now it’s our turn to see it.</p>
<h2>Neighborhood litterbug</h2>
<p>“The T. Coronae Borealis is a binary system. It is actually two stars,” said Gerard Van Belle, the director of science at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. One of these stars is a white dwarf, an old star that has already been through its fusion-powered lifecycle. “It’s gone from being a main sequence star to being a giant star. And in the case of giant stars, what happens is their outer parts eventually get kind of pushed into outer space. What’s left behind is a leftover core of the star—that’s called a white dwarf,” Van Belle explained.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025759#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025759&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cities and towns that build their own broadband networks often say they only considered the do-it-yourself option because private Internet service providers didn't meet their communities' needs. When a cable or phone company's Internet service is too slow, too expensive, not deployed widely enough, or all of the above, local government officials sometimes decide to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p><a href="https://communitynets.org/content/community-network-map">Hundreds of municipal broadband networks</a> have been built around the US as a result, including dozens that have <a href="https://ilsr.org/articles/new-municipal-broadband-networks-skyrocket-in-post-pandemic-america/">started operating</a> since 2021. The rise of public broadband hasn't happened without a fight, though. Private ISPs that would rather face no government-funded competition have tried to convince voters that public networks are doomed to become boondoggles.</p>
<p>Opponents of public broadband don't always attach their names to these campaigns, but it often seems likely that private ISPs are behind the anti-municipal broadband lobbying. Public broadband advocates say that over the past few years, they've seen a noticeable increase in "dark money" groups attacking public network projects.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025230#p3">Read 85 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025230&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Leading artificial intelligence companies have signed up to a new round of voluntary commitments on AI safety, the UK and South Korean governments have announced.</p>
<p>The companies, which include tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft as well as Sam Altman-led OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI, and Chinese developer Zhipu AI, will publish frameworks outlining how they will measure the risks of their “frontier” AI models.</p>
<p>The groups committed “not to develop or deploy a model at all” if severe risks could not be mitigated, the two governments said ahead of the opening of a global AI summit in Seoul on Tuesday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025811#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025811&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Good morning. It's May 21, and today's photo comes from the James Webb Space Telescope. It showcases the coming together of two massive black holes in the early Universe, just 740 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Each of the black holes has an estimated mass of roughly 50 million times the mass of our star, the Sun. The discovery of this merger so early in the Universe indicates that the growth of these objects in the centers of galaxies occurred very rapidly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025716#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025716&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Federal authorities have arrested a 23-year-old Taiwanese national and charged him with running an online market that sold $100 million worth of illicit narcotics, including fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, LSD, and ketamine.</p>
<p>The authorities said that for almost four years, Rui-Siang Lin operated and owned the Incognito Market, an online marketplace on the dark web that users worldwide visited to buy and sell illegal narcotics. The marketplace facilitated transactions with many of the same features provided by legitimate e-commerce sites, including buyer and user registration, branding, advertising, and customer service. When registered buyers visited the site using the Tor browser, they were presented with the following graphic:</p>

<p>The site allowed buyers to search through thousands of listings for narcotics of their choice. It opened in October 2020 and, as <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/incognito-darknet-market-mass-extorts-buyers-sellers/">reported</a> by KrebsOnSecurity, closed last March when its operators extorted both buyers and sellers of fees ranging from $100 to $2,000 in exchange for not revealing text messages and transaction records showing their participation in the marketplace. In the 41 months that Incognito Market was open, it facilitated the sale of more than $100 million of narcotics. By June 2023, the site was generating sales of $5 million per month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025786#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025786&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
