                            <![CDATA[<p>When one of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-class_submarine">Kilo-class</a>, diesel-electric submarines recently surfaced off the coast of France, Russia denied that there was a problem with the vessel. The sub was simply surfacing to comply with maritime transit rules governing the English Channel, the Kremlin said—Russia being, of course, a noted follower of international law.</p>
<p>But social media accounts historically linked to Russian security forces suggested a far more serious problem on the submarine <em>Novorossiysk</em>. According to <a href="https://maritime-executive.com/article/nato-highlights-decline-of-russian-navy-after-sub-surfaces-off-france">The Maritime Executive</a>, "Rumors began to circulate on well-informed social media channels that the <em>Novorossiysk</em> had suffered a fuel leak. They suggested the vessel lacked onboard capabilities and was forced to surface to empty flooded compartments. Some reports said it was a dangerous fuel leak aboard the vessel, which was commissioned in 2012."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251001-russia-submarine-gibraltar-fuel-leak-mediterranean-risk-explosion">France 24</a> quoted further social media reports as saying, "The submarine has neither the spare parts nor the qualified specialists onboard to fix the malfunction," and it "now poses an explosion hazard."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/nato-boss-mocks-russian-navy-which-is-on-the-hunt-for-red-october-the-nearest-mechanic/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal prosecutors have seized $15 billion from the alleged kingpin of an operation that used imprisoned laborers to trick unsuspecting people into making investments in phony funds, often after spending months faking romantic relationships with the victims.</p>
<p>Such "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_butchering_scam">pig butchering</a>" scams have operated for years. They typically work when members of the operation initiate conversations with people on social media and then spend months messaging them. Often, the scammers pose as <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-a-pig-butchering-scam-heres-how-to-avoid-falling-victim-to-one">attractive individuals</a> who feign romantic interest for the victim.</p>
<h2>Forced labor, phone farms, and human suffering</h2>
<p>Eventually, conversations turn to phony investment funds with the end goal of convincing the victim to transfer <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3282345/hong-kong-fraudsters-use-deepfake-tech-swindle-love-struck-men-out-hk360-million">large amounts of bitcoin</a>.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi today said that Facebook removed an ICE-tracking group after "outreach" from the Department of Justice. "Today following outreach from @thejusticedept, Facebook removed a large group page that was being used to dox and target @ICEgov agents in Chicago," Bondi wrote in an <a href="https://x.com/agpambondi/status/1978104370186137616">X post</a>.</p>
<p>Bondi alleged that a "wave of violence against ICE has been driven by online apps and social media campaigns designed to put ICE officers at risk just for doing their jobs." She added that the DOJ "will continue engaging tech companies to eliminate platforms where radicals can incite imminent violence against federal law enforcement."</p>
<p>When contacted by Ars, Facebook owner Meta said the group "was removed for violating our policies against coordinated harm." Meta didn't describe any specific violation but directed us to a <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/coordinating-harm-promoting-crime/">policy</a> against "coordinating harm and promoting crime," which includes a prohibition against "outing the undercover status of law enforcement, military, or security personnel."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trump-admin-pressured-facebook-into-removing-ice-tracking-group/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As if DirecTV doesn't have enough trouble keeping customers, the satellite TV provider's streaming devices will show AI-generated screensaver ads next year, according to an announcement today from partnering ads company Glance.</p>
<p>People who use either of DirecTV’s two Gemini streaming devices will start seeing the ads “in early 2026,” per the announcement. DirecTV’s Gemini Air is an Android TV-powered USB device that people can plug into a TV for access to live TV channels, as well as streaming apps. Gemini Air doesn’t require a DirecTV satellite connection, and DirecTV gives all of its Internet customers the device. DirecTV first started selling Gemini devices <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/directv-introduces-new-gemini-cpe-gets-brian-cox-to-shill-for-it-in-new-ad-campaign">in 2023</a>, when it launched a separate Gemini set-top box that connects through DirecTV satellite setups.</p>
<p>DirecTV made an agreement with Glance to show AI-generated content and ads on Gemini devices' screensavers. Currently, Gemini devices show Google wallpapers as screensavers, which are on by default. When the new screensavers launch, Glance's AI content will show if the TV is idle for 10 minutes, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798174/directv-glance-ai-shoppable-screensavers">The Verge </a>reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/directv-screensavers-will-show-ai-generated-ads-with-your-face-in-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Meetings can be a real drain on productivity, but a new Gmail feature might at least cut down on the time you spend scheduling them. The company has <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/10/help-me-schedule-meeting-gmail-calendar.html">announced</a> "Help Me Schedule" is coming to Gmail, leveraging Gemini AI to recognize when you want to schedule a meeting and offering possible meeting times for the email recipient to choose.</p>
<p>The new meeting feature is reminiscent of Magic Cue on Google's latest Pixel phones. As you type emails, Gmail will be able to recognize when you are planning a meeting. A Help Me Schedule button will appear in the toolbar. Upon clicking, Google's AI will swing into action and find possible meeting times that match the context of your message and are available in your calendar.</p>
<p>When you engage with Help me schedule, the AI generates an in-line meeting widget for your message. The recipient can select the time that works for them, and that's it—the meeting is scheduled for both parties. What about meetings with more than one invitee? Google says the feature won't support groups at launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/gemini-can-now-help-schedule-meetings-in-gmail/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ever since a lawsuit accused <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">ChatGPT of becoming a teen's "suicide coach,"</a> OpenAI has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/critics-slam-openais-parental-controls-while-users-rage-treat-us-like-adults/">scrambling to make its chatbot safer</a>. Today, the AI firm unveiled the experts it hired to help make ChatGPT a healthier option for all users.</p>
<p>In a press release, OpenAI explained its Expert Council on Wellness and AI started taking form after OpenAI began informally consulting with experts on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-announces-parental-controls-for-chatgpt-after-teen-suicide-lawsuit/">parental controls earlier this year</a>. Now it's been formalized, bringing together eight "leading researchers and experts with decades of experience studying how technology affects our emotions, motivation, and mental health" to help steer ChatGPT updates.</p>
<p>One priority was finding "several council members with backgrounds in understanding how to build technology that supports healthy youth development," OpenAI said, "because teens use ChatGPT differently than adults."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/openai-unveils-wellness-council-suicide-prevention-expert-not-included/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The prospects of continued electric vehicle adoption in the US are in an odd place. As promised, the Trump administration and its congressional Republican allies killed off as many of the clean energy and EV incentives as they could after taking power in January. Ironically, though, the end of the clean vehicle tax credit on September 30 actually spurred the sales of EVs, as customers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the soon-to-disappear $7,500 credit.</p>
<p>Predictions for EV sales going forward aren't so rosy, and automakers are reacting by adjusting their product portfolio plans. Today, General Motors revealed that will result in a $1.6 billion hit to its balance sheet when it reports its Q3 results late this month, <a href="https://investor.gm.com/node/27881/html">according to its 8-K</a>.</p>
<p>Q3 was a decent one for GM, with sales up 8 percent year on year and up 10 percent for the year to date. GM EV sales look even better: up 104 percent for the year to date compared to the first nine months of 2024, with nearly 145,000 electric Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and GMCs finding homes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/gms-ev-push-will-cost-it-1-6-billion-in-q3-with-end-of-the-tax-credit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Today is the official end-of-support date for Microsoft's Windows 10. That doesn't mean these PCs will suddenly stop working, but if you don't take action, it does mean your PC has received its last regular security patches and that Microsoft is washing its hands of technical support.</p>
<p>This end-of-support date comes about a decade after the initial release of Windows 10, which is typical for most Windows versions. But it comes just four years after Windows 10 was replaced by Windows 11, a version with <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-system-requirements-86c11283-ea52-4782-9efd-7674389a7ba3">stricter system requirements</a> that left many older-but-still-functional PCs with no officially supported upgrade path. As a result, Windows 10 still runs on roughly 40 percent of the world's Windows PCs (or around a third of US-based PCs), <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america">according to StatCounter data</a>.</p>
<p>But this end-of-support date also isn't set in stone. Home users with Windows 10 PCs can enroll in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which extends the support timeline by another year. We've published directions for how to do this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/how-to-get-another-free-year-of-updates-for-your-windows-10-pc/">here</a>—while you do need one of the Microsoft accounts that the company is always pushing, it's relatively trivial to enroll in the ESU program for free.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-10-support-ends-today-but-its-just-the-first-of-many-deaths/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>"ChatGPT shouldn't have political bias in any direction."</p>
<p>That's OpenAI's stated goal in a new research paper <a href="https://openai.com/index/defining-and-evaluating-political-bias-in-llms/">released</a> Thursday about measuring and reducing political bias in its AI models. The company says that "people use ChatGPT as a tool to learn and explore ideas" and argues "that only works if they trust ChatGPT to be objective."</p>
<p>But a closer reading of OpenAI's paper reveals something different from what the company's framing of objectivity suggests. The company never actually defines what it means by "bias." And its evaluation axes show that it's focused on stopping ChatGPT from several behaviors: acting like it has personal political opinions, amplifying users' emotional political language, and providing one-sided coverage of contested topics.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-wants-to-stop-chatgpt-from-validating-users-political-views/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX closed a troubled but instructive chapter in its Starship rocket program Monday with a near-perfect test flight that carried the stainless steel spacecraft halfway around the world from South Texas to the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The rocket's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines roared to life at 6:23 pm CDT (7:23 pm EDT; 23:23 UTC), throttling up to generate some 16.7 million pounds of thrust, by large measure more powerful than any rocket before Starship. Moments later, the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket began a vertical climb away from SpaceX's test site in Starbase, Texas, near the US-Mexico border.</p>
<p>From then on, the rocket executed its flight plan like clockwork. This was arguably SpaceX's most successful Starship test flight to date. The only flight with a similar claim occurred one year ago Monday, when the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/spacex-catches-returning-rocket-in-mid-air-turning-a-fanciful-idea-into-reality/">caught the rocket's Super Heavy booster</a> back at the launch pad after soaring to the uppermost fringes of the atmosphere. But that flight didn't accomplish as much in space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/after-year-of-hardships-spacexs-starship-finally-flirts-with-perfection/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Android devices are vulnerable to a new attack that can covertly steal two-factor authentication codes, location timelines, and other private data in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The new attack, named Pixnapping by the team of academic researchers who devised it, requires a victim to first install a malicious app on an Android phone or tablet. The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed.</p>
<h2>Like taking a screenshot</h2>
<p>Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side channel</a> that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/no-fix-yet-for-attack-that-lets-hackers-pluck-2fa-codes-from-android-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Last week, officials in Greenville identified an eighth measles case that is potentially linked to the outbreak. Seven outbreak cases had been confirmed since September 25 in neighboring Spartanburg, where transmission was identified in two schools: Fairforest Elementary and Global Academy, a public charter school.</p>
<p>Across those two schools, at least 153 unvaccinated children were exposed to the virus and have been put in a 21-day quarantine, during which they are barred from attending school, state officials said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOoDM-Bn2g">a press conference</a>. Twenty-one days is the maximum incubation period, spanning from when a person is exposed to when they would develop a rash if infected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/over-150-unvaccinated-kids-quarantined-for-21-days-in-sc-measles-outbreak/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">experimenting with conversational image editing</a> earlier this year in the dev-focused AI studio, but the feature didn't remain experimental for long. Over the summer, Google rolled out the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/google-improves-gemini-ai-image-editing-with-nano-banana-model/">Nano Banana</a>" image-editing model in Gemini 2.5 Flash. You can use this feature to modify images with just a prompt, and now you don't even need to go to Gemini to use it. Google says Nano Banana is now coming to search, Google Photos, and NotebookLM.</p>
<p>The AI image editor is coming to search via Lens and AI Mode. For Lens, you can simply open the app (iOS and Android) and snap a photo to get started. When the rollout is complete, you'll see a "Create" button at the bottom, with a banana icon. Tap that to enter a prompt, telling the AI how you'd like the photo changed.</p>

  <div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative" style="aspect-ratio: 1.7777777777778;">

  </div>

  <figcaption>
    <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span>
      </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When you begin an edit in Lens, the Google app will display the results and offer the chance for follow-up edits in the AI Mode interface. Google is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/at-i-o-2025-google-leaves-no-doubt-that-ai-mode-is-the-future-of-search/">always looking</a> for more ways to get people plugged into its conversational search bot, so there's also a separate way to access Nano Banana there. Simply select the "Create image" tool and enter your prompt to create an image. You can then continue the conversation to have Nano Banana change the image.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/googles-nano-banana-ai-image-editor-is-coming-to-search-photos-and-notebooklm/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Liftoff of the Super Heavy booster with the Starship upper stage is scheduled for 6:15 pm CDT (7:15 pm EDT; 23:15 UTC). SpaceX has a 75-minute window to launch Monday. You can watch a livestream of the flight <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-11">here</a>.</p>
<p>SpaceX's control team, positioned a couple of miles away from the launch pad at Starbase, Texas, will oversee the loading of more than 10.5 million pounds of super-cold methane and liquid oxygen into the two-stage rocket beginning about an hour before liftoff. In the final minutes of the countdown, the world's largest rocket will undergo a steering check, and the launch director will give a final "go" for launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/starships-elementary-era-ends-today-with-mega-rockets-11th-test-flight/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>California is cracking down on AI technology deemed too harmful for kids, attacking two increasingly notorious child safety fronts: companion bots and deepfake pornography.</p>
<p>On Monday, Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/10/13/governor-newsom-signs-bills-to-further-strengthen-californias-leadership-in-protecting-children-online/">signed</a> the first-ever US law regulating companion bots after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/after-childs-trauma-chatbot-maker-allegedly-forced-mom-to-arbitration-for-100-payout/">several teen suicides</a> sparked lawsuits.</p>
<p>Moving forward, California will require any companion bot platforms—including ChatGPT, Grok, Character.AI, and the like—to create and make public "protocols to identify and address users’ suicidal ideation or expressions of self-harm."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/to-shield-kids-california-hikes-fake-nude-fines-to-250k-max/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple has lightly rebranded its video-on-demand streaming service. The Netflix rival that has brought us critically acclaimed shows and movies like <em>Slow Horses</em> and <em>The Lost Bus</em> has gone from Apple TV+ to Apple TV.</p>
<p>Apple announced the name change today in a press release that was primarily about the film <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/f1-the-movie-takes-motorsport-into-the-imax-age/">F1: The Movie</a> </em>coming to its streaming service on December 12. Unlike previous announcements, however, today’s release referred to the streaming service as Apple TV, instead of Apple TV+. The announcement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple didn’t specify how its streaming service’s “identity” has changed at all. As of this writing, accessing Apple’s streaming service via a browser or smart TV app still shows the original Apple TV+ branding.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/10/apple-tv-streaming-service-is-renamed-to-just-apple-tv/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The encryption protecting communications against criminal and nation-state snooping is under threat. As private industry and governments get closer to building useful quantum computers, the algorithms protecting Bitcoin wallets, encrypted web visits, and other sensitive secrets will be useless. No one doubts the day will come, but as the now-common joke in cryptography circles observes, experts have been forecasting this cryptocalypse will arrive in the next 15 to 30 years for the past 30 years.</p>
<p>The uncertainty has created something of an existential dilemma: Should network architects spend the billions of dollars required to wean themselves off quantum-vulnerable algorithms now, or should they prioritize their limited security budgets fighting more immediate threats such as ransomware and espionage attacks? Given the expense and no clear deadline, it’s little wonder that <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than half</a> of all TLS connections made inside the Cloudflare network and only <a href="https://trustfour.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 percent</a> of Fortune 500 networks support quantum-resistant TLS connections. It's all but certain that many fewer organizations still are supporting quantum-ready encryption in less prominent protocols.</p>
<h2>Triumph of the cypherpunks</h2>
<p>One exception to the industry-wide lethargy is the engineering team that designs the Signal Protocol, the open source engine that powers the world’s most robust and resilient form of end-to-end encryption for multiple private chat apps, most notably the <a href="https://signal.org/download/">Signal Messenger</a>. Eleven days ago, the nonprofit entity that develops the protocol, Signal Messenger LLC, published a 5,900-word write-up describing its latest updates that bring Signal a significant step toward being fully quantum-resistant.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/why-signals-post-quantum-makeover-is-an-amazing-engineering-achievement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A battle over the United Kingdom's Online Safety Act (OSA) heated up Monday as UK regulator Ofcom fined the notorious image-hosting board 4chan about $26,000 for failing to provide a risk assessment detailing the potential harms of illegal content hosted on its forum.</p>
<p>In a press release provided to Ars, Ofcom said 4chan refused to respond to two requests for information that the regulator considered "routine." The first asked for the risk assessment and the second for 4chan's "qualifying worldwide revenue."</p>
<p>4chan was anticipating the Monday fine, noting in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4chan-Kiwi-varms-v-Ofcom-Complaint-8-27-25.pdf">lawsuit</a>—which was jointly filed with the online trolling forum <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/cloudflare-explains-why-kiwi-farms-was-its-most-dangerous-customer-ever/">Kiwi Farms</a> in August and seeks to permanently enjoin Ofcom from enforcing OSA—that Ofcom had made it clear that because 4chan ignored Ofcom's emails, the fine was coming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/4chan-fined-26k-for-refusing-to-assess-risks-under-uk-online-safety-act/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>When Elon Musk started the company in 2002, he was joined by two other "founding" employees, Tom Mueller in propulsion and Chris Thompson in structures. Koenigsmann was the next hire, brought on to develop avionics for the Falcon 1 rocket.</p>
<p>Koenigsmann remained at the company for two decades before leaving SpaceX in late 2021. During that time, he transitioned from avionics to lead mission assurance and safety while also spearheading every major failure investigation of the Falcon 9 rocket. He was a beloved leader and mentor for his employees within the company's demanding culture.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/one-of-spacexs-earliest-employees-is-going-to-space-via-blue-origin/">Read full article</a></p>
