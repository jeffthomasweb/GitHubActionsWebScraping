                            <![CDATA[<p>Today marks the 50th anniversary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)"><em>Jaws</em></a>, Steven Spielberg's blockbuster horror movie based on the bestselling novel by Peter Benchley. We're marking the occasion with a tribute to this classic film and its enduring impact on the popular perception of sharks, shark conservation efforts, and our culture at large.</p>
<p><strong>(Many spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Jaws</em> tells the story of Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), the new police chief for Amity Island, a New England beach town and prime summer tourist attraction. But that thriving industry is threatened by a series of shark attacks, although the local mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), initially dismisses the possibility, ridiculing the findings of visiting marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). The attacks keep escalating and the body count grows, until the town hires a grizzled shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt down and kill the great white shark, with the help of Brody and Hooper.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/a-shark-scientist-reflects-on-jaws-at-50/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The 7.3Tbps attack amounted to 37.4 terabytes of junk traffic that hit the target in just 45 seconds. That's an almost incomprehensible amount of data, equivalent to more than 9,300 full-length HD movies or 7,500 hours of HD streaming content in well under a minute.</p>
<h2>Indiscriminate target bombing</h2>
<p>Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/defending-the-internet-how-cloudflare-blocked-a-monumental-7-3-tbps-ddos/">said</a> the attackers “carpet bombed” an average of nearly 22,000 destination ports of a single IP address belonging to the target, identified only as a Cloudflare customer. A total of 34,500 ports were targeted, indicating the thoroughness and well-engineered nature of the attack.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/record-ddos-pummels-site-with-once-unimaginable-7-3tbps-of-junk-traffic/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Microsoft's Azure Quantum group announced that it has settled on a plan for getting error correction on quantum computers. While the company pursues <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/microsoft-builds-its-first-qubits-lays-out-roadmap-for-quantum-computing/">its own hardware efforts</a>, the Azure team is a platform provider that currently gives access to several distinct types of hardware qubits. So it has chosen a scheme that is suitable for several different quantum computing technologies (notably excluding its own). The company estimates that the system it has settled on can take hardware qubits with an error rate of about 1 in 1,000 and use them to build logical qubits where errors are instead 1 in 1 million.</p>
<p>While it's describing the scheme in terms of mathematical proofs and simulations, it hasn't shown that it works using actual hardware yet. But one of its partners, Atom Computing, is accompanying the announcement with a description of how its machine is capable of performing all the operations that will be needed.</p>
<h2>Arbitrary connections</h2>
<p>There are similarities and differences between what the company is talking about today and IBM's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ibm-is-now-detailing-what-its-first-quantum-compute-system-will-look-like/">recent update of its roadmap</a>, which described another path to error-resistant quantum computing. In IBM's case, it makes both the software stack that will perform the error correction and the hardware needed to implement it. It uses chip-based hardware, with the connections among qubits mediated by wiring that's laid out when the chip is fabricated. Since error correction schemes require a very specific layout of connections among qubits, once IBM decides on a quantum error correction scheme, it can design chips with the wiring needed to implement that scheme.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/microsoft-lays-out-its-path-to-useful-quantum-computing/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>MIT graduate student Alex Kachkine once spent nine months meticulously restoring a damaged baroque Italian painting, which left him plenty of time to wonder if technology could speed things up. Last week, MIT News <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/restoring-damaged-paintings-using-ai-generated-mask-0611">announced</a> his solution: a technique that uses AI-generated polymer films to physically restore damaged paintings in hours rather than months. The research <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09045-4">appears</a> in Nature.</p>
<p>Kachkine's method works by printing a transparent "mask" containing thousands of precisely color-matched regions that conservators can apply directly to an original artwork. Unlike traditional restoration, which permanently alters the painting, these masks can reportedly be removed whenever needed. So it's a reversible process that does not permanently change a painting.</p>
<p>"Because there's a digital record of what mask was used, in 100 years, the next time someone is working with this, they'll have an extremely clear understanding of what was done to the painting," Kachkine told MIT News. "And that's never really been possible in conservation before."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/mit-student-prints-ai-polymer-masks-to-restore-paintings-in-hours/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>About two months after receiving a donated kidney, a 61-year-old man ended up back in the hospital. He was tired, nauseous, and vomiting. He was also excessively thirsty and producing too much urine. Over the next 10 days, things only got worse. The oxygen levels in his blood began to fall. His lungs filled with fluid. He kept vomiting. He couldn't eat. Doctors inserted a feeding tube. His oxygen levels and blood pressure kept falling. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation. Still, things kept getting worse.</p>
<p>At that point, he was transferred to the ICU of Massachusetts General Hospital, where he had received the transplant. He was in acute respiratory failure and shock.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510">a case report in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, doctors at Mass General explained how they determined what was wrong with the man. Their first steps were collecting more information about the man's symptoms from his wife, reviewing his family medical history, and contacting the regional organ-procurement organization that provided the kidney.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/mans-health-crashes-after-getting-donated-kidney-it-was-riddled-with-worms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The original <em>Pac-Man</em> is unquestionably a video game classic, well deserving of its position in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/first-gaming-hall-of-fame-class-includes-pong-tetris-and-mario/">the inaugural class of the Strong Museum of Play's World Video Game Hall of Fame</a>. But playing the unmodified 1980 release these days can feel a little slow-paced and repetitive, given advancements in game design and taste in the intervening decades.</p>
<p>So when I noticed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playables/Ugkxh6_qVyD8REm5RO9C3X1wEpFNk-o3E02t">a game called <em>Pac-Man Superfast</em></a> sitting under a "YouTube Playables" heading on Google's popular video site the other day, my first thought was "Wait, how fast is 'superfast' exactly?" My second thought was, "Wait, what the heck is YouTube Playables?"</p>

      Looks familiar, except for that speed gauge in the corner....

<p>You'd be forgiven for not knowing about YouTube Playables. Few seemed to note <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-playables/">its official announcement last year</a> as a collection of free-to-play web games <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables">built for the web using standard rendering APIs</a>. The seeming competitor to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/netflix-now-comes-with-free-android-video-games-for-paying-subscribers/">Netflix's mobile gaming offerings</a> is <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328604">still described in an official FAQ</a> as "an experimental feature rolled out to select users in eligible countries/regions," which doesn't make this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">post-Stadia gaming effort</a> seem like a huge priority for Google.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/one-of-the-best-pac-man-games-in-years-is-playable-on-youtube-of-all-places/">Read full article</a></p>

You may have noticed we are a little late with the report this week, and that is due to the Juneteenth holiday celebrated in the United States on Thursday. But that hasn't stopped a torrent of big news this week, from exploding Starships to significant reuse milestones being reached in Asia.</p>

<p><strong>Honda stamps passport to the skies with a hopper</strong>. An experimental reusable rocket developed by the research and development arm of Honda Motor Company flew to an altitude of nearly 900 feet (275 meters) Tuesday, then landed with pinpoint precision at the carmaker's test facility in northern Japan, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/hondas-hopper-suddenly-makes-the-japanese-carmaker-a-serious-player-in-rocketry/">Ars reports</a>. Honda's hopper is the first prototype rocket outside of the United States and China to complete a flight of this kind, demonstrating vertical takeoff and vertical landing technology that could underpin the development of a reusable launch vehicle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/rocket-report-two-big-asian-reuse-milestones-vandenberg-becomes-spacex-west/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amazon Prime Video subscribers aren’t the only streaming customers being subjected to longer commercial breaks lately. Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD) Max has increased the amount of commercials it shows to US subscribers from approximately four minutes per hour to about six minutes per hour.</p>
<p>A US <a href="https://help.max.com/us-en/Answer/Detail/000002520">support page</a> for Max currently says that subscribers to Max with ads “can expect about 6 minutes of ads per hour.” But <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2820461/its-not-just-prime-video-max-shows-50-more-ads-now.html">PCWorld</a> noticed this week that this differs from what Max used to claim, which as recently as February was “about 4 minutes” of ads an hour, per the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250216204517/https:/help.max.com/us/Answer/Detail/000002520">Wayback Machine</a>. Some of Max’s geographies have smaller ad loads. For example, WBD's support page <a href="https://help.max.com/kn-en/Answer/Detail/000002520">for Saint Kitts and Nevis</a> says Max ad subscribers should expect about four minutes of ads hourly.</p>
<p>A 50 percent increase in the duration of commercials that US subscribers see puts Max’s ad load on par with that of Prime Video, which AdWeek reported last week also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/amazon-prime-video-subscribers-sit-through-up-to-6-minutes-of-ads-per-hour/">increased its ad load</a> from four minutes per hour to six minutes per hour. For comparison, Netflix shows four to five minutes of ads per hour, according to earlier <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/815640/netflix-with-ads-plan-price-release-date.html">PC World</a> reporting, and Peacock shows to five to seven minutes of ads hourly, per <a href="https://thestreamable.com/how-many-ads-do-you-really-see-when-watching-peacock-originals-vs-licensed-content-ad-break-length-more">The Streamable</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/maxs-longer-commercial-breaks-bring-ad-load-to-6-minutes-per-hour/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent years, numerous plaintiffs—including publishers of books, newspapers, computer code, and photographs—have <a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/the-ai-community-needs-to-take-copyright" rel="">sued AI companies</a> for training models using copyrighted material. A key question in all of these lawsuits has been how easily AI models produce verbatim excerpts from the plaintiffs’ copyrighted content.</p>
<p>For example, in its <a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/why-the-new-york-times-sued-microsoft" rel="">December 2023 lawsuit</a> against OpenAI, The New York Times Company produced dozens of examples where GPT-4 exactly reproduced significant passages from Times stories. In its <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/open-ai-motion-to-dismiss-ny-times.pdf" rel="">response</a>, OpenAI described this as a “fringe behavior” and a “problem that researchers at OpenAI and elsewhere work hard to address.”</p>
<p>But is it actually a fringe behavior? And have leading AI companies addressed it? <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12546" rel="">New research</a>—focusing on books rather than newspaper articles and on different companies—provides surprising insights into this question. Some of the findings should bolster plaintiffs’ arguments, while others may be more helpful to defendants.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/06/study-metas-llama-3-1-can-recall-42-percent-of-the-first-harry-potter-book/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Israel-linked hacker group known as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/predatory-sparrow-cyberattack-timeline/">Predatory Sparrow</a> has carried out some of the most disruptive and destructive cyberattacks in history, twice disabling thousands of gas station payment systems across Iran and once even setting a steel mill in the country on fire. Now, in the midst of a new war unfolding between the two countries, they appear to be bent on burning Iran's financial system.</p>
<p>Predatory Sparrow, which often goes by its Farsi name, Gonjeshke Darande, in an effort to appear as a homegrown hacktivist organization, announced in a post on on its X account Wednesday that it had targeted the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, accusing the exchange of enabling sanctions violations and terrorist financing on behalf of the Iranian regime. According to cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic, the hackers <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/iranian-crypto-exchange-nobitex-hacked-pro-israel-group" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/iranian-crypto-exchange-nobitex-hacked-pro-israel-group" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">destroyed more than $90 million</a> in Nobitex holdings, a rare instance of hackers burning crypto assets rather than stealing them.</p>
<p>“These cyberattacks are the result of Nobitex being a key regime tool for financing terrorism and violating sanctions,” the hackers posted to X. “Associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts your assets at risk.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/israel-tied-predatory-sparrow-hackers-are-waging-cyberwar-on-irans-financial-system/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX's next Starship rocket exploded during a ground test in South Texas late Wednesday, dealing another blow to a program already struggling to overcome three consecutive failures in recent months.</p>
<p>The late-night explosion at SpaceX's rocket development complex in Starbase, Texas, destroyed the bullet-shaped upper stage that was slated to launch on the next Starship test flight. The powerful blast set off fires around SpaceX's Massey's Test Site, located a few miles from the company's Starship factory and launch pads.</p>
<p>Live streaming video from NASASpaceflight.com and LabPadre media organizations with cameras positioned around Starbase showed the 15-story-tall rocket burst into flames shortly after 11:00 pm local time (12:00 am EDT; 04:00 UTC). Local residents as far as 30 miles away reported seeing and feeling the blast.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/starships-rough-year-gets-worse-after-a-late-night-explosion-in-south-texas/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Critics have long warned that Donald Trump's pro-cryptocurrency push as president, coupled with his links to his family's growing crypto empire, creates substantial conflicts of interest that must be probed.</p>
<p>But so far, nothing has stopped Trump's family from seemingly benefiting from the presidency while expanding their empire. And now, Trump is rushing regulation through Congress that many Democrats fear could create his biggest conflict of interest yet.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill that will regulate stablecoins in the US, establishing guardrails and consumer protections that may spur wider crypto adoption nationwide. Unlike more volatile forms of cryptocurrency—like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/bitcoin-plunges-as-crypto-fans-didnt-get-everything-they-wanted-from-trump/">Trump's controversial memecoin</a>—stablecoins' value can be pegged to the US dollar. The crypto industry is hoping the House of Representatives will quickly send the bill to Trump's desk, which Trump has demanded happen by August.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/senate-passes-genius-act-criticized-as-gifting-trump-ample-opportunity-to-grift/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>DENVER—Most smart TV operating system (OS) owners are in the ad sales business now. Software providers for budget and premium TVs are honing their ad skills, which requires advancing their ability to collect user data. This is creating an “inherent conflict” within the industry, Takashi Nakano, VP of content and programming at Samsung TV Plus, said at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/inside-the-firm-turning-eerie-blank-streaming-ads-into-useful-nonprofit-messages/">StreamTV Show</a> in Denver last week.</p>
<p>During a panel at StreamTV Insider’s conference entitled “CTV OS Leader Roundtable: From Drivers to Engagement and Content Strategy,” Nakano acknowledged the opposing needs of advertisers and smart TV users, who are calling for a reasonable amount of data privacy.</p>
<p>“Do you want your data sold out there and everyone to know exactly what you’ve been watching … the answer is generally no,” the Samsung executive said. “Yet, advertisers want all of this data. They wanna know exactly what you ate for breakfast."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/tv-brands-face-inherent-conflict-over-user-privacy-advertiser-data-demands/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tech support scammers have devised a method to inject their fake phone numbers into webpages when a target's web browser visits official sites for Apple, PayPal, Netflix, and other companies.</p>
<p>The ruse, outlined in a <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/scammers-hijack-websites-of-bank-of-america-netflix-microsoft-and-more-to-insert-fake-phone-number">post on Wednesday</a> from security firm Malwarebytes, threatens to trick users into calling the malicious numbers even when they think they're taking measures to prevent falling for such scams. One of the more common pieces of security advice is to carefully scrutinize the address bar of a browser to ensure it's pointing to an organization’s official website. The ongoing scam is able to bypass such checks.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>With ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the country's top health position, use of a long-approved vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella/chickenpox (MMRV) as well as flu shots that include the preservative thimerosal will now be reevaluated, putting their future availability and use in question. The development seemingly continues to vindicate health experts' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-expected-to-rebuild-cdc-panel-with-anti-vaxxers-he-claims-he-wont/">worst fears</a> that, as health secretary, Kennedy would attack and dismantle the federal government's scientifically rigorous, evidence-based vaccine recommendations.</p>
<p>Discussions of the two types of vaccines now appear <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-18.pdf">on the agenda</a> of a meeting for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) scheduled for two days next week (June 25 and 26).</p>
<h2>ACIP’s overhaul</h2>
<p>On June 9, Kennedy summarily <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-fires-entire-cdc-panel-of-vaccine-advisors/">fired all 17 members of ACIP</a>, who were rigorously vetted—esteemed scientists and clinicians in the fields of immunology, epidemiology, pediatrics, obstetrics, internal and family medicine, geriatrics, infectious diseases, and public health. Two days later, Kennedy installed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/yep-rfk-jr-appoints-anti-vaccine-advocates-to-cdc-vaccine-panel/">eight new members</a>, many with dubious qualifications and several known to hold anti-vaccine views.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/after-rfk-jr-overhauls-cdc-panel-measles-and-flu-vaccines-are-up-for-debate/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Results are consistent with two earlier studies dating the footprints to between 22,000 and 24,000 years ago.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The 2009 discovery of footprints (human and animal) left behind in layers of clay and silt at New Mexico’s White Sands National Park sparked a contentious debate about when, exactly, human cultures first developed in North America. Until about a decade ago, it seemed as if the first Americans arrived near the end of the last Ice Age and were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/new-study-adds-evidence-to-debate-over-the-only-known-clovis-burial/">part of the Clovis culture</a>, named for the distinctive projectile points they left behind near what’s now Clovis, New Mexico. But various dating methods indicated the White Sands footprints are 10,000 years older. Now there is a fresh independent analysis that agrees with those earlier findings, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv4951">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/23000-year-old-footprints-suggest-people-reached-the-americas-early/">previously reported</a>, earlier archaeological evidence had suggested the Clovis people made their way southward through a corridor that opened up in the middle of the ice sheets between 13,000 and 16,000 years ago. Subsequent archaeological evidence—such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/underwater-discovery-reveals-14550-year-old-florida-mastodon-hunters/">a 14,500-year-old site in Florida</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/16000-year-old-site-in-idaho-indicates-people-sailed-around-the-ice-sheet/">stone tools dating to 16,000 years ago in western Idaho</a>—suggested that the Clovis people were actually not the first to arrive. It also made it look much more likely that the first Americans had skirted the edge of the ice sheets along the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>The White Sands footprints further muddled the narrative. In 2019, Bournemouth University archaeologist Matthew Bennett and his colleagues excavated the White Sands area and found a total of 61 human footprints east of an area called Alkali Flat, which was once the bed and shoreline of an ancient lake. Over time, as the lake’s edge expanded and contracted with shifts in climate, it left behind distinct layers of clay, silt, and sand. Seven of those layers, in the area Bennett and his colleagues excavated, held human tracks along with those of long-lost megafauna.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/study-confirms-white-sands-footprints-are-23000-years-old/">Read full article</a></p>

To ensure there's time for what the NAACP considers urgently needed negotiations ahead of filing the lawsuit, lawyers asked xAI to come to the table within the next 20 days.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><span class="bolded">Earlier this year,</span> a biomedical researcher at the University of Michigan received an update from the National Institutes of Health. The federal agency, which funds a large swath of the country’s medical science, had given the green light to begin releasing funding for the upcoming year on the researcher’s multi-year grant.</p>
<p>Not long after, the researcher learned that the university had placed the grant on hold. The school’s lawyers, it turned out, were wrestling with a difficult question: whether to accept new terms in the Notice of Award, a legal document that outlines the grant’s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Other researchers at the university were having the same experience. Indeed, Undark’s reporting suggests that the University of Michigan—among the top three university recipients of NIH funding in 2024, with more than $750 million in grants—had quietly frozen some, perhaps all, of its incoming NIH funding dating back to at least the second half of April.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/via-the-false-claims-act-nih-puts-universities-on-edge/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The blackout that took down the Iberian grid serving Spain and Portugal in April was the result of a number of smaller interacting problems, according to an investigation by the Spanish government. The report concludes that several steps meant to address a small instability made matters worse, eventually leading to a self-reinforcing cascade where high voltages caused power plants to drop off the grid, thereby increasing the voltage further. Critically, the report suggests that the Spanish grid operator had an unusually low number of plants on call to stabilize matters, and some of the ones it did have responded poorly.</p>
<p>The full report will be available later today; however, the government <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/2702b812ce1f3e6da64933b9d/files/f543f912-b15e-d3ae-8a8a-e393bf6fdfb6/20250617_NdP_Se_presenta_el_informe_del_Comit_eacute__de_an_aacute_lisis_de_la.pdf">released a summary</a> ahead of its release. The document includes a timeline of the events that triggered the blackout, as well as an analysis of why grid management failed to keep it in check. It also notes that a parallel investigation checked for indications of a cyberattack and found none.</p>
<h2>Oscillations and a cascade</h2>
<p>The document notes that for several days prior to the blackout, the Iberian grid had been experiencing voltage fluctuations—products of a mismatch between supply and demand—that had been managed without incident. These continued through the morning of April 28 until shortly after noon, when an unusual frequency oscillation occurred. This oscillation has been traced back to a single facility on the grid, but the report doesn't identify it or even indicate its type, simply referring to it as an "instalación."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/spanish-blackout-report-power-plants-meant-to-stabilize-voltage-didnt/">Read full article</a></p>
