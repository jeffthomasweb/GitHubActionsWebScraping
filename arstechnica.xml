                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, OpenAI engineer Michael Bolin <a href="https://openai.com/index/unrolling-the-codex-agent-loop/">published</a> a detailed technical breakdown of how the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-introduces-codex-its-first-full-fledged-ai-agent-for-coding/">Codex CLI</a> coding agent works internally, offering developers insight into AI coding tools that can write code, run tests, and fix bugs with human supervision. It complements our article <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">in December</a> on how AI agents work by filling in technical details on how OpenAI implements its "agentic loop."</p>
<p>AI coding agents are having something of a "ChatGPT moment," where Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and Codex with GPT-5.2 have reached a new level of usefulness for rapidly coding up prototypes, interfaces, and churning out boilerplate code. The timing of OpenAI's post details the design philosophy behind Codex just as AI agents are becoming more practical tools for everyday work.</p>
<p>These tools aren't perfect and remain controversial for some software developers. While OpenAI has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">previously told</a> Ars Technica that it uses Codex as a coding tool to help develop the Codex product itself, we also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/">discovered</a>, through hands-on experience, that these tools can be astonishingly fast at simple tasks but remain brittle beyond their training data and require human oversight for production work. The rough framework of a project tends to come fast and feels magical, but filling in the details involves tedious debugging and workarounds for limitations the agent cannot overcome on its own.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/openai-spills-technical-details-about-how-its-ai-coding-agent-works/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The chair of a federal vaccine advisory panel under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made his stance clear on vaccines in a podcast last week—and that stance was so alarming that the American Medical Association was compelled to respond with a scathing statement.</p>
<p>Kirk Milhoan, who was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/meet-cdcs-new-lead-vaccine-advisor-who-thinks-shots-cause-heart-disease/">named chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices</a> for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in December, appeared on the aptly named podcast "<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-conversation-w-dr-kirk-milhoan-chair-of-acip-on/id1788335471?i=1000746190751">Why Should I Trust You</a>." In the hour-long interview, Milhoan made a wide range of comments that have concerned medical experts and raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>Early into the discussion, Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist, declared, "I don't like established science," and that "science is what I observe." He lambasted the evidence-based methodology that previous ACIP panels used to carefully and transparently craft vaccine policy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/do-we-really-need-polio-shots-deep-thoughts-by-rfk-jr-advisor-get-dragged/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>From the Department of Bizarre Anomalies: Microsoft has suppressed an unexplained anomaly on its network that was routing traffic destined to example.com—a domain reserved for testing purposes—to a maker of electronics cables located in Japan.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2606">RFC2606</a>—an official standard maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force—example.com isn't obtainable by any party. Instead it resolves to IP addresses assigned to Internet Assiged Names Authority. The designation is intended to prevent third parties from being bombarded with traffic when developers, penetration testers, and others need a domain for testing or discussing technical issues. Instead of naming an Internet-routable domain, they are to choose example.com or two others, example.net and example.org.</p>
<h2>Misconfig gone, but is it fixed?</h2>
<p>Output from the terminal command cURL shows that devices inside Azure and other Microsoft networks have been routing some traffic to subdomains of sei.co.jp, a domain belonging to Sumitomo Electric. Most of the resulting text is exactly what’s expected. The exception is the JSON-based response.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple is introducing a new version of its AirTag tracking device—simply dubbed "the new AirTag"—and claims it offers substantial improvements thanks to a new Bluetooth chip.</p>
<p>The original AirTag came out five years ago now, and it became popular in a variety of contexts. There were some problems, though—there was real concern about unwanted tracking and stalking with the devices, based on real stories of it being used for that. The company gradually introduced new features and protections against that, getting it to a much better place.</p>
<p>This new version is focused on making the device more effective in general. Thanks to the inclusion of the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip (the same one found in other recently released Apple devices like the iPhone 17), Apple says the new AirTag can work with the Precision Finding feature in the Find My app to direct users to the AirTag (and whatever lost item it's stored with or attached to) from up to 50 percent farther away.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/apple-introduces-new-airtag-with-better-range-and-a-louder-speaker/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Transportation apparently thinks it's a good idea to use artificial intelligence to draft rules impacting the safety of airplanes, cars, and pipelines, a ProPublica investigation <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-artificial-intelligence-google-gemini-transportation-regulations">revealed</a> Monday.</p>
<p>It could be a problem if DOT becomes the first agency to use AI to draft rules, ProPublica pointed out, since AI is known to confidently get things wrong and hallucinate fabricated information. Staffers fear that any failure to catch AI errors could result in flawed laws, leading to lawsuits, injuries, or even deaths in the transportation system.</p>
<p>But the DOT's top lawyer, Gregory Zerzan, isn't worried about that, December meeting notes revealed, because the point isn't for AI to be perfect. It's for AI to help speed up the rulemaking process, so that rules that take weeks or months to draft can instead be written within 30 days. According to Zerzan, DOT's preferred tool, Google Gemini, can draft rules in under 30 minutes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/wildly-irresponsible-dots-use-of-ai-to-draft-safety-rules-sparks-concerns/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In early 2025, Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2026/01/22/microsoft-gave-fbi-keys-to-unlock-bitlocker-encrypted-data/">reports</a>, investigators at the FBI served Microsoft with a warrant seeking the BitLocker encryption recovery keys for several laptops it believed held evidence of fraud in Guam's COVID-19 unemployment assistance program. And Microsoft complied with the FBI's request.</p>
<p>BitLocker is the name of the full-disk encryption technology that has been part of Windows for nearly two decades. Though initially only available to owners of the Pro editions of Windows who turned it on manually, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/windows-8-1-includes-seamless-automatic-disk-encryption-if-your-pc-supports-it/">during the Windows 8 era</a> Microsoft began using BitLocker to encrypt local disks automatically for all Windows 11 Home and Pro PCs that signed in with a Microsoft account. Using BitLocker in this way also uploads a recovery key for your device to Microsoft's servers—this makes it possible to unlock your disk so you don't lose data if something goes wrong with your system, or if you install a CPU upgrade or some other hardware change that breaks BitLocker. But it also (apparently) makes it possible for Microsoft to unlock your disk, too.</p>
<p>A Microsoft rep said that the company handled "around 20" similar BitLocker recovery key requests from government authorities per year, and that these requests often fail because users haven't stored their recovery keys on Microsoft's servers. Microsoft and other tech companies have generally <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/fbi-microsoft-bitlocker-backdoor">refused requests</a> to install universal encryption backdoors for law enforcement purposes, and some companies (like Apple) <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/09/22/tahoe-filevault-icloud-keychain-and-ssh/">claim</a> to store device encryption keys using another layer of encryption that renders the keys inaccessible to the company.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/how-to-encrypt-your-pcs-disk-without-giving-the-keys-to-microsoft/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SA9ohTuGl4Q?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Universal Pictures and Illumination dropped a new trailer for the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie,</em> and gaming fans will no doubt be delighted at the news that Yoshi, the little green dinosaur, features prominently, along with plenty of other Easter eggs for sharp-eyed fans.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/11/nintendo-drops-official-trailer-for-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">previously reported</a>, the first attempt at a Super Mario movie adaptation in 1993 was notoriously a <a href="https://collider.com/super-mario-bros-movie-1993-history-explained/">dismal failure</a>, although it still has its ’90s-nostalgic fans. But 2023’s <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> won over gaming fans who were skeptical about another adaptation—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/review-the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-a-madcap-love-letter-to-fans/">including</a> Ars Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland.</p>
<p>The 2023 film reintroduced Mario and Luigi, two tight-knit but struggling Brooklyn plumbers who got separated when they unexpectedly fell into the fantastical Mushroom Kingdom. Mario sought Princess Peach’s help to rescue his brother from the evil clutches of Bowser, ruler of the Dark Lands, who was keen to marry Peach and threatened to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom with a Super Star if she refused him. So Peach led Mario on a quest to recruit allies and stop Bowser for good. They succeeded, shrinking Bowser and imprisoning him in a jar. Mario and Luigi moved to the Mushroom Kingdom and continued their plumbing work there.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/yoshi-joins-the-fun-in-latest-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>TikTok has been glitching for US users since Sunday, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-finalizes-trump-deal-that-allows-bytedance-to-maintain-some-control/">TikTok's new US owners</a> finally confirmed the cause: a power outage at a US data center.</p>
<p>"Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a US data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate," the TikTok USDS Joint Venture posted on X on Monday morning. "We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon."</p>
<p>By Monday evening, the issues had not been resolved, with the TikTok USDS account posting an update warning users to expect "bugs, slower load times, or timed-out requests, including when posting new content." The X post directly confronted creator concerns about receiving "0 views" on new videos and/or missing earnings. The glitch is temporary, TikTok USDS said, "your actual data and engagement are safe."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-glitches-caused-by-data-center-power-outage-us-joint-venture-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the years, hackers and modders at large have <a href="https://canitrundoom.org/">made it their mission</a> to port classic first-person shooter <em>Doom</em> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/someone-made-a-captcha-where-you-play-doom-on-nightmare-difficulty/">practically</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/can-it-run-doom-gut-bacteria-edition/">anything</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/can-it-run-doom-gut-bacteria-edition/">a display</a>. Recently, though, coder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arin-sarkisian/">Arin Sarkisan</a> has taken the "Can it Run <em>Doom</em>?" idea in an unlikely direction: wireless earbuds that aren't designed to output graphics at all.</p>
<p>To be clear, this hack doesn't apply to any generic set of earbuds. <a href="https://doombuds.com/">The "Doombuds" project</a> is designed specifically for the <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinebuds-pro-open-firmware-capable-anc-wireless-earbuds/">PineBuds Pro</a>, which are unique in featuring <a href="https://github.com/pine64/OpenPineBuds">completely open source firmware</a> and <a href="https://pine64.org/documentation/PineBuds_Pro/Software/">a community-maintained SDK</a>.</p>
<p>That means Sarkisan was able to <a href="https://github.com/arin-s/DOOMBUDS-JS">code up a JavaScript interface</a> that uses the earbuds' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART contact pads</a> to send <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/video/codec/mjpeg.html">a heavily compressed MJPEG video stream</a> to a web server (via a serial server). The 2.4 MB/s data stream from the UART connection can put out about 22 to 27 frames per second in this format, which is more than enough for a CPU that can only run the game at a maximum of 18 fps anyway.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/how-to-get-doom-running-on-a-pair-of-earbuds/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The billionaire entrepreneur has come under scrutiny from regulators around the world this month after people began using Grok to generate deepfakes of people without consent. The images were posted on the X social network as well as the separate Grok app, both of which are run by xAI.</p>
<p>The probe, announced on Monday under the EU’s Digital Services Act, will assess if xAI tried to mitigate the risks of deploying Grok’s tools on X and the proliferation of content that “may amount to child sexual abuse material.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/eu-launches-formal-investigation-of-xai-over-groks-sexualized-deepfakes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Crew members traveling to the lunar surface on NASA's Artemis missions should be gearing up for a grind. They will wear heavier spacesuits than those worn by the Apollo astronauts, and NASA will ask them to do more than the first Moonwalkers did more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p>The Moonwalking experience will amount to an "extreme physical event" for crews selected for the Artemis program's first lunar landings, a former NASA astronaut told a panel of researchers, physicians, and engineers convened by the National Academies.</p>
<p>Kate Rubins, who <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-astronaut-kate-rubins-first-to-sequence-dna-in-space-retires/">retired from the space agency</a> last year, presented <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/projects/DEPS-SSB-24-06/event/46213">the committee</a> with her views on the health risks for astronauts on lunar missions.

                            <![CDATA[<p>A decade is a long time for a TV series; no single iteration of<i> Star Trek </i>has made it that far.</p>
<p>But “a <i>Star Trek</i> podcast by two guys just a little bit embarrassed to have a <i>Star Trek </i>podcast” has now passed the milestone. January 25, 2026, marks a full decade since <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, my favorite podcast, debuted. Like a bottle of Château Picard, the show<em> </em>has only improved with age. (I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/if-you-grew-up-watching-st-tng-then-youll-love-this-new-podcast/">interviewed the guys behind the show</a> back in 2016 when they were just getting started.)</p>
<p>The podcast helped me rediscover, and appreciate more fully, <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation—</i>which is also my favorite TV show. <em>The Greatest Generation</em> continues to delight with its irreverent humor, its celebration of the most minor of characters, and its technical fascination with how a given episode was made.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/a-decade-of-star-trek-themed-fart-jokes-the-greatest-generation-podcast-turns-10/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Graphene is the thinnest material yet known, composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. That structure gives it many unusual properties that hold great promise for real-world applications: batteries, super capacitors, antennas, water filters, transistors, solar cells, and touchscreens, just to name a few. The physicists who first synthesized graphene in the lab won the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2010/summary/">2010 Nobel Prize in Physics</a>. But 19th century inventor Thomas Edison may have unknowingly created graphene as a byproduct of his original experiments on incandescent bulbs over a century earlier, according to a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c12759">new paper</a> published in the journal ACS Nano.</p>
<p>“To reproduce what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a> did, with the tools and knowledge we have now, is very exciting,” <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2026/rice-researchers-replicating-edisons-1879-light-bulb-experiments-show-graphene-may-have">said co-author James Tour</a>, a chemist at Rice University. “Finding that he could have produced graphene inspires curiosity about what other information lies buried in historical experiments. What questions would our scientific forefathers ask if they could join us in the lab today? What questions can we answer when we revisit their work through a modern lens?”</p>
<p>Edison didn't invent the concept of incandescent lamps; there were several versions predating his efforts. However, they generally had a very short life span and required high electric current, so they weren't well suited to Edison's vision of large-scale commercialization. He experimented with different filament materials starting with carbonized cardboard and compressed lampblack. This, too, quickly burnt out, as did filaments made with various grasses and canes, like hemp and palmetto. Eventually Edison discovered that carbonized bamboo made for the best filament, with life spans over 1,200 hours using a 110 volt power source.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/did-edison-accidentally-make-graphene-in-1879/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old man in Taiwan went to a dermatology clinic for a strange rash that had developed across his shoulders and chest. The raised, red, and itchy condition had been bothering him for a full month. By this point, he had also developed patches of pigmented skin interlaced with the red rash.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2514242?logout=true">a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, a skin biopsy showed swelling between his skin cells and inflammation around blood vessels, but testing came up negative for other common signs of skin conditions, leaving doctors with few leads. The doctors ultimately came to a diagnosis not by analyzing his skin further but by hearing about his diet.</p>

<p>The man told doctors that two months prior to his clinic appointment—a month before his rash developed—he had switched to a ketogenic diet, which is a high-fat but very low-carbohydrate eating pattern. This diet forces the body to shift from using glucose (sugar derived from carbohydrates) as an energy source to fat instead.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/a-weird-itchy-rash-is-linked-to-the-keto-diet-but-no-one-knows-why/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>If you've ever fallen down <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/fokmsp/stuck_in_quarantine_heres_a_list_of_wikipedia/">a Wikipedia rabbit hole</a> or spent a pleasant evening digging through college library stacks, you know the joy of a good research puzzle. Every new source and cross-reference you find unlocks an incremental understanding of a previously unknown world, forming a piecemeal tapestry of knowledge that you can eventually look back at as a cohesive and well-known whole.</p>
<p><em>TR-49</em> takes this research process and operationalizes it into an engrossing and novel piece of heavily non-linear interactive fiction. Researching the myriad sources contained in the game's mysterious computer slowly reveals a tale that's part mystery, part sci-fi allegory, part family drama, and all-compelling alternate academic history.</p>
<h2>Steampunk Wikipedia</h2>
<p>The entirety of <em>TR-49</em> takes place from a first-person perspective as you sit in front of a kind of Steampunk-infused computer terminal. An unseen narrator asks you to operate the machine but is initially cagey about how or why or what you're even looking for. There's a creepy vibe to the under-explained circumstances that brought you to this situation, but the game never descends into the jump scares or horror tropes of so many other modern titles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/tr-49-is-interactive-fiction-for-fans-of-deep-research-rabbit-holes/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Intel reported <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1759/intel-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial">its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2025 yesterday</a>, and the news both for the quarter and for the year was mixed: year-over-year revenue was down nearly imperceptibly, from $53.1 billion to $52.9 billion, while revenue for the quarter was down about four percent, from $14.3 billion last year to $13.7 billion this year. (That number was, nevertheless, on the high end of Intel's guidance for the quarter, which ranged from $12.8 to $13.8 billion.)</p>
<p>Diving deeper into the numbers makes it clear exactly where money is being made and lost: Intel's data center and AI products were up 9 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the year, while its client computing group (which sells Core processors, Arc GPUs, and other consumer products) was down 7 percent for the quarter and 3 percent for the year.</p>
<p>That knowledge makes it slightly easier to understand the bind that company executives talked about on Intel's earnings call (<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-intel-beats-q4-2025-eps-forecast-stock-steady-93CH-4461706">as transcribed by Investing.com</a>). In short, Intel is having trouble making (and buying) enough chips to meet demand, and it makes more sense to allocate the chips it <em>can</em> make to the divisions that are actually making money—which means that we could see shortages of or higher prices for consumer processors, just as Intel is gearing up to launch the promising Core Ultra Series 3 processors (codenamed Panther Lake).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/core-ultra-series-3-launch-may-be-hampered-by-chip-shortages-says-intel/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>One of the anonymous account holders, John Doe, sued to block ICE from identifying him and other critics online through summonses to Meta that he claimed infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity.</p>
<p>DHS initially fought Doe's motion to quash the summonses, arguing that the community watch groups endangered ICE agents by posting "pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things." This was akin to "threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties," DHS alleged. DHS's arguments echoed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has claimed that identifying ICE agents is a crime, even though <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agents-are-doxing-themselves/">Wired noted</a> that ICE employees often post easily discoverable LinkedIn profiles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-ice-critic-wins-fight-to-stay-anonymous-as-dhs-backs-down/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/double-screen-free-tv-will-show-you-ads-even-when-not-in-use/">Telly</a>, a company that accepts advertising data instead of cash for its TVs, has reportedly had a hard time getting its “free” TVs into people’s homes.</p>
<p>Telly debuted in May 2023. Its dual-screen design can show ads, even when people aren't watching. Although the smaller, secondary screen can be used for more helpful applications, like showing the weather or sports scores, its primary purpose is to serve as a billboard south of the 55-inch primary display. Owners cannot disable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/double-screen-free-tv-will-show-you-ads-even-when-not-in-use/">tracking</a> or cover up the secondary screen (or they have to pay for the TV, which Telly claims is worth $1,000), and they must fill out a lengthy, detailed survey to get one.</p>
