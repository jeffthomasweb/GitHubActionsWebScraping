                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge ruled today that Florida cannot enforce a law that requires social media platforms to block kids from using their platforms. The state law "is likely unconstitutional," US Judge Mark Walker of the Northern District of Florida <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.527923/gov.uscourts.flnd.527923.94.0.pdf">ruled</a> while granting the tech industry's request for a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>The Florida law "prohibits some social media platforms from allowing youth in the state who are under the age of 14 to create or hold an account on their platforms, and similarly prohibits allowing youth who are 14 or 15 to create or hold an account unless a parent or guardian provides affirmative consent for them to do so," Walker wrote.</p>
<p>The law is subject to intermediate scrutiny under the First Amendment, meaning it must be "narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest," must "leave open ample alternative channels for communication," and must not "burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests," the ruling said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/federal-judge-blocks-florida-law-that-bans-kids-from-social-media/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In 1979, Atari released the Atari <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/how-a-1980s-atari-creator-with-cystic-fibrosis-crafted-a-story-of-salmon-survival/">400 and 800</a>, groundbreaking home computers that included custom graphics and sound chips, four joystick ports, and the ability to run the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Raiders">most advanced</a> home video games of their era. These machines, which retailed for $549 and $999, respectively, represented a leap in consumer-friendly personal computing, with their modular design and serial I/O bus that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432140/how-atari-took-on-apple-in-the-1980s-home-pc-wars">presaged USB</a>. Now, 46 years later, a hobbyist has shrunk down the system hardware to a size that would have seemed like science fiction in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Polish engineer Piotr "Osa" Ostapowicz <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/381202-the-new-extraordinary-a8-clone-platform/">recently unveiled</a> "Atarino," which may be the world's smallest 8-bit Atari computer re-creation, according to retro computing site <a href="https://www.atariteca.net.pe/2025/05/atarino-el-atari-8-bits-mas-pequeno.html">Atariteca</a>. The entire system—processor, graphics chips, sound hardware, and memory controllers—fits on a module measuring just 2×1.5 centimeters (about 0.79×0.59 inches), which is roughly the size of a postage stamp.</p>
<p>Ostapowicz's creation reimplements the classic Atari XL/XE architecture using modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> (field-programmable gate array) technology. Unlike software emulators that simulate old hardware (and modern recreations that run them, like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/why-i-hope-the-atari-400-mini-will-bring-respect-to-ataris-most-underrated-platform/">Atari 400 Mini</a> console) on a complete computer system of another architecture, Atarino reproduces the original Atari components faithfully at the logic level, allowing it to run vintage software while maintaining compatibility with original peripherals.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/polish-engineer-creates-postage-stamp-sized-1980s-atari-computer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Senate Democrats are pleading with the Trump administration to stop delaying distribution of $42 billion in grants for construction of broadband networks in areas with poor Internet access.</p>
<p>The Biden administration spent about three years developing rules and procedures for the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) fund and then evaluating plans submitted by each US state and territory. Republicans repeatedly alleged that Democrats should have distributed the grants more quickly, but the Trump administration halted progress after taking over.</p>
<p>"States are ready to put shovels in the ground and have been waiting for months to get started... Additional delays and onerous changes to the program at this stage threaten to further stall urgently needed deployment and leave communities behind," Senate Democrats wrote in a May 30 <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/with-over-42-billion-in-vital-broadband-funding-still-held-up-by-trump-administration-leader-schumer-ranking-member-cantwell-and-senator-lujan-demand-admin-stop-the-delays-and-immediately-release-the-funding-into-american-communities-senators-say-25-million-americans-still-lack-high-speed-internet-as-bipartisan-funding-lingers">letter</a> to President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Many Arsians are the go-to IT support representative for family and friends. If you're lucky, your loved ones' problems are easily resolved with a reset, update, or new cable. That wasn't the case for a son who recently had to break the news to his father that the 20TB portable hard drive he purchased for about $50 was mostly just a plastic box with weights and a PCB.</p>
<p>Ars Technica spoke with the Reddit user who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1iur7hv/dad_dropped_off_his_new_20tb_hdd_to_see_if_i/">posted about</a> his father bringing him a "new 20T[B] HDD to see if I could figure out what was wrong with it." The Redditor, who asked that we refer to him by his first name, Martin, revealed that his dad paid £38 (about $51.33) for what he thought was a portable HDD. That's a red flag. HDDs have gotten cheaper over the years, but not <em>that cheap</em>. A 20TB external HDD <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/external-hard-drives/expansion-desktop-hard-drive/?sku=STKP6000400">typically</a> costs over $200, and they’re usually much larger than the portable-SSD-sized device that Martin’s father received. A 20TB HDD in a portable form factor is <a href="https://oyendigital.com/novus-20tb-external-usb-c-rugged-desktop-hard-drive.html?srsltid=AfmBOopFp8DUqHef7CH_ioNWQMiXjaEveGF43GpOTe3hhs03GxrW80Zy">rarer</a> and can cost well <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-easystore-20tb-external-usb-3-0-hard-drive-black/6500985.p?skuId=6500985">over $300</a>.</p>
<p>Taking a hammer to the device revealed that the chassis was nearly empty, save for some iron wheel weights sloppily attached to the black plastic with hefty globs of glue and a small PCB with some form of flash storage that could connect to a system via USB-A.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/man-buys-20tb-portable-hdd-for-51-son-breaks-the-news-that-its-a-fake/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The mobile app includes a reasonably broad selection of tools from the desktop version of Adobe's iconic image editor, including masks, clone stamp, layers, transformations, cropping, and an array of generative AI tools. The app looks rather barebones when you first start using it, but the toolbar surfaces features as you select areas and manipulate layers.</p>
<p>Depending on how you count, this is Adobe's <em>third</em> attempt to do Photoshop on phones. So far, it appears to be the most comprehensive, though. It's much more capable than <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.psmobile">Photoshop Express</a> or the ancient <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/photoshop-touch-puts-graphic-design-in-the-palm-of-your-hands/">Photoshop Touch app</a>, which Adobe unpublished almost a decade ago. If you're not familiar with the ins and outs of Photoshop, the new app comes with a robust collection of tutorials—just tap the light bulb icon to peruse them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/adobe-finally-releases-photoshop-for-android-and-its-free-for-now/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>New details of the Trump administration's plans for NASA, released Friday, revealed the White House's desire to end the development of an experimental nuclear thermal rocket engine that could have shown a new way of exploring the Solar System.</p>
<p>Trump's NASA budget request is rife with spending cuts. Overall, the White House proposes reducing NASA's budget by about 24 percent, from $24.8 billion this year to $18.8 billion in fiscal year 2026. In previous stories, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/white-house-budget-seeks-to-end-sls-orion-and-lunar-gateway-programs/">Ars has covered many of the programs</a> impacted by the proposed cuts, which would cancel the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft and terminate numerous robotic science missions, including the Mars Sample Return, probes to Venus, and future space telescopes.</p>
<p>Instead, the leftover funding for NASA's human exploration program would go toward supporting commercial projects to land on the Moon and Mars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/some-parts-of-trumps-proposed-budget-for-nasa-are-literally-draconian/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Eight years ago, just before the release of the Nintendo Switch, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/">provided an in-depth review of the hardware</a> thanks to early production units provided by Nintendo. This year, Nintendo has opted not to provide such unrestricted early press access to the Switch 2 hardware, citing a "day-one update" to the system software and some launch games that would supposedly make pre-release evaluation more difficult.</p>
<p>As such, we won't be able to provide our full thoughts on the Switch 2 until well after the system is in players' hands. While that's not an ideal situation for readers looking to make an early purchase decision, we'll do our best to give you our hands-on impressions as soon as possible after launch day.</p>
<p>In lieu of review access, though, we were able to get some extended hands-on time with the final Switch 2 hardware at a daylong preview event held by Nintendo last week. This event provided our first look at the console's system-level menu and settings, as well as features like GameChat (which was hard to fully evaluate in an extremely controlled environment).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/11-things-you-probably-didnt-know-the-switch-2-can-do/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Yoshua Bengio, a Canadian academic whose work has informed techniques used by top AI groups such as OpenAI and Google, said: “There’s unfortunately a very competitive race between the leading labs, which pushes them towards focusing on capability to make the AI more and more intelligent, but not necessarily put enough emphasis and investment on research on safety.”</p>
<p>The Turing Award winner issued his warning in an interview with the Financial Times, while launching a new non-profit called LawZero. He said the group would focus on building safer systems, vowing to “insulate our research from those commercial pressures.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/godfather-of-ai-calls-out-latest-models-for-lying-to-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Ars tried out <em>Mario Kart World</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">at April's Switch 2 premiere hands-on event</a>, the short demos focused on more-or-less standard races in the game's Grand Prix and Knockout modes. So when Nintendo invited us back for more time previewing the near-final version of the game before the Switch 2's release, we decided to focus most of our time on the game's mysterious (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-do-you-actually-do-in-mario-kart-worlds-vast-open-world/">previously teased</a>) "Free Roam" mode.</p>
<p>We're glad we did, because the mode feels like the hidden gem of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and maybe of the Switch 2 launch as a whole. Combining elements of games like <em>Diddy Kong Racing</em>, <em>Forza Horizon</em>, and even the <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> series, Free Roam provides a unique mixture of racing challenges, exploration, and collectibles that should keep new Switch 2 owners busy for a while.</p>
<h2>Switch hunt</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, Free Roam mode isn't listed as one of the main options when you launch a new game of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Instead, a tiny note in the corner of the screen tells you to hit the plus button to get dropped into a completely untimed and free-wheeling version of the vast <em>Mario Kart World</em> map.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/free-roam-mode-is-mario-kart-worlds-killer-app/">Read full article</a></p>

      100,000 computer simulations reveal Milky Way's fate—and it might not be what we thought.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>It's been textbook knowledge for over a century that our Milky Way galaxy is doomed to collide with another large spiral galaxy, Andromeda, in the next 5 billion years and merge into one even bigger galaxy. But a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02563-1">fresh analysis</a> published in the journal Nature Astronomy is casting that longstanding narrative in a more uncertain light. The authors conclude that the likelihood of this collision and merger is closer to the odds of a coin flip, with a roughly 50 percent probability that the two galaxies will avoid such an event during the next 10 billion years.</p>
<p>Both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies (M31) are part of what's known as the Local Group (LG), which also hosts other smaller galaxies (some not yet discovered) as well as dark matter (per the prevailing standard cosmological model). Both already have remnants of past mergers and interactions with other galaxies, according to the authors.</p>
<p>"Predicting future mergers requires knowledge about the present coordinates, velocities, and masses of the systems partaking in the interaction," the authors wrote. That involves not just the gravitational force between them but also dynamical friction. It's the latter that dominates when galaxies are headed toward a merger, since it causes galactic orbits to decay.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/milky-way-galaxy-might-not-collide-with-andromeda-after-all/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device, <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>. Google says it's investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities.</p>
<p>The covert tracking—implemented in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel/">Meta Pixel</a> and <a href="https://ads.yandex/metrica">Yandex Metrica</a> trackers—allows Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it. <a href="https://source.Android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox">Android sandboxing</a>, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources. Defenses such <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state</a></span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning"> partitioning</a> and <a href="https://privacysandbox.google.com/cookies/storage-partitioning">storage partitioning</a>, which are built into all major browsers, store site cookies and other data associated with a website in containers that are unique to every top-level website domain to ensure they're off-limits for every other site.</p>
<h2>A blatant violation</h2>
<p>“One of the fundamental security principles that exists in the web, as well as the mobile system, is called sandboxing,” Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, one of the researchers behind the discovery, said in an interview. “You run everything in a sandbox, and there is no interaction within different elements running on it. What this attack vector allows is to break the sandbox that exists between the mobile context and the web context. The channel that exists allowed the Android system to communicate what happens in the browser with the identity running in the mobile app.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Exercise is generally good for you, but a new high-quality clinical trial finds that it's so good, it can even knock back colon cancer—and, in fact, rival some chemotherapy treatments.</p>
<p>The finding comes from a phase 3, randomized clinical trial led by researchers in Canada, who studied nearly 900 people who had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for colon cancer. After those treatments, patients were evenly split into groups that either bulked up their regular exercise routines in a three-year program that included coaching and supervision or were simply given health education. The researchers found that the exercise group had a 28 percent lower risk of their colon cancer recurring, new cancers developing, or dying over eight years compared with the health education group.</p>
<p>The benefits of exercise, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760">published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, became visible after just one year and increased over time, the researchers found. The rate of people who survived for five years and remained cancer-free was 80.3 percent among the exercise group. That's a 6.4 percentage-point survival boost over the education group, which had a 73.9 percent cancer-free survival rate. The overall survival rate (with or without cancer) during the study's eight-year follow-up was 90.3 percent in the exercise group compared with 83.2 percent in the education group—a 7.1 percentage point difference. Exercise reduced the relative risk of death by 37 percent (41 people died in the exercise group compared with 66 in the education group).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/exercise-improves-colon-cancer-survival-high-quality-trial-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Broadcom has cut the lowest tier in its VMware partner program. The move allows the enterprise technology firm to continue its focus on customers with larger VMware deployments, but it also risks more migrations from VMware users and partners.</p>
<h2>Broadcom ousts low-tier VMware partners</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.broadcom.com/partners/fueling-customer-success-through-deep-partner-collaboration">blog post</a> on Sunday, Broadcom executive Brian Moats announced that the Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Resellers, which became the VMware partner program after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/">Broadcom eliminated the original one</a> in January 2024, would now offer three tiers instead of four. Broadcom is killing the Registered tier, leaving the Pinnacle, Premier, and Select tiers.</p>
<p>The reduction is a result of Broadcom's "strategic direction" and a "comprehensive partner review" and affects VMware's Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan geographies, Moats wrote. Affected partners are receiving 60 days' notice, Laura Falko, Broadcom’s head of global partner programs, marketing, and experience, told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/01/vmware_channel_changes/">The Register</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/broadcom-ends-business-with-vmwares-lowest-tier-channel-partners/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We've been covering the small, reversible USB Type-C connector since the days when it was just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/reversible-tiny-faster-hands-on-with-the-usb-type-c-plug/">a USB Implementers Forum tech demo</a>, and in the decade-plus since then, the port has gradually taken over the world. It quietly migrated from laptops to game consoles, to PC accessories, to Android phones, to e-readers, and to iPhones. Despite some hiccups and shortcomings, we're considerably closer to a single connector that does <em>everything</em> than we were a decade ago.</p>
<p>But some confusion persists. A weakness built into the USB-C from the very beginning was that the specification for the physical connector was always separate from the specifications for the USB Power Delivery specification for charging, the USB-C Alt Mode specification for carrying non-USB signals like DisplayPort or HDMI, and for the USB protocol itself (that is, the data transfer speed a given port is capable of).</p>
<p>All of these specifications were frequently grouped together so that individual USB-C ports could handle charging, display output, and data transfers (or some combination of all three at once), but they weren't <em>required</em> to go together, so occasionally users will still run into physical USB-C ports that fall short of the port's do-everything promise.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-belatedly-attempts-to-tame-usb-c-confusion-with-its-rules-for-pc-oems/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It has become a common refrain during Google's antitrust saga: What happened to "don't be evil?" Google's unofficial motto has haunted it as it has grown ever larger, but a shareholder lawsuit sought to rein in some of the company's excesses. And it might be working. The plaintiffs in the case have reached a settlement with Google parent company Alphabet, which will spend a boatload of cash on "comprehensive" reforms. The goal is to steer Google away from the kind of anticompetitive practices that got it in hot water.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement, obtained by <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/InreAlphabetIncShareholderDerivativeLitigationDocketNo321cv09388N/1?doc_id=X6L5I3F7H479DQB4STTU3JAG8JV">Bloomberg Law</a>, Alphabet will spend $500 million over the next 10 years on systematic reforms. The company will have to form a board-level committee devoted to overseeing the company's regulatory compliance and antitrust risk, a rarity for US firms. This group will report directly to CEO Sundar Pichai. There will also be reforms at other levels of the company that allow employees to identify potential legal pitfalls before they affect the company. Google has also agreed to preserve communications. Google's propensity to use auto-deleting chats drew condemnation from several judges overseeing its antitrust cases.</p>
<p>The agreement still needs approval from US District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco, but that's mainly a formality at this point. Naturally, Alphabet does not admit to any wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, but it may have to pay tens of millions in legal fees on top of the promised $500 million investment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/google-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-will-spend-500m-on-being-less-evil/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On May 23, President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/restoring-gold-standard-science/">issued an executive order</a> entitled "Restoring Gold Standard Science." And, in news that may surprise our readers, it sounds remarkably good, focusing on issues like reproducibility and conflicts of interest. While there were a few things that could be phrased better, when it comes to basic scientific practices, the language was remarkably reasonable.</p>
<p>So, why didn't we report on what appeared to be a rare bit of good news? I'd considered doing so, but the situation is complicated by the fact that the order is structured in a way that makes it very sensitive to who's responsible for implementing it, a situation that's subtle enough that I couldn't figure out how to handle it well. Fortunately, I only had to wait a week for a member of the Trump administration to show just how dangerous it could be and highlight its biggest problem.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary appeared on one of the weekend news programs, where he was asked about the decision to limit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-axes-covid-shot-guidance-for-pregnant-people-kids/">pregnant people's access to the COVID-19 vaccines</a>. The host mentioned that aggregation of studies involving a total of over 1.8 million women had shown the vaccine was safe and effective.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/analysis-trumps-gold-standard-science-is-already-wearing-thin/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every smartphone maker is racing to find a way to put AI in your pocket, but no one has cracked the code yet. Samsung was an early supporter of Google's Gemini AI, which has largely supplanted its little-used Bixby assistant. However, a new report claims Samsung is planning a big AI shakeup by partnering with Perplexity on the Galaxy S26.</p>
<p>Perplexity pitches itself as an AI-powered search service, running on the same generative AI technology behind ChatGPT, Gemini, and all the others. However, it cites its sources around the web more prominently than a pure chatbot. Perplexity made waves during the Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-and-doj-tussle-over-how-ai-will-remake-the-web-in-antitrust-closing-arguments/">search antitrust trial</a> when executive Dmitry Shevelenko testified that Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/perplexity-will-come-to-moto-phones-after-exec-testified-google-blocked-access/">blocked Motorola from using Perplexity</a> on its 2024 phones. The company got its wish this year, though, with Perplexity finding a place on 2025 Razr phones.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-01/samsung-nears-wide-ranging-deal-with-perplexity-for-ai-features">report from Bloomberg</a> says Samsung will be the next to leverage Perplexity's AI. The companies are apparently close to signing a deal that will make this AI model a core part of the Galaxy S26 lineup. Motorola uses Perplexity for search functionality inside its Moto AI system, but the Samsung deal would be more comprehensive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/samsung-could-drop-google-gemini-in-favor-of-perplexity-for-galaxy-s26/">Read full article</a></p>
