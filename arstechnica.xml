                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The makers of BIND, the Internet’s most widely used software for resolving domain names, are warning of two vulnerabilities that allow attackers to poison entire caches of results and send users to malicious destinations that are indistinguishable from the real ones.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities, tracked as <a href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2025-40778">CVE-2025-40778</a> and <a href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2025-40780">CVE-2025-40780</a>, stem from a logic error and a weakness in generating pseudo-random numbers, respectively. They each carry a severity rating of 8.6. Separately, makers of the Domain Name System resolver software Unbound <a href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2025-11411.txt">warned</a> of similar vulnerabilities that were reported by the same researchers. The unbound vulnerability severity score is 5.6</p>
<h2>Revisiting Kaminsky’s cache poisoning attack</h2>
<p>The vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause DNS resolvers located inside thousands of organizations to replace valid results for domain lookups with corrupted ones. The corrupted results would replace the IP addresses controlled by the domain name operator (for instance, 3.15.119.63 for arstechnica.com) with malicious ones controlled by the attacker. Patches for all three vulnerabilities became available on Wednesday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/bind-warns-of-bugs-that-could-bring-dns-cache-attack-back-from-the-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2025 this afternoon. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-reverses-sales-decline-in-q3-sells-50k-more-cars-than-it-built/">Earlier this month</a>, we learned that the electric vehicle manufacturer had a pretty good Q3 in terms of sales, which grew by 7.3 percent year over year and cleared out tens of thousands of cars from inventory in the process. However, that hasn’t translated into greater profitability.</p>
<p>Even though revenues grew by 12 percent to $28 billion compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/teslas-q3-buoyed-by-credits-cost-cutting-as-auto-revenue-stays-flat/">the same period last year</a>, Tesla’s operating expenses grew by 50 percent. As a result, its operating margin halved to just 5.8 percent. And so its profit for the quarter fell by 37 percent to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Some growth in revenue came from its battery and solar division; this increased by 44 percent to $3.4 billion compared to Q3 2024. Services—including the Supercharger network, which is now open to an increasing number of other makes of EV—also grew, increasing by 25 percent to $3.4 billion. EV deliveries increased by 7 percent to 497,099, most of which were the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover. Automotive revenues grew slightly less, increasing 6 percent year over year to $21.2 billion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-profits-fall-37-in-q3-despite-healthy-sales/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">GM provided flights from Detroit to New York City and accommodation so Ars could attend its tech event. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>General Motors held a preview event today to show the world what it’s working on. We’ve already seen some projects, like the further development of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/05/gms-new-ev-battery-will-offer-30-percent-more-range-for-less-money/">lithium manganese-rich battery technology</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/general-motors-will-add-bidirectional-charging-to-its-ultium-based-evs/">backup power for EVs</a> that can power a home or support the power grid.</p>
<p>The most significant new announcement is that Cadillac will offer an Escalade IQ with a so-called “Level 3” conditional automated driving system in 2028. GM is referring to it as a “hands off, eyes off” system and says it will integrate advanced digital mapping, use of lidar and other systems, and advanced machine learning to handle the driving duties in a controlled environment up to 80 mph (129 km/h).</p>
<p>This means you can theoretically watch a movie from the driver’s seat while your car takes you down the highway to the airport. Over time, the system’s operation areas will expand to cover even more roads, making driving unnecessary in many situations—unless, of course, you like to drive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/ai-and-hands-free-driving-are-coming-to-gms-vehicles/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Shock and dismay have already begun as Americans face next year’s health insurance costs—and it looks like everyone will be in for some grim numbers.</p>
<p>So far, much of the attention has been on the stratospheric prices that Americans might see on plans they buy from Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Critical tax credits for those plans are set to expire at the end of the year, and, on top of that, insurers have proposed a median 18 percent price increase for 2026. With the higher prices and a loss of credits, some Americans could see their monthly premiums more than double.</p>
<p>In an analysis last month, nonpartisan health policy group <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/">KFF estimated</a> that, on average, ACA marketplace premiums would rise 114 percent, going from $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/health-care-costs-are-soaring-for-americans-and-2026-is-looking-grim/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>Once upon a time, two villagers visited the fabled Mullah Nasreddin. They hoped that the Sufi philosopher, famed for his acerbic wisdom, could mediate a dispute that had driven a wedge between them. Nasreddin listened patiently to the first villager’s version of the story and, upon its conclusion, exclaimed, “You are absolutely right!” The second villager then presented his case. After hearing him out, Nasreddin again responded, “You are absolutely right!” An observant bystander, confused by Nasreddin’s proclamations, interjected, “But Mullah, they can’t both be right.” Nasreddin paused, regarding the bystander for a moment before replying, “You are absolutely right, too!”</em></p>
<p>In late May, the White House’s first “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) report was criticized for citing multiple research studies that did not exist. Fabricated citations like these are common in the outputs of generative artificial intelligence based on large language models, or LLMs. LLMs have presented plausible-sounding sources, catchy titles, or even false data to craft their conclusions. Here, the White House pushed back on the journalists who first broke the story before admitting to “<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-officials-downplay-fake-citations-high-profile-report-children-s-health">minor citation errors</a>.”</p>
<p>It is ironic that fake citations were used to support a principal recommendation of the MAHA report: addressing the health research sector’s “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04253-w">replication crisis</a>,” wherein scientists’ findings often cannot be reproduced by other independent teams.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/when-sycophancy-and-bias-meet-medicine/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX said it disabled over 2,500 Starlink terminals suspected of being used by scammers in Myanmar. Lauren Dreyer, vice president of Starlink business operations, described the action in an <a href="https://x.com/LaurenDreyer/status/1980816703459082632">X post</a> last night after reports that Myanmar’s military shut down a major scam operation.</p>
<p>“SpaceX complies with local laws in all 150+ markets where Starlink is licensed to operate,” Dreyer wrote. “SpaceX continually works to identify violations of our Acceptable Use Policy and applicable law… On the rare occasion we identify a violation, we take appropriate action, including working with law enforcement agencies around the world. In Myanmar, for example, SpaceX proactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected ‘scam centers.'”</p>
<p>Starlink is not licensed to operate in Myanmar. While Dreyer didn’t say how the terminals were disabled, it’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/12/starlink-russia-ukraine-elon-musk/">known</a> that Starlink can disable individual terminals based on their ID numbers or use geofencing to block areas from receiving signals.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/starlink-blocks-2500-dishes-allegedly-used-by-myanmars-notorious-scam-centers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The era of Android virtual reality is here… again. Google’s first two attempts at making Android fit for your face didn’t work out, but the AI era and a partnership with Samsung have enabled a third attempt, and maybe the third time’s the charm. Samsung has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-galaxy-xr-opening-new-worlds">unveiled the Galaxy XR headset</a>, the first and currently only device running Google’s new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/google-steps-into-extended-reality-once-again-with-android-xr/">Android XR platform</a>. It’s available for pre-order today, but it will not come cheap. The headset, which doesn’t come with controllers, retails for $1,800.</p>
<p>Galaxy XR is a fully enclosed headset with passthrough video. It looks similar to the Apple Vision Pro, right down to the battery pack at the end of a cable. It packs solid hardware, including 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 processor. That’s a slightly newer version of the chip powering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">Meta’s Quest 3 headset</a>, featuring six CPU cores and an Adreno GPU that supports up to dual 4.3K displays.</p>
<p>The new headset has a pair of 3,552 x 3,840 Micro-OLED displays with a 109-degree field of view. That’s marginally more pixels than the Vision Pro and almost three times as many as the Quest 3. The displays can refresh at up to 90Hz, but the default is 72Hz to save power.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/samsung-galaxy-xr-is-the-first-android-xr-headset-now-on-sale-for-1800/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A few years back, Google made waves when it claimed that some of its hardware had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/paper-leaks-showing-a-quantum-computer-doing-something-a-supercomputer-cant/">achieved quantum supremacy</a>, performing operations that would be effectively impossible to simulate on a classical computer. That claim didn’t hold up especially well, as mathematicians later developed methods to help <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/math-may-have-caught-up-with-googles-quantum-supremacy-claims/">classical computers catch up</a>, leading the company to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/">repeat the work</a> on an improved processor.</p>
<p>While this back-and-forth was unfolding, the field became less focused on quantum supremacy and more on two additional measures of success. The first is quantum utility, in which a quantum computer performs computations that are useful in some practical way. The second is quantum advantage, in which a quantum system completes calculations in a fraction of the time it would take a typical computer. (IBM and a startup called Pasqual have published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20658">useful discussion</a> about what would be required to verifiably demonstrate a quantum advantage.)</p>
<p>Today, Google and a large collection of academic collaborators are publishing a paper describing a computational approach that demonstrates a quantum advantage compared to current algorithms—and may actually help us achieve something useful.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/google-claims-to-have-quantum-advantage-with-a-potentially-useful-algorithm/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover is estimated to have cost the UK at least £1.9 billion in what is likely to be “the most economically damaging cyber event” for the country.</p>
<p>The month-long shutdown of internal systems and production at JLR affected over 5,000 British organisations, according to an analysis by Cyber Monitoring Centre, a non-profit organization that ranks the severity of cyber events in the UK.</p>
<p>“This incident looks to have been by some distance, the single most financially damaging cyber event ever to hit the UK,” said Ciaran Martin, former head of the National Cyber Security Centre and chair of CMC’s technical committee.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/jaguar-land-rover-struggling-8-weeks-after-most-expensive-uk-cyberattack/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amid the chaos of the Trump administration’s haphazard job cuts and a mass exodus of leadership, the Food and Drug Administration is experiencing a slowdown of drug reviews and approvals, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/10/20/fda-drug-approvals-slowing-rejections-rising/">an analysis reported by Stat News</a>.</p>
<p>An assessment of metrics by RBC Capital Markets analysts found that FDA drug approvals dropped 14 percentage points in the third quarter compared to the average of the six previous quarters—falling from an average of 87 percent to 73 percent this past quarter. In line with that finding, analysts noted that the delay rate in meeting deadlines for drug application reviews rose from an average of 4 percent to 11 percent.</p>
<p>The FDA also rejected more applications than normal, going from a historical average of 10 percent to 15 percent in the third quarter. A growing number of rejections relate to problems at manufacturing plants, which in turn could suggest problems with the FDA’s inspection and auditing processes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/fda-slows-down-on-drug-reviews-approvals-amid-trump-admin-chaos/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hzk4ovnGOyw?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Netflix’s international offerings include some entertaining Norwegian fare, such as the series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/review-ragnorak-updates-norse-mythology-for-the-modern-age/"><em>Ragnarok</em></a> (2020–2023), a surprisingly engaging reworking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k">Norse mythology</a> brought into the 21st century that ran for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_(TV_series)">three seasons</a>. Another enjoyable offering was a 2022 monster movie called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(2022_film)"><em>Troll</em></a>, essentially a Norwegian take on the classic <em>Godzilla</em> formula. Netflix just dropped a trailer for the sequel, <em>Troll 2,</em> which looks to be very much in the same vein as its predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first <em>Troll</em> movie below.)</strong></p>
<p>Don’t confuse the Netflix franchise with 2010’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollhunter"><em>Trollhunter</em></a>, shot in the style of a found footage mockumentary. A group of college students sets off into the wilds of the fjordland to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher named Hans. They discover that Hans is actually hunting down trolls and decide to document those endeavors instead, but soon realize they are very much out of their depth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/troll-2-trailer-is-a-godzilla-inspired-monster-mash/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple’s new Liquid Glass user interface design was one of the most noticeable and divisive features of its major software updates this year. It added additional fluidity and translucency throughout iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Apple’s other operating systems, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/macos-26-tahoe-the-ars-technica-review/#toc-h9">as we noted in our reviews</a>, the default settings weren’t always great for readability.</p>
<p>The upcoming 26.1 update for all of those OSes is taking a step toward addressing some of the complaints, though not by changing things about the default look of Liquid Glass. Rather, the update is adding a new toggle that will let users choose between a Clear and Tinted look for Liquid Glass, with Clear representing the default look and Tinted cranking up the opacity and contrast.</p>

<p>The new toggle adds a half-step between the default visual settings and the “reduce transparency” setting, which, aside from changing a bunch of other things about the look and feel of the operating system, is buried further down inside the Accessibility options. The Tinted toggle does make colors and vague shapes visible beneath the glass panes, preserving the general look of Liquid Glass while also erring on the side of contrast and visibility, where the “reduce transparency” setting is more of an all-or-nothing blunt instrument.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/new-ios-and-macos-betas-add-tinted-toggle-to-tone-down-liquid-glass/">Read full article</a></p>

Today, OpenAI announced the Atlas browser that it hopes will do something similar for its ChatGPT large language model, answering the question “What if I could chat with a browser?” as the OpenAI team put it.</p>
<p>OpenAI Founder and CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UWKxJbjriY">said in a live stream announcement</a> that Atlas will let users “chat with a page,” helping ChatGPT become a core way that users interact with the place where “a ton of work and life happens” online. “The way that we hope people will use the Internet in the future… is that the chat experience and a web browser can be a great analogue,” he said.</p>
<p>The new browser is <a href="https://chatgpt.com/atlas">available for download now on macOS</a>, and Altman promised Windows and mobile versions would be rolled out “as quick as we can.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openais-new-atlas-web-browser-wants-to-let-you-chat-with-a-page/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AI content has proliferated across the Internet over the past few years, but those early confabulations with mutated hands have evolved into synthetic images and videos that can be hard to differentiate from reality. Having helped to create this problem, Google has some responsibility to keep AI video in check on YouTube. To that end, the company has started rolling out its promised likeness detection system for creators.</p>
<p>Google’s powerful and freely available AI models have helped fuel the rise of AI content, some of which is aimed at spreading misinformation and harassing individuals. Creators and influencers fear their brands could be tainted by a flood of AI videos that show them saying and doing things that never happened—even lawmakers are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/senates-no-fakes-act-hopes-to-make-unauthorized-digital-replicas-illegal/">fretting about this</a>. Google has placed a large bet on the value of AI content, so banning AI from YouTube, as many want, simply isn’t happening.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, YouTube promised tools that would flag face-stealing AI content on the platform. The likeness detection tool, which is similar to the site’s copyright detection system, has now expanded beyond the initial small group of testers. YouTube says the first batch of eligible creators have been notified that they can use likeness detection, but interested parties will need to hand Google even more personal information to get protection from AI fakes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/youtube-rolls-out-likeness-detection-to-help-creators-combat-ai-fakes/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, a group of researchers won the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634021001537">for discovering</a> that many mammals are capable of breathing through their anus. But as with many Ig Nobel awards, there is a serious side to the seeming silliness. The same group has conducted <a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(25)00314-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666634025003149%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">a new study</a> on the feasibility of adapting this method to treat people with blocked airways or clogged lungs, with promising results that bring rectal oxygen delivery one step closer to medical reality.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/meet-the-winners-of-the-2024-ig-nobel-prizes/">previously reported</a>, this is perhaps one of the more unusual research developments to come out of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated shortages of ventilators and artificial lungs to assist patients’ breathing and prevent respiratory failure. The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center team took their inspiration from the humble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loach">loach</a>, a freshwater bottom-dwelling fish found throughout Eurasia and northern Africa. The loach (along with sea cucumbers) employs intestinal breathing (i.e., through the anus) rather than gills to survive under hypoxic conditions, thanks to having lots of capillary vessels in its intestine. The technical term is enteral ventilation via anus (EVA).</p>
<p>Would such a novel breathing method work in mammals? The team thought it might be possible and undertook experiments with mice and micro-pigs to test that hypothesis. They drew upon earlier research by Leland Clark, also of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, who invented a perfluorocarbon liquid called Oxycyte as a possible form of artificial blood. That vision never materialized, although it did provide a handy plot point for the 1989 film <em>The Abyss</em>, in which a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFFpMqs9kbI">rat is able to “breathe”</a> in a similar liquid.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/butt-breathing-might-soon-be-a-real-medical-treatment/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A year after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/cards-against-humanity-sues-spacex-alleges-invasion-of-land-on-us-mexico-border/">suing SpaceX</a> for “invading” a plot of land on the US/Mexico border, Cards Against Humanity says it has obtained a settlement and will provide supporters with a new pack of cards about Elon Musk.</p>
<p>The party-game company bought the land in 2017 in an attempt to stymie President Trump’s wall-building project, but alleged that SpaceX illegally took over the land and filled it with construction equipment and materials. A <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cah-vs-spacex.pdf">September 2024 lawsuit</a> filed against SpaceX in Cameron County District Court in Texas sought up to $15 million to cover the cost of restoring the property and other damages.</p>
<p>Cards Against Humanity, which bought the property with donations from supporters, told Ars today that “we’ve been in negotiations with SpaceX for much of the last year. We held out for the best settlement we could get—almost until the trial was supposed to start—and unfortunately part of that negotiation was that we’re not allowed to discuss specific settlement terms. They did admit to trespassing during the discovery phase, which was very validating.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/cards-against-humanity-gets-settlement-from-spacex-plans-pack-of-elon-musk-cards/">Read full article</a></p>
