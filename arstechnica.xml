              <![CDATA[<p>After a month of unexplained bouts of stomach pain, an otherwise healthy 16-year-old girl arrived at the emergency department of Massachusetts General Hospital actively retching and in severe pain.</p>
<p>A CT scan showed nothing unusual in her innards, and her urine and blood tests were normal. The same was found two weeks prior, when she had arrived at a different hospital complaining of stomach pain. She was discharged home with instructions to take painkillers, a medication for peptic ulcers, and another to prevent nausea and vomiting. The painkiller didn't help, and she didn't take the other two medications.</p>
<p>Her pain worsened, and something was clearly wrong. When she arrived at Mass General, her stomach was tender, and her heart rate was elevated. When doctors tried to give her a combination of medications for common causes of abdominal pain, she immediately vomited them back up.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/surgeons-remove-2-5-inch-hairball-from-teen-with-rare-rapunzel-syndrome/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The duck-billed dinosaur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasaurolophus"><em>Parasaurolophus</em></a> is distinctive for its prominent crest, which some scientists have suggested served as a kind of resonating chamber to produce low-frequency sounds. Nobody really knows what <em>Parasaurolophus</em> sounded like, however. Hongjun Lin of New York University is trying to change that by constructing his own model of the dinosaur's crest and its acoustical characteristics. Lin has not yet reproduced the call of <em>Parasaurolophus</em>, but he talked about his progress thus far at a <a href="https://acousticalsociety.org/asa-virtual-fall-2024/">virtual meeting</a> of the Acoustical Society of America.</p>
<p>Lin was inspired in part by the dinosaur sounds featured in the Jurassic Park film franchise, which were a combination of sounds from other animals like baby whales and crocodiles. “I’ve been fascinated by giant animals ever since I was a kid. I’d spend hours reading books, watching movies, and imagining what it would be like if dinosaurs were still around today,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1064589?">he said</a> during a press briefing. “It wasn’t until college that I realized the sounds we hear in movies and shows—while mesmerizing—are completely fabricated using sounds from modern animals. That’s when I decided to dive deeper and explore what dinosaurs might have actually sounded like.”</p>
<p>A skull and partial skeleton of <em>Parasaurolophus</em> were first discovered in 1920 along the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada, and another partial skull was discovered the following year in New Mexico. There are now three known species of <em>Parasaurolophus;</em> the name means "near crested lizard." While no complete skeleton has yet been found, paleontologists have concluded that the adult dinosaur likely stood about 16 feet tall and weighed between 6,000 to 8,000 pounds. <em>Parasaurolophus</em> was an herbivore that could walk on all four legs while foraging for food but may have run on two legs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/one-scientists-quest-to-recreate-call-of-parasaurolophus/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A federal court yesterday ruled against parents who sued a Massachusetts school district for punishing their son who used an artificial intelligence tool to complete an assignment.</p>
<p>Dale and Jennifer Harris <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/student-was-punished-for-using-ai-then-his-parents-sued-teacher-and-administrators/">sued Hingham High School officials and the School Committee</a> and sought a preliminary injunction requiring the school to change their son's grade and expunge the incident from his disciplinary record before he needs to submit college applications. The parents argued that there was no rule against using AI in the student handbook, but school officials said the student violated multiple policies.</p>
<p>The Harris' motion for an injunction was rejected in an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.275605/gov.uscourts.mad.275605.30.0_3.pdf">order</a> issued yesterday from US District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

              <![CDATA[<p>An ad company’s foray into TV operating systems (OSes) illustrates a significant shift for TV hardware toward products that are increasingly focused on <a class="c-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">ad sales and tracking</a>.</p>
<p>With more people using web-based streaming for TV, smart TV OSes have become the most lucrative part of the TV business. OS owners accumulate valuable data on how people use their smart TVs and streaming sticks, which is helpful for OS operators as well as third parties, like companies paying for ads distributed via TV OSes. Meanwhile, the smart TV ad business is growing rapidly, with GroupM, the world's biggest media investment firm, expecting ad revenue to reach $38.3 billion this year, a 20.1 percent year-over-year increase.</p>
<p>That trend has pushed TV OS operators, from Vizio and Roku to Samsung and LG, to seek new ways to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/streaming-industry-has-unprecedented-surveillance-manipulation-capabilities/">incorporate ads and tracking</a> into their TV software. Now, an ad tech giant is planning to become a TV OS provider itself.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/an-ad-giant-wants-to-control-your-next-tvs-operating-system/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the years since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/10/heroes-die-our-first-hours-with-the-addictive-and-maddening-dark-souls/"><em>Dark Souls</em> first hit the scene</a>, the action RPG genre has been overrun with "Souls-like" games that emulate FromSoft's general vibe. That often applies not just to dark settings and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">punishing difficulty</a> but also to the slow, deliberate management of every movement and attack to survive even simple encounters with your life and stamina intact.</p>
<p>While that approach definitely has its place, sometimes you want an action-RPG with a little more color, a little faster pacing, and a little more, well, <em>action</em>. After spending a few hours with Obsidian's <em>Avowed</em>, it already feels like just the thing for action-RPG fans who want something a little less Souls-like.</p>
<h2>All politics is local</h2>
<p>From the start, <em>Avowed</em> is layered with all of the vaguely medieval high fantasy tropes you'd expect from a game spun off from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-review-oh-the-places-youll-plunder/"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> universe. Your protagonist is a "god-like," touched in the womb by mysterious immortal beings that gave you mysterious powers but also a disfigured face that led you to be bullied as a child. Eventually, you grow up to be an envoy to the King of Aedrys and are sent over the sea to the lightly civilized Living Lands to investigate a mysterious fungal plague that is turning animals and soldiers alike into unruly, rage-filled beasts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/obsidians-avowed-is-the-cure-for-souls-like-action-rpg-fatigue/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Space Launch System rocket that will dispatch four astronauts on the first Moon mission in more than 50 years passed a major milestone Wednesday.</p>
<p>NASA said ground teams inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida lifted the aft assembly of the rocket's left booster onto the mobile launch platform. Using an overhead crane, teams hoisted the left aft booster assembly—already filled with pre-packed solid propellant—from the VAB transfer aisle, over a catwalk dozens of stories high and then down onto mounting posts on the mobile launcher.</p>
<p>This marks the start of stacking for the second SLS rocket earmarked to launch NASA's Artemis II mission and slated to send NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen on a 10-day flight around the far side of the Moon. Artemis II will be the first crewed flight of NASA's Artemis program and the first time people fly on the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/nasa-begins-assembling-rocket-to-send-astronauts-around-far-side-of-the-moon/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Google's nightmare.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/US-v-Google-Proposed-Final-Judgment-11-20-24.pdf">filed</a> its proposed final judgment, officially recommending a broad range of remedies to end Google's search monopoly.</p>
<p>Predictably, Google is not happy with the DOJ's plan, which requires the company to sell its Chrome browser. It also retains the option of forcing Google to divest Android if competition doesn't increase from behavioral remedies, including bans on exclusive default deals with other browsers and device makers. Additionally, Google is prohibited from building any new browsers and must fund an education campaign that shows people how to switch search engines and potentially even pays people to switch. Google may also be restricted from using its data scale advantage to benefit its AI products.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/welcome-to-googles-nightmare-us-reveals-plan-to-destroy-search-monopoly/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you lose your iPhone or buy an upgrade, you could reasonably expect to be up and running after an hour, presuming you backed up your prior model. Your Apple stuff all comes over, sure, but most of your third-party apps will still be signed in.</p>
<p>Doing the same swap with an Android device is more akin to starting three-quarters fresh. After one or two Android phones, you learn to bake in an extra hour of rapid-fire logging in to all your apps. Password managers, or just using a Google account as your authentication, are a godsend.</p>
<p>That might change relatively soon, as Google has <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/11/maintain-strong-user-relationships-with-restore-credentials.html">announced</a> a new <a href="https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/restore-credentials">Restore Credentials</a> feature, which should do what it says in the name. Android apps can "seamlessly onboard users to their accounts on a new device," with the restore keys handled by Android's native backup and restore process. The experience, says Google, is "delightful" and seamless. You can even get the same notifications on the new device as you were receiving on the old.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/android-will-soon-instantly-log-you-in-to-your-apps-on-new-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol">US Capitol building</a> in Washington, DC, is adorned with <a href="https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/brochures/low-res/CVC_17-115_BrumidiArtistCapitol.pdf">multiple lavish murals</a> created in the 19th century by Italian artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantino_Brumidi">Constantino Brumidi</a>. These include panels in the Senate first-floor corridors, Room H-144, and the rotunda. The crowning glory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apotheosis_of_Washington"><em>The Apotheosis of Washington</em></a> on the dome of the rotunda, 180 feet above the floor.</p>
<p>Brumidi worked in various mediums, including frescoes. Among the issues facing conservators charged with maintaining the Capitol building frescoes is delamination. Artists apply dry pigments to wet plaster to create a fresco, and a good fresco can last for centuries. Over time, though, the decorative plaster layers can separate from the underlying masonry, introducing air gaps. Knowing precisely where such delaminated areas are, and their exact shape, is crucial to conservation efforts, yet the damage might not be obvious to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Acoustician Nicholas Gangemi is part of a research group led by Joseph Vignola at the Catholic University of America that has been using laser Doppler vibrometry to pinpoint delaminated areas of the Capitol building frescoes. It's a non-invasive method that zaps the frescoes with sound waves and measures the vibrational signatures that reflect back to learn about the structural conditions. This in turn enables conservators to make very precise repairs to preserve the frescoes for future generations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/how-sound-aids-in-preserving-frescoes-in-us-capitol-building/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"Serving at the Federal Communications Commission has been the honor of a lifetime, especially my tenure as chair and as the first woman in history to be confirmed to lead this agency," Rosenworcel said in today's announcement. Rosenworcel said that being chair during the pandemic "made clear how important the work of the FCC is and how essential it is for us to build a digital future that works for everyone."</p>
<p>Rosenworcel touted the agency's work in "setting up the largest broadband affordability program in history—which led to us connecting more than 23 million households to high-speed Internet, connecting more than 17 million students caught in the homework gap to hotspots and other devices as learning moved online." That discount program <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/fcc-makes-last-plea-to-congress-as-broadband-discount-program-runs-out-of-cash/">ended this year</a> after Congress let funding run out, despite Rosenworcel's repeated pleas for more money.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/fcc-chairwoman-announces-departure-paving-way-for-republican-majority/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For years, hashing technology has made it possible for platforms to automatically detect known child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) to stop kids from being retraumatized online. However, rapidly detecting new or unknown CSAM remained a bigger challenge for platforms as new victims continued to be victimized. Now, AI may be ready to change that.</p>
<p>Today, a prominent child safety organization, Thorn, in partnership with a leading cloud-based AI solutions provider, Hive, announced the release of an API expanding access to an AI model designed to flag unknown CSAM. It's the earliest use of AI technology striving to expose unreported CSAM at scale.</p>
<p>An expansion of Thorn's CSAM detection tool, <a href="https://safer.io/how-it-works/#compare">Safer</a>, the AI feature uses "advanced machine learning (ML) classification models" to "detect new or previously unreported CSAM," generating a "risk score to make human decisions easier and faster."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ai-trained-on-real-child-sex-abuse-images-to-detect-new-csam/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal prosecutors have charged five men with running an extensive phishing scheme that allegedly allowed them to compromise hundreds of companies nationwide, gain non-public information, and steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The charges, detailed in court documents unsealed Wednesday, pertain to a crime group security researchers have dubbed Scattered Spider. Members were behind a massive breach on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/09/a-phone-call-to-helpdesk-was-likely-all-it-took-to-hack-mgm/">MGM last year</a> that cost the casino and resort company $100 million. MGM preemptively shut down large parts of its internal networks after discovering the breach, causing slot machines and keycards for thousands of hotel rooms to stop working and slowing electronic transfers. Scattered Spider also breached the internal network of authentication provider <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/phishers-who-hit-twilio-and-cloudflare-stole-10k-credentials-from-136-others/">Twilio</a>, which allowed the group to hack or target hundreds of other companies.</p>
<h2>Not your father’s phishing campaign</h2>
<p>Key to Scattered Spider’s success were phishing attacks so methodical and well-orchestrated they were hard to detect even when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/phishers-breach-twilio-and-target-cloudflare-using-workers-home-numbers/">sophisticated defenses were implemented</a>. Microsoft researchers, who track the group under the name Octo Tempest, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/10/25/octo-tempest-crosses-boundaries-to-facilitate-extortion-encryption-and-destruction/">declared</a> it “one of the most dangerous financial criminal groups.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/prosecutors-charge-5-in-phishing-scams-that-stole-millions-of-dollars/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On May 7, 2011, Georgia resident Tonya Brand noticed a pain on the inside of her right thigh. As the pain grew worse in the 4- to 5-inch area of her leg, she headed to a hospital. There, doctors suspected she had a blood clot. But an ultrasound the next day failed to find one. Instead, it revealed a mysterious toothpick-sized object lodged in Brand's leg.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, the painful area became a bulge, and on June 17, Brand put pressure on it. Unexpectedly, the protrusion popped, and a 1.5-inch metal wire came poking out of her leg, piercing her skin.</p>
<p>The piece of metal was later determined to be part of a metal filter she had implanted in a vein in her abdomen more than two years earlier, in March 2009, <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1-1.pdf">according to a lawsuit Brand filed</a>. The filter was initially placed in her inferior vena cava (IVC), the body's largest vein tasked with bringing deoxygenated blood from the lower body back up to the heart. The filter is intended to catch blood clots, preventing them from getting into the lungs, where they could cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Brand got the IVC filter ahead of a spinal surgery she had in 2009, which could boost her risk of clots.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/womans-abdominal-implant-erupts-from-her-leg-experts-call-for-fda-reforms/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When it comes to space policy, a hallmark of the first Trump administration was its embrace of private companies. NASA sought to build fewer expensive things and buy more lower-cost services. In doing so, it aimed to foster a healthy ecosystem of private space companies.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Jim Bridenstine, NASA, during these years, stood on the shoulders of more than a decade of government investment in commercial space. This culminated in a triumphant Crew Dragon mission in the summer of 2020, the first privately led human orbital spaceflight.</p>
<p>This Demo-2 mission, sending NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station on a SpaceX vehicle, validated NASA’s long push into commercial space. Since then, the agency has only doubled down on this approach, generally using fixed-price contracts and buying a service instead of telling companies what and how to build while paying a premium.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/as-nasa-increasingly-relies-on-commercial-space-there-are-some-troubling-signs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We're nearing the end of the year, and there are typically a flood of announcements regarding quantum computers around now, in part because some companies want to live up to promised schedules. Most of these involve evolutionary improvements on previous generations of hardware. But this year, we have something new: the first company to market with a new qubit technology.</p>
<p>The technology is called a dual-rail qubit, and it is intended to make the most common form of error trivially easy to detect in hardware, thus making error correction far more efficient. And, while tech giant Amazon has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/quantum-computing-progress-higher-temps-better-error-correction/">been experimenting with them</a>, a startup called Quantum Circuits is the first to give the public access to dual-rail qubits via a cloud service.</p>
<p>While the tech is interesting on its own, it also provides us with a window into how the field as a whole is thinking about getting error-corrected quantum computing to work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/first-commercial-dual-rail-qubit-hardware-announced/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/11/site-reputation-abuse">Updating our site reputation abuse policy</a>" is how Google, in wondrously opaque fashion, announced yesterday that big changes have come to some big websites, especially those that rely on their domain authority to promote lucrative third-party product recommendations.</p>
<p>If you've searched for reviews and seen results that make you ask why so many old-fashioned news sites seem to be "reviewing" products lately—especially products outside that site's expertise—that's what Google is targeting.</p>
<p>"This is a tactic where third-party content is published on a host site in an attempt to take advantage of the host's already-established ranking signals," Google's post on its Search Central blog reads. "The goal of this tactic is for the content to rank better than it could otherwise on a different site, and leads to a bad search experience for users."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/google-cracks-down-on-parasite-seo-punishing-established-publishers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Archaeologists have discovered numerous ceramic or clay whistles at Aztec sites, dubbed "death whistles" because of their distinctive skull shapes. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-024-00157-7">new paper</a> published in the journal Communications Psychology examines the acoustical elements of the unique shrieking sounds produced by those whistles, as well as how human listeners are emotionally affected by the sounds. The findings support the hypothesis that such whistles may have been used in Aztec religious rituals or perhaps as mythological symbols.</p>
<p>Archaeologists unearthed the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_death_whistle">Aztec death whistles</a>, also known as ehecachichtlis, in 1999 while excavating the Tlatelolco site in Mexico City. They found the body of a sacrificial victim, a 20-year-old male who had been beheaded, at the base of the main stairway of a temple dedicated to the wind god Ehecatl. The skeleton was clutching two ceramic skull-shaped whistles, one in each hand, along with other artifacts. More skull whistles were subsequently found, and they've found their way into popular culture. For instance, in <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> (2021), Egon Spengler had such a whistle in his secret laboratory collection.</p>
<p>Scholars have puzzled over the purpose of the skull whistles, although given the dearth of concrete evidence, most suggestions are highly speculative. One hypothesis is that it was used in battle, with hundreds of warriors blowing their whistles simultaneously as a battle cry. Music archaeologist Arnd Adje Both has dismissed that idea, suggesting instead that the whistle's purpose was more likely tied to ceremonial or religious practices, like human sacrifice. Yet another hypothesis proposes that the whistles were intended as symbols of a deity. The skull shape, for instance, might allude to the Aztec god of the underworld, Mictlantecuhtli.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/study-why-aztec-death-whistles-sound-like-human-screams/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Windows 10's free, guaranteed security updates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/lots-of-pcs-are-poised-to-fall-off-the-windows-10-update-cliff-one-year-from-today/">stop in October 2025</a>, less than a year from now. Windows 10 users with supported PCs have been offered the Windows 11 upgrade plenty of times before. But now Microsoft is apparently making a fresh push to get users to upgrade, sending them full-screen reminders recommending they buy new computers.</p>
<p>The reminders, which users have seen within the last few days, all mention the end of Windows 10 support but otherwise seem to differ from computer to computer. My Ars colleague Kyle Orland got one focused on Windows 11's gaming features, while <a href="https://x.com/femceIs/status/1858314837845229737">posters</a> on <a href="https://x.com/RealJMcAfreak/status/1859181138746704108">X</a> (formerly Twitter) got screens that <a href="https://x.com/JustinWhang/status/1859033492367307108">emphasized</a> the ease of migrating from old PCs to new ones and other Windows 11 features. One specifically recommended <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">upgrading to a Copilot+ PC</a>, which supports a handful of extra AI features that other Windows 11 PCs don't, but other messages didn't mention Copilot+ specifically.</p>
<p>None of the messages mention upgrading to Windows 11 directly, though Kyle said his PC meets Windows 11's requirements. These messages may be intended mostly for people using older PCs that can't officially install the Windows 11 update.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-pushes-full-screen-ads-for-copilot-pcs-on-windows-10-users/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A day after SpaceX launched its Starship rocket <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/the-key-moment-came-38-minutes-after-starship-roared-off-the-launch-pad/">for the sixth time</a>, the company received good news from the Federal Aviation Administration regarding future launch operations from its Starbase facility in South Texas.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship">a draft version</a> of what is known as an "Environmental Assessment," the FAA indicated that it will grant SpaceX permission to increase the number of Starship launches in South Texas to 25 per year from the current limit of five. Additionally, the company will likely be allowed to continue increasing the size and power of the Super Heavy booster stage and Starship upper stage.</p>
<p>"FAA has concluded that the modification of SpaceX’s existing vehicle operator license for Starship/Super Heavy operations conforms to the prior environmental documentation, consistent with the data contained in the 2022 PEA, that there are no significant environmental changes, and all pertinent conditions and requirements of the prior approval have been met or will be met in the current action," the federal agency stated in its conclusion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/spacex-just-got-exactly-what-it-wanted-from-the-faa-for-texas-starship-launches/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> app is one of the most popular ways for cyclists, runners, hikers, and other distance sports enthusiasts to track their performance and grab some bragging rights. Because most athletic types will have the app installed already—and because it's hard or impossible to run two tracking apps at once—many apps use <a href="https://developers.strava.com/">Strava's API</a> as a go-between for workout data.</p>
<p>Strava emailed its more than 100 million users earlier this week to notify them about "important updates on how Strava data can be displayed, accessed, and used by third-party apps." In the <a href="https://communityhub.strava.com/developers-api-7/api-agreement-update-how-data-appears-on-3rd-party-apps-7636?%24web_only=true&amp;%243p=e_it&amp;_branch_match_id=1033098535293130962&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAAy2N4YqEMAyEn6b%2Bq4KVFQ7kOG73XkPimrPlahvSdMW3vwgLgRm%2BTCZehMpH1xVheEELRG0M6a9z9Gn6wdGEc5BGbeawhQRxrhwnf10Z92X6H51n3veagpy%2BLu27SJluVnxhzIRcLFCwo6JLYWPEHZPYSisIWp8PqwY0RQiazsk6Xi0By3nBYsebuxmn74YDlzmneBp3F67YmPHB%2BIvMIW3zwvkoyNO357zjP%2BY%2F%2FAneAAAA">update</a>, Strava noted that third-party apps "are no longer able to display your Strava activity data on their surfaces to other users," that Strava's API data cannot be used "in artificial intelligence models or other similar applications," and that third-party apps must be designed so as to "complement" Strava's look and feel "rather than replicating it."</p>
<p>What does this actually mean? It depends on which apps you're using. DC Rainmaker, a longtime fitness tech blogger, sees the "other users" clause as something that "immediately break[s] almost all coaching apps that have connections to Strava." If an app needs to see your Strava workout to provide insights on performance or connect you to a group, Strava's API seems to block it now. A manager at the training app Intervals <a href="https://forum.intervals.icu/t/strava-activity-visibility-update/79590">posted on the app's official forum</a> that the API change would break Intervals' ability to use Strava as its data source.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/fitness-app-strava-is-tightening-third-party-access-to-user-data/">Read full article</a></p>
