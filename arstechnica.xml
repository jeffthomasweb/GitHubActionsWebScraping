<p>In his complaint, Joshua Aaron, creator of ICEBlock, cited a Fox News interview in which Attorney General Pam Bondi “made plain that the United States government used its regulatory power to coerce a private platform to suppress First Amendment-protected expression.”</p>
<p>Suing Bondi—along with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons, White House “Border Czar” Thomas D. Homan, and unnamed others—Aaron further alleged that US officials made false statements and “unlawful threats” to criminally investigate and prosecute him for developing ICEBlock.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/iceblock-lawsuit-trump-admin-bragged-about-demanding-app-store-removal/">Read full article</a></p>

Discovery’s (WBD’s) streaming and movie studio businesses last week. But Paramount Skydance isn’t relenting on its dreams of owning WBD and is pushing forward with a hostile takeover bid.</p>
<p>On Friday, Netflix announced that it had agreed to pay an equity value of $72 billion, or an approximate total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, for WBD’s streaming and film businesses, as well as its film and TV libraries. The deal includes HBO and the HBO Max streaming service but not WBD’s cable channels, which are to be split off ahead of the acquisition into a separate company called Discovery Global. Netflix said WBD’s split should conclude in Q3 2026.</p>
<p>Paramount has different plans, though.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/paramount-says-it-could-get-antitrust-approval-for-wbd-before-netflix/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The 2025 Formula 1 World Championship drew to a close this past weekend in Abu Dhabi, and with it came the end of the current generation of cars. After a grueling 24 races, the title was decided in a three-way fight by the finest of margins; just two points, less than half a percent, separated the winning driver from second place when the checkered flag waved on Sunday.</p>
<p>Coming into Abu Dhabi, McLaren’s Lando Norris was, if not a comfortable favorite, then at least the driver with the highest odds of prevailing. After a strong start to the season, the British driver’s form dipped at the Dutch Grand Prix. But he bounced back, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/f1-in-mexico-city-we-have-a-new-championship-leader/">retaking the championship lead</a> from his Australian teammate Oscar Piastri in Mexico in October.</p>
<p>For much of the season, it seemed to be a two-car race. McLaren had a clear car advantage and two strong drivers, suggesting a repeat of the years we saw Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg duking it out to bring home titles for Mercedes. But that didn’t figure on Red Bull developing its car late in the season. New boss Laurent Mekies has revitalized the energy drinks squad, and four-time champion Max Verstappen was able to close inexorably toward the McLaren drivers in the points with a string of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/f1-in-texas-well-now-the-championship-is-exciting-again/">sublime performances</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/f1-in-abu-dhabi-and-thats-the-championship/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Almost every bit of bike testing I’ve done starts out the same way. After assembling the bike, I set the seatpost to its maximum recommended height, take it on a short test ride, and try to figure out new and creative phrasing to describe the same old problem: The frame isn’t quite big enough to accommodate my legs. While I’m on the tall side at a bit over 6 feet (~190 cm), I’m definitely not abnormally large. Yet very few e-bike manufacturers seem to be interested in giving people my height a comfortable ride.</p>
<p>So imagine my surprise when, within two blocks of my first ride on <a href="https://lectricebikes.com/products/xpress-750-high-step-ebike">the XPress 750,</a> I had to pull off to the side of the street and lower the seat. This was especially notable given that the XPress is a budget bike (currently on sale for just under $1,000.00) that is only offered in a single frame size. So kudos to Lectric for giving me a comfortable and enjoyable ride, and doing so with a lot of features I wouldn’t expect at this price point.</p>
<p>That said, hitting that price necessitated some significant compromises. We’ll discuss those in detail so you can get a sense of whether any of them will get in the way of your riding enjoyment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/lectric-xpress-750-a-full-sized-bike-for-the-budget-minded/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday, the European Commission announced that the social media giant had offered users an alternative choice of Facebook and Instagram services that would show them fewer personalized advertisements.</p>
<p>The offer follows an EU investigation into Meta’s policy of requiring users either to consent to data tracking or pay for an ad-free service. The Financial Times reported on optimism that an agreement could be reached between the parties in October.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/meta-offers-eu-users-ad-light-option-in-push-to-end-investigation/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Prime Video dropped an extended teaser for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_season_5">fifth and final season</a> of <em>The Boys</em>—based on the comic book series of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson—during CCXP in Sao Paulo, Brazil. And it looks like we’re getting nothing less than a full-on Supe-ocalypse as an all-powerful Homelander seeks revenge on The Boys.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for prior seasons of <em>The Boys</em> and S2 of <em>Gen V</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>Things were not looking good for our antiheroes after the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_Four_Finale"> S4 finale</a>. They managed to thwart the assassination of newly elected US President Robert Singer, but new Vought CEO/evil supe Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) essentially overthrew the election and installed Senator Steve Calhoun (David Andrews) as president. Calhoun declared martial law, and naturally, Homelander (Antony “Give Him an Emmy Already” Starr) swore loyalty as his chief enforcer. Butcher (Karl Urban) and Annie (Erin Moriarty) escaped, but the rest of The Boys were rounded up and placed in re-education—er, “Freedom”—camps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/the-boys-gears-up-for-a-supe-ocalypse-in-s5-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s time to admit, before God and the good readers of Ars Technica, that I have a problem. I love roguelikes. Reader, I can’t get enough of them. If there’s even a whisper of a hot new roguelike on Steam, I’m <em>there</em>. You may call them arcane, repetitive, or maddeningly difficult; I call them heaven.</p>
<p>The second best part of video games is taking a puny little character and, over 100 hours, transforming that adventurer into a god of destruction. The best thing about video games is doing the same thing in under an hour. Beat a combat encounter, get an upgrade. Enter a new area, choose a new item. Put together a build and watch it sing.</p>
<p>If you die—immediately ending your ascent and returning you to the beginning of the game—you’ll often make a pit stop at a home base to unlock new goodies to help you on your next run. (Some people distiguish between roguelikes and “roguelites,” with the latter including permanent, between-run upgrades. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll use “roguelike” as an umbrella term).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/please-send-help-i-cant-stop-playing-these-roguelikes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Popular genetics tests can’t tell you much about your dog’s personality, according to a recent study.</p>
<p>A team of geneticists recently found no connection between simple genetic variants and behavioral traits in more than 3,200 dogs, even though previous studies suggested that hundreds of genes might predict aspects of a dog’s behavior and personality. That’s despite the popularity of at-home genetic tests that claim they can tell you whether your dog’s genes contain the recipe for anxiety or a fondness for cuddles.</p>

<h2><em>Gattaca</em> for dogs, except it doesn’t work</h2>
<p>University of Massachusetts genomicist Kathryn Lord and her colleagues compared DNA sequences and behavioral surveys from more than 3,000 dogs whose humans had enrolled them in the Darwin’s Ark project (and filled out the surveys). “Genetic tests for behavioral and personality traits in dogs are now being marketed to pet owners, but their predictive accuracy has not been validated,” wrote Lord and her colleagues in their recent paper.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/why-is-my-dog-like-this-current-dna-tests-wont-explain-it-to-you/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Black Death ravaged medieval Western Europe, ultimately wiping out roughly one-third of the population. Scientists have identified the bacterium responsible and its likely origins, but certain specifics of how and why it spread to Europe are less clear. According to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02964-0">a new paper</a> published in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment, either one large volcanic eruption or a cluster of eruptions might have been the triggering factor, setting off a chain of events that brought the plague to the Mediterranean region in the 1340s.</p>
<p>Technically, we’re <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/researchers-find-just-two-plague-strains-wiped-out-30-60-of-europe/">talking about</a> the <em>second</em> plague pandemic. The first, known as the Justinian Plague, broke out about 541 CE and quickly spread across Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. (The Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I, for whom the pandemic is named, actually survived the disease.) There continued to be outbreaks of the plague over the next 300 years, although the disease gradually became less virulent and died out. Or so it seemed.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, the Black Death burst onto the scene, with the first historically documented outbreak occurring in 1346 in the Lower Volga and Black Sea regions. That was just the beginning of the second pandemic. During the 1630s, fresh outbreaks of plague killed half the populations of affected cities. Another bout of the plague significantly culled the population of France during an outbreak between 1647 and 1649, followed by an epidemic in London in the summer of 1665. The latter was so virulent that, by October, one in 10 Londoners had succumbed to the disease—over 60,000 people. Similar numbers perished in an outbreak in Holland in the 1660s. The pandemic had run its course by the early 19th century, but a third plague pandemic hit China and India in the 1890s. There are still occasional outbreaks today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/how-volcanoes-helped-spark-the-black-death/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I wrote a couple of weeks ago about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/ive-already-been-using-a-steam-machine-for-months-and-i-think-its-great/">my personal homebrew Steam Machine</a>, a self-built desktop under my TV featuring an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ryzen-8000g-review-an-integrated-gpu-that-can-beat-a-graphics-card-for-a-price/">AMD Ryzen 7 8700G</a> processor and a Radeon 780M integrated GPU. I wouldn’t recommend making your own version of this build, especially with RAM prices as they currently are, but there are all kinds of inexpensive mini PCs on Amazon with the same GPU, and they’ll all be pretty good at playing the kinds of games that already run well on the less-powerful Steam Deck.</p>
<p>But this kind of hardware is an imperfect proxy for the Steam Machine that Valve plans to launch sometime next year—that box will include a dedicated GPU with 8GB of dedicated video memory, presenting both benefits and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/steamos-has-problems-with-8gb-gpus-but-valve-is-working-on-it/">possible pitfalls</a> compared to a system with an integrated GPU.</p>
<p>As a last pre-Steam Machine follow-up to our coverage so far, we’ve run tests on several games we test regularly in our GPU reviews to get a sense of how current versions of SteamOS stack up to Windows running on the same hardware. What we’ve found so far is basically the inverse of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">what we found when comparing handhelds</a>: Windows usually has an edge on SteamOS’s performance, and sometimes that gap is quite large. And SteamOS also exacerbates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/steamos-has-problems-with-8gb-gpus-but-valve-is-working-on-it/">problems with 8GB GPUs</a>, hitting apparent RAM limits in more games and at lower resolutions compared to Windows.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/steamos-vs-windows-on-dedicated-gpus-its-complicated-but-windows-has-an-edge/">Read full article</a></p>

The decision was made with no evidence of harm from that dose and no evidence of any benefit from the delay.</p>
<p>Public health experts, medical experts, and even some members of the panel decried the vote, which studies and historical data indicate will lead to more infections in babies that, in turn, will lead to more cases of chronic liver disease, liver cancer, and premature death.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk’s X became the first large online platform fined under the European Union’s Digital Services Act on Friday.</p>
<p>The European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2934">announced</a> that X would be fined nearly $140 million, with the potential to face “periodic penalty payments” if the platform fails to make corrections.</p>
<p>A third of the fine came from one of the first moves Musk made when taking over Twitter. In November 2022, he changed the platform’s historical use of a blue checkmark to verify the identities of notable users. Instead, Musk started selling blue checks for about $8 per month, immediately prompting a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/twitter-scammers-use-musks-paid-checkmarks-to-spread-official-looking-fake-news/">wave of imposter accounts </a>pretending to be notable celebrities, officials, and brands.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/elon-musks-x-first-to-be-fined-under-eus-digital-service-act/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There’s some Toyota news today that doesn’t involve the chairman wearing a MAGA hat. The Japanese automaker evidently decided it’s been too long since it flexed its engineering chops on something with two doors and plenty of power, so it has rectified that situation with a new flagship coupe for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/toyotas-rally-bred-hot-hatch-the-300-hp-awd-gr-corolla-reviewed/">Gazoo Racing</a> sporty <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/we-drive-the-most-hardcore-toyota-corolla-ever-the-gr-morizo-edition/">sub-brand</a>. Meet the GR GT, which looks set to go on sale toward the end of next year.</p>
<p>The Camry-esque look at the front, and to an extent the rear, came second to the GR GT’s aerodynamics, which is the opposite way to how Toyota usually styles its cars. It’s built around a highly rigid aluminum frame—Toyota’s first, apparently—with carbon fiber for the hood, roof, and some other body panels to minimize weight. The automaker says that lowering the car’s center of gravity was a top priority, and weight balance and distribution also help explain the transaxle layout, where the car’s transmission is behind the cockpit and between the rear wheels.</p>

<p>That transaxle transmission will be an eight-speed automatic that uses a wet clutch instead of a torque converter and into which the car’s hybrid motor is integrated. Power from the 4.0 L twin-turbo V8 and the hybrid system should be a combined 641 hp (478 kW) and 626 lb-ft (850 Nm). Despite the aluminum frame and use of composites, the GT GR is no featherweight; it will weigh as much as 3,858 lb (1,750 kg). The V8 is a new design with a short stroke, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_vee_turbocharged_engine">hot-V</a> configuration for the turbochargers, and dry sump lubrication.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/toyota-busts-out-a-new-flagship-gazoo-racing-coupe-plus-gt3-version/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sItUCKJQLTU?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>With <em>House of the Dragon</em> entering its third season, HBO is ready to debut a new spinoff series set in <em>Game of Thrones’</em> Westeros: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Knight_of_the_Seven_Kingdoms_(TV_series)">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</a>,</em> based on George R.R. Martin’s <em>Tales of Dunk and Egg</em> novellas. HBO clearly has a lot of confidence in this series; it’s already been renewed for a second season. And judging by the final trailer, that optimism is warranted.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-teaser-debuts-at-nycc/">previously reported</a>, <em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em> adapts the first novella in the series, <em>The Hedge Knight,</em> and is set 50 years after the events of <em>House of the Dragon</em>. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>A century before the events of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros: a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg. Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter Claffey co-stars as Ser Duncan the Tall, aka a hedge knight named “Dunk,” along with Dexter Sol Ansell as Prince Aegon Targaryen, aka “Egg,” a child prince and Dunk’s squire. The main cast also includes Finn Bennett as Egg’s older brother, Prince Aerion “Brightflame” Targaryen; Bertie Carvel as Egg’s uncle, Prince Baelor “Breakspear” Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne; Tanzyn Crawford as a Dornish puppeteer named Tanselle; Daniel Ings as Ser Lyonel “Laughing Storm” Baratheon, heir to House Baratheon; and Sam Spruell as Prince Maekar Targaryen, Egg’s father.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-trailer-brings-levity-to-westeros/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As global warming accelerates, about 480 million people in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula face intensifying and in some places unsurvivable heat, as well as drought, famine, and the risk of mass displacement, the World Meteorological Organization warned Thursday.</p>
<p>The 22 Arab region countries covered in the WMO’s new <a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-arab-region-2024">State of the Climate report</a> produce about a quarter of the world’s oil, yet directly account for only 5 to 7 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions from their own territories. The climate paradox positions the region as both a linchpin of the global fossil-fuel economy and one of the most vulnerable geographic areas.</p>
<p>WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said extreme heat is pushing communities in the region to their physical limits. Droughts show no sign of letting up in one of the world’s most water-stressed regions, but at the same time, parts of it have been devastated by record rains and flooding, she added.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/new-report-warns-of-critical-climate-risks-in-arab-region/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.21 of the Rocket Report! We’re back after the Thanksgiving holiday with more launch news. Most of the big stories over the last couple of weeks came from abroad. Russian rockets and launch pads didn’t fare so well. China’s launch industry celebrated several key missions. SpaceX was busy, too, with seven launches over the last two weeks, six of them carrying more Starlink Internet satellites into orbit. We expect between 15 and 20 more orbital launch attempts worldwide before the end of the year.</p>

<p><b>Another Sarmat failure. </b>A Russian intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fired from an underground silo on the country’s southern steppe on November 28 on a scheduled test to deliver a dummy warhead to a remote impact zone nearly 4,000 miles away. The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet, Ars reports. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the <a href="https://t.me/militaryrussiaru/39856">Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram</a> and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/rocket-report-openais-launch-overture-south-korea-making-progress-in-space/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent months, it has begun dawning on US lawmakers that, absent significant intervention, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/after-recent-tests-china-appears-likely-to-beat-the-united-states-back-to-the-moon/">China will land humans</a> on the Moon before the United States can return there with the Artemis Program.</p>
