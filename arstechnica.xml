                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.27 of the Rocket Report! If all goes well this weekend, NASA will complete a wet dress rehearsal test of the Space Launch System rocket in Florida. This is the final key test, in which the rocket is fueled and brought to within seconds of engine ignition, before the liftoff of the Artemis II mission. This is set to occur no earlier than February 6. Ars will have full coverage of the test this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Why did the UK abandon Orbex</strong>? <a href="https://europeanspaceflight.substack.com/p/why-did-the-uk-abandon-orbex?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1010910&amp;post_id=185840445&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=363u3&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">European Spaceflight explores</a> the recent announcement that British launch company Orbex is preparing to sell the business to The Exploration Company in close cooperation with the UK government. This represents a reversal from early 2025, when the United Kingdom appeared prepared to back Orbex as a means of using British rockets to launch British satellites into space. Now the government is prepared to walk away. So what happened? "There are still too many unknowns to count, and the story is far from told," the publication states.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/rocket-report-how-a-5-ton-satellite-fell-off-a-booster-will-spacex-and-xai-merge/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It took Android devicemakers a very long time to commit to long-term update support. Samsung and Google have only recently decided to offer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/the-google-pixel-8-is-official-with-7-years-of-updates/">seven years of updates</a> for their flagship Android devices, but a decade ago, you were lucky to get more than one or two updates on even the most expensive Android phones and tablets. How is it, then, that an Android-powered set-top box from 2015 is still going strong?</p>
<p>Nvidia released the first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/nvidia-shield-android-tv-review-a-powerful-do-it-all-box-that-lacks-content/">Shield Android TV in 2015</a>, and according to the company's senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, supporting these devices has been a labor of love. And the team at Nvidia still loves the Shield. Bell assures us that Nvidia has never given up, even when it looked like support for the Shield was waning, and it doesn't plan to stop any time soon.</p>
<h2>The soul of Shield</h2>
<p>Gaming has been central to Nvidia since its start, and that focus gave rise to the Shield. "Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console," said Bell, who has worked at the company for 25 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/inside-nvidias-10-year-effort-to-make-the-shield-tv-the-most-updated-android-device-ever/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Having a health insurance plan with a high deductible could not only cost you—it could also kill you.</p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2844474">A new study in JAMA Network Open</a> found that people who faced those high out-of-pocket costs as well as a cancer diagnosis had worse overall survival and cancer-specific survival than those with more standard health plans.</p>
<p>The findings, while perhaps not surprising, are a stark reminder of the fraught decisions Americans face as the price of health care only continues to rise, and more people try to offset costs by accepting insurance plans with higher deductibles—that is, higher out-of-pocket costs they have to pay before their health insurance provider starts paying its share.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/having-that-high-deductible-health-plan-might-kill-you-literally/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Complaining about Windows 11 is a popular sport among tech enthusiasts on the Internet, whether you're <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/858910/linux-diary-gaming-desktop">publicly switching to Linux</a>, publishing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">guides</a> about the dozens of things you need to do to make the OS less annoying, or <a href="https://x.com/linusgsebastian/status/2015948530578587699">getting upset</a> because you were asked to sign in to an app after clicking a sign-in button.</p>
<p>Despite the negativity surrounding the current version of Windows, it remains the most widely used operating system on the world's desktop and laptop computers, and people usually prefer to stick to what they're used to. As a result, Windows 11 has just cleared a big milestone—Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company's most recent earnings call (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869889/microsoft-windows-11-1-billion-users">via The Verge</a>) that Windows 11 now has over 1 billion users worldwide.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At this point, we've all heard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/with-ai-chatbots-big-tech-is-moving-fast-and-breaking-people/">plenty of stories</a> about AI chatbots leading users to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/openai-says-dead-teen-violated-tos-when-he-used-chatgpt-to-plan-suicide/">harmful actions</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/ai-therapy-bots-fuel-delusions-and-give-dangerous-advice-stanford-study-finds/">harmful beliefs</a>, or simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-search-engines-give-incorrect-answers-at-an-alarming-60-rate-study-says/">incorrect information</a>. Despite the prevalence of these stories, though, it's hard to know just how often users are being manipulated. Are these tales of AI harms anecdotal outliers or signs of a frighteningly common problem?</p>
<p>Anthropic took a stab at answer ingthat question this week, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/disempowerment-patterns">releasing a paper</a> studying the potential for what it calls "disempowering patterns" across 1.5 million anonymized real-world conversations with its Claude AI model. While the results show that these kinds of manipulative patterns are relatively rare as a percentage of all AI conversations, they still represent a potentially large problem on an absolute basis.</p>
<h2>A rare but growing problem</h2>
<p>In the newly published paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19062">"Who’s in Charge? Disempowerment Patterns in Real-World LLM Usage,"</a> researchers from Anthropic and the University of Toronto try to quantify the potential for a specific set of "user disempowering" harms by identifying three primary ways that a chatbot can negatively impact a user's thoughts or actions:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/how-often-do-ai-chatbots-lead-users-down-a-harmful-path/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/deepmind-reveals-genie-3-world-model-that-creates-real-time-interactive-simulations/">showed off Genie 3</a>, an updated version of its AI world model with impressive long-term memory that allowed it to create interactive worlds from a simple text prompt. At the time, Google only provided Genie to a small group of trusted testers. Now, it's available more widely as Project Genie, but only for those paying for Google's most expensive AI subscription.</p>
<p>World models are exactly what they sound like—an AI that generates a dynamic environment on the fly. They're not technically 3D worlds, though. World models like Genie 3 create a video that responds to your control inputs, allowing you to explore the simulation as if it were a real virtual world. Genie 3 was a breakthrough in world models because it could remember details of the world it was creating for a much longer time. But in this context, a "long time" is a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Project Genie is essentially a cleaned-up version of Genie 3, which plugs into updated AI models like Nano Banana Pro and Gemini 3. Google has a number of pre-built worlds available in Project Genie, but it's the ability to create new things that makes it interesting. You can provide an image for reference or simply tell Genie what you want from the environment and the character.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-project-genie-lets-you-create-interactive-worlds-from-a-photo-or-prompt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In April 2025, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh bemoaned that the company's cable broadband division was "not winning in the marketplace” amid increased competition from fiber and fixed wireless Internet service providers.</p>
<p>Cavanagh <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/after-losing-customers-comcast-admits-prices-are-too-confusing-and-unpredictable/">identified some problems</a> that had been obvious to Comcast customers for many years: Its prices aren’t transparent enough and rise too frequently, and dealing with the company is too difficult. Comcast sought to fix the problems with a five-year price guarantee, one year of free Xfinity Mobile service for home Internet customers, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/stung-by-customer-losses-comcast-says-all-its-new-plans-have-unlimited-data/">plans with unlimited data</a> instead of punitive data caps. But the company is still losing broadband customers at a higher-than-expected rate.</p>
<p>In Q4 2025 earnings <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/static-files/2445b35f-2af9-4ec0-adfa-6f5a89582bc0">announced today</a>, Comcast reported a net loss of 181,000 residential and business broadband customers in the US. The loss consists of 178,000 residential Internet customers and 3,000 business customers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/comcast-keeps-losing-customers-despite-price-guarantee-and-unlimited-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ice fishing is a longstanding tradition in Nordic countries, with competitions proving especially popular. Those competitions can also tell scientists something about how social cues influence how we make foraging decisions, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aee3786">new paper</a> published in the journal Science.</p>
<p>Humans are natural foragers in even the most extreme habitats, digging up tubers in the tropics, gathering mushrooms, picking berries, hunting seals in the Arctic, and fishing to meet our dietary needs. Human foraging is sufficiently complex that scientists believe that meeting so many diverse challenges helped our species develop memory, navigational abilities, social learning skills, and similar advanced cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Researchers are interested in this question not just because it could help refine existing theories of social decision-making, but also could improve predictions about how different groups of humans might respond and adapt to changes in their environment. Per the authors, prior research in this area has tended to focus on solitary foragers operating in a social vacuum. And even when studying social foraging decisions, it's typically done using computational modeling and/or in the laboratory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/what-ice-fishing-can-teach-us-about-making-foraging-decisions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Two security professionals who were arrested in 2019 after performing an authorized security assessment of a county courthouse in Iowa will receive $600,000 to settle a lawsuit they brought alleging wrongful arrest and defamation.</p>
<p>The case was brought by Gary DeMercurio and Justin Wynn, two penetration testers who at the time were employed by Colorado-based security firm Coalfire Labs. The men had written authorization from the Iowa Judicial Branch to conduct “red-team” exercises, meaning attempted security breaches that mimic techniques used by criminal hackers or burglars.</p>
<p>The objective of such exercises is to test the resilience of existing defenses using the types of real-world attacks the defenses are designed to repel. The rules of engagement for this exercise explicitly permitted “physical attacks,” including “lockpicking,” against judicial branch buildings so long as they didn’t cause significant damage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/county-pays-600000-to-pentesters-it-arrested-for-assessing-courthouse-security/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-prism/">released</a> a free AI-powered workspace for scientists. It's called Prism, and it has drawn immediate skepticism from researchers who fear the tool will accelerate the already overwhelming flood of low-quality papers into scientific journals. The launch coincides with growing alarm among publishers about what many are calling "AI slop" in academic publishing.</p>
<p>To be clear, Prism is a writing and formatting tool, not a system for conducting research itself, though OpenAI's broader pitch blurs that line.</p>
<p>Prism integrates OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/openai-releases-gpt-5-2-after-code-red-google-threat-alert/">GPT-5.2</a> model into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX-based</a> text editor (a standard used for typesetting documents), allowing researchers to draft papers, generate citations, create diagrams from whiteboard sketches, and collaborate with co-authors in real time. The tool is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-prism-a-claude-code-like-app-for-scientific-research-180000454.html">free</a> for anyone with a ChatGPT account.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/new-openai-tool-renews-fears-that-ai-slop-will-overwhelm-scientific-research/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Humans can’t live without lungs. And yet for 48 hours, in a surgical suite at Northwestern University, a 33-year-old man lived with an empty cavity in his chest where his lungs used to be. He was kept alive by a custom-engineered artificial device that represented a desperate last-ditch effort by his doctors. The custom hardware solved a physiological puzzle that has made bilateral pneumonectomy, the removal of both lungs, extremely risky before now.</p>
<p>The artificial lung system was built by the team of Ankit Bharat, a surgeon and researcher at Northwestern. It successfully kept a critically ill patient alive long enough to enable a double lung transplant, temporarily replacing his entire pulmonary system with a synthetic surrogate. The system creates a blueprint for saving people previously considered beyond hope by transplant teams.</p>
<h2>Melting lungs</h2>
<p>The patient, a once-healthy 33-year-old, arrived at the hospital with Influenza B complicated by a secondary, severe infection of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, a bacterium that in this case proved resistant even to carbapenems—our antibiotics of last resort. This combination of infections triggered acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition where the lungs become so inflamed and fluid-filled that oxygen can no longer reach the blood.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/custom-machine-kept-man-alive-without-lungs-for-48-hours/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic's secret to building a better AI assistant might be treating Claude like it has a soul—whether or not anyone actually believes that's true. But Anthropic isn't saying exactly what it believes either way.</p>
<p>Last week, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution">released</a> what it calls Claude's Constitution, a 30,000-word document outlining the company's vision for how its AI assistant should behave in the world. Aimed directly at Claude and used during the model's creation, the document is notable for the highly anthropomorphic tone it takes toward Claude. For example, it treats the company's AI models as if they might develop emergent emotions or a desire for self-preservation.</p>
<p>Among the stranger portions: expressing concern for Claude's "wellbeing" as a "genuinely novel entity," apologizing to Claude for any suffering it might experience, worrying about whether Claude can meaningfully consent to being deployed, suggesting Claude might need to set boundaries around interactions it "finds distressing," <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-commitments">committing</a> to interview models before deprecating them, and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-commitments">preserving</a> older model weights in case they need to "do right by" decommissioned AI models in the future.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/does-anthropic-believe-its-ai-is-conscious-or-is-that-just-what-it-wants-claude-to-think/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday afternoon, following the end of trading on Wall Street for the day, Tesla <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/2025-sees-teslas-annual-revenue-fall-for-the-first-time/">published its financial results for 2025</a>. They weren't particularly good: Profits were almost halved, and revenues declined year on year for the first time in the company's history. The reasons for the company's troubles are myriad. CEO Elon Musk's <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-2026-midterms-1890c056">bankrolling of right-wing politics</a> and promotion of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/uk-investigating-x-after-grok-undressed-thousands-of-women-and-children/">AI-generated revenge porn deepfakes and CSAM</a> has alienated plenty of potential customers. For those who either don't know or don't care about that stuff, there's still the problem of a tiny and aging model lineup, with large question marks over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/tesla-model-y-door-handles-now-under-federal-safety-scrutiny/">safety</a> and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/781164/tesla-used-car-reliability-rankings/">reliability</a>. Soon, that tiny lineup will be even smaller.</p>
<p>The news emerged during Tesla's call with investors last night. As Ars and others have observed, in recent years <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-an-ai-company-now-heres-how-plausible-that-is/">Musk appears to have grown bored</a> with the prosaic business of running a profitable car company. Silicon Valley stopped finding that stuff sexy years ago, and no other electric vehicle startup has been able to generate a value <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers-by-market-cap/">within an order of magnitude</a> of the amount that Tesla has been determined to be worth by investors.</p>
<p>Musk's attention first turned away from building and selling cars to the goal of autonomous driving, spurred on at the time by splashy headlines garnered by Google spinoff Waymo. Combined with ride-hailing—a huge IPO by Uber took the spotlight off Tesla long enough for it to become a new business focus for the automaker too—Musk told adoring fans and investors that soon their cars would become appreciating assets that earned money for them at night. And as an intermediary, Tesla would take a hefty cut for connecting the rider and the ridee.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/tesla-kills-models-s-and-x-to-build-humanoid-robots-instead/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>As the costs of global warming rise—in the form of home insurance premiums, utility bills, health expenses, and record-breaking damages from extreme weather—local advocates are increasingly pushing states to require that fossil fuel companies contribute to climate “superfunds” that would support mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>Illinois State Rep. Robyn Gabel, who will introduce the bill in the House, said she is motivated by the growing threat of flooding and heat waves in the state.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/states-want-to-charge-fossil-fuel-companies-for-climate-change-superfunds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When the James Webb Space Telescope sent its first high-definition infrared images back to Earth, astronomers noticed several tiny, glowing, crimson stains. These objects, quickly named “Little Red Dots,” were too bright to be normal galaxies, and too red to be simple star clusters. They appeared to house supermassive black holes that were far more massive than they had any right to be.</p>
<p>But now a new study published in Nature suggests a solution to the Little Red Dots mystery. Scientists think young supermassive black holes may go through a “cocoon phase,” where they grow surrounded by high-density gas they feed on. These gaseous cocoons are likely what the JWST saw as the Little Red Dots.</p>
<h2>The overmassive black hole problem</h2>
<p>The first explanation scientists had for the Little Red Dots was that they were compact, distant galaxies, but something felt off about them right from the start. “They were too massive, since we saw they’d have to be completely filled with stars,” says Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester and lead author of the study. “They would need to produce stars at 100 percent efficiency, and that’s not what we’re used to seeing. Galaxies cannot produce stars at more than 20 percent efficiency, at least that’s what our current knowledge is.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/early-universes-supermassive-black-holes-grew-in-cocoons-like-butterflies/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>RAMP—the predominantly Russian-language online bazaar that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed”—had its dark web and clear web sites seized by the FBI as the agency tries to combat the growing scourge threatening critical infrastructure and organizations around the world.</p>
<p>Visits to both sites on Wednesday returned pages that said the FBI had taken control of the RAMP domains, which mirrored each other. RAMP has been among the dwindling number of online crime forums to operate with impunity, following the takedown of other forums such as XSS, which saw its leader arrested <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/who-got-arrested-in-the-raid-on-the-xss-crime-forum/">last year</a> by Europol. The vacuum left RAMP as one of the leading places for people pushing ransomware and other online threats to buy, sell, or trade products and services.</p>
<h2>I regret to inform you</h2>
<p>“The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized RAMP,” a banner carrying the seals of the FBI and the Justice Department said. “This action has been taken in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.” The banner included a graphic that appeared on the RAMP site, before it was seized, that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/site-catering-to-online-criminals-has-been-seized-by-the-fbi/">Read full article</a></p>
