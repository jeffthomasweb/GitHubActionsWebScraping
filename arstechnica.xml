<p>The outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in US dairy cows has now spread to three herds in California, the largest milk-producing state in the country with around 1.7 million dairy cows, <a href="https://pressreleases.cdfa.ca.gov/Home/PressRelease/62008965">federal and state health officials have confirmed</a>.</p>
<p>Fourteen states and 197 herds have now been affected by the unprecedented outbreak in dairy cows, which was first confirmed by federal health officials on March 25.</p>
<p>In a statement, the secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, Karen Ross, said the spread of the virus to California was not unexpected. "We have been preparing for this possibility since earlier this year when [Highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI] detections were confirmed at dairy farms in other states," Ross said. "Our extensive experience with HPAI in poultry has given us ample preparation and expertise to address this incident, with workers’ health and public health as our top priorities."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047019#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047019&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Disney-owned channels have been blacked out on DirecTV for the past two days because of a contract dispute, with both companies claiming publicly that they aren't willing to budge much from their negotiating positions. Until it's resolved, DirecTV subscribers won't have access to ABC, ESPN, and other Disney channels.</p>
<p>While there have been many contentious contract negotiations between TV providers and programmers, this one is "not a run-of-the-mill dispute," DirecTV CFO Ray Carpenter said today in a call with reporters and analysts, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/directv-disney-carriage-fight-1235990223/">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "This is not the kind of dispute where we're haggling over percentage points on a rate. This is really about changing the model in a way that gives everyone confidence that this industry can survive."</p>
<p>Carpenter was quoted as saying that DirecTV will fight Disney "as long as it needs to" and accused Disney of timing the blackout before big sporting events "to put the most pain and disruption on our customers." Carpenter also said DirecTV doesn't "have any dates drawn in the sand" and is "not playing a short-term game," <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/directv-disney-blackout-no-easy-resolution-nfl-1236128284/">according to Variety</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046976#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046976&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>There's long been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwP_s7qjxvA">a debate</a> in baseball circles about the respective benefits and drawbacks of using <a href="https://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/bats/perform-advantage.html#:~:text=Width%20of%20the%20sweet%20spot,away%20from%20the%20sweet%20spot.&amp;text=When%20a%20ball%20hits%20a,friction%20forces%20during%20this%20compression.">wood bats versus metal bats</a>. However, there are relatively few scientific studies on the topic that focus specifically on young athletes, who are most likely to use metal bats. Scientists at Washington State University (WSU) conducted their own tests of wood and metal bats with young players. They found that while there are indeed performance differences between wooden and metal bats, a batter's skill is still the biggest factor affecting how fast the ball comes off the bat, according to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17543371241260098">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology.</p>
<p>According to physicist and acoustician <a href="https://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/">Daniel Russell</a> of Penn State University—who was not involved in the study but has a <a href="https://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/bats/perform-advantage.html#:~:text=Width%20of%20the%20sweet%20spot,away%20from%20the%20sweet%20spot.&amp;text=When%20a%20ball%20hits%20a,friction%20forces%20during%20this%20compression.">long-standing interest</a> in the physics of baseball ever since his faculty days at Kettering University in Michigan—metal bats were first introduced in 1974 and soon dominated NCAA college baseball, youth baseball, and adult amateur softball. Those programs liked the metal bats because they were less likely to break than traditional wooden bats, reducing costs.</p>
<p>Players liked them because it can be easier to control metal bats and swing faster, as the center of mass is closer to the balance point in the bat's handle, resulting in a lower moment of inertia (or "swing weight"). A faster swing doesn't mean that a hit ball will travel faster, however, since the lower moment of inertia is countered by a decreased collision efficiency. Metal bats are also more forgiving if players happen to hit the ball away from the proverbial "sweet spot" of the bat. (The <a href="https://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/148th/russell.html">definition of the sweet spot</a> is a bit fuzzy because it is sometimes defined in different ways, but it's commonly understood to be the area on the bat's barrel that results in the highest batted ball speeds.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046697#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046697&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, ABC <a href="https://abc.com/news/1efd942d-61bb-4519-8a62-c4a8fce50792/category/1138628">announced</a> an upcoming TV special titled, "AI and the Future of Us: An Oprah Winfrey Special." The one-hour show, set to air on September 12, aims to explore AI's impact on daily life and will feature interviews with figures in the tech industry, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Bill Gates. Soon after the announcement, some AI critics began questioning the guest list and the framing of the show in general.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel is not a place to work if you're not ready for some, shall we say, spirited argument. Still, one key developer in the project to expand Rust's place inside the largely C-based kernel feels the "nontechnical nonsense" is too much, so he's retiring.</p>
<p>Wedson Almeida Filho, a leader in the <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust for Linux project</a>, <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240828211117.9422-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/">wrote</a> to the Linux kernel mailing list last week to remove himself as the project's maintainer. "After almost 4 years, I find myself lacking the energy and enthusiasm I once had to respond to some of the nontechnical nonsense, so it's best to leave it up to those who still have it in them," Filho wrote. While thanking his teammates, he noted that he believed the future of kernels "is with memory-safe languages," such as Rust. "I am no visionary but if Linux doesn't internalize this, I'm afraid some other kernel will do to it what it did to Unix," Filho wrote.</p>
<p>Filho also left a "sample for context," a link to <a href="https://youtu.be/WiPp9YEBV0Q?t=1529">a moment during a Linux conference talk</a> in which an off-camera voice, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/02/rust_for_linux_maintainer_steps_down/">identified by Filho in a Register interview</a> as kernel maintainer Ted Ts'o, emphatically interjects: "Here's the thing: you're not going to force all of us to learn Rust." In the context of Filho's request that Linux's file system implement Rust bindings, Ts'o says that while he knows he must fix all the C code for any change he makes, he cannot or will not fix the Rust bindings that may be affected.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046763#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046763&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of the reasons gold is so valuable is because it is highly unreactive—if you make something out of gold, it keeps its lustrous radiance. Even when you can react it with another material, it's also barely soluble, a combination that makes it difficult to purify away from other materials. Which is part of why a large majority of the gold we've obtained comes from deposits where it is present in large chunks, some of them reaching hundreds of kilograms.</p>
<p>Those of you paying careful attention to the previous paragraph may have noticed a problem here: If gold is so difficult to get into its pure form, how do natural processes create enormous chunks of it? On Monday, a group of Australian researchers published a hypothesis, and a bit of evidence supporting it. They propose that an earthquake-triggered piezoelectric effect essentially electroplates gold onto quartz crystals.</p>
<h2>The hypothesis</h2>
<p>Approximately 75 percent of the gold humanity has obtained has come from what are called orogenic gold deposits. Orogeny is a term for the tectonic processes that build mountains, and orogenic gold deposits form in the seams where two bodies of rock are moving past each other. These areas are often filled with hot hydrothermal fluids, and the heat can increase the solubility of gold from "barely there" to "extremely low," meaning generally less than a single milligram in a liter of water.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046817#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046817&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Sony's team-based online shooter <em>Concord</em> has been removed from sale and will be taken offline on Friday, September 6, just two weeks after its August 23 launch. Firewalk Studios Game Director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">said in an announcement Tuesday</a> that publisher Sony will offer refunds to all players who purchased the game on PC or PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Sony may not need to pay out that many refunds. GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">told IGN</a> last week that he estimated an underwhelming 25,000 total sales for the game across PS5 and PC. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, meanwhile, said that just 0.2 percent of all active PS5 players were playing the game last Monday, making it the 147th most-played title for that day.</p>
<p>The Steam version of the game peaked at well under 700 players just after launch, <a href="&lt;a%20href=">according to SteamDB tracking</a>. On PlayStation, popular opt-in trophy tracking site PSNProfiles logged <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28912-concord">just over 1,300 players who owned <em>Concord</em></a>, a relatively small showing compared to popular recent releases like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> (<a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28905-star-wars-outlaws">4,300 PSNProfiles owners</a>) and Black Myth: Wukong (<a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28916-black-myth-wukong">16,000 PSNProfiles-tracked owners</a>).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046849#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046849&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The YubiKey 5, the most widely used hardware token for two-factor authentication based on the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/how-fido-works/">FIDO standard</a>, contains a cryptographic flaw that makes the finger-size device vulnerable to cloning when an attacker gains temporary physical access to it, researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The cryptographic flaw, known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side channel</a>, resides in a small microcontroller used in a large number of other authentication devices, including smartcards used in banking, electronic passports, and the accessing of secure areas. While the researchers have confirmed all YubiKey 5 series models can be cloned, they haven’t tested other devices using the microcontroller, such as the SLE78 made by Infineon and successor microcontrollers known as the Infineon Optiga Trust M and the Infineon Optiga TPM. The researchers suspect that any device using any of these three microcontrollers and the Infineon cryptographic library contains the same vulnerability.</p>
<h2>Patching not possible</h2>
<p>YubiKey-maker Yubico issued an <a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories-ysa-2024-03/">advisory</a> in coordination with a <a href="https://ninjalab.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240903_eucleak.pdf">detailed disclosure report</a> from NinjaLab, the security firm that reverse-engineered the YubiKey 5 series and devised the cloning attack. All YubiKeys running firmware prior to version 5.7—which was released in May and replaces the Infineon cryptolibrary with a custom one—are vulnerable. Updating key firmware on the YubiKey isn’t possible. That leaves all affected YubiKeys permanently vulnerable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046777#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046777&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is one of our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/">favorite electric vehicles</a>. It offers excellent efficiency and really rapid charging, all wrapped up in a shape that exudes late-'80s hatchback vibes. Today, Hyundai revealed details about the Ioniq 5's update for model year 2025 (MY25), and it's noteworthy for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>For starters, when MY25 Ioniq 5s start appearing on dealer lots in Q4, they'll arrive with J3400 ports concealed underneath their charger port flaps. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/3/">Once known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS</a>), this is the Tesla-style charger plug, which means MY25 Ioniq 5s should be able to fast charge at more than 17,000 Tesla Superchargers throughout the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The flip side is that a MY25 Ioniq 5 will require an adapter if the driver wants to charge it with a CCS1 charger, although Hyundai will include that dongle with a new car. The automaker says that as it refreshes other EVs in Q4, they will also only come with J3400 ports. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/hyundai-is-switching-to-tesla-style-nacs-plugs-for-its-evs-in-late-2024/">For existing Hyundai EVs with CCS1 ports</a>, J3400 adapters are supposed to be available in Q1 2025.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046798#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046798&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's Starlink broadband service said it would defy an order to block Musk's X platform in Brazil after the country's top court required Internet providers to block the site. SpaceX's Starlink division, which says it has 250,000 customers in Brazil, reportedly told the country's telecom agency on Sunday that it will not comply with orders to block X.</p>
<p>Starlink <a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1829253524842303678">said last week</a> that a Brazilian court order "freezes Starlink's finances and prevents Starlink from conducting financial transactions in that country... based on an unfounded determination that Starlink should be responsible for the fines levied—unconstitutionally—against X. It was issued in secret and without affording Starlink any of the due process of law guaranteed by the Constitution of Brazil."</p>
<p>Starlink said it would "address the matter legally," and its refusal to block X appears to be part of an attempt to get its assets unfrozen. "On Sunday, Starlink informed Brazil's telecom agency, Anatel, that it would not block X until Brazilian officials released Starlink's frozen assets, Anatel's president, Carlos Baigorri, said in an interview broadcast by the Brazilian outlet Globo News," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/world/americas/elon-musk-brazil-starlink-x.html">according to The New York Times</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046765#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046765&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>China’s efforts to match US computing power in artificial intelligence are being hampered by bug-ridden software, with customers of leading AI chipmaker Huawei complaining about performance issues and the difficulty of switching from Nvidia products.</p>
<p>The Chinese technology giant has emerged as the frontrunner in the race to develop a domestic alternative to industry leader Nvidia, after Washington further tightened export controls on high-performance silicon last October.</p>
<p>Its Ascend series has become an increasingly popular option for Chinese AI groups to run inference, a process that applications such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT use to generate responses to queries.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046709#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046709&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An early convert to the idea of an all-electrified lineup, Volvo has taken a slightly different tack to most other automakers as it electrifies its product range. Where most would start off with a big and expensive electric vehicle first, it did the opposite, starting out with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-electric-2022-volvo-c40-recharge-puts-style-at-a-premium/">small</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/how-volvo-made-rear-wheel-drive-work-on-ice-for-the-ex30-suv/">affordable</a>. That means it's now time for a flagship EV, an all-new three-row SUV called the EX90, which we've driven ahead of US deliveries toward the end of this year.</p>
<p>That's later than Volvo planned, and as you'll see, some EX90 features have fallen even further behind and will need to be enabled via software update in the future. Because while the EX90 is a good demonstration of a new, tech-forward approach to car design, it's also the latest example of automakers adopting the "minimal viable product" approach from the tech sector.</p>
<p>Volvo has developed an all-new platform for larger EVs, which the EX90 will share with other brands within the Geely group, notably <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-2025-polestar-3-is-a-torque-vectoring-suv-thats-fun-to-drive/">the Polestar 3 we drove a few weeks ago</a>. The Volvo is a little longer than the Polestar, and unlike the SUV from the upstart startup, the EX90 is a three-row, with seats for either six or seven depending on whether you opt for a bench or a pair of captain's chairs for the middle row.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046679#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046679&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Blue Origin plans to enter the final phase of its launch preparations for the New Glenn rocket on Monday by rolling the vehicle's second stage to Launch Complex 36 in Florida. Pending weather and other final considerations, a rollout could occur as early as Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>This is the flight version of the vehicle, with the exception of a fixed adaptor for weather protection during a test campaign. The launch company is targeting a hot fire test of the upper stage, which is powered by two BE-3U engines, within the next week or so.</p>
<p>The launch company, founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is closing in on the debut launch of the massive New Glenn rocket, which will be one of the most powerful launch vehicles in the world. With a fully reusable first stage, New Glenn has a lift capacity of 45 metric tons to low-Earth orbit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046666#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046666&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>MUNICH—Germany's triumvirate of luxury automakers made their reputations off the backs of sedans, but the uncomfortable fact is that these days, they sell far more in the way of SUVs and crossovers, particularly in North America, where the prevailing sentiment is that station wagons belong with bell bottom jeans in the suburbs of the '70s and hatchbacks are reserved for college kids. The ur-Quattro might have made Audi famous, but the Q5 is what <a href="https://carfigures.com/us-market-brand/audi/q5">keeps it profitable</a>.</p>
<p>There's a new Q5 on the way, the third in its line. As global electrification timelines are proving to be a little slower than once predicted, automakers are responding accordingly, and at Audi, that has meant developing Premium Platform Combustion, a new flexible architecture for internal combustion engine-powered vehicles (including hybrids) that combines the latest in software-defined vehicle technology with more fuel-efficient powertrains and the latest active and passive safety standards.</p>
<p>In mid-July, we published our first look at the first car to use PPC, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/heres-audis-next-a5-and-all-the-stuff-we-wont-get-in-the-us/">the next Audi A5</a>.

<p>On Saturday NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore noticed some strange noises emanating from a speaker inside the Starliner spacecraft.</p>
<p>"I've got a question about Starliner," Wilmore radioed down to Mission Control at Johnson Space Center in Houston. "There's a strange noise coming through the speaker... I don't know what's making it."</p>
<p>Wilmore said he was not sure if there was some oddity in the connection between the station and the spacecraft causing the noise, or something else. He asked the flight controllers in Houston to see if they could listen to the audio inside the spacecraft. A few minutes later, Mission Control radioed back that they were linked via "hardline" to listen to audio inside Starliner, which has now been docked to the International Space Station for nearly three months.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046651#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046651&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Disney introduced the poster and first full trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_All_Along_(miniseries)"><em>Agatha All Along</em></a> during its annual D23 Expo earlier this month. And now Marvel Studios has dropped a one-minute teaser that has fans wildly speculating about the possible true identity of one character in particular, who might just be a future Young Avenger.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision"><em>WandaVision</em></a> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/the-witchs-road-might-take-everything-in-agatha-all-along-d23-trailer/">previously reported</a>, the nine-episode series, starring Kathryn Hahn, is one of the TV series in the MCU's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Five">Phase Five</a>, coming on the heels of <em>Secret Invasion</em>,<em> Loki </em>S2, <em>What If...?</em> S2, and <em>Echo</em>. <em>Agatha All Along</em> has been in the works since 2021, officially announced in November of that year and inspired by Hahn's breakout performance in <em>WandaVision</em> as nosy neighbor Agnes—who's secretly a powerful witch named Agatha Harkness who was conspiring to steal Wanda's power. The plot twist even inspired <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8u8md-NiHM">a meta-jingle</a> that went viral. <em>WandaVision</em> ended with Wanda victorious (of course) and Agatha robbed of all her powers, trapped in her nosy neighbor persona. This new series picks up where <em>WandaVision</em> left Agatha, and apparently we can expect a <a href="https://tvline.com/news/agatha-coven-of-chaos-musical-wandavision-spinoff-kathryn-hahn-1234921751/">few more catchy tunes</a>.

<p>A judge in Ohio has issued a temporary restraining order against a security researcher who presented evidence that a recent ransomware attack on the city of Columbus scooped up reams of sensitive personal information, contradicting claims made by city officials.</p>
<p>The order, issued by a judge in Ohio's Franklin County, came after the city of Columbus fell victim to a ransomware attack on July 18 that <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/ransomware-group-claims-columbus-attack-selling-6-terabytes-of-passwords-and-more/">siphoned 6.5 terabytes</a> of the city’s data. A ransomware group known as Rhysida took credit for the attack and offered to auction off the data with a starting bid of about <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/devastating-stolen-columbus-data-leaked-by-ransomware-group-after-auction-gets-no-bids/">$1.7 million in bitcoin</a>. On August 8, after the auction failed to find a bidder, Rhysida released what it said was about 45 percent of the stolen data on the group’s dark web site, which is accessible to anyone with a TOR browser.</p>
<h2>Dark web not readily available to public—really?</h2>
<p>Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said on August 13 that a “breakthrough” in the city’s forensic investigation of the breach found that the sensitive files Rhysida obtained were either <a href="https://statescoop.com/columbus-ohio-ransomware-data-unusable/">encrypted or corrupted</a>, making them “unusable” to the thieves. Ginther went on to say the data’s lack of integrity was likely the reason the ransomware group had been unable to auction off the data.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046614#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046614&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Major technology companies, including Google, Apple, and Discord, have been enabling people to quickly sign up to harmful “undress” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dark-side-open-source-ai-image-generators/">websites</a>, which use AI to remove clothes from real photos to make victims appear to be “nude” without their consent. More than a dozen of these deepfake websites have been using login buttons from the tech companies for months.</p>
<p>A WIRED analysis found 16 of the biggest so-called undress and “nudify” websites using the sign-in infrastructure from Google, Apple, Discord, Twitter, Patreon, and Line. This approach allows people to easily create accounts on the deepfake websites—offering them a veneer of credibility—before they pay for credits and generate images.</p>
