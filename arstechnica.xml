              <![CDATA[<p>For years, Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski stood as the undisputed champion of <em>Diablo</em> speedrunning. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8XorD9RwI">3-minute, 12-second Sorcerer run</a> looked all but unbeatable thanks to a combination of powerful (and allowable) glitch exploits along with what seemed like some unbelievable luck in the game's randomly generated dungeon.</p>
<p>But when a team of other speedrunners started trying and failing to replicate that luck using outside software and analysis tools, the story behind Groobo's run began to fall apart. As the inconsistencies in the run <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/">started to mount</a>, that team would conduct an automated search through billions of legitimate <em>Diablo</em> dungeons to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Groobo's game couldn't have taken place in any of them.</p>
<p>"We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," team member Staphen told Ars Technica of their investigation. "Betrayal might be another way to describe it," team member AJenbo added. "To find out that this had been done illegitimately... and the person had both gotten and taken a lot of praise for their achievement."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hyundai Ioniq 5s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/hyundai-ioniq-5s-will-be-made-in-usa-with-native-tesla-style-ports/">with NACS (J3400) ports</a>, as opposed to the CCS1 style, are starting to roll out of its factory in Savannah, Georgia. It's the first manufacturer to sell electric vehicles with native NACS ports—other than Tesla, that is, and you'll be able to read about our first drive in the model year 2025 Ioniq 5, as well as the new, off-roady Ioniq 5 XRT next week. But we've got some good news for owners of any existing Hyundai EVs out there—if your car has a CCS1 port, then next month, you're eligible for a free CCS1-NACS adapter.</p>
<p>Hyundai wasn't the first OEM to ink a deal with Tesla to gain access to the Supercharger network, but it is ahead of Ford, General Motors, and Rivian in swapping to the Tesla-style charge ports. Existing owners get access to the large charging network, too, but they'll need an adapter to make use of the smaller NACS plugs.</p>
<p>And those will be available next month, Hyundai told us. What's more, they're going to be <em>gratis</em>, <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/21932/what-does-the-term-and-free-as-in-free-beer-mean">or free as in beer</a>. As long as you have a VIN, the automaker will send you the adapter, which you'll be able to order once the website goes live in March.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/hyundais-nacs-adapter-for-evs-will-be-free-to-all-existing-owners/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI published the latest version of its "<a href="https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html">Model Spec</a>," a set of guidelines detailing how ChatGPT should behave and respond to user requests. The document reveals a notable shift in OpenAI's content policies, particularly around "sensitive" content like erotica and gore—allowing this type of content to be generated without warnings in "<a href="https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#sensitive_content">appropriate contexts</a>."</p>
<p>The change in policy has been in the works since <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-is-exploring-how-to-responsibly-generate-ai-porn/">May 2024</a>, when the original Model Spec document first <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#dont-respond-with-nsfw-content">mentioned</a> that OpenAI was exploring "whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts through the API and ChatGPT."</p>
<p>ChatGPT's guidelines now state that that "erotica or gore" may now be generated, but only under specific circumstances. "The assistant should not generate erotica, depictions of illegal or non-consensual sexual activities, or extreme gore, except in scientific, historical, news, creative or other contexts where sensitive content is appropriate," OpenAI writes. "This includes depictions in text, audio (e.g., erotic or violent visceral noises), or visual content."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/chatgpt-can-now-write-erotica-as-openai-eases-up-on-ai-paternalism/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As prominent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed to the nation's top health position Thursday, Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham sent a memo to the state's health department saying that the state "will no longer promote mass vaccination" and barred staff from running seasonal vaccine campaigns, according to <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/louisiana-vaccines-abraham-department-health/article_e84828d8-ea38-11ef-af78-036bbfc0e22e.html#tncms-source=featured-3">a report by the Times-Picayune of New Orleans</a>.</p>
<p>The memo echoes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/louisiana-bars-health-dept-from-promoting-flu-covid-mpox-vaccines-report/">directives that state health employees say they were told in October and November</a>. In meetings at the time, employees learned of a policy shift that would end seasonal campaigns for flu, COVID-19, and mpox vaccines, but it was to be implemented discreetly and not put in writing.</p>
<p>According to Abraham's memo, the abandonment of lifesaving vaccination campaigns is in service of individual choice. "For many illnesses, vaccines are one tool in the toolbox of ways to combat severe illness," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/louisiana-mass-vaccination.html?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y7TRe-NKnZcOmmHnV7C7IMEv_iWgcHs3muaqUKW5uVpO71Tzao8VKW92hLUd1iiFYEU3PppG-nJwLPXAqYJbOgooaeA&amp;_hsmi=347361433&amp;utm_content=347361433&amp;utm_source=hs_email">according to The New York Times</a>, which also obtained a copy of the memo.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/louisiana-officially-ends-mass-vaccinations-as-rfk-jr-comes-to-power/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have uncovered a sustained and ongoing campaign by Russian spies that uses a clever phishing technique to hijack Microsoft 365 accounts belonging to a wide range of targets, researchers warned.</p>
<p>The technique is known as device code phishing. It exploits “device code flow,” a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-07#section-3.4">OAuth standard</a>. Authentication through device code flow is designed for logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These devices typically don’t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.</p>
<p>Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a computer or other device that’s easier to sign in with and enters the code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained device that logs it into the account.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 2019, Haley Olson's life in Grant County, Oregon, was upended when people in town appeared to know about private nude photos that Olson kept on her phone. Worse, some of the people appeared to have seen and shared the photos. The incidents all had some relationship to the local sheriff's department, where Olson was dating one of the deputies.</p>
<p>In July, for instance, a stranger in a sheriff's office uniform approached her to say that he had "heard there’s some pretty smokin’ pictures of you going around the sheriff’s office." Someone else saw a married couple, both of whom worked for the sheriff's office, looking at Olson's photos on the husband's phone. Other people also approached Olson with knowledge of her recent out-of-state arrest. One person called her "the drug dealer that likes to f--- cops."</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A measles outbreak in an area of Texas with abysmal vaccination rates continues to mushroom, with cases doubling since Tuesday and expanding into additional counties.</p>
<p>A week ago, officials reported <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-erupts-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/">nine confirmed cases</a> in Gaines County, at the border of New Mexico, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates among kindergartners in the state at just <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage">about 82 percent</a>. On Tuesday, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-doubles-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/">cases climbed to 24</a>, all in Gaines. In Friday's update, the state health department reports that <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-14-2025">the case count has now reached 48 and spread to three nearby counties</a>, which also have vaccination rates below the 95 percent threshold that prevent vaccine-preventable diseases from spreading onward.</p>
<p>Gaines now reports 42 cases. There's one case reported in Lynn County to the northeast, which has a 91 percent vaccination rate. Terry County, with a vaccination rate of 94 percent, reports three cases, and Yoakum County, with a vaccination rate of 92.5 percent, reports two cases. Terry and Yoakum are both directly north of Gaines.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/texas-measles-outbreak-climbs-to-48-cases-almost-all-kids-13-hospitalized/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Working at the intersection of Apple's newest hardware and Linux kernel development, for the benefit of a free distribution, was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/asahi-linux-is-already-running-on-the-mac-studios-new-m1-ultra-chip/">never going to be easy</a>. But it's been an especially hard couple of weeks for Hector Martin, project lead for Asahi Linux, capping off years of what he describes as burnout, user entitlement, and political battles within the Linux kernel community about Rust code.</p>
<p>In a post on his site, "<a href="https://marcan.st/2025/02/resigning-as-asahi-linux-project-lead/">Resigning as Asahi Linux project lead</a>," Martin summarizes his history with hardware hacking projects, including his time with the Wii homebrew scene (Team Twiizers/<a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Fail0verflow">fail0verflow</a>), which had its share of insistent users desperate to play pirated games. Martin shifted his focus, and when Apple unveiled its own silicon with the M1 series, Martin writes, "I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project." This time, there was no jailbreaking and a relatively open, if tricky, platform.</p>
<p>Support and donations came quickly. The first two years saw rapid advancement of a platform built "from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation." Upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, across "practically every Linux subsystem," was an "<em>incredibly</em> frustrating experience" (emphasis Martin's).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/asahi-linux-lead-resigns-from-mac-based-distro-after-tumultuous-kernel-debate/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The venerable late-night sketch comedy show <em>Saturday Night Live</em> is celebrating its 50th anniversary season this year. NBC will air a special on Sunday evening featuring current and former cast members.</p>
<p>I've long been a big fan of the show, since I was a kid in the late 1980s watching cast members such as Phil Hartman, Dana Carvey, and Jan Hooks. By then, the show was more than a decade old. It had already spawned huge Hollywood stars like Chevy Chase and Eddie Murphy and had gone through some near-death experiences as it struggled to find its footing.</p>
<p>The show most definitely does not appeal to some people. When I asked the Ars editorial team to share their favorite sketches, a few writers told me they had never found <em>Saturday Night Live</em> funny, hadn't watched it in decades, or just did not get the premise of the show. Others, of course, love the show's ability to poke fun at the cultural and political zeitgeist of the moment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/02/after-50-years-ars-staffers-pick-their-favorite-saturday-night-live-sketches/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Will the GeForce RTX 5070 and Radeon RX 9070 achieve the dream of affordable 4K?]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>The GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 are both very fast graphics cards—if you can look past the possibility that we may have yet another power-connector-related overheating problem on our hands. But the vast majority of people (including you, discerning and tech-savvy Ars Technica reader) won't be spending $1,000 or $2,000 (<a href="https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-gv-n5090aorus-m-32gd-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32gb-gddr7/p/N82E16814932760">or $2,750 or whatever</a>) on a new graphics card this generation.</p>
<p>No, statistically, you (like most people) will probably end up buying one of the more affordable midrange Nvidia or AMD cards, GPUs that are all slated to begin shipping later this month or early in March.</p>
<p>There has been a spate of announcements on that front this week. Nvidia announced yesterday that the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, which the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/geforce-rtx-50-gpus-run-from-1999-to-549-lean-heavily-on-ai-generated-frames/">previously introduced at CES</a>, would be available starting on February 20 for $749 and up. The new GPU, like the RTX 5080, looks like a relatively modest upgrade from last year's RTX 4070 Ti Super. But it ought to at least flirt with affordability for people who are looking to get natively rendered 4K without automatically needing to enable DLSS upscaling to get playable frame rates.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nvidia-and-amd-both-plan-to-launch-more-affordable-gpus-in-february-and-march/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Enzymes are amazing catalysts. These proteins are made of nothing more than a handful of Earth-abundant elements, and they promote a vast array of reactions, convert chemical energy to physical motion, and act with remarkable specificity. In many cases, we have struggled to find non-enzymatic catalysts that can drive some of the same chemical reactions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there isn't an enzyme for many reactions we would sorely like to catalyze—things like digesting plastics or incorporating carbon dioxide into more complex molecules. We've had a few successes using directed evolution to create useful variations of existing enzymes, but efforts to broaden the scope of what enzymes can do have been limited.</p>
<p>With the advent of AI-driven protein design, however, we can now potentially design things that are unlike anything found in nature. A new paper today describes a success in making a brand-new enzyme with the potential to digest plastics. But it also shows how even a simple enzyme may have an extremely complex mechanism—and one that's hard to tackle, even with the latest AI tools.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"An official website of the United States government," reads small text atop the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) website that Elon Musk's team started populating this week with information on agency cuts.</p>
<p>But you apparently don't have to work in government to push updates to the site. A couple of prankster web developers <a href="https://www.404media.co/anyone-can-push-updates-to-the-doge-gov-website-2/">told 404 Media</a> that they separately discovered how "insecure" the DOGE site was, seemingly pulling from a "database that can be edited by anyone."</p>
<p>One coder couldn't resist and pushed two updates that, as of this writing, remained on the DOGE site. "This is a joke of a .gov site," <a href="https://doge.gov/workforce?orgId=1">one read</a>. "THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN," read <a href="https://doge.gov/workforce?orgId=7cd300eb-cf3f-47f5-90f1-9e66a8bc8d07&amp;ref=404media.co">another</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/doges-gov-site-lampooned-as-coders-quickly-realize-it-can-be-edited-by-anyone/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In November 2019, I was overjoyed to drive a new Jaguar I-Pace off the dealer's lot. Five years later, I'm waiting for Jaguar to drive the car away.</p>
<p>After two recalls for software updates, the car's range is now permanently restricted to 80 percent of what it was new. And along with owners of over 2,700 2019 I-Paces, I'm waiting for Jaguar to buy the car back. That's because the company has decided that purchasing the cars is cheaper—and likely easier—than identifying and replacing defective battery packs. It's a frustrating situation to be in, and not just because I can no longer drive a car I have grown to like.</p>
<p>Why did I buy an I-Pace? Good question—after all, Jaguars are not renowned for being paragons of reliability. 2019 was also the first year for the I-Pace, and buying a car in its first model can be a risky move as unanticipated manufacturing and parts problems rear their heads. One example: The original wiring harness in the I-Pace was poorly designed, so Jaguar ended up replacing many of them (including mine), which the mechanic told me took 11 hours and involved disassembling the front of the car.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/after-20-range-reduction-im-waiting-for-jaguar-to-buy-my-car-back/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.31 of the Rocket Report! The unfortunate news this week concerns layoffs. Blue Origin announced a 10 percent cut in its workforce as the company aims to get closer to breaking even. More broadly in the space industry, there is unease about what the Trump administration's cuts to NASA and other federal agencies might mean.</p>
<p>We don't have all the answers, but it does seem that NASA is likely to be subject to less deep cuts than some other parts of the government. We should find out sometime in March when the Trump White House submits its initial budget request. Congress, of course, will have the final say.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Three veterinarians who work with cows have tested positive for prior infections of H5 bird flu, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm?s_cid=mm7404a2_w">a study released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>The finding may not seem surprising, given the sweeping and ongoing outbreak of H5N1 among dairy farms in the US, which has reached <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">968 herds in 16 states</a> and led to infections in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html">41 dairy workers</a>. However, it is notable that none of the three veterinarians were aware of being infected, and none of them worked with cows that were known or suspected to be infected with H5N1. In fact, one of them only worked in Georgia and South Carolina, two states where H5N1 infections in dairy cows and humans have never been reported.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that the virus may be moving in animals and people silently, and that our surveillance systems are missing infections—both long-held fears among health experts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/h5n1-testing-in-cow-veterinarians-suggests-bird-flu-is-spreading-silently/">Read full article</a></p>
