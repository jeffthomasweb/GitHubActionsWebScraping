<p>Because most things about Earth change so slowly, it's difficult to imagine them being any different in the past. But Earth's rotation has been slowing due to tidal interactions with the Moon, meaning that days were considerably shorter in the past. It's easy to think that a 22-hour day wouldn't be all that different, but that turns out not to be entirely true.</p>
<p>For example, some modeling has indicated that certain day lengths will be in resonance with other effects caused by the planet's rotation, which can potentially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/the-gravitational-interactions-that-have-helped-us-dodge-60-hour-days/">offset the drag</a> caused by the tides. Now, a new paper looks at how these resonances could affect the climate. The results suggest that it would shift rain to occurring in the morning and evening while leaving midday skies largely cloud-free. The resulting Earth would be considerably warmer.</p>
<h2>On the Lamb</h2>
<p>We're all pretty familiar with the fact that the daytime Sun warms up the air. And those of us who remember high school chemistry will recall that a gas that is warmed will expand. So, it shouldn't be a surprise to hear that the Earth's atmosphere expands due to warming on its day side and contracts back again as it cools (these lag the daytime peak in sunlight). These differences provide something a bit like a handle that the gravitational pulls of the Sun and Moon can grab onto, exerting additional forces on the atmosphere. This complicated network of forces churns our atmosphere, helping shape the planet's weather.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035071#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035071&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ah, cats. We love our furry feline overlords despite the occasional hairball and their propensity to scratch the furniture to sharpen their claws. The latter is perfectly natural kitty behavior, but overly aggressive scratching is usually perceived as a behavioral problem. Veterinarians frown on taking extreme measures like declawing or even euthanizing such "problematic" cats. But there are alternative science-backed strategies for reducing or redirecting the scratching the behavior, according to the authors of a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2024.1403068/full">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science.</p>
<p>This latest study builds on the group's prior research investigating the effects of synthetic feline facial pheromones on undesirable scratching in cats, according to co-author Yasemin Salgirli Demirbas, a veterinary researcher at Ankara University in Turkey. "From the beginning, our research team agreed that it was essential to explore broader factors that might exacerbate this issue, such as those influencing stress and, consequently, scratching behavior in cats," she told Ars. "What’s new in this study is our focus on the individual, environmental and social dynamics affecting the level of scratching behavior. This perspective aims to enhance our understanding of how human and animal welfare are interconnected in different scenarios."</p>
<p>The study investigated the behavior of 1,211 cats, with data collected via an online questionnaire completed by the cats' caregivers. The first section collected information about the caregivers, while the second asked about the cats' daily routines, social interactions, environments, behaviors, and temperaments. The third and final section gathered information about the frequency and intensity of undesirable scratching behavior in the cats based on a helpful "scratching index."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034541#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034541&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On the day before Christmas last year, a Falcon 9 rocket launched from California and put two spy satellites into low-Earth orbit for the armed forces of Germany, which are collectively called the Bundeswehr.</p>
<p>Initially, the mission appeared successful. The German satellite manufacturer, OHB, <a href="https://www.ohb.de/en/news/sarah-satellites-successfully-launched">declared that</a> the two satellites were "safely in orbit." The addition of the two SARah satellites completed a next-generation constellation of three reconnaissance satellites, the company said.</p>
<p>However, six months later, the two satellites have yet to become operational. <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-schwierigkeiten-bei-sarah-spionagesatelliten-a-1f6a0e7a-38f2-4a63-af65-78eb43c1d736">According to</a> the German publication Der Spiegel, the antennas on the satellites cannot be unfolded. Engineers with OHB have tried to resolve the issue by resetting the flight software, performing maneuvers to vibrate or shake the antennas loose, and more to no avail.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035061#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035061&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In December, New York became the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/ny-passes-right-to-repair-will-require-tech-oems-to-share-tools-diagnostic-info/">first state</a> to enact a "Right to Repair" law for electronics. Since then, other states, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/oregon-governor-signs-nations-first-right-to-repair-bill-that-bans-part-pairing/">Oregon</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/minnesota-enacts-right-to-repair-law-that-covers-more-devices-than-any-other-state/">Minnesota</a>, have passed similar laws. However, a recent analysis of some recently released gadgets shows that self-repair still has a long way to go before it becomes ubiquitous.</p>
<p>On Monday, the US Public Interest Research Group (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/all-the-ways-streaming-services-are-aggravating-their-subscribers-this-week/">PIRG</a>) released its Leaders and Laggards <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/leaders-and-laggards-in-new-york/">report</a> that examined user repairability of 21 devices subject to New York's electronics Right to Repair law. The nonprofit graded devices "based on the quality and accessibility of repair manuals, spare parts, and other critical repair materials.”</p>
<p>Nathan Proctor, one of the report's authors and senior director for the Campaign for the Right to Repair for the US PIRG Education Fund, told Ars Technica via email that PIRG focused on new models since the law only applies to new products, adding that PIRG "tried to include a range of covered devices from well-known brands."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034998#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034998&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) continues to reveal how photos of real children casually posted online years ago are being used to train AI models powering image generators—even when platforms prohibit scraping and families use strict privacy settings.</p>
<p>Last month, HRW researcher Hye Jung Han <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/ai-trained-on-photos-from-kids-entire-childhood-without-their-consent/">found 170 photos of Brazilian kids that were linked in LAION-5B</a>, a popular AI dataset built from Common Crawl snapshots of the public web. Now, she has released a second <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/02/australia-childrens-personal-photos-misused-power-ai-tools">report</a>, flagging 190 photos of children from all of Australia’s states and territories, including indigenous children who may be particularly vulnerable to harms.</p>
<p>These photos are linked in the dataset "without the knowledge or consent of the children or their families." They span the entirety of childhood, making it possible for AI image generators to generate realistic deepfakes of real Australian children, Han's report said. Perhaps even more concerning, the URLs in the dataset sometimes reveal identifying information about children, including their names and locations where photos were shot, making it easy to track down children whose images might not otherwise be discoverable online.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035015#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035015&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US government will pay Moderna $176 million to develop an mRNA vaccine against a pandemic influenza—an award given as the highly pathogenic bird flu virus H5N1 continues to spread widely among US dairy cattle.</p>
<p>The funding flows through BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, as part of a new Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) Consortium. The program is intended to set up partnerships with industry to help the country better prepare for pandemic threats and develop medical countermeasures, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/07/02/hhs-provides-176-million-develop-pandemic-influenza-mrna-based-vaccine.html">the Department of Health and Human Services said in a press announcement Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p>Researchers have warned of a critical vulnerability affecting the OpenSSH networking utility that can be exploited to give attackers complete control of Linux and Unix servers with no authentication required.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-6387, allows unauthenticated remote code execution with root system rights on Linux systems that are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glibc">glibc</a>, an open source implementation of the C standard library. The vulnerability is the result of a code regression introduced in 2020 that reintroduced CVE-2006-5051, a vulnerability that was fixed in 2006. With thousands, if not millions, of vulnerable servers populating the Internet, this latest vulnerability could pose a significant risk.</p>
<h2>Complete system takeover</h2>
<p>“This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent access,” <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/07/01/regresshion-remote-unauthenticated-code-execution-vulnerability-in-openssh-server">wrote</a> Bharat Jogi, the senior director of threat research at Qualys, the security firm that discovered it. “It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other vulnerable systems within the organization.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035011#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035011&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Supreme Court today agreed to hear a challenge to the Texas law that requires age verification on porn sites. A <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/070224zor_2co3.pdf">list of orders</a> released this morning shows that the court granted a petition for certiorari filed by the Free Speech Coalition, an adult-industry lobby group.</p>
<p>In March, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/texas-can-require-age-verification-on-porn-sites-5th-circuit-judges-rule/">ruled</a> that Texas could continue enforcing the law while litigation continues. In a 2-1 decision, 5th Circuit judges wrote that "the age-verification requirement is rationally related to the government's legitimate interest in preventing minors' access to pornography. Therefore, the age-verification requirement does not violate the First Amendment."</p>
<p>The dissenting judge faulted the 5th Circuit majority for reviewing the law under the "rational-basis" standard instead of the more stringent strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court "has unswervingly applied strict scrutiny to content-based regulations that limit adults' access to protected speech," Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote at the time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034992#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034992&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google’s greenhouse gas emissions have surged 48 percent in the past five years due to the expansion of its data centers that underpin artificial intelligence systems, leaving its commitment to get to “net zero” by 2030 in doubt.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley company’s pollution amounted to 14.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2023, a 48 percent increase from its 2019 baseline and a 13 percent rise since last year, Google said in its annual environmental report on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Google said the jump highlighted “the challenge of reducing emissions” at the same time as it invests in the build-out of large language models and their associated applications and infrastructure, admitting that “the future environmental impact of AI” was “complex and difficult to predict.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035001#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035001&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle—it's more than just a fun alliteration tagline. It's also a set of instructions for how to consume in a way that's less destructive to our environment. We reduce our consumption and reuse what we already have, then recycle it once it no longer has any use. Unfortunately, many are going straight to recycling and calling it a day.</p>
<p>At its sustainability summit in Northern California at the Sonoma Raceway, Michelin laid out a new roadmap for its plans to become a more sustainable company. Most importantly, the company shared what it's been doing for decades to reduce the harm done to the world by its tires.</p>
<p>The company reiterated its desire to have 100 percent renewable tires by 2050. Companies make a lot of pronouncements like this, and they only sometimes come to fruition. But looking at Michelin's present efforts and past record, the company has a decent chance of succeeding.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034974#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034974&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the hopes of dodging a significant projected worker shortage in the next few years, the Biden administration will finally start funding workforce development projects to support America's ambitions to become the world's leading chipmaker through historic CHIPS and Science Act investments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://natcast.org/workforce/wfpa">Workforce Partner Alliance</a> (WFPA) will be established through the CHIPS Act's first round of funding focused on workers, officials confirmed in a <a href="https://natcast.org/natcast-launches-nstc-workforce-partner-alliance-program">press release</a>. The program is designed to "focus on closing workforce and skills gaps in the US for researchers, engineers, and technicians across semiconductor design, manufacturing, and production," a <a href="https://natcast.org/workforce/wfpa">program requirements</a> page said.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that the US risks a technician shortage reaching 90,000 by 2030. This differs slightly from Natcast's forecast, which found that out of "238,000 jobs the industry is projected to create by 2030," the semiconductor industry "will be unable to fill more than 67,000."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034957#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034957&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Florida carpenter ants (<em>Camponotus floridanus</em>) selectively treat the wounded limbs of their fellow ants, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)00805-4">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. Depending on the location of the injury, the ants either lick the wounds to clean them or chew off the affected limb to keep infection from spreading. The treatment is surprisingly effective, with survival rates of around 90–95 percent for amputee ants.</p>
<p>“When we're talking about amputation behavior, this is literally the only case in which a sophisticated and systematic amputation of an individual by another member of its species occurs in the animal kingdom,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1049744?">said co-author Erik Frank</a>, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Würzburg in Germany. “The fact that the ants are able to diagnose a wound, see if it's infected or sterile, and treat it accordingly over long periods of time by other individuals—the only medical system that can rival that would be the human one."</p>
<p>Frank has been studying various<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant"> species of ants</a> for many years. Late last year, he co-authored <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43885-w">a paper</a> detailing how Matabele ants (<em>Megaponera analis) </em>south of the Sahara can tell if an injured comrade's wound is infected or not, thanks to chemical changes in the hydrocarbon profile of the ant cuticle when a wound gets infected. These ants only eat termites, but termites have powerful jaws and use them to defend against predators, so there is a high risk of injury to hunting ants.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034534#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034534&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla published its quarterly production and delivery numbers yesterday afternoon, and anyone hoping that the last three months have marked a return to growth will be disappointed. For Q2 2024, the automaker built 418,831 electric vehicles, a 14.4 percent decrease on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/tesla-revenue-grows-to-25-billion-but-margin-shrinks-in-q2-2023/#:~:text=Tesla%20reported%20strong%20sales%20and,percent%20increase%20year%20over%20year.">Q2 2023</a>. The drop in sales wasn't quite as bad—in Q2 2024 Tesla sold 443,956 EVs, a 4.8 percent decline, year on year.</p>
<p>After several boom years, even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/14/musk-tesla-shareholders-50-billion/">the hype-generating powers</a> of Tesla CEO Elon Musk weren't able to stave off the realities of a small and stagnant product line and a brutal price war, particularly in China. The first quarter of 2024 saw Tesla's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-deliveries-drop-8-5-percent-year-over-year-in-first-decline-since-2020/">deliveries fall by 8.5 percent</a>, the first time this number hadn't gone up since 2020.</p>

<p>Microsoft has been trying to make Windows-on-Arm-processors a thing for so long that, at some point, I think I just started assuming it was never actually going to happen.</p>
<p>The first effort was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/microsofts-first-stab-at-a-pc-surface-reviewed/">Windows RT</a>, which managed to run well enough on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/my-kingdom-for-some-apps-the-asus-vivo-tab-rt-review/">the piddly Arm hardware available at the time</a> but came with a perplexing new interface and couldn't run any apps designed for regular Intel- and AMD-based Windows PCs. Windows RT failed, partly because a version of Windows that couldn't run Windows apps and didn't use a familiar Windows interface was ignoring two big reasons why people keep using Windows.</p>
<p>Windows-on-Arm came back in the late 2010s, with better performance and a translation layer for 32-bit Intel apps in tow. This version of Windows, confined mostly to oddball Surface hardware and a handful of barely promoted models from the big PC OEMs, has quietly percolated for years. It has improved slowly and gradually, as have the Qualcomm processors that have powered these devices.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032066#p3">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032066&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Officially, of course, the Atlantic hurricane season begins on June 1, But most years, the tropics remain fairly sleepy for the first month or two, allowing coastal residents to ease into the season.</p>
<p>Yes, a tropical storm might form here or a modest hurricane there. But the really big and powerful hurricanes, which develop from tropical waves in the central Atlantic and roar into the Caribbean Sea, do not spin up until August or September when seas reach their peak temperatures.</p>
<p>Not so this year, in which the Atlantic Ocean is boiling already. The seas in the main development region of the Atlantic have already reached temperatures not normally seen until August or September. This has led to the rapid intensification of Hurricane Beryl, which crashed through the Windward Islands on Monday and is now traversing the Caribbean Sea toward Jamaica.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034854#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034854&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since antiquity, humans have envisioned various means of time travel into the future or the past. The concept has since become a staple of modern science fiction. In particular, the number of films that make use of time travel has increased significantly over the decades, while the real-world science has evolved right alongside them, moving from simple Newtonian mechanics and general relativity to quantum mechanics and the notion of a multiverse or more exotic alternatives like string theory.</p>
<p>But not all time-travel movies are created equal. Some make for fantastic entertainment, but the time travel makes no scientific or logical sense, while others might err in the opposite direction, sacrificing good storytelling in the interests of technical accuracy. That's why last fall, we gave you the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2023/11/the-ars-guide-to-time-travel-in-the-movies/">Ars Guide to Time Travel in the Movies</a>, co-written by yours truly and my spouse, physicist Sean Carroll of Johns Hopkins University. The aim was to help us all make better, more informed decisions when it comes to choosing our time travel movie fare—and have a bit of fun while doing so.</p>
<p>The guide was never meant to be an exhaustive/comprehensive list; rather, we selected films that represented many diverse approaches to time travel across multiple subgenres and decades. We then evaluated each one—grading on a curve—with regard to its overall entertainment value and scientific logic, with the final combined score determining a film's spot on the overall ranking. Does the time travel make logical sense? Second, is the physical mechanism of time travel somewhat realistic? And third, does the film use time travel in narratively interesting ways? So a movie like <i>Looper</i>, which makes absolutely no sense if you think about it too hard, gets points for weaving time paradoxes thoroughly into the fabric of the story.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034631#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034631&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BRIGGS, Texas—The new medium-lift rocket under development by Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman will eventually incorporate a recoverable booster that will return to its launch site in Virginia for reuse.</p>
<p>Firefly has previously suggested rocket reuse is on the roadmap for the new rocket—known, for now, only as the Medium Launch Vehicle (MLV)—but officials revealed new details of the plan during a recent visit by Ars to Firefly's rocket factory in rural Central Texas.</p>
<p>“Northrop and Firefly have a similar perspective and that is, for that class of rocket, reusability is a requirement for a bunch of reasons," said Bill Weber, Firefly's CEO. "Economically, it becomes an advantage because we don't have to go build additional floor space... Similarly, the pricing structure for customers starts to get super competitive, which we absolutely love, and we’ll be right in the middle of.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034632#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034632&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Vulnerabilities that went undetected for a decade left thousands of macOS and iOS apps susceptible to supply-chain attacks. Hackers could have added malicious code compromising the security of millions or billions of people who installed them, researchers said Monday.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities, which were fixed last October, resided in a “trunk” server used to manage <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>, a repository for open source Swift and Objective-C projects that roughly 3 million macOS and iOS apps depend on. When developers make changes to one of their “pods”—CocoaPods lingo for individual code packages—dependent apps typically incorporate them automatically through app updates, typically with no interaction required by end users.</p>
<h2>Code injection vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>“Many applications can access a user’s most sensitive information: credit card details, medical records, private materials, and more,” <a href="https://www.evasec.io/blog/eva-discovered-supply-chain-vulnerabities-in-cocoapods">wrote</a> researchers from EVA Information Security, the firm that discovered the vulnerability. “Injecting code into these applications could enable attackers to access this information for almost any malicious purpose imaginable—ransomware, fraud, blackmail, corporate espionage… In the process, it could expose companies to major legal liabilities and reputational risk.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034866#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034866&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington to Bilbao and accommodation so Ars could drive the Q6 e-tron. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>The arrival of the Q6 e-tron marks a significant milestone on the electric journey that Audi and its corporate siblings began in the wake of dieselgate, nearly a decade ago. Now, after developing electric vehicles based on its own gas-powered models, a cheaper VW platform, and a tweaked Taycan, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/throw-out-all-those-black-boxes-and-say-hello-to-the-software-defined-car/">the brand has led the development</a> of a new platform just for electric vehicles, one that incorporates lessons learned from those earlier EVs.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/audi-is-planning-20-all-electric-models-by-2025-heres-how-it-will-do-it/">followed the development</a> of that Premium Platform Electric architecture and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/audi-debuts-its-next-ev-platform-with-the-2025-q6-e-tron-suv/">the Q6 e-tron</a> for some time. Now, we've finally been behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Audi made its name with "quattro" all-wheel drive powertrains, and both versions of Q6 e-tron to be offered initially will use twin-motor, all-wheel drive powertrains—an asynchronous motor driving the front wheels and a permanent magnet synchronous motor at the rear. Both versions will use the same capacity 100 kWh (94.4 kWh net) battery pack, which operates at 800 V and DC fast-charges from 10–80 percent in 21 minutes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034780#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034780&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Keith Gill—the meme stock influencer known as "Roaring Kitty" and "DeepF—Value" who has rallied millions on X and Reddit behind GameStop—briefly faced a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Radev-v-Gill-Complaint-6-28-2024.pdf">lawsuit</a> claiming that he knowingly deceived his loyal followers to reap millions of dollars in gains. The lawsuit was <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/123121452012.pdf">voluntarily dismissed</a> by the plaintiff, Martin Radev, on July 1.</p>
<p>The proposed class action was filed Friday by Radev, a GameStop investor who accused Gill of a "pump-and-dump scheme" that allegedly artificially raised prices of GameStop securities between May 13 and June 13. As a result, perhaps thousands of investors were harmed, including Gill's followers, Radev's complaint alleged, while speculating on the class size. On Monday, Radev asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice.</p>
<p>Radev's complaint followed reports <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/gamestop-stock-influencer-roaring-kitty-may-lose-access-to-e-trade-report-says/">that E-Trade was considering banning Gill</a> for suspected stock manipulation but reportedly feared backlash from Gill's so-called meme stock army.
