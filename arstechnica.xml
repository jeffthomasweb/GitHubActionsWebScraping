                            <![CDATA[<p>When the Trump administration brutally cut federal funding for biomedical research earlier this year, at least 383 clinical trials that were already in progress were abruptly cancelled, cutting off over 74,000 trial participants from their experimental treatments, monitoring, or follow-ups, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840939">a study published today in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The study, led by researchers at Harvard, fills a knowledge gap of how the Trump administration’s research funding cuts affected clinical trials specifically. It makes clear not just the wastefulness and inefficiency of the cuts but also the deep ethical violations, JAMA Internal Medicine editors wrote in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840943">an accompanying editor’s note</a>.</p>
<p>In March, the National Institutes of Health, under the control of the Trump administration, announced that it would cancel $1.8 billion in grant funding that wasn’t aligned with the administration’s priorities. The Harvard researchers, led by health care policy expert Anupam Jena, used an NIH database and a federal accountability tracking tool to find grants supporting clinical trials that were active as of February 28 but had been terminated by August 15.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/over-74000-people-were-kicked-out-of-clinical-trials-because-of-trump-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos is one of the world’s richest and most famous tech CEOs, but he hasn’t actually been a CEO of anything since 2021. That’s now changing as he takes on the role of co-CEO of a new AI company, according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/technology/bezos-project-prometheus.html">New York Times report</a> citing three people familiar with the company.</p>
<p>Grandiosely named Project Prometheus (and not to be confused with the NASA project of the same name), the company will focus on using AI to pursue breakthroughs in research, engineering, manufacturing, and other fields that are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/project-prometheus25/about/">dubbed</a> part of “the physical economy”—in contrast to the software applications that are likely the first thing most people in the general public think of when they hear “AI.”</p>
<p>Bezos’ co-CEO will be Dr. Vik Bajaj, a chemist and physicist who previously led life sciences work at Google X, an Alphabet-backed research group that worked on speculative projects that could lead to more product categories. (For example, it developed technologies that would later underpin Google’s Waymo service.) Bajaj also worked at Verily, another Alphabet-backed research group focused on life sciences, and Foresite Labs, an incubator for new AI companies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/with-a-new-company-jeff-bezos-will-become-a-ceo-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Five men have pleaded guilty to running laptop farms and providing other assistance to North Koreans to obtain remote IT work at US companies in violation of US law, federal prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The pleas come amid a rash of similar schemes orchestrated by hacking and threat groups backed by the North Korean government. The campaigns, which ramped up nearly five years ago, aim to steal millions of dollars in job revenue and cryptocurrencies to fund North Korean weapons programs. Another motive is to seed cyber attacks for espionage. In one such incident, a North Korean man who fraudulently obtained a job at US security company KnowBe4 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/us-security-firm-unwittingly-hired-apparent-nation-state-hacker-from-north-korea/">installed malware</a> immediately upon beginning his employment.</p>
<p>On Friday, the US Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-nationwide-actions-combat-illicit-north-korean-government">said</a> that five men pleaded guilty to assisting North Koreans in obtaining jobs in a scheme orchestrated by <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082/">APT38</a>, also tracked under the name Lazarus. APT38 has targeted the US and other countries for more than a decade with a stream of attack campaigns that have grown ever bolder and more advanced. All five pleaded guilty to wire fraud, and one to aggravated identity theft, for a range of actions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/5-plead-guilty-to-laptop-farm-and-id-theft-scheme-to-land-north-koreans-us-it-jobs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, a US District Court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the United States government from halting federal funding at UCLA or any other school in the University of California system. The ruling came in response to a suit filed by groups representing the faculty at these schools challenging the Trump administration’s attempts to force UCLA into a deal that would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trumps-ucla-deal-pay-us-1b-and-we-can-still-cut-your-grants-again/">substantially revise</a> instruction and policy.</p>
<p>The court’s decision lays out how the Trump administration’s attacks on universities follow a standard plan: use accusations of antisemitism to justify an immediate cut to funding, then use the loss of money to compel an agreement that would result in revisions to university instruction and management. The court finds that this plan was deficient on multiple grounds, violating legal procedures for cutting funding to an illegal attempt and suppressing the First Amendment rights of faculty.</p>
<p>The result is a reprieve for the entire University of California system, as well as a clear pathway for any universities to fight back against the Trump administration’s attacks on research and education.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/ucla-faculty-gets-big-win-in-suit-against-trumps-university-attacks/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In records filed Friday, District Judge LeAnn Rafferty, in Panola County, also rejected Paxton’s unusual request to block Kenvue from distributing $400 million in dividends to shareholders later this month.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For decades—yes, literally decades—it has been easy to dismiss Blue Origin as a company brimming with potential but rarely producing much of consequence.</p>
<p>But last week the company took a tremendous stride forward, not just launching its second orbital rocket, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/blue-origin-caps-second-heavy-lift-launch-with-first-offshore-landing/">but subsequently landing the booster</a> on a barge named <em>Jacklyn</em>. It now seems clear that Blue Origin is in the midst of a transition from sleeping giant to force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>To get a sense of where the company goes from here, Ars spoke with the company’s chief executive, Dave Limp, on the eve of last week’s launch. The first thing he emphasized is how much the company learned about New Glenn, and the process of rolling the vehicle out and standing it up for launch, from the vehicle’s first attempt in January.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/after-last-weeks-stunning-landing-heres-what-comes-next-for-blue-origin/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple’s Power Mac and Mac Pro towers used to be the company’s primary workstations, but it has been years since they were updated with the same regularity as the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro. The Mac Pro has seen just four hardware updates in the last 15 years, and that’s counting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/as-mac-pro-stagnates-pc-workstations-muscle-ahead/">a 2012 refresh</a> that was mostly identical to the 2010 version.</p>
<p>Long-suffering Mac Pro buyers may have taken heart when Apple finally <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/this-is-the-new-apple-silicon-mac-pro/">added an M2 Ultra processor to the tower in mid-2023</a>, making it one of the very last Macs to switch from Intel to Apple Silicon—surely this would mean that the computer would at least be updated once every year or two, like the Mac Studio has been? But Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-16/apple-s-iphone-road-map-iphone-air-2-iphone-18-mac-pro-future-tesla-carplay-mi1q4l2o">says</a> that Mac Pro buyers shouldn’t get their hopes up for new hardware in 2026.</p>
<p>Gurman says that the tower is “on the back burner” at Apple and that the company is “focused on a new Mac Studio” for the next-generation M5 Ultra chip that is in the works. As we reported earlier this year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-announces-m3-ultra-and-says-not-every-generation-will-see-an-ultra-chip/">Apple doesn’t have plans to design or release an M4 Ultra</a>, and the Mac Studio refresh from this spring included an M3 Ultra alongside the M4 Max.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/report-claims-that-apple-has-yet-again-put-the-mac-pro-on-the-back-burner/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Nothing says it’s holiday season quite like a new installment of Rian Johnson’s delightful <em>Knives Out</em> mystery series. The final trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_Dead_Man"><em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em></a> was just released, featuring Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc in all his Southern gentleman detective glory. This time, he’s tackling the strange death of a parish priest in a spookily Gothic small-town setting.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/wake-up-dead-man-trailer-teases-classic-locked-room-puzzle/">previously reported</a>, the original <em>Knives Out</em> was a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/review-knives-out-is-a-delightfully-twisty-homage-to-classic-whodunnits/">masterfully plotted</a> winning mashup of <em>Clue</em> and <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>—or any number of adaptations of novels by the grande dame of murder mysteries, Agatha Christie—along with other classics like <em>Deathtrap</em>,<em> Gosford Park</em>, and <em>Murder by Death</em>. Craig clearly found Blanc a refreshing counter to the 007 franchise, and he and Johnson soon committed to filming a sequel: 2022’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Onion:_A_Knives_Out_Mystery"><em>Glass Onion</em></a>, inspired particularly by the Christie-based “tropical getaway” whodunnit <em>Evil Under the Sun</em> (1982) and an under-appreciated 1973 gem called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Sheila" data-uri="99bce8b4d8c200c40f73ec1f30dad9dd"><em>The Last of Sheila</em></a>.</p>
<p>And now we have <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em>. With this franchise, the less one knows going in, the better. But Johnson has assembled yet another winning all-star cast. Josh Brolin plays the victim, the fire-and-brimstone-spewing Monseigneur Jefferson Wicks; Josh O’Connor plays a young priest named Rev. Jud Duplenticy; Glenn Close plays a devout churchgoer named Martha Delacroix, Wick’s loyal helper; Mila Kunis plays local police chief Geraldine Scott; Jeremy Renner plays town doctor Nat Sharp; Kerry Washington plays uptight lawyer Vera Draven; Daryl McCormack plays aspiring politician Cy Draven; Thomas Haden Church plays groundskeeper Samson Holt; Andrew Scott plays bestselling author Lee Ross; and Cailee Spaeny plays Simone Vivane, a disabled former classical cellist.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/11/benoit-blanc-takes-on-a-perfectly-impossible-crime-in-wake-up-dead-man-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A group of dedicated coders has managed to partially revive online gameplay for the PC version of <em>Concord</em>, the team-based shooter that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/two-weeks-after-launch-sony-shooter-concord-goes-offline-and-offers-refunds/">Sony famously shut down just two weeks after its launch</a> last summer. Now, though, the team behind that fan server effort is closing off new access after Sony started issuing DMCA takedown requests of sample gameplay videos.</p>
<p><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-concord-playable-again-custom-servers/">The Game Post</a> was among the first to publicize the “Concord Delta” project, which reverse-engineered the game’s now-defunct server API to get a functional multiplayer match running over the weekend. “The project is still [a work in progress], it’s playable, but buggy,” developer Red posted in the game’s Discord channel, as reported by The Game Post. “Once our servers are fully set up, we’ll begin doing some private playtesting.”</p>
<p>Accessing the “Concord Delta” servers reportedly requires a legitimate PC copy of the game, which is relatively hard to come by these days. <em>Concord</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">only sold an estimated 25,000 copies</a> across PC and PS5 before being shut down last year. And that number doesn’t account for the players who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/two-weeks-after-launch-sony-shooter-concord-goes-offline-and-offers-refunds/">accepted a full refund for their $40 purchase</a> after the official servers shut down.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/fans-reverse-engineered-servers-for-sonys-defunct-concord-might-be-in-trouble/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The US software group founded by Larry Ellison has made a dramatic entrance to the AI race, committing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the next few years on chips and data centers—largely as part of deals to supply computing capacity to OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>The speed and scale of its moves have unsettled some investors at a time when markets are keenly focused on the spending of so-called hyperscalers—big tech companies building vast data centers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/11/oracle-hit-hard-in-wall-streets-tech-sell-off-over-its-huge-ai-bet/">Read full article</a></p>

Going forward, though, that ball will be handed off from longtime developer Colossal Order to Finnish studio <a href="https://www.iceflake.com/">Iceflake</a> (a subsidiary of <em>Cities</em> publisher Paradox Interactive).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">surprise announcement Monday morning</a> on Paradox’s official forums says that <em>Cities</em>‘ developer and publisher “mutually decided to pursue independent paths” without going into many details as to why. “The decision was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams—ensuring the strongest possible future for the <em>Cities: Skylines</em> franchise,” the announcement says.</p>
<p>“Both companies are excited for what the future holds while remaining deeply appreciative of our shared history and grateful to the <em>Cities</em>’ community,” the statement continues. Colossal Order “will work on new projects and explore new creative opportunities,” Paradox wrote in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/studio-shift-frequently-asked-questions.1873693/">an accompanying FAQ</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/cities-skylines-upheaval-developer-and-publisher-announce-mutual-breakup/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Be careful with your marketing stunts around national landmarks. That should be the take-home message from Chery Automobile’s recent attempt to measure itself up against Land Rover, an attempt that went sadly wrong.</p>
<p>In 2018, Land Rover and Chinese racing driver Ho-Pin Tung drove a Range Rover Sport up the 999 steps that make up the “Stairway to Heaven” that climb China’s Tianmen mountain. It was a dazzling stunt, for driving up a staircase that ranges between 45–60 degrees is no simple task, and one that’s certain to have left an impression with any acrophobics out there.</p>

<p>Chery certainly remembered it. The brand—which in fact is <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/05/competition-forces-jlr-to-stop-making-cars-in-china-will-rebrand-chery-platform-instead/">a long-time collaborator</a> with Jaguar Land Rover and next year even takes over the Freelander brand from the British marque—has a new electric SUV called the Fulwin X3L and decided that it, too, was made of the right stuff. The SUV, which costs between $16,500–$22,000 in China, features a plug-in hybrid powertrain, boxy looks, and a whole bunch of off-roading features, including the ability to do tank turns.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/when-recreating-a-famous-suv-stunt-in-china-goes-wrong/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Scientists have found traces of ancient opiates in the residue lining an Egyptian alabaster vase, indicating that opiate use was woven into the fabric of the culture. And the Egyptians didn’t just indulge occasionally: according to a <a href="https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/psup/jemahs/article/13/3/317/402889/The-Pharmacopeia-of-Ancient-Egyptian-Alabaster">paper</a> published in the Journal of Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology, opiate use may have been a fixture of daily life.</p>
<p>In recent years, archaeologists have been applying the tools of pharmacology to excavated artifacts in collections around the world. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/study-confirms-egyptians-likely-used-hallucinogens-in-rituals/">previously reported</a>, there is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includes not just ancient Egypt but also ancient Greek, Vedic, Maya, Inca, and Aztec cultures. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urarina">Urarina</a> people who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca">ayahuasca</a> in their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have also been known to participate.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2023, David Tanasi, of the University of South Florida, posted <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3000218/v1">a preprint</a> on his preliminary analysis of a ceremonial mug decorated with the head of Bes, a popular deity believed to confer protection on households, especially mothers and children. After collecting sample residues from the vessel, Tanasi applied various techniques—including proteomic and genetic analyses and synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy—to characterize the residues.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/ancient-egyptians-likely-used-opiates-regularly/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Valve’s second big foray into first-party PC hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valve-says-its-still-waiting-for-better-chips-to-power-steam-deck-2/">isn’t</a> a sequel to the much-imitated Steam Deck portable, but rather <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">a desktop computer</a> called the Steam Machine. And while it could go on your desk, Valve clearly intends for it to fit in an entertainment center under a TV—next to, or perhaps even instead of, a game console like the Xbox or PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this idea could work, and it’s because I’ve already been experimenting with what is essentially a “Steam Machine” underneath my own TV for months, starting in May when Valve began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/">making it possible to install SteamOS on certain kinds of generic PC hardware</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on what it costs—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">and we can only guess what it will cost</a>—the Steam Machine could be a good fit for people who just want to plug a more powerful version of the Steam Deck experience into their TVs. But for people who like tinkering or who, like me, have been messing with miniature TV-connecting gaming PCs for years and are simply tired of trying to make Windows workable, the future promised by the Steam Machine is already here.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/ive-already-been-using-a-steam-machine-for-months-and-i-think-its-great/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Aristotle claimed that humans differ from other animals because they have the ability to be rational, he understood rational to mean that we could form our views and beliefs based on evidence, and that we could reconsider that evidence. “You know—ask ourselves if we should really believe that based on the evidence we’ve got,” says Jan M. Engelmann, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>Engelmann says that from the beginning of the Western intellectual tradition, people thought that only humans are rational. So, he designed a study to see if rationality shows up in chimpanzees. It turned out that they’re almost as rational as we are.</p>
<h2>Food puzzles</h2>
<p>“There was quite a bit of research showing that chimpanzees can form their beliefs in response to evidence,” Engelmann says. The experiments usually involved chimpanzees deciding which of the two boxes contained a snack. When the researchers shook both boxes and there was a rattling sound coming from one of them, the chimps almost always chose the box where the rattling came from.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/the-evolution-of-rationality-how-chimps-process-conflicting-evidence/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>Edmontosaurus annectens</em>, a large herbivore duck-billed dinosaur that lived toward the end of the Cretaceous period, was discovered back in 1908 in east-central Wyoming by C.H. Sternberg, a fossil collector. The skeleton, later housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and nicknamed the “AMNH mummy,” was covered by scaly skin imprinted in the surrounding sediment that gave us the first approximate idea of what the animal looked like.</p>
<p>More than a century later, a team of paleontologists led by Paul C. Sereno, a professor of organismal biology at the University of Chicago, got back to the same exact place where Sternberg dug up the first <em>Edmontosaurus</em> specimen. The researchers found two more <em>Edmontosaurus</em> mummies with all fleshy external anatomy imprinted in a sub-millimeter layer of clay. For the first time, we uncovered an accurate image of what <em>Edmontosaurus</em> really looked like, down to the tiniest details, like the size of its scales and the arrangement of spikes on its tail. And we were in for at least a few surprises.</p>
<h2>Evolving images</h2>
<p>Our view of <em>Edmontosaurus </em>changed over time, even before Sereno’s study. The initial <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Edmontosaurus_annectens,_by_Charles_R._Knight.jpg">drawing</a> of <em>Edmontosaurus</em> was made in 1909 by Charles R. Knight, a famous paleoartist, who based his visualization on the first specimen found by Sternberg. “He was accurate in some ways, but he made a mistake in that he drew the crest extending throughout the entire length of the body,” Sereno says. The mummy Knight based his drawing on had no tail, so understandably, the artist used his imagination to fill in the gaps and made the <em>Edmontosaurus</em> look a little bit like a dragon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/wyoming-dinosaur-mummies-give-us-a-new-view-of-duck-billed-species/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If Donald Trump loses his Supreme Court fight over tariffs, the US may be forced to return “tens of billions of dollars to companies that have paid import fees this year, plus interest,” The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/trump-trade-war-supreme-court/684911/">reported</a>. And the longer the verdict is delayed, the higher the refunds could go, possibly even hitting $1 trillion.</p>
<p>For tech companies both large and small, the stakes are particularly high. A Trump defeat would not just mean clawing back any duties paid on imports to the US that companies otherwise can use to invest in their competitiveness. But, more critically in the long term, it would also end tariff shocks that, as economics lecturer Matthew Allen <a href="https://theconversation.com/trumps-tariffs-threaten-the-future-of-innovation-and-uk-tech-could-be-collateral-damage-269158">emphasized</a> in a report for The Conversation, risked harming “innovation itself” by destabilizing global partnerships and diverse supply chains in “tech-intensive, IP-led sectors like semiconductors and software.”</p>
<p>Currently, the Supreme Court is weighing two cases that argue that the US president does not have unilateral authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Defending his regime of so-called “reciprocal tariffs,” Trump <a href="applewebdata://8E693EF9-6ED6-45FB-B173-8E1BCD2F095B/filing,">argued</a> these taxes were necessary to correct the “emergency” of enduring trade imbalances that he alleged have unfairly enriched other countries while bringing the US “to the brink of catastrophic decline.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/tariff-refunds-may-get-messy-if-trump-loses-supreme-court-fight/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>NASA’s ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) mission lifted off on a 22-month trip to Mars on Thursday <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/blue-origin-caps-second-heavy-lift-launch-with-first-offshore-landing/">aboard a New Glenn rocket</a>.

<p>Led by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley—the two spacecraft are named “Blue” and “Gold” after the school’s colors—the ESCAPADE probes are the first Mars-bound vehicles to be designed, built, and tested by Rocket Lab, the end-to-end space company headquartered in California but founded in New Zealand.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/the-twin-probes-just-launched-toward-mars-have-an-easter-egg-on-board/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>A meeting that was scheduled for October but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/childhood-vaccines-safe-for-a-little-longer-as-cdc-cancels-advisory-meeting/">put on hold</a> during the shutdown has already been rescheduled for December 4 and 5. <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/11/13/2025-19872/meeting-of-the-advisory-committee-on-immunization-practices">A Federal Register notice</a> Thursday said that the meeting will “include discussions on vaccine safety, the childhood and adolescent immunization schedule, and hepatitis B vaccines.” The announcement was light on information beyond that but indicated that there would be a vote on hepatitis B vaccines.</p>
<p>The panel—the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—is typically composed of preeminent, extensively vetted vaccine experts. But, in June, Kennedy summarily fired all 17 experts on the panel and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/yep-rfk-jr-appoints-anti-vaccine-advocates-to-cdc-vaccine-panel/">installed</a> 12 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/meet-the-latest-anti-vaccine-voices-on-rfk-jr-s-cdc-advisory-panel/">new members</a>, almost all of whom are questionably qualified and espouse anti-vaccine views.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/as-shutdown-ends-dubious-cdc-panel-gets-back-to-dismantling-vaccine-schedule/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Not everything about the future sucks. Like electric cars. Sure, there’s one thing that dinosaur-burners do better—short refueling stops—but even the least efficient EV is still multiple times better than its gas equivalent. So much better in fact that it offsets all the extra energy needed to make the battery within a year or two. They’re quieter, and easy to drive. And in a pinch, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/general-motors-will-add-bidirectional-charging-to-its-ultium-based-evs/">they can power your house</a> from the garage. Or how about an airport?</p>
<p>OK, we’re not talking about a major international airport (although I really need to talk to someone at Dulles International Airport about my idea to electrify those Space 1999-esque mobile lounges at some point). But up in Humboldt County, California, there’s a microgrid at the Redwood Coast Airport that has now integrated bidirectional charging, and a pair of Nissan Leaf EVs, into its operation.</p>
<p>The microgrid has been operating since 2021 with a 2.2 MW solar array, 8.9 MWh of battery storage, and a 300 KW net-metered solar system. It can feed excess power back into PG&amp;E’s local grid and draw power from the same, but in an outage, the microgrid can keep the airport up and operational.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/california-airport-tries-out-bidirectional-ev-charging-microgrid/">Read full article</a></p>
