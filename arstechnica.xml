              <![CDATA[<p>Manta rays are elegantly shaped. They swim by flapping their fins like enormous wings, and their gills filter for plankton with the utmost precision. These creatures have now inspired human innovations that take soft robots and water filters to the next level.</p>
<p>With fins that borrow their shape and motion from mantas, a soft robot created by a team of researchers at North Carolina State University and the University of Virginia improves on a previous model by reaching speeds of 6.8 body lengths per second, nearly double what its predecessor was capable of. This makes it the fastest soft robot so far. It is also more energy-efficient than its previous iteration and can swim not just on the surface, but upward and downward, just like an actual manta ray.</p>
<p>Another research team at MIT used the gills of these creatures, which filter for plankton, to improve commercial water filtration systems. Their gill openings are also the perfect size to help them breathe while they feed, absorbing oxygen from water on its way out. The rays’ balance of feeding and breathing helped the researchers figure out a filter structure that more precisely controls inflow and outflow.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/manta-rays-inspire-faster-swimming-robots-and-better-water-filters/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Ahead of a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-crypto-mining-ban-2025-2031">major crackdown on illegal cryptocurrency mines in Russia</a> next year, a power provider in Siberia has been fined for illegally leasing state land that's supposed to be used only for public utilities to an illegal mining operation.</p>
<p>In a social media <a href="https://vk.com/wall-213611955_10193">post</a> translated by Ars, the Irkutsk Region Prosecutor-General’s Office explained that the power provider was fined more than 330,000 rubles (about $3,000) for the improper land use. Local prosecutors will also pursue an administrative case against the power provider, the office said.</p>
<p>Crypto mining is popular in Siberia because of low operating costs, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-miner-hunting-siberian-power-provider-finds-illegal-farm-on-its-own-property/">Crypto News noted</a>, due to the cool temperatures and cheap power supply. But many in Siberia have blamed crypto miners for power outages and grid instability that can cause significant harms during winter months.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/russian-power-provider-struck-deal-that-hid-illegal-crypto-mine-on-state-land/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the holiday weekend, all but one member of the editorial board of Elsevier's <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-human-evolution">Journal of Human Evolution</a> (JHE) resigned "with heartfelt sadness and great regret," <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/27/evolution-journal-editors-resign-en-masse-to-protest-elsevier-changes/">according to Retraction Watch</a>, which helpfully provided an <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Social-Media-Statement-re-JHE-Resignations.pdf">online PDF</a> of the editors' full statement. It's the 20th <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/">mass resignation</a> from a science journal since 2023 over various points of contention, per Retraction Watch, many in response to controversial changes in the business models used by the scientific publishing industry.</p>
<p>"This has been an exceptionally painful decision for each of us," the board members wrote in their statement. "The editors who have stewarded the journal over the past 38 years have invested immense time and energy in making JHE the leading journal in paleoanthropological research and have remained loyal and committed to the journal and our authors long after their terms ended. The [associate editors] have been equally loyal and committed. We all care deeply about the journal, our discipline, and our academic community; however, we find we can no longer work with Elsevier in good conscience."</p>
<p>The editorial board cited several changes made over the last ten years that it believes are counter to the journal's longstanding editorial principles. These included eliminating support for a copy editor and a special issues editor, leaving it to the editorial board to handle those duties. When the board expressed the need for a copy editor, Elsevier's response, they said, was "to maintain that the editors should not be paying attention to language, grammar, readability, consistency, or accuracy of proper nomenclature or formatting."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/journal-editors-resign-to-protest-ai-use-high-fees-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Behold the frogfish. This bizarre creature really is a fish, despite its bullfrog face, pectoral fins that look like webbed feet, and a froglike mouth that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJXmJsIaHy8&amp;t=47s">snaps up unsuspecting prey</a>.</p>
<p>But the way it lures its prey is even weirder. Frogfish belong to the anglerfish family known as Antennariidae. Like their anglerfish cousins who lurk in the ocean’s depths, these ambush predators attract their next meal via an appendage on their heads that they use like a fishing lure. This appendage is known as the illicium and thought to have once been a dorsal fin. It has a specialized skin flap, the esca at the end. It tantalizes small fish and crustaceans into thinking it’s a worm until they come too close.</p>
<p>How frogfish controlled the illicium was previously unknown. Led by biologist Naoyuki Yamamoto of Nagoya University, a team of researchers have now discovered that a specialized population of motor neurons have evolved to allow it to shake the illicium around like a wriggling worm. Yamamoto thinks they were originally dorsal fin motor neurons that became more specialized.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/frogfish-reveals-how-it-evolved-the-fishing-rod-on-its-head/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the weeks before Donald Trump takes office, he has moved to delay a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-if-chinese-owner-bytedance-doesnt-sell/">nationwide TikTok ban</a> from taking effect until he has a chance to make a deal on his own terms that he believes could allow TikTok to continue operating in the US without posing a national security threat.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump's lawyer filed a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-656/336151/20241227163400981_2024-12-27%20-%20TikTok%20v.%20Garland%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20President%20Donald%20J.%20Trump.pdf">brief</a>, urging the Supreme Court to stay enforcement of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that would either ban TikTok on January 19 or force TikTok to sell the company to prevent China's alleged covert control of content on the app.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/supreme-court-to-decide-if-tiktok-should-be-banned-or-sold/">Supreme Court had previously denied TikTok's request for an injunction</a> that would have delayed enforcement until Trump takes office, instead planning to rush a decision on whether the Act violates the First Amendment before the deadline hits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/trump-told-scotus-he-plans-to-make-a-deal-to-save-tiktok/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Connected cars are great—at least until some company leaves unencrypted location data on the Internet for anyone to find. That's what happened with over 800,000 EVs manufactured by the Volkswagen Group, after Cariad, an automative software company that handles much of the development tasks for VW, left several terabytes of data unprotected on Amazon's cloud.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/745636/vw-group-location-data-exposed/">According to Motor1</a>, a whistleblower gave German publication Der Spiegel and hacking collective Chaos Computer Club a heads-up about the misconfiguration. Der Spiegel and CCC then spent some time sifting through the data, with which allowed them to tie individual cars to their owners.</p>
<p>"The security hole allowed the publication to track the location of two German politicians with alarming precision, with the data placing a member of the German Defense Committee at his father’s retirement home and at the country’s military barracks," wrote Motor1.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/whistleblower-finds-unencrypted-location-data-for-800000-vw-evs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There is rarely time to write about every cool science paper that comes our way; many worthy candidates sadly fall through the cracks over the course of the year. But as 2024 comes to a close, we've gathered ten of our favorite such papers at the intersection of science and culture as a special treat, covering a broad range of topics: from reenacting Bronze Age spear combat and applying network theory to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, to Spider-Man inspired web-slinging tech and a mathematical connection between a turbulent phase transition and your morning cup of coffee. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Reenacting Bronze Age spear combat</h2>

<p>The European Bronze Age saw the rise of institutionalized warfare, evidenced by the many spearheads and similar weaponry archaeologists have unearthed. But how might these artifacts be used in actual combat? Dutch researchers decided to find out by constructing replicas of Bronze Age shields and spears and using them in realistic combat scenarios. They described their findings in an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440324001122?via%3Dihub">October paper</a> published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.</p>
<p>There have been a couple of prior experimental studies on bronze spears, but per Valerio Gentile (now at the University of Gottingen) and coauthors, practical research to date has been quite narrow in scope, focusing on throwing weapons against static shields. Coauthors C.J. van Dijk of the National Military Museum in the Netherlands and independent researcher O. Ter Mors each had more than a decade of experience teaching traditional martial arts, specializing in medieval polearms and one-handed weapons. So they were ideal candidates for testing the replica spears and shields.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We’d been chatting for the better part of two hours when Chris Kraft’s eyes suddenly brightened. “Hey,” he said, “Here’s a story I’ll bet you never heard.” Kraft, the man who had written flight rules for NASA at the dawn of US spaceflight and supervised the Apollo program, had invited me to his home south of Houston for one of our periodic talks about space policy and space history. As we sat in recliners upstairs, in a den overlooking the Bay Oaks Country Club, Kraft told me about a time the space shuttle almost got canceled.</p>
<p>It was the late 1970s, when Kraft directed the Johnson Space Center, the home of the space shuttle program. At the time, the winged vehicle had progressed deep into a development phase that started in 1971. Because the program had not received enough money to cover development costs, some aspects of the vehicle (such as its thermal protective tiles) were delayed into future budget cycles. In another budget trick, NASA committed $158 million in fiscal year 1979 funds for work done during the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>This could not go on, and according to Kraft the situation boiled over during a 1978 meeting in a large conference floor on the 9th floor of Building 1, the Houston center’s headquarters. All the program managers and other center directors gathered there along with NASA’s top leadership. That meeting included Administrator Robert Frosch, a physicist President Carter had appointed a year earlier.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/a-cold-war-mystery-why-did-jimmy-carter-save-the-space-shuttle/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Whether it’s braving the long line at a trendy new restaurant or hanging on just a few minutes longer to see if there’s a post-credits scene after a movie, the decision to persevere or ditch it depends on specific regions of our brains.</p>
<p>Waiting is not always about self-control. Deciding to wait (or not to wait) also involves gauging the value of the potential reward. In an experiment that investigated wait times among people with lesions in the frontal cortex of the brain, University of Pennsylvania psychologist Joe Kable and his research team found that subjects with damage to certain regions of the prefrontal cortex were less likely to wait things out.</p>
<p>“[Our] findings suggest that regions of the frontal cortex make computationally distinct contributions to adaptive persistence,” he and his team said in a <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2024/11/18/JNEUROSCI.0068-24.2024">study</a> recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/when-does-your-brain-think-something-is-worth-the-wait/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I'd describe myself as a skeptic of the generative AI revolution—I think the technology as it currently exists is situationally impressive and useful for specific kinds of tasks, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-are-honestly-pretty-bad/">broadly oversold</a>. I'm not sure it will vanish from relevance to quite the extent that other tech fads like the metaverse or NFTs did, but my suspicion is that companies like Nvidia and OpenAI are riding a bubble that will pop or deflate over time as more companies and individuals run up against the technology's limitations, and as it fails to advance as quickly or as impressively as its most ardent boosters are predicting.</p>
<p>Maybe you agree with me and maybe you don't! I'm not necessarily trying to convince you one way or the other. But I <em>am</em> here to say that even if you agree with me, we can all celebrate the one unambiguously positive thing that the generative AI hype cycle has done for computers this year: the RAM floor for many PCs and all Macs is now finally 16GB instead of 8GB.</p>
<p>Companies like Apple and Microsoft have, for years, created attractive, high-powered hardware with 8GB of memory in it, most egregiously in $1,000-and-up putative "pro" computers like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/new-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-add-m3-chips-plus-a-1599-entry-level-model/">last year's $1,599 M3 MacBook Pro</a> or the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/surface-pro-9-comes-in-both-intel-and-arm-flavors-absorbing-the-surface-pro-x/">Surface Pro 9</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/generative-ai-has-done-one-unambiguously-good-thing-for-pcs-and-macs-16gb-of-ram/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's that time again, when families and friends gather and implore the more technically inclined among them to troubleshoot problems they're having behind the device screens all around them. One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.</p>
<p>Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passwordless-google-accounts-are-easier-and-more-secure-than-passwords-heres-why/">two years ago</a>, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts. How and why is that?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/passkey-technology-is-elegant-but-its-most-definitely-not-usable-security/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The art of space mission patches is now more than six decades old, dating to the Vostok 6 mission in 1963 that carried Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova into low-Earth orbit for nearly three days. The patch for the first female human spaceflight showcased a dove flying above the letters designating the Soviet Union, CCCP.</p>
<p>That patch was not publicly revealed at the time, and the use of specially designed patches was employed only infrequently by subsequent Soviet missions. NASA's first mission patch would not follow for two years, but the practice would prove more sticky for missions in the United States and become a time-honored tradition.</p>
<p>The first NASA flight to produce a mission-specific patch worn by crew members was Gemini 5. It flew in August 1965, carrying astronauts Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad on an eight-day mission inside a small Gemini spacecraft. At the time, it was the longest spaceflight conducted by anyone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/after-60-years-of-spaceflight-patches-here-are-some-of-our-favorites/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It feels like tech workers have caught very few breaks over the past several years, between ongoing mass layoffs, stagnating wages amid inflation, AI supposedly coming for jobs, and unpopular orders to return to office that, for many, threaten to disrupt work-life balance.</p>
<p>But in 2024, a potentially critical mass of tech workers seemed to reach a breaking point. As labor rights groups advocating for tech workers told Ars, these workers are banding together in sustained strong numbers and are either winning or appear tantalizingly close to winning better worker conditions at major tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>In February, the industry-wide Tech Workers Coalition (TWC) <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/blog/labor-notes-highlights/">noted</a> that "the tech workers movement is far more expansive and impactful" than even labor rights advocates realized, noting that unionized tech workers have gone beyond early stories about Googlers marching in the streets and now "make the headlines on a daily basis."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/from-ai-to-rto-unpopular-policies-may-fuel-tech-worker-movements-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a long day of stops and starts that stretched well into the evening, and on what appeared to be the company's fifth attempt Friday, Blue Origin successfully ignited the seven main engines on its massive New Glenn rocket.</p>
<p>The test firing came as fog built over the Florida coast, and it marks the final major step in the rocket company's campaign to bring the New Glenn rocket—a privately developed, super-heavy lift vehicle—to launch readiness. Blue Origin said it fired the vehicle's engines for a duration of 24 seconds. They fired at full thrust for 13 of those seconds.</p>
<p>"This is a monumental milestone and a glimpse of what’s just around the corner for New Glenn’s first launch," said Jarrett Jones,  senior vice president of the New Glenn program, <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenn-completes-integrated-launch-vehicle-hotfire">in a news release</a>. "Today’s success proves that our rigorous approach to testing—combined with our incredible tooling and design engineering–is working as intended."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/blue-origin-hot-fires-new-glenn-rocket-setting-up-a-launch-early-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A brave YouTuber has managed to defeat a fake Nintendo lawyer improperly targeting his channel with copyright takedowns that could have seen his entire channel removed if YouTube issued one more strike.</p>
<p>Sharing his story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/27/24326278/nintendo-fake-takedowns-youtube-domtendo-dmca">with The Verge</a>, Dominik "Domtendo" Neumayer—a German YouTuber who has broadcasted play-throughs of popular games for 17 years—said that it all started when YouTube removed some videos from his channel that were centered on <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>. Those removals came after a pair of complaints were filed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and generated two strikes. Everyone on YouTube knows that three strikes mean you're out and off the platform permanently.</p>
<p>Suddenly at risk of losing the entire channel he had built on YouTube, Neumayer was stunned, The Verge noted, partly because most game companies consider "Let's Play" videos like his to be free marketing, not a threat to their business. And while Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/nintendo-issues-copyright-claims-on-mario-themed-minecraft-videos/">been known to target YouTubers</a> with DMCA takedowns, it generally historically took no issues with accounts like his.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/youtuber-won-dmca-fight-with-fake-nintendo-lawyer-by-detecting-spoofed-email/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>'Tis the season for many holiday traditions, including the Ugly Christmas Sweater—you know, those 1950s-style heavy knits featuring some kind of cartoonish seasonal decoration, like snowflakes, Santa Claus, or—in the case of Mark Darcy from <em>Bridget Jones' Diary</em> (2001)—Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. "It’s obnoxious and tacky, but also fuzzy and kind of wholesome—the fashion equivalent of a Hallmark Christmas movie (with a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek)," as CNN's Marianna Cerini <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/ugly-christmas-sweater-holidays-history/index.html">recently observed</a>.</p>
<p>Fashion (or lack thereof) aside, sweaters and other knitted fabric are also fascinating to physicists and mathematicians. Case in point: a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.248201">recent paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Letters examining the complex mechanics behind the many resting shapes a good Jersey knit can form while at rest.</p>
<p>Knitted fabrics are part of a class of intertwined materials—which also includes birds' nests, surgical knots, knotted shoelaces, and even the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10570-023-05683-x">degradation of paper fibers</a> in ancient manuscripts. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/physicists-are-decoding-math-y-secrets-of-knitting-to-make-bespoke-materials/">Knitted fabrics are technically a type</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial">metamaterial</a>: an engineered material that gets its properties not from the base materials but from their designed structures. The elasticity (aka, stretchiness) of knitted fabrics is an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3410/03-ask.html">emergent property</a>: the whole is more than the sum of its parts. How those components (strands of yarn) are arranged at an intermediate scale (the structure) determines the macro scale properties of the resulting fabric.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/the-physics-of-ugly-christmas-sweaters/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has finally shared details about its plans to shake up its core business by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openai-plans-tectonic-shift-from-nonprofit-to-for-profit-giving-altman-equity/">shifting to a for-profit </a>corporate structure.</p>
<p>On Thursday, OpenAI posted on its <a href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">blog</a>, confirming that in 2025, the existing for-profit arm will be transformed into a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC). As a PBC, OpenAI would be required to balance its shareholders' and stakeholders' interests with the public benefit. To achieve that, OpenAI would offer "ordinary shares of stock" while using some profits to further its mission—"ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity"—to serve a social good.</p>
<p>To compensate for losing control over the for-profit, the nonprofit would have some shares in the PBC, but it's currently unclear how many will be allotted. Independent financial advisors will help OpenAI reach a "fair valuation," the blog said, while promising the new structure would "multiply" the donations that previously supported the nonprofit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/openai-defends-for-profit-shift-as-critical-to-sustain-humanitarian-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apparently Hertz's purging of electric vehicles from its fleet isn't going fast enough for the car rental giant. A Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HertzRentals/comments/1hi5p7d/hertz_trying_to_sell_you_the_car_youre_currently/">posted an offer</a> they received from Hertz to buy the 2023 Tesla Model 3 they had been renting for $17,913.</p>
<p>Hertz originally went strong into EVs, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/hertz-to-purchase-100000-tesla-model-3s-for-its-rental-fleet/">announcing a plan</a> to buy 100,000 Model 3s for its fleet by the end of 2021, but 16 months later had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/hertz-falls-short-of-ambitious-tesla-2022-fleet-goal/">acquired only half that amount</a>. The company found that repair costs—especially for Teslas, which averaged 20 percent more than other EVs—were cutting into its profit margins. Customer demand was also not what Hertz had hoped for; last January, it announced plans to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/hertz-is-selling-20000-used-evs-due-to-high-repair-costs/">sell off 20,000 EVs</a>.</p>
<p>Asking its customers if they want to purchase their rentals isn't a new strategy for Hertz. "By connecting our rental customers who opt into our emails to our sales channels, we're not only building awareness of the fact that we sell cars but also offering a unique opportunity to someone who may be in the market for the same car they have on rent," Hertz communications director Jamie Line <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/26/24329874/hertz-ev-tesla-email-sales-offers">told The Verge</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/hertz-is-asking-ev-renters-if-they-want-to-buy-their-rentals/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There are thousands of YouTube videos in which DIY science enthusiasts cut grapes in half—leaving just a thin bit of skin connecting them—and put the grapes in the microwave, just to marvel at the sparks and plume of ionized gas (plasma) that the grapes produce. This quirky property of grapes might help make more efficient quantum sensors, according to a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.22.064078">new paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Applied.</p>
<p>The plasma-inducing grape effect was first observed in 1994, per the authors. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/these-scientists-broke-12-microwaves-to-learn-how-grapes-create-plasmas/">previously reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-here-s-how-to-make-plasma-by-microwaving-a-grape">usual explanation</a> for the generation of plasmas is that grapes are so small that the irradiating microwaves become <a href="https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=818">highly concentrated</a> in the grape tissue, <a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/12/3/7326643/grape-plasma-microwave">ripping some the molecules apart</a> to generate charged ions (adding to the electrolytes already present in the grapes). The electromagnetic field that forms causes ions to flow from one grape half to the other via the connecting skin—at least at first. That's when you get the initial sparks. Eventually, the ions start passing through the surrounding air as well, ionizing it to produce that hot plume of plasma.</p>
<p>But in 2019, Trent University scientists <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1818350116">showed that</a> explanation isn't quite right. The skin bridge isn't necessary for the effect to occur. Rather, the plasma is generated by an electromagnetic "hot spot." The grapes have the right refractive index and size to "trap" microwaves, so putting two of them close together leads to the generation of a hot spot between them. The trick also works with gooseberries, large blackberries, and quail eggs, as well as hydrogel beads—plastic beads soaked in water. ("Many microwaves were in fact harmed during the experiments," co-author Hamza Khattak admitted at the time.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/could-microwaved-grapes-be-used-for-quantum-sensing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Microsoft in a wide-ranging probe that will examine whether the company’s business practices have run afoul of antitrust laws, according to people familiar with the matter. In recent weeks, FTC attorneys have been conducting interviews and setting up meetings with Microsoft competitors.</p>
<p>One key area of interest is how the world’s largest software provider packages popular Office products together with cybersecurity and cloud computing services, said one of the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.</p>
<p>This so-called bundling was the subject of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-white-house-offer-cybersecurity-biden-nadella">a recent ProPublica investigation</a>, which detailed how, beginning in 2021, Microsoft used the practice to vastly expand its business with the US government while boxing competitors out of lucrative federal contracts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/ftc-launches-probe-of-microsoft-over-bundling/">Read full article</a></p>
