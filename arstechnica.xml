                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal judge has ordered spyware maker <a href="https://www.nsogroup.com/">NSO</a> to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.350613/gov.uscourts.cand.350613.802.0.pdf">ruling</a>, issued Friday by Phyllis J. Hamilton of of the US District Court of the District of Northern California, grants a permanent injunction sought by WhatsApp owner Meta in a case it brought against NSO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">in 2019</a>. The lawsuit alleged that Meta caught NSO trying to surreptitiously infect about 1,400 mobile phones—many belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials—with Pegasus. As part of the campaign, NSO created fake WhatsApp accounts and targeted Meta infrastructure. The suit sought monetary awards and an injunction against the practice.</p>
<h2>Setting a precedent</h2>
<p>Friday’s ruling ordered NSO to permanently cease targeting WhatsApp users, attempting to infect their devices, or intercepted WhatsApp messages, which are end-to-end encrypted using the open source <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/why-signals-post-quantum-makeover-is-an-amazing-engineering-achievement/">Signal Protocol</a>. Hamilton also ruled that NSO must delete any data it obtained when targeting the WhatsApp users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/nso-permanently-barred-from-targeting-whatsapp-users-with-pegasus-spyware/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy made two television appearances on Monday morning in which he shook up the space agency’s plans to return humans to the Moon.</p>
<p>Speaking on Fox News, where the secretary of transportation frequently appears in his acting role as NASA chief, Duffy said SpaceX has fallen behind in its efforts to develop the Starship vehicle as a lunar lander. Duffy also indirectly acknowledged that NASA’s projected target of a 2027 crewed lunar landing is no longer achievable. Accordingly, he said he intended to expand the competition to develop a lander capable of carrying humans down to the Moon from lunar orbit and back.</p>
<p>“They’re behind schedule, and so the President wants to make sure we beat the Chinese,” <a href="https://x.com/SecDuffyNASA/status/1980243865400701369">Duffy said</a> of SpaceX. “He wants to get there in his term. So I’m in the process of opening that contract up. I think we’ll see companies like Blue [Origin] get involved, and maybe others. We’re going to have a space race in regard to American companies competing to see who can actually lead us back to the Moon first.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/nasas-acting-leader-seeks-to-keep-his-job-with-new-lunar-lander-announcement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic has <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-on-the-web">added web and mobile interfaces</a> for Claude Code, its immensely popular command-line interface (CLI) agentic AI coding tool.</p>
<p>The web interface appears to be well-baked at launch, but the mobile version is limited to iOS and is in an earlier stage of development.</p>
<p>The web version of Claude Code can be given access to a GitHub repository. Once that’s done, developers can give it general marching orders like “add real-time inventory tracking to the dashboard.” As with the CLI version, it gets to work, with updates along the way approximating where it’s at and what it’s doing. The web interface supports the recently implemented Claude Code capability to take suggestions or requested changes while it’s in the middle of working on a task. (Previously, if you saw it doing something wrong or missing something, you often had to cancel and start over.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It took awhile, but Google’s Pixel line of smartphones has established itself as a mainstay of Android after 10 generations. The company has long operated a “Superfans” group to help promote Pixels, but now members have a slim chance to get their hands on Google’s next phones ahead of time. Google is reportedly looking for some lucky Superfans to test and provide feedback on unreleased devices, but they’ll have to promise not to leak anything.</p>
<p>It’s not unheard of for companies to have loyal customers help test new products, but it’s not usually big companies like Google with well-established products like Pixel. Google usually keeps its circle of hardware testers small and limited to employees. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-20/google-to-let-superfans-test-pixel-11-before-it-s-announced">According to Bloomberg</a>, Google is running a contest among Superfans to find 15 non-employees suited to test in-development hardware. An official document reviewed by Bloomberg describes the program as a chance to “provide feedback and help shape a Pixel phone currently in development.”</p>
<p>To apply, interested Superfans have to prove they are more super than the rest. They must demonstrate deep knowledge of the Pixel product family and suggest ways the phones can be improved. However, Google is asking this of its biggest supporters—people who still care enough about their smartphones to seek out a group specifically to talk about how much they care about their phones. Is Google going to get gushing praise or constructive criticism?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-reportedly-searching-for-15-pixel-superfans-to-test-unreleased-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>All the world’s discarded phones, bricked laptops, and other trashed electronics are collectively a treasure trove of rare earth elements (REEs). But separating out and recovering these increasingly sought-after materials is no easy task.</p>
<p>However, a team of researchers says it has developed a way of separating REEs from waste—magnets, in this case—that is relatively easy, uses less energy, and isn’t nearly as emissions and pollution intensive as current methods. The team published <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2507819122">a paper</a> describing this method in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>In short, this process involves using an electric current to heat waste magnets to very high temperatures very fast, and using chlorine gas to react with the non-REEs in the mix, keeping them in the vapor phase. James Tour, one of the authors and a professor of materials science and nanoengineering at Rice University, says that the research can help the United States meet its growing need for these elements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/breaking-down-rare-earth-element-magnets-for-recycling/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Chances are you’ve encountered some version of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion">Ebbinghaus illusion</a>,” in which a central circle appears to be smaller when encircled by larger circles and seems larger when surrounded by smaller circles. It’s an example of context-dependent size perception. But is this unique to humans or are some animals susceptible as well? According to a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1653695/full">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, it might depend on the specific sensory environment, since the illusion relies on contextual clues to be effective.</p>
<p>Prior research has produced mixed results on the question of animals and their susceptibility to optical illusions, per the authors. Dolphins, chicks, and redtail splitfins seem to be susceptible, for example, while pigeons, baboons, and gray bamboo snakes are not.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known example is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/what-cats-love-of-boxes-and-squares-can-tell-us-about-their-visual-perception/">cats’ undeniable love of boxes</a> and squares—the “if it fits, I sits” phenomenon documented all over the Internet. This behavior is <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-cant-cats-resist-thinking-inside-the-box-76287">generally attributed</a> to the fact that cats feel safer when squeezed into small spaces, but it also tells us something about feline visual perception. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3250081/">A 1988 study</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?fbclid=IwAR0NkvhAGEDRgD4xwynVFuaXl6JUFZ0ZSgDYNJH7tEwiPIMZrYv7tkxUoIw">a 2021 study</a> concluded that cats are susceptible to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contour">Kanizsa square illusion</a>, suggesting that they perceive subjective contours much like humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/do-animals-fall-for-optical-illusions-its-complicated/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The second of these two launches<span class="s1">—originating from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California</span><span class="s1">—</span>propelled SpaceX’s Starlink program past a notable milestone.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla shareholders should reject a compensation plan that could pay Elon Musk more than $1 trillion over the next decade, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said in a report Friday.</p>
<p>The plan is designed “to retain Musk and keep his time and attention on Tesla instead of his other business ventures,” but “there are no prescriptive elements within the award to ensure his focus and time remain on Tesla as opposed to his other ventures, undermining the award’s primary rationale,” the <a href="https://www.issgovernance.com/">advisory firm</a> said in a report for its clients.</p>
<p>The “astronomical grant value” awarded to Musk could dilute value for other shareholders “due to the extreme value and number of shares being granted,” and it is questionable whether the award “is necessary or appropriate to further align his interests [with Tesla] when he currently holds a 19.8 percent ownership stake in the company,” ISS said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/musks-1-trillion-pay-plan-doesnt-force-him-to-keep-focus-on-tesla-critics-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1 held the third of its five North American rounds this past weekend at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. Unlike the races in Montreal, Miami, and Las Vegas, the US Grand Prix is held on a proper road course, one purpose-built for the task of hosting F1 a little over a decade ago.</p>
<p>It’s a circuit Ars knows quite well—along with some friends, I was on the turn-19 banking for the first race in 2012, and we checked out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/gallery-ars-goes-behind-the-scenes-with-the-caterham-f1-racing-team/">Caterham’s setup</a> the following year; toured <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/11/the-real-race-day-formula-1s-data-needs-to-move-even-faster-than-its-cars/">the F1 tech center</a> in 2015, where the race broadcasts are directed; then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/why-f1s-switch-from-13-inch-to-18-inch-tires-is-important/">learned about tires</a> there with Pirelli in 2021. And we’ve driven it in everything from an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/11/a-retina-display-for-the-road-the-clever-new-2016-audi-tt-reviewed/">Audi TT-S</a> to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-first-drive-engineered-for-insane-speed/">Corvette ZR1</a> to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/circling-or-cycling-the-track-at-f1s-famous-circuit-of-the-americas/">Mocabene Vent Noir</a>. Not to mention all the Lone Star Le Mans races we’ve attended.</p>
<p>The crowds now exceed even the mass of humanity that showed up for that first race. And while Miami and Las Vegas have been pitched at the “more money than they know what to do with” people, ticket prices at COTA are more reasonable (for an F1 event). As long as you don’t mind brutal heat and humidity, it can be quite a good race to attend.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/f1-in-texas-well-now-the-championship-is-exciting-again/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Three women become choked up as they deliver news in a video posted to social media. “We did it, everybody,” says Leslie Manookian, the woman in the middle. She is a driving force in a campaign that has chipped away at the foundations of modern public health in Idaho. The group had just gotten lawmakers to pass what she called the first true “medical freedom” bill in the nation. “It’s literally landmark,” Manookian said. “It is changing everything.”</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For more than a decade, researchers have wondered whether artificial intelligence could help predict what incapacitated patients might want when doctors must make life-or-death decisions on their behalf.</p>
<p>It remains one of the most high-stakes questions in health care AI today. But as AI improves, some experts increasingly see it as inevitable that digital “clones” of patients could one day aid family members, doctors, and ethics boards in making end-of-life decisions that are aligned with a patient’s values and goals.</p>
<p>Ars spoke with experts conducting or closely monitoring this research who confirmed that no hospital has yet deployed so-called “AI surrogates.” But AI researcher Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad is aiming to change that, taking the first steps toward piloting AI surrogates at a US medical facility.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/10/should-an-ai-copy-of-you-help-decide-if-you-live-or-die/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed Sunday that it is investigating an airliner that was struck by an object in its windscreen, mid-flight, over Utah.</p>
<p>“NTSB gathering radar, weather, flight recorder data,” the federal agency said on the <a href="https://x.com/ntsb_newsroom/status/1979962245703483461?s=43">social media site X</a>. “Windscreen being sent to NTSB laboratories for examination.”</p>
<p>The strike occurred Thursday, during a United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles. <a href="https://x.com/xJonNYC/status/1979220753380683943">Images shared on social media</a> showed that one of the two large windows at the front of a 737 MAX aircraft was significantly cracked. Related images also reveal a pilot’s arm that has been cut multiple times by what appear to be small shards of glass.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/something-from-space-may-have-just-struck-a-united-airlines-flight-over-utah/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>Even in my youth, I always loved the idea of point-and-click adventure games more than I did the reality. I appreciated how they transported me to other worlds, each with its own rules, histories, and interesting characters. However, like many people, I often ran up against the harsh reality of solving bizarre and obtuse puzzles in a time before Internet walkthroughs.</p>
<p>I almost never actually finished point-and-click adventure games for that reason—but there is one major exception: I completed Roberta Williams’ <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe_colonels_bequest"><em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em></a> several times.</p>
<p>One of the last Sierra adventure games to still use a text parser, <em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em> follows a young woman named Laura Bow as she visits a mansion in the Southern US belonging to her college friend’s grandfather, Colonel Henri Dijon. While she’s there, a dispute breaks out over the colonel’s will, and it becomes clear a murderer is on the loose.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/roberta-williams-the-colonels-bequest-was-a-different-type-of-adventure-game/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, the Trump administration made nine elite universities <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">an offer they couldn’t refuse</a>: bring in more conservatives while shutting down “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” give up control of admissions and hiring decisions, agree to “biological” definitions of sex and gender, don’t raise tuition for five years, clamp down on student protests, and stay institutionally “neutral” on current events. Do this and you won’t be cut off from “federal benefits,” which could include research funding, student loans, federal contracts, and even student and faculty immigration visas. Instead, you may gain “substantial and meaningful federal grants.”</p>
<p>But the universities <em>are</em> refusing. With the initial deadline of October 20 approaching, four of the nine universities—the <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/announcements/update-penns-response-compact-academic-excellence">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5557914-brown-university-rejects-trump-compact/">Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-16/usc-rejects-trump-education-compact">University of Southern California</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/mit-rejects-white-house-compact.html">MIT</a>—that received the federal “compact” have announced that they will not sign it. [<strong>Update</strong>: A fifth school, the University of Virginia, has now<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/us/university-of-virginia-white-house-compact.html"> declined the deal</a>. <strong>Update 2</strong>: School six, Dartmouth, has also<a href="https://president.dartmouth.edu/news/2025/10/dartmouths-feedback-compact"> rejected the compact</a>.]</p>
<p>In addition, the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,600 colleges and universities, today <a href="https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Statement-Trump-Administration-Compact.aspx">issued a statement</a> calling for the compact to be completely withdrawn.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/with-deadline-looming-4-of-9-universities-reject-trumps-compact-to-remake-higher-ed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Law enforcement agencies will soon have easier access to footage captured by Amazon’s Ring smart cameras. In a partnership announced this week, Amazon will allow approximately 5,000 local law enforcement agencies to request access to Ring camera footage via surveillance platforms from <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/">Flock Safety</a>. Ring’s cooperation with law enforcement and the reported use of Flock technologies by federal agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has resurfaced privacy concerns that have followed the devices for years.</p>
<p>According to Flock’s announcement, its Ring partnership allows local law enforcement members to use Flock software “to send a direct post in the Ring Neighbors app with details about the investigation and request voluntary assistance.” Requests must include “specific location and timeframe of the incident, a unique investigation code, and details about what is being investigated,” and users can look at the requests anonymously, Flock said.</p>
<p>“Any footage a Ring customer chooses to submit will be securely packaged by Flock and shared directly with the requesting local public safety agency through the FlockOS or Flock Nova platform,” the announcement reads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/ring-cameras-are-about-to-get-increasingly-chummy-with-law-enforcement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 1890, a German scientist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Koch">Robert Koch</a> thought he’d invented a cure for tuberculosis, a substance derived from the infecting bacterium itself that he dubbed Tuberculin. His substance didn’t actually cure anyone, but it was eventually widely used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin">diagnostic skin test</a>. Koch’s successful failure is just one of the many colorful cases featured in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Ends-Failures-Sparked-Medical/dp/1547615028"><em>Dead Ends! Flukes, Flops, and Failures</em> <em>that Sparked Medical Marvels</em></a>, a new nonfiction illustrated children’s book by science historian Lindsey Fitzharris and her husband, cartoonist Adrian Teal.</p>
<p>A noted science communicator with a fondness for the medically macabre, Fitzharris published a biography of surgical pioneer Joseph Lister, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374117292/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=0&amp;imprToken=26c0af77-ed11-8f74-19c&amp;tag=arstech20-20" rel="nofollow" data-orig-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374117292/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=0&amp;imprToken=26c0af77-ed11-8f74-19c&amp;tag=arstech20-20" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-uri="ad6f0422bfaaccb498271fe8ac321b3d" data-xid="fr1760646290574dbd"><em>The Butchering Art</em></a>, in 2017—a great, if occasionally grisly, read. She followed up with 2022’s  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facemaker-Visionary-Surgeons-Disfigured-Soldiers/dp/0374282307"><em>The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon’s Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I</em></a>, about a WWI surgeon named Harold Gillies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/meet-harold-gillies-the-wwi-surgeon-who-rebuilt-the-faces-of-injured-soldiers/">who rebuilt</a> the faces of injured soldiers.</p>
<p>And in 2020, she hosted a documentary for the Smithsonian Channel, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/famous-strange-demises-get-a-second-look-in-the-curious-life-and-death-of/"><em>The Curious Life and Death Of</em></a>…, exploring famous deaths, ranging from drug lord Pablo Escobar to magician Harry Houdini. Fitzharris performed virtual autopsies, experimented with blood samples, interviewed witnesses, and conducted real-time demonstrations in hopes of gleaning fresh insights. For his part, Teal is a well-known caricaturist and illustrator, best known for his work on the British TV series <em>Spitting Image</em>. His work has also appeared in The Guardian and the Sunday Telegraph, among other outlets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/dead-ends-is-a-fun-macabre-medical-history-for-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Texas is being sued by a Big Tech lobby group over the state’s new law that will require app stores to verify users’ ages and impose restrictions on users under 18.</p>
<p>“The Texas App Store Accountability Act imposes a broad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps,” the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said yesterday in a <a href="https://ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dkt.-1-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a>. “In a misguided attempt to protect minors, Texas has decided to require proof of age before anyone with a smartphone or tablet can download an app. Anyone under 18 must obtain parental consent for every app and in-app purchase they try to download—from ebooks to email to entertainment.”</p>
<p>The CCIA said in a <a href="https://ccianet.org/news/2025/10/ccia-sues-texas-to-block-unconstitutional-app-store-law/">press release</a> that the law violates the First Amendment by imposing “a sweeping age-verification, parental consent, and compelled speech regime on both app stores and app developers.” When app stores determine that a user is under 18, “the law prohibits them from downloading virtually all apps and software programs and from making any in-app purchases unless their parent consents and is given control over the minor’s account,” the CCIA said. “Minors who are unable to link their accounts with a parent’s or guardian’s, or who do not receive permission, would be prohibited from accessing app store content.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/big-tech-sues-texas-says-age-verification-law-is-broad-censorship-regime/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In her <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jane-Doe-v-ClothOff-Telegram-Complaint-10-16-25.pdf">complaint</a>, the teen—who was granted anonymity as a 17-year-old minor—accused ClothOff of intentionally making it easy to generate and distribute child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), as well as nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) of adults. She also alleged that the social media network Telegram helps promote ClothOff through automated bots that have attracted hundreds of thousands of subscribers.</p>
<p>ClothOff’s operation, the teen alleged, goes beyond promoting a single app, which can be used for free to turn an ordinary Instagram photo into CSAM or NCII in “three clicks.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/teen-haunted-by-fake-nudes-sues-to-kill-nudify-app-block-telegram-bots/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The late-night transfer covered about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from one facility to another at the Florida spaceport. NASA and its contractors are continuing preparations for the Artemis II mission after the White House approved the program as an exception to work through the ongoing government shutdown, which began on October 1.</p>
<p>The sustained work could set up Artemis II for a launch opportunity as soon as February 5 of next year.
