            <![CDATA["The Budget reduces the space station’s crew size and onboard research."]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>NASA is considering scaling back its activities on the International Space Station, according to multiple sources. The changes, which are being considered primarily due to shortfalls in the space station budget, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the size of the crew complement of Crew Dragon missions from four to three, starting with Crew-12 in February 2026</li>
<li>Extending the duration of space station missions from six to eight months</li>
<li>Canceling all upgrades to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/nasa-is-planning-a-daring-repair-mission-to-save-a-2-billion-particle-detector/">Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer</a> science instrument attached to the station</li>
</ul>
<p>The changes align with a desire that was reflected in the Trump administration's "skinny budget" proposal for NASA, released last Friday, which seeks to have the US space agency reduce its activities on the ISS.</p>
<p>"The Budget reduces the space station’s crew size and onboard research, preparing for a safe decommissioning of the station by 2030 and replacement by commercial space stations," stated the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">budget request for fiscal year 2026</a>. "Crew and cargo flights to the station would be significantly reduced. The station’s reduced research capacity would be focused on efforts critical to the Moon and Mars exploration programs."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/nasa-scrambles-to-cut-iss-activity-after-trump-budget-its-options-are-not-great/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The world has been abuzz for weeks now about the inclusion of a journalist in a group message of senior White House officials discussing plans for a military strike. In that case, the breach was the result of then-National Security Advisor Mike Waltz accidentally adding The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the group chat and no one else in the chat noticing. But what if someone controlling or hacking a messenger platform could do the same thing?</p>
<p>When it comes to WhatsApp—the Meta-owned messenger that’s frequently touted for offering end-to-end encryption—it turns out you can.</p>
<h2>A clean bill of health except for ...</h2>
<p>A team of researchers made the finding in a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/794.pdf">recently released</a> formal analysis of WhatsApp group messaging. They reverse-engineered the app, described the formal cryptographic protocols, and provided theorems establishing the security guarantees that WhatsApp provides. Overall, they gave the messenger a clean bill of health, finding that it works securely and as described by WhatsApp.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/whatsapp-provides-no-cryptographic-management-for-group-messages/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Five clusters of genes from different organisms put into a single bacterial strain.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Over the last century or more, humanity has been developing an ever-growing list of chemicals that have never been seen by Earth's creatures. Many of these chemicals end up being toxic contaminants that we'd love to get rid of, but we struggle to purify them from the environment or break them down once we do. And microbes haven't had much chance to evolve the ability to break them down for us.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, however, we've found a growing number of cases where bacteria have evolved the ability to break down industrial contaminants and plastics. Unfortunately, these bacteria are all different species, target different individual contaminants, and thrive in different environments. But now, researchers have developed a new way to take the genes from all these species and place them in a single bacterial strain that can decontaminate complex waste mixtures.</p>
<h2>Targeting contaminants</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this work was the fact that a lot of industrial contamination contains a mixture of toxic organic molecules, but is found in brackish or salty water. So, the research team, based in Shenzhen, China, started by simply testing a number of lab strains to determine the ability to survive these conditions. The one that seemed to do the best is called <em>Vibrio natriegens</em>. These bacteria were discovered in a salt marsh, and their primary claim to fame is an impressive growth rate, with a population being able to double about every 10 minutes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/researchers-engineer-bacteria-to-clean-up-industrial-wastewater/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There is no product category that better embodies the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">XKCD take on standards</a> than smart home. With an ocean of connectivity options and incompatible standards, taming this mess has been challenging, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/matter-1-4-has-some-solid-ideas-for-the-future-home-now-lets-see-the-support/">Matter</a> could finally have a shot at making things a little less frustrating. The latest version of the standard has launched, offering multiple ways to streamline the usually aggravating setup process.</p>
<p>The first public release of Matter was in late 2022, but compatible systems didn't get support until the following year. Now, there are Matter-certified devices like smart bulbs and sensors that will talk to Apple, Google, Amazon, and other smart home platforms. <a href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/a-smarter-start-matter-1-4-1-makes-setup-easier/">Matter 1.4.1</a> includes support for multi-device QR codes, NFC connection, and integrated terms and conditions—all of these have the potential to eliminate some very real smart home headaches.</p>
<p>It's common for retailers to offer multi-packs of devices like light bulbs or smart plugs. That can save you some money, but setting up all those devices is tedious. With Matter 1.4.1, it might be much easier thanks to multi-device QR codes. Manufacturers can now include a QR code in the package that will pair all the included devices with your smart home system when scanned.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/matter-update-may-finally-take-the-tedium-out-of-setting-up-your-smart-home/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie"><em>gendarmes</em></a> have been busy policing crypto crimes, but these aren't the usual financial schemes, cons, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp">HODL!</a> shenanigans one usually reads about. No, these crimes involve abductions, (multiple) severed fingers, and (multiple) people rescued from the trunks of cars—once after being doused with gasoline.</p>
<p>This previous weekend was particularly nuts, with an older gentleman snatched from the streets of Paris' 14th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris"><em>arrondissement</em></a> on May 1 by men in ski masks. The 14th is a pleasant place—I highly recommend a visit to the catacombs in Place Denfert-Rochereau—and not usually the site of snatch-and-grab operations. The abducted man was apparently the father of someone who had made a packet in crypto. The kidnappers demanded a multimillion-euro ransom from the man's son.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/05/04/abducted-dad-of-crypto-firm-boss-freed-in-french-police-raid_6740891_7.html%20">Le Monde</a>, the abducted father was taken to a house in a Parisian suburb, where one of the father's fingers was cut off in the course of ransom negotiations. Police feared "other mutilations" if they were unable to find the man, but they did locate and raid the house this weekend, arresting five people in their 20s. (According to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/kidnapped-father-french-crypto-millionaire-150730032.html?guccounter=1">the BBC</a>, French police used "phone signals" to locate the house.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple executive Eddie Cue said that Apple is "actively looking at" shifting the focus of mobile Safari's search experience to AI search engines, potentially challenging Google's longstanding search dominance and the two companies' lucrative default search engine deal. The statements were made while Cue testified for the US Department of Justice in the Alphabet/Google antitrust trial, as first reported in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/apple-working-to-move-to-ai-search-in-browser-amid-google-fallout">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>Cue noted that searches in Safari fell for the first time ever last year, and attributed the shift to users increasingly using large language model-based solutions to perform their searches.</p>
<p>"Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices," Cue said of the deal Apple had with Google, which is a key component in the DOJ's case against Alphabet. He added: "I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/05/cue-apple-will-add-ai-search-in-mobile-safari-challenging-google/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Starlink last week <a href="https://x.com/starlink/status/1917029886432317947">announced</a> a new deal for its standard hardware kit, giving the satellite dish and Wi-Fi router for free to customers who sign up for a 12-month commitment.</p>
<p>The deal is reminiscent of the hardware rental agreements long used by cable companies, but Starlink's offer has generated a bit of excitement. Some analysts <a href="https://x.com/thejoekane/status/1917564442478362908">suggested</a> that the free kits are a reason for the federal government's $42 billion broadband deployment fund to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/">send grants</a> to Starlink instead of to fiber-to-the-home providers, or that the government should <a href="https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/starlink-gets-aggressive-free-gear-new-broadband-customers">buy Starlink kits at the regular price of $349 each</a> so that Elon Musk's company doesn't have to eat the cost.</p>
<p>You may not be surprised to learn that the free hardware kit isn't really free. But much of the discussion around the offer has ignored the fine details that could make a reasonable Starlink buyer decide to reject the deal. Similarly, policymakers deciding which ISPs should get government money might be wise to remember that fiber provides superior and more future-proof Internet service and that Starlink's offers to customers could change at any time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/starlink-heres-a-free-satellite-dish-if-you-pay-120-a-month-instead-of-90/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Broadcom has been sending cease-and-desist letters to owners of VMware perpetual licenses with expired support contracts, Ars Technica has confirmed.</p>
<p>Following its November 2023 acquisition of VMware, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">Broadcom ended VMware perpetual license sales</a>. Users with perpetual licenses can still use the software they bought, but they are unable to renew support services <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/broadcom-tried-to-jack-vmware-prices-by-1050-percent-att-claims/">unless they had a pre-existing contract</a> enabling them <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/amid-eu-antitrust-qs-broadcom-extends-support-for-some-vmware-perpetual-licenses/">to do so</a>. The controversial move aims to push VMware users to buy subscriptions to VMware products bundled such that associated costs have increased by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">300 percent</a> or, in some cases, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/">more</a>.</p>
<p>Some customers have opted to continue using VMware unsupported, often as they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/01/a-long-costly-road-ahead-for-customers-abandoning-broadcoms-vmware/">research alternatives</a>, such as VMware rivals or devirtualization.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/broadcom-sends-cease-and-desist-letters-to-subscription-less-vmware-users/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Greetings, Arsians, and welcome to Mother's Day, which I am told is once again happening this weekend in the US! Do you, much like the rest of humanity, have a mother? Well, if you do, then this is the time of year when you're supposed to buy her something to make up for all the pain and suffering she went through in order to bring you into this world! Mom raised you, and while what your mother probably wants more than anything is for you to pick up the phone and <em>talk</em><em>,</em> you could do a lot worse than throwing some money at the problem and buying your mother something from the list we've assembled below!</p>
<h2>Stuff for under $100</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DWM3PCBN?linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=arstech20-20"><em>Severance</em> TV show mug, $17.99</a></h3>

<p>Whether the mom in your life operates primarily as an "innie" or an "outie," if she's a fan of the Apple TV+ show <em>Severance</em>, she may appreciate <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DWM3PCBN?linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=arstech20-20">this ceramic coffee mug inspired by the series</a>. The mug features the iconic phrase "The Work is Both Mysterious and Important" in blue text that mirrors Lumon Industries' sterile corporate aesthetic. It's an ideal conversation starter for fans enjoying the show's second season after the painfully long production delay. Best of all, it's perfect for morning coffee before Mom begins her own mysterious and important work. The same company also offers a "Woe's Hollow" mug if you'd like an alternative design. Celebrate the Sisyphean every-day-is-the-same blessing of motherhood with confidence as these mugs are dishwasher and microwave safe, and they are available in both 11oz and 15oz sizes.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like any big industry, the automotive business has several dumpsters filled with products and ideas that should have remained conceptual. From modern climate controls buried within successive infotainment menus that neither Lawrence of Arabia nor Columbo could find to the old and unlamented Chrysler TC by Maserati with its atrocious build quality and a terrible cylinder head (the Maserati part), the collective car circus has spawned no shortage of bad ideas.</p>
<p>However, there are a few good ideas buried under the weight of poor execution, lousy technology, dreadful marketing, steep pricing, or just merely something being ahead of its time. Several of these morsels deserved a better launch and a second chance. One of them is four-wheel steering.</p>
<h2>Four-wheel steering, in concept</h2>
<p>The idea of steering a two-axle vehicle's front and rear wheels isn't new. Very early American 4x4 trucks from the dawn of the 20th century sported four-wheel-steering systems (4WS), including the Cotta Cottamobile, the American ¾-ton to 10-ton trucks, and Jeffery/Nash Quad Lorry 3-ton trucks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/a-brief-history-of-four-wheel-steering/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"A threshold has been reached. We are effectively being DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time," wrote Daniel Stenberg, original author and lead of <a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html">the curl project</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielstenberg_hackerone-curl-activity-7324820893862363136-glb1/?rcm=ACoAABvgIC0Bx1xUu-E97QUzl6wtDuTtUHlFX7g">on LinkedIn this week</a>.</p>
<p>Curl (cURL in some realms), which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/curl-the-omnipresent-data-tool-is-getting-a-25th-birthday-party-this-month/">turned 25 years old in 2023</a>, is an essential command-line tool and library for interacting with Internet resources. The open source project receives bug reports and security issues through many channels, including HackerOne, a reporting service that helps companies manage vulnerability reporting and bug bounties. HackerOne has fervently taken to AI tools in recent years. "One platform, dual force: Human minds + AI power," <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">the firm's home page reads</a>.</p>
<p>Stenberg, saying that he's "had it" and is "putting my foot down on this craziness," suggested that every suspected AI-generated HackerOne report will have its reporter asked to verify if they used AI to find the problem or generate the submission. If a report is deemed "AI slop," the reporter will be banned. "We still have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help," Stenberg wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/open-source-project-curl-is-sick-of-users-submitting-ai-slop-vulnerabilities/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">China has finally agreed to open negotiations with the Trump administration as the tech industry warns that tariffs could soon spike Americans' costs for the 10 most popular consumer technology products by more than $123 billion annually.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Chinese Embassy in the US <a href="https://x.com/ChineseEmbinUS/status/1919909430939865300">announced</a> on X (formerly Twitter) that "China’s lead on China-US economic and trade affairs," He Lifeng, will meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent from May 9 to 12 to open talks. For those talks to go smoothly, China's Ministry of Commerce <a href="https://newsus.cgtn.com/news/2025-05-07/China-s-Ministry-of-Commerce-answers-question-on-China-U-S-talks-1DaEhZ1FxcI/p.html">told </a><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://newsus.cgtn.com/news/2025-05-07/China-s-Ministry-of-Commerce-answers-question-on-China-U-S-talks-1DaEhZ1FxcI/p.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporters </a>Wednesday</span>, the US must "demonstrate sincerity" and come ready to "correct its wrongdoings," including facing "the severe negative impacts of its unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, China had demanded that President Trump drop all tariffs to begin negotiations, which Trump refused while seemingly holding out on making a deal on TikTok to keep the potential bargaining chip.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/trump-tariffs-could-make-americans-pay-123b-more-annually-for-10-common-gadgets/">Read full article</a></p>

      We have our first teaser for the upcoming third season of <em>Foundation</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>It's been nearly two years, but the third season of <em>Foundation,</em> Apple TV+'s epic adaptation (or remix) of the Isaac Asimov series, is almost here. The streaming platform released an action-packed teaser of what we can expect from the new ten-episode season: the onset of the Third Crisis, a galactic war, and a shirtless Lee Pace.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for first two seasons below.)</strong></p>
<p>Showrunner David S. Goyer took great pains in S1 to carefully set up his expansive fictional world, and the scope only broadened in the second season. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/lee-paces-brother-day-is-front-and-center-in-first-teaser-for-foundation-s2/" data-uri="dc75a67acce22551ebce8beabf3198b4">previously reported</a>, Asimov's fundamental narrative arc remains intact, with the series taking place across multiple planets over 1,000 years and featuring a huge cast of characters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/the-third-crisis-dawns-in-foundation-s3-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Price rises are coming to some Mexican-made Ford vehicles this summer as a result of President Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/">decision to launch</a> an international trade war. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-hikes-prices-mexico-produced-models-citing-tariffs-2025-05-07/">According to Reuters</a>, which saw a memo that Ford sent to dealers, the price increase will affect the Mustang Mach-E electric crossover, the Bronco Sport crossover, and the Maverick pickup truck, which cost as much as an extra $2,000.</p>
<p>The Trump auto tariffs went into effect at the beginning of April, adding a 25 percent charge to any imported vehicle. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/trump-on-car-tariffs-i-couldnt-care-less-if-they-raise-prices/">When challenged</a> on the fact that this would cause significant price rises for US consumers, Trump told NBC that he "couldn't care less if they raise prices." And now that's happening.</p>
<p>Ford told Ars that the price increases are part of its "usual mid-year pricing actions combined with tariffs we are facing" and that the price bumps do not cover the full costs of the tariff. Additionally, the move only affects vehicles that have been imported since May 2, which should only appear in dealerships in late June—any cars already in inventory are not subject to the price rise.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/ford-says-price-rises-on-mexican-made-cars-dont-cover-the-cost-of-tariffs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>VIENNA—Scientists at the European Geosciences Union conference last week said there is growing scientific evidence that global warming is driving a big increase in dangerous clear-air turbulence, which is invisible from the cockpit and can surprise pilots and damage aircraft.</p>
<p>Along some busy flight routes, turbulence is projected to “double or treble or quadruple over the next few decades,” said <a href="https://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~williams/">Paul Williams</a>, a professor of atmospheric science and head of the weather research division at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. “What we find … is that the jet stream regions in both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres are affected.”</p>
<p>As its name implies, clear-air turbulence can happen when there are no visible signs of a weather disturbance, often at or near the boundary of contrasting air masses, moving in different directions and at varying speeds. It can unexpectedly toss large airplanes up and down by several hundred feet, potentially damaging the airframe and injuring passengers and crew.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/dangerous-clear-air-turbulence-is-worsening-due-to-global-warming/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A jury has awarded WhatsApp $167 million in punitive damages in a case the company brought against Israel-based NSO Group for exploiting a software vulnerability that hijacked the phones of thousands of users.</p>
<p>The verdict, reached Tuesday, comes as a major victory not just for Meta-owned WhatsApp but also for privacy- and security-rights advocates who have long criticized the practices of NSO and other exploit sellers. The jury also awarded WhatsApp $444 million in compensatory damages.</p>
<h2>Clickless exploit</h2>
<p>WhatsApp sued NSO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">in 2019</a> for an attack that targeted roughly 1,400 mobile phones belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials. NSO, which works on behalf of governments and law enforcement authorities in various countries, exploited a critical WhatsApp vulnerability that allowed it to install NSO’s proprietary spyware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/found-quite-possibly-the-most-sophisticated-android-espionage-app-ever/">Pegasus</a> on iOS and Android devices. The clickless exploit worked by placing a call to a target's app. A target did not have to answer the call to be infected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/jury-orders-nso-to-pay-167-million-for-hacking-whatsapp-users/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump is demanding the release of Tina Peters, a former election official who parroted Trump's 2020 election conspiracy theories and is serving nine years in prison for compromising the security of election equipment.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114457992767716636">post</a> on Truth Social last night, Trump wrote that "Radical Left Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser ignores Illegals committing Violent Crimes like Rape and Murder in his State and, instead, jailed Tina Peters, a 69-year-old Gold Star mother who worked to expose and document Democrat Election Fraud. Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment."</p>
<p>Trump said he is "directing the Department of Justice to take all necessary action to help secure the release of this 'hostage' being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats, for political reasons."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/trump-demands-release-of-county-clerk-imprisoned-for-voting-system-breach/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Although we are still waiting for SpaceX to signal when it will fly the Starship rocket again, the company got some good news from the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After a lengthy review, the federal agency agreed to allow SpaceX to substantially increase the number of annual launches from its Starbase launch site in South Texas. Previously, the company was limited to five launches, but now it will be able to conduct up to 25 Starship launches and landings during a calendar year.</p>
<p>"The FAA has determined that modifying SpaceX’s vehicle operator license supporting the increased launch and landing cadence of the Starship/Super Heavy launch vehicle would not significantly impact the quality of the human environment," states the document, known as a <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/94336">Mitigated Finding of No Significant Impact</a>. This finding was signed by Daniel P. Murray, executive director of the FAA's Office of Operational Safety.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/faa-clears-spacex-for-25-launches-a-year-from-its-texas-launch-site/">Read full article</a></p>
