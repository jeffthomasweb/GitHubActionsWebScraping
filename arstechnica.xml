<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/judge-tosses-big-pharma-suit-claiming-drug-price-negotiation-is-unconstitutional/">a series of decisive court losses</a>, the pharmaceutical industry appears to be taking its fight against Medicare drug price negotiations directly to the people—and the White House is not impressed.</p>
<p>This week, the high-powered industry group PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America) released two eye-catching attacks on federal efforts to lower America's singularly astronomical drug prices. In <a href="https://phrma.org/resource-center/Topics/Access-to-Medicines/New-Analysis-The-IRA-Could-Lead-to-Higher-Out-of-Pocket-Costs-for-3-point-5-Million-Medicare-Patients">a press release Tuesday</a>, PhRMA announced an analysis suggesting that the Medicare drug price negotiations—part of the Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act—could actually cost some seniors and people with disabilities slightly more in out-of-pocket costs. <a href="https://www.milliman.com/en/insight/ira-mdpnp-impact-on-beneficiary-oop">The analysis</a>, however, relies on a key—and questionable—assumption that the federal government will set price limits using the highest possible estimate for maximum fair prices in 2026.</p>
<p>Milliman, the consulting firm PhRMA commissioned to do the study, cautioned that the actual prices "will certainly vary due to differences in unit cost and utilization trend, 2026 benefit designs, and actual 2026 maximum fair prices."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034140#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034140&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, a slim majority of the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23a349_0813.pdf">issued an emergency ruling</a> that places a stay on rules developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, meant to limit the spread of ozone-generating pollutants across state lines. Because it was handled on an emergency basis, the decision was made without any evidence gathered during lower court proceedings. As a result, the justices don't even agree on the nature of the regulations the EPA has proposed, leading to a blistering dissent from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was joined by the court's three liberal justices.</p>
<h2>Bad neighbors</h2>
<p>The rule at issue arose from the EPA's regular process of revisiting existing limits in light of changes in public health information and pollution-control technology. In this case, the focus was on ozone-producing chemicals; in 2015, the EPA chose to lower the limit on ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion.</p>
<p>Once these standards are set, states are required to submit plans that fulfill two purposes. One is to limit pollution within the state itself; the second involves pollution controls that will limit the exposure in states that are downwind of the pollution sources. The EPA is required to evaluate these plans; if they are deemed insufficient, the EPA can require the states to follow a federal plan devised by the EPA.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034143#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034143&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, OpenAI researchers unveiled <a href="https://openai.com/index/finding-gpt4s-mistakes-with-gpt-4/">CriticGPT</a>, a new AI model designed to identify mistakes in code generated by ChatGPT. It aims to enhance the process of making AI systems behave in ways humans want (called "alignment") through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback">Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</a> (RLHF), which helps human reviewers make large language model (LLM) outputs more accurate.</p>

<p>As outlined in a new research paper called "<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/llm-critics-help-catch-llm-bugs-paper.pdf">LLM Critics Help Catch LLM Bugs</a>," OpenAI created CriticGPT to act as an AI assistant to human trainers who review programming code generated by the ChatGPT AI assistant. CriticGPT—based on the GPT-4 family of LLMS—analyzes the code and points out potential errors, making it easier for humans to spot mistakes that might otherwise go unnoticed. The researchers trained CriticGPT on a dataset of code samples with intentionally inserted bugs, teaching it to recognize and flag various coding errors.</p>
<div class="font-claude-message pr-4 md:pr-9 relative leading-[1.65rem] [&amp;_pre&gt;div]:bg-bg-300 [&amp;_pre]:-mr-4 md:[&amp;_pre]:-mr-9">
<div>
<div class="grid-col-1 grid gap-2.5 [&amp;_&gt;_*]:min-w-0">
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The researchers found that CriticGPT's critiques were preferred by annotators over human critiques in 63 percent of cases involving naturally occurring LLM errors and that human-machine teams using CriticGPT wrote more comprehensive critiques than humans alone while reducing confabulation (hallucination) rates compared to AI-only critiques.</p>
<h2>Developing an automated critic</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The development of CriticGPT involved training the model on a large number of inputs containing deliberately inserted mistakes. Human trainers were asked to modify code written by ChatGPT, introducing errors and then providing example feedback as if they had discovered these bugs. This process allowed the model to learn how to identify and critique various types of coding errors.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034089#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034089&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mac malware that steals passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive data has been spotted circulating through Google ads, making it at least the second time in as many months the widely used ad platform has been abused to infect web surfers.</p>
<p>The latest ads, found by security firm Malwarebytes on Monday, promote Mac versions of Arc, an unconventional browser that became generally available for the macOS platform <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/the-browsing-companys-unconventional-browser-arc-releases-publicly-on-mac/">last July</a>. The listing promises users a “calmer, more personal” experience that includes less clutter and distractions, a marketing message that mimics the one communicated by The Browser Company, the startup maker of Arc.</p>

<p>Griffin cited research and media reports exposing Temu's allegedly nefarious design, which "purposely" allows Temu to "gain unrestricted access to a user's phone operating system, including, but not limited to, a user's camera, specific location, contacts, text messages, documents, and other applications."</p>
<p>"Temu is designed to make this expansive access undetected, even by sophisticated users," Griffin's complaint said. "Once installed, Temu can recompile itself and change properties, including overriding the data privacy settings users believe they have in place."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034055#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034055&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2017, Kathleen Odean thought she had found the last cell phone plan she would ever need. T-Mobile was offering a mobile service for people age 55 and over, with an "Un-contract" guarantee that it would never raise prices.</p>
<p>"I thought, wow, I can live out my days with this fixed plan," Odean, a Rhode Island resident who is now 70 years old, told Ars last week. Odean and her husband switched from Verizon to get the T-Mobile deal, which cost $60 a month for two lines.</p>
<p>Despite its Un-contract promise, T-Mobile in May 2024 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/">announced</a> a price hike for customers like Odean who thought they had a lifetime price guarantee on plans such as T-Mobile One, Magenta, and Simple Choice. The $5-per-line price hike will raise her and her husband's monthly bill from $60 to $70, Odean said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033962#p3">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033962&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA has awarded an $843 million contract to SpaceX to develop a "US Deorbit Vehicle." This spacecraft will dock to the International Space Station in 2029 and then ensure the large facility makes a controlled reentry through Earth's atmosphere before splashing into the ocean in 2030.</p>
<p>"Selecting a US Deorbit Vehicle for the International Space Station will help NASA and its international partners ensure a safe and responsible transition in low Earth orbit at the end of station operations," said Ken Bowersox, NASA's associate administrator for Space Operations, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-international-space-station-us-deorbit-vehicle/">in a statement</a>. "This decision also supports NASA’s plans for future commercial destinations and allows for the continued use of space near Earth."</p>
<p>NASA has a couple of reasons for bringing the space station's life to a close in 2030. Foremost among these is that the station is aging. Parts of it are now a quarter of a century old. There are cracks on the Russian segment of the space station <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/on-the-space-station-band-aid-fixes-for-systemic-problems/">that are spreading</a>. Although the station could likely be maintained beyond 2030, it would require increasing amounts of crew time to keep flying the station safely.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033868#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033868&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In a 5-4 ruling, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-124_8nk0.pdf">the US Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an opioid settlement plan worth billions</a> over the deal's stipulation that the billionaire Sackler family would get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/billionaire-sacklers-granted-lifetime-legal-immunity-in-opioid-settlement/">lifetime immunity from further opioid-related litigation</a>.</p>
<p>While the ruling may offer long-sought schadenfreude over the deeply despised Sackler family, it is a heavy blow to the over 100,000 people affected by opioid epidemic who could have seen compensation from the deal. With the high court's ruling, the settlement talks will have to begin again, with the outcome and possible payouts to plaintiffs uncertain.</p>
<p>Between 1999 and 2019, as nearly 250,000 Americans died from prescription opioid overdoses, members of the Sackler family siphoned approximately $11 billion from the pharmaceutical company they ran, Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, a highly addictive and falsely marketed pain medication. In 2007, amid the nationwide epidemic of opioid addiction and overdoses, Purdue affiliates pleaded guilty in federal court to falsely branding OxyContin as less addictive and less abusive than other pain medications. Out of fear of future litigation, the Sacklers began a "milking program," the high court noted, draining Purdue of roughly 75 percent of its assets.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034031#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034031&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Earlier this week, Apple published a whitepaper titled "<a href="https://support.apple.com/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/otherassets/programs/Longevity_by_Design.pdf">Longevity by Design</a>." The purpose, <a href="https://nr.apple.com/dg2u2Q6Po9">Apple says</a>, is to explain "the company's principles for designing for longevity—a careful balance between product durability and repairability." It also contains some notable changes to Apple's parts pairing and repair technology.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the action items in the document's 24 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The self-service diagnostics tool that arrived in the US last year is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-expands-self-service-repair-diagnostics-support-to-europe/">now available in 32 European countries</a>.</li>
<li>True Tone, the color-balancing screen feature, can soon be activated on third-party screens, "to the best performance that can be provided."</li>
<li>Battery statistics, like maximum capacity and cycle count, will be available "later in 2024" for third-party batteries, with a notice that "Apple cannot verify the information presented."</li>
<li>Used Apple parts, transferred from one to another, will be "as easy to use as new Apple parts" in select products "later this year."</li>
<li>Parts for "most repairs" from Apple's Self Service Repair program will no longer require a device serial number to order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes timed to "later this year" may well indicate their arrival with iOS 18 or a subsequent update.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033873#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033873&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">Repetitive stress injuries</a> are a common feature of modern life, especially for office workers who spend a good chunk of their working days at a desk typing on a computer. Apparently, scribes in ancient Egypt suffered from their own distinctive repetitive stress injuries, according to a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports that provides fresh insights into how these scribes lived and worked during the third millennium BCE.</p>
<p>Egyptian kings, royal family members, and other elite people from this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a> era were buried in tombs in the acropolis at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abusir">Abusir</a> rather than at neighboring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza">Giza</a>, which by then had largely filled up thanks to all the activity during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Dynasty_of_Egypt">Fourth Dynasty</a>. The Czech Institute of Egyptology at Charles University in Prague has been conducting research at the site since 1960, leading to the discovery of nearly 200 tombs dating back to the Old Kingdom (between 2700 and 2180 BCE). The first human skeletons were excavated in 1976, and there are currently 221 Old Kingdom skeletons in the collection, 102 of which are male.</p>
<p>Scientists started looking into the health status and markers for specific activities in 2009, but it wasn't until quite recently that there were enough skeletons to conduct a comprehensive study. That's what Petra Brukner Havelková of Charles University and the National Museum in Prague, Czech Republic, and colleagues set out to do, analyzing the remains of 69 adult males of different social status and different ages at which they died.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033600#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033600&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Their feet left copious traces in muddy Permian floodplains, leaving tracks scattered across ancient sediments. But in one slab of such trackways, scientists uncovered something more: the trace of an animal’s tail as it dragged across the ground. Strikingly, these tail prints come complete with scale impressions—at 300 million years old, they’re among the earliest scale impressions we have.</p>
<p>This may seem small, but it shows us that some of the hardened skin structures necessary for our ancestors to survive on land had evolved much earlier than previously suspected. A <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2024.0041">paper</a> published in Biology Letters this past May describes this discovery in detail.</p>
<h2>A rare find</h2>
<p>The particular slab holding these traces was discovered in 2020 at the Piaskowiec Czerwony quarry in Poland. Mining had stopped to enable paleontologists to search the red sandstone rocks for fossils. Gabriela Calábková described climbing upon “a huge pile of rubble” only to discover a sizable slab of fossil tracks at the very top. There, among one set of footprints, was something new.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033803#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033803&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last December, a joint <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/48112-increasing-numbers-of-americans-say-antisemitism-is-a-serious-problem">survey</a> by The Economist and the polling organization YouGov claimed to reveal a striking antisemitic streak among America’s youth. One in five young Americans thinks the Holocaust is a myth, according to the poll. And 28 percent think Jews in America have too much power.</p>
<p>“Our new poll makes alarming reading,” <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/07/one-in-five-young-americans-thinks-the-holocaust-is-a-myth">declared</a> The Economist. The results inflamed discourse over the Israel-Hamas war on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/18e3ai0/1_out_of_5_young_people_1829_now_say_that_the/">social</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1733252866079699377">media</a> and made international news.</p>
<p>There was one problem: The survey was almost certainly wrong. The Economist/YouGov poll was a so-called opt-in poll, in which pollsters often pay people they've recruited online to take surveys. According to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/05/online-opt-in-polls-can-produce-misleading-results-especially-for-young-people-and-hispanic-adults/">analysis</a> from the nonprofit Pew Research Center, such polls are plagued by “bogus respondents” who answer questions disingenuously for fun, or to get through the survey as quickly as possible to earn their reward.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033909#p3">Read 47 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033909&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The second flight of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket will take off in September with a dummy payload in place of Sierra Space's Dream Chaser spaceplane, preserving a chance for ULA to begin launching US military satellites on the new rocket by the end of the year, officials announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tory Bruno, ULA's CEO, announced the change in flight plan for the second Vulcan rocket in a conference call with reporters. There was little hope Sierra Space's Dream Chaser would be ready to make its first resupply run to the International Space Station before the end of the summer.</p>
<p>Dream Chaser had been booked to launch on the second test flight of ULA's Vulcan rocket for the last five years. With the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/ulas-vulcan-rocket-shot-for-the-moon-on-debut-launch-and-hit-a-bullseye/">near-flawless inaugural flight of Vulcan in January</a> and a successful second flight later this year, ULA's Vulcan will be certified by the US Space Force to loft the military's most sensitive national security satellites into orbit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033825#p3">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033825&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A critical vulnerability recently discovered in a widely used piece of software is putting huge swaths of the Internet at risk of devastating hacks, and attackers have already begun actively trying to exploit it in real-world attacks, researchers warn.</p>
<p>The software, known as MOVEit and sold by Progress Software, allows enterprises to transfer and manage files using various specifications, including SFTP, SCP, and HTTP protocols and in ways that comply with regulations mandated under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPAA</a>. At the time this post went live, Internet scans <a href="https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/iot-devices/time-series/?date_range=7&amp;vendor=progress&amp;model=moveit&amp;dataset=count&amp;limit=1000&amp;group_by=geo&amp;style=stacked">indicated</a> it was installed inside almost 1,800 networks around the world, with the biggest number in the US. A separate scan performed Tuesday by security firm Censys <a href="https://censys.com/moveit-transfer-auth-bypass/">found</a> 2,700 such instances.</p>
<h2>Causing mayhem with a null string</h2>
<p>Last year, a critical MOVEit vulnerability led to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/mass-exploitation-of-critical-moveit-flaw-is-ransacking-orgs-big-and-small/">compromise of more than 2,300 organizations</a>, including Shell, British Airways, the US Department of Energy, and Ontario’s government birth registry, BORN Ontario, the latter of which led to the compromise of information for 3.4 million people.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033848#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033848&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft's mid-generation plans for the Xbox Series S and X consoles looked a whole lot different a couple of years ago than it does now. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/ftc-v-microsoft-document-leak-outs-detailed-plans-for-mid-gen-xbox-refresh/">A leaked slide deck from the <em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> case last year</a> outlined detailed plans for a spruced up Series S, an overhauled Series X, and even a redesigned controller. Another part of that roadmap included a streaming-only version of the Xbox, codenamed Keystone, that was designed to connect to Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming servers rather than rendering games locally.</p>

<p>Microsoft has talked openly about this version of the Xbox before. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23460485/microsoft-xbox-streaming-console-keystone-delay-price">told The Verge</a> that the Keystone console was designed and fully functional, but that it wasn't launched because Microsoft had a hard time getting the price down low enough that it made sense next to the $299 Series S (which already occasionally goes on sale in the $200 to $250 range).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033759#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033759&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has identified a synthetic psychedelic compound as well as compounds from a potentially toxic plant in the Diamond Shruumz-brand microdosing candies linked to a growing number of severe illnesses nationwide that have included seizures, intubation, and admissions to intensive care units.</p>
<p>As of June 25, the case total has grown to 39, including 23 hospitalizations, across 20 states, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">the FDA</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/environmental-health-studies/outbreak-investigation-diamond-shruumz-products/index.html#cdc_generic_section_1-outbreak-investigation-summary">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> reported.</p>
<p>It remains unclear what is in the candies and what may be causing the severe illnesses. Diamond Shruumz does not provide a full list of ingredients. The term "microdosing" and other marketing used by Diamond Shruumz suggests the candies contain a psychedelic compound, but the company does not name any. To figure it out, the FDA has been analyzing multiple samples of Diamond Shruumz-brand candies, including chocolates, gummies, and candy cones. On Tuesday, the FDA reported finding the synthetic psychedelic compound 4-AcO-DMT in the company's Dark Chocolate Bar and its Birthday Cake Chocolate Bar.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033774#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033774&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While CRISPR is probably the most prominent gene-editing technology, there are others, some developed before and since. And people have been developing CRISPR variants to perform more specialized functions, like altering specific bases. In all of these cases, researchers are trying to balance a number of competing factors: convenience, flexibility, specificity and precision for the editing, low error rates, and so on.</p>
<p>So, having additional options for editing can be a good thing, enabling new ways of balancing those different needs. On Wednesday, a pair of papers in Nature describe a DNA-based parasite that moves itself around bacterial genomes through a mechanism that hasn't been previously described. It's nowhere near ready for use in humans, but it may have some distinctive features that make it worth further development.</p>
<h2>Going mobile</h2>
<p>Mobile genetic elements, commonly called transposons, are quite common in many species—they make up nearly half the sequences in the human genome, for example. They are indeed mobile, showing up in new locations throughout the genome, sometimes by cutting themselves out and hopping to new locations, other times by sending a copy out to a new place in the genome. For any of this to work, they need to have an enzyme that cuts DNA and specifically recognizes the right transposon sequence to insert into the cut.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033770#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033770&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court tossed out claims that the Biden administration coerced social media platforms into censoring users by removing COVID-19 and election-related content.</p>
<p>Complaints alleging that high-ranking government officials were censoring conservatives had previously convinced a lower court to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/judge-rules-white-house-pressured-social-networks-to-suppress-free-speech/">order an injunction limiting the Biden administration's contacts with platforms</a>. But now that injunction has been overturned, re-opening lines of communication just ahead of the 2024 elections—when officials will once again be closely monitoring the spread of misinformation online targeted at voters.</p>
<p>In a 6–3 vote, the majority ruled that none of the plaintiffs suing—including five social media users and Republican attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri—had standing. They had alleged that the government had "pressured the platforms to censor their speech in violation of the First Amendment," demanding an injunction to stop any future censorship.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033738#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033738&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
