                            <![CDATA[<p>For the last three months or so, I've been learning to use (and love) a Bambu Labs A1 3D printer, a big, loud machine that sits on my desk and turns pictures on my computer screen into real-world objects.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-my-first-few-months-with-a-bambu-lab-a1-3d-printer-part-1/">the first part</a> of my series about diving into the wild world of 3D printers, I covered what I'd learned about the different types of 3D printers, some useful settings in the Bambu Studio app (which should also be broadly useful to know about no matter what printer you use), and some initial, magical-feeling successes in downloading files that I turned into useful physical items using a few feet of plastic filament and a couple hours of time.</p>
<p>For this second part, I'm focusing on what I learned when I embarked on my first major project—printing upgrade parts for the A1 <em>with </em>the A1. It was here that I made some of my first big 3D printing mistakes, mistakes that prompted me to read up on the different kinds of 3D printer filament, what each type of filament is good for, and which types the A1 is (and is not) good at handling as an un-enclosed, bed-slinging printer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-a-bambu-labs-a1-3d-printer-part-2-upgrades-and-mistakes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX made some progress on another test flight of the world's most powerful rocket Tuesday, finally overcoming technical problems that plagued the program's two previous launches.</p>
<p>But minutes into the mission, SpaceX's Starship lost control as it cruised through space, then tumbled back into the atmosphere somewhere over the Indian Ocean nearly an hour after taking off from Starbase, Texas, the company's privately-owned spaceport near the US-Mexico border.</p>
<p>SpaceX's next-generation rocket is designed to eventually ferry cargo and private and government crews between the Earth, the Moon, and Mars. The rocket is complex and gargantuan, wider and longer than a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, and after nearly two years of steady progress since its first test flight in 2023, this has been a year of setbacks for Starship.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/spacex-may-have-solved-one-problem-only-to-find-more-on-latest-starship-flight/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In recent weeks, Musk has dialed back his focus on politics and said he wants to devote the majority of his time to SpaceX and his other companies. So what does that mean?</p>
<p>The conversation came just ahead of the opening of Starship's launch window, at 6:30 pm CT (23:30 UTC) in South Texas.

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, independent AI researcher <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/join-ars-live-nov-19-to-dissect-microsofts-rogue-ai-experiment/">Simon Willison</a> published a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/">detailed analysis</a> of Anthropic's newly released system prompts for Claude 4's Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 models, offering insights into how Anthropic controls the models' "behavior" through their outputs. Willison examined both the published prompts and leaked internal tool instructions to reveal what he calls "a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools."</p>
<p>To understand what Willison is talking about, we'll need to explain what system prompts are. Large language models (LLMs) like the AI models that run Claude and ChatGPT process an input called a "prompt" and return an output that is the most likely continuation of that prompt. System prompts are instructions that AI companies feed to the models before each conversation to establish how they should respond.</p>
<p>Unlike the messages users see from the chatbot, system prompts typically remain hidden from the user and tell the model its identity, behavioral guidelines, and specific rules to follow. Each time a user sends a message, the AI model receives the full conversation history along with the system prompt, allowing it to maintain context while following its instructions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/hidden-ai-instructions-reveal-how-anthropic-controls-claude-4/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Currently, there are no nuclear power plants scheduled for construction in the US. Everybody with plans to build one hasn't had a reactor design approved, while nobody is planning to use any of the approved designs. This follows a period in which only three new reactors have entered service since 1990. Despite its extremely low carbon footprint, nuclear power appears to be dead in the water.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders intended to revive the US nuclear industry. These include plans to streamline the reactor approval process and boost the construction of experimental reactors by the Department of Energy. But they also contain language that's inconsistent with other administration priorities and fundamentally misunderstands the use of nuclear power. Plus, some timelines might be, shall we say, unrealistic: three new experimental reactors reaching criticality in just over a year.</p>
<h2>Slow nukes</h2>
<p>The heyday of nuclear plant construction in the US was in the 1970s and 80s. But the 1979 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident">partial meltdown</a> at the Three Mile Island plant soured public sentiment toward nuclear power. This also came at a time when nuclear plants typically generated <a href="https://nuclear.duke-energy.com/2021/05/18/capacity-factor-it-s-a-measure-of-reliability">only half of their rated capacity</a>, making them an expensive long-term bet. As a result, plans for many plants, including some that were partially constructed, were canceled.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trump-signs-executive-orders-meant-to-resurrect-us-nuclear-power/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>National Public Radio sued President Trump and his administration today over Trump's move to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/blatantly-unlawful-trump-slammed-for-trying-to-defund-pbs-npr/">block funding</a> for public broadcasting. NPR said Trump acted illegally, and that losing federal funding could force it to shut newsrooms and dramatically scale back news coverage.</p>
<p>On May 1, Trump issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ending-taxpayer-subsidization-of-biased-media/">executive order</a> titled, "Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media," in which he ordered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and all US agencies to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS. The White House had previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/white-house-aims-to-defund-npr-and-pbs-in-move-slammed-as-cultural-sabotage/">alleged</a> that NPR and PBS "spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'"</p>
<p>NPR's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.280953/gov.uscourts.dcd.280953.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> in US District Court for the District of Columbia asked the court to declare Trump's executive order and all actions to implement it unconstitutional. NPR's lawsuit said that Trump "has no authority under the Constitution to take such action. On the contrary, the power of the purse is reserved to Congress, and the President has no inherent authority to override Congress's will on domestic spending decisions. By unilaterally imposing restrictions and conditions on funds in contravention of Congress, the Order violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause of the Constitution."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/npr-sues-trump-over-blocked-funding-says-it-may-have-to-shutter-newsrooms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Police have arrested a third suspect linked to one of the most extreme bitcoin-related kidnapping and torture cases in the United States, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/nyregion/crypto-investor-torture-arrest.html">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The arrest came after an Italian man, Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, escaped a luxury Manhattan townhouse after three weeks of alleged imprisonment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Running to a traffic agent for help, he later told police that he was tortured by colleagues for his bitcoin password, "bound with electrical cords and whipped with a gun," his feet submerged in water while a Taser gun sent jolts through his body, the NYT reported. At times he feared for his life—allegedly once held suspended from the ledge of the fifth-story building—but he seemingly never gave up his password, a resistance that only prompted more extreme violence.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/third-suspect-arrested-after-man-was-kidnapped-and-tortured-for-bitcoin/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">For millions of music fans, the most controversial app ban of the past year was not the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/after-chaotic-weekend-tiktok-remains-in-limbo/">brief TikTok outage </a>but the ongoing delisting of Musi from Apple's App Store.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Those users are holding out hope that Musi can defeat Apple in court and soon be reinstated. However, rather than coming to any sort of resolution, that court fight has intensified over the past month, with both sides now seeking sanctions, TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/musi-alleges-apples-app-store-removal-was-orchestrated-seeks-sanctions/">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Musi is a free app that lets users stream music from YouTube without interruptions, only playing ads when the app is initially opened. It was removed from the App Store in September 2024 after a YouTube complaint, but it maintains a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/fans-mourn-loss-of-music-streaming-app-accused-of-ripping-off-youtube/">deeply loyal fan base</a> who swear it's better than alternatives like Spotify. Those fans who still have the app installed on their iPhones can continue to use the service, but if they lose access to the app (by updating their phones) or are first-time users, it is currently unavailable for download, to the dismay of many fans who complain daily <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Musi_App/">on Reddit</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/musi-strikes-back-defending-claim-apple-conspired-with-youtube-music-industry/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Season 2 of HBO's <em>The Last of Us</em> wrapped up on Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">are back to talk about the finale like they've talked about every other episode this season</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Coming back from last week's Joel flashback, it took me a second to remember what was actually going on in "The Present" of <em>The Last of Us</em> as we enter the season 2 finale. Ellie marvels at how easy it was to torture a hated enemy even though the result was just two words indicating Abby's supposed location: "whale" and "wheel."</p>
<p>I don't think Ellie's turn to "the dark side" is unearned, exactly. But I do think that this single-minded, revenge-obsessed version of Ellie is a lot less interesting than the character we grew to love in season 1. We went into this season in a sort of adolescent family drama, and we are leaving it in post-apocalyptic <em>Breaking Bad</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: To compare it to <em>Breaking Bad</em> implies some kind of gradual, nuanced transformation has taken place, where my problem with the season so far has been mostly the opposite thing. Everyone's motivations here make sense and are consistent, to some extent, with who we know these characters to be. Ellie is rash and impulsive; Dina is lovestruck; Jesse is loyal and selfless.</p>
<p>It's just that trading the first season's story (an unlikely pairing navigates the breadth of a post-apocalyptic America, driven by the promise of a cure) for the second season's story (Ellie's revenge fantasy) is a huge downgrade! And I say this as someone who has been slightly warmer on the season overall than you have. They killed the most interesting character and, with him, the story's most interesting dynamic. Whatever followed that was probably always going to be a letdown, and I'm sure you can attest to that as a game-player who has already experienced a version of all of this.</p>

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yes, I soured on the second game for pretty much the same reasons. But I also feel the show has been more artlessly blunt with some of its character moments. Like the way Jesse finds out about Dina's pregnancy, and then similarly declares that he "can't die" because he's going to be a father. It felt like an AI trained on the TV Tropes website was writing some of these scenes...</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Listen, normally I'm all for blaming AI, but to blame AI for this one is to imply that lowest-common-denominator TV storytelling hasn't existed for as long as the medium has. Everyone is just performing the most-predictable version of their respective character archetypes. It's an expensive show with a talented cast and an interesting riff on the zombie apocalypse idea, so at a baseline it remains watchable. But I suppose that's damning with faint praise.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah I didn't mean a literal AI. I meant that as a sick burn on the human writers.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I am trying to think of things to say to stop this from just being a litany of complaints, but unfortunately complaints are a lot of what I've got about this episode. I liked the visuals of Ellie's nighttime sojourn to the abandoned Ferris wheel. I feel like there is a slightly more interesting TV show happening off to the side of this one, about the conflict between the militarized WLF types and the cultists. But as far as Ellie has been concerned so far, these factions mostly exist to chase the other faction off at the last minute, saving Ellie's bacon again.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: And to set up contrived philosophical discussions. Like when Jesse makes the perfectly reasonable decision not to mount a doomed attempt to save a cultist when they're outnumbered by WLF members. Then, later, Ellie twists that into Jesse chickening out because the guy "wasn't a member of your community." No... I'm pretty sure the 6-to-2 odds had at least as much to do with it. But Ellie needs to turn the conversation back to how Joel represents "my community... beaten to death." It's not subtle...</p>

      Ellie's single-minded quest for revenge this season has been less compelling than the first season's unlikely buddy story.

<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah I found that moment frustrating because Ellie is here in direct contravention of what her community decided! And it <em>is</em> her community, as a group of people who have looked out for her and provided for her for years, whether she wants to admit that or not. She only uses this idea of "community" with Joel selectively, as a cudgel, so she can do what she already wants to do.</p>
<p>By letting her have the last word on it, the show tacitly endorses her read of the situation, and it's a variety of vigilante justice that TV audiences have been primed to sympathize with, but man it just falls flat for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I was also perplexed by Ellie's brief shipwreck storyline, which led to her being put in a noose by angry cultists. Then she gets saved just seconds from death by a deus ex machina problem in "The Village" that requires the cultists to immediately put her execution on hold and run away. And after all that she just... hops in a boat and goes off to the next completely unrelated bit of the story.</p>
<p>I suppose they're probably setting things up to provide more context for that scene in the next season, but in the context of this episode as it stands it was just a baffling way to use up 10 minutes or so.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yes I am assuming all the time spent setting up these cultists is going to pay off somehow, eventually, but it hasn't happened yet.</p>
<p>The episode's other Big Emotional Moment comes when Ellie catches up with a couple of members of Abby's crew (I imagine a Hells Angels-style leather jacket, emblazoned with ABBY'S CREW on the back) and ends up killing them both, including a heavily pregnant woman whose dying breaths are spent trying to talk Ellie into cutting her baby out of her. There's some kind of lesson here, about the ultimate futility of revenge, about the sins of the parents, about what perpetuating the cycle of violence ultimately gets you. We'll see if Ellie ends up absorbing any of this in the end.</p>
<p>In both her response to the underground torture scene and here, Ellie seems continually shocked that her quest for vengeance might involve any kind of collateral damage to anyone other than Abby.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yes, this bit is culled from the game, but there she just discovers the unborn baby after both of Abby's companions are already dead. The whole "cut my baby out of me before I die" thing was seemingly crafted to make this just that much more emotionally scarring for Ellie. But as you said, she doesn't really get to spend any time absorbing any of that, because we're moving right on to the next plot point.</p>
<p>I understand how and why we don't get to have 23 episode seasons of TV shows anymore, but it feels like some of the 17 side stories they introduce in this episode (and many more throughout this season) could have stood to have some more time to breathe.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I was astounded—astounded! That this was our <em>season finale</em>, because it feels like such a transitional piece-moving episode, and because we're only <em>seven episodes in</em>. I get that we are stretching one game into two seasons here, but the nine-episode first season was already short, and then this one's even shorter. Can we just agree to return to 13-episode seasons, please?</p>
<p>Anyway, if your main complaint about the Seattle section of the show has been "too much wheel spinning," this episode's big, dramatic cliffhanger is bad news for you. Every day Ellie has spent in Seattle has gotten some big <em>Majora's Mask</em>-esque "DAY ONE, DAY TWO, etc" subtitle, and now we know why. The beginning of next season is going to show us the events of these three days—but from Abby's perspective!</p>
<p>I guess I caused this by saying "what if Abby were a more fully formed antagonist" to my monkey's paw at the start of the season. But I can't say that this has me on the edge of my seat about season 3, this little slip of a teaser at the end of an episode that I didn't know was the season finale until after the fact.</p>

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yes, this structure also apes the second game, which switches to Abby's backstory halfway through (though there's no "season break" in the middle there). The dramatic reveal of Abby's community being housed in a football stadium is one of the most memorable moments of the game and was a rare highlight of this episode, I felt.</p>
<p>Before that, though, we get the inevitable and deadly confrontation between Ellie/Jesse/Tommy and Abby. After seeing it in the show, I had to go back and rewatch how it plays out in the game because something just felt off in the translation. Sure enough, the TV show production added Ellie screaming "no no no" and <em>the sound of a gunshot</em> before that dramatic cut to black and transition to Abby's earlier POV.</p>
<p>As usual, it feels like the show has a need to just crank up the drama at every turn in an effort to make sure people tune in next week (or next season).</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Let's return to that divide between me as a show-watcher and you as a game-player as we wrap up.</p>
<p>I find myself with more gripes than praise here at the end of the season. There are still a lot of things I like here—like I said, the fictional universe is compelling enough to keep it watchable, and for all my complaints about Ellie the character, Bella Ramsey as a performer is doing the best work they can with sort of underwhelming material (predictably, some corners of the Internet have decided to harangue Ramsey relentlessly, partly because they're a non-binary person who has decided to exist in public).</p>
<p>But my impression is that my biggest problems with this season, from the killing of Joel to the single-minded vengeance arc, are all downstream of story decisions made years ago during the development of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>. Normally the complaint with an adaptation is that the show or film's creators are ruining the story somehow by being insufficiently faithful to the source material and losing something in the process. But it feels like the show's problems are mostly inherited from the game—in other words, that the show is being <em>too</em> faithful to underwhelming source material. Is this a fair assessment, or am I missing something?</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I'd say that the structural problems of the show are mostly derived from the game's decision to transition from "buddy adventure" to "revenge saga" as we've discussed ad nauseam. But a lot of the nitty-gritty problems of this season—stuff like pacing, flow, character development, etc.—actually come off a little worse because of decisions to add or change things for the show.</p>
<p>After season 1, I was hopeful that some light-touch changes could help redeem a game that I did not enjoy much. Instead, I think they somehow made it worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Oops!</p>
<p>Well, there’s always next season. Maybe all of our complaints will be substantively addressed and then some. The only thing we can say for sure is: We haven’t seen the last of <em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: In the end, the real <em>Last of Us</em> was all the people we killed along the way.</p>

But how do all those launches affect residents living along the Central Coast? People might marvel at the spectacular visual display, but as launch activity at the base has ramped up, so have <a href="https://www.edhat.com/news/central-coast-residents-address-concerns-over-spacex-sonic-booms/#:~:text=During%20the%20meetings%2C%20community%20members,on%20air%20and%20water%20quality.">the noise complaints</a>, particularly about the sonic booms produced by Falcon 9 launches, which can reach as far south as Ventura County. The booms rattle windows, frighten pets, and have raised concerns about threats to the structural integrity of private homes.</p>
<p>There have been rockets launching from Vandenberg for decades, so why are the Falcon 9 launches of such concern? "Because of the Starlink satellites, the orbital mechanics for where they're trying to place these in orbit is bringing [the trajectories] closer to the coast," said Brigham Young University's <a href="https://physics.byu.edu/department/directory/gee">Kent Gee</a>, who described his research into sonic boom effects on neighboring communities in <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084385">a press briefing</a> at <a href="https://acousticalsociety.org/new-orleans-2025/">a meeting</a> of the Acoustical Society of America in New Orleans. And the launches are occurring much more frequently, from two to three launches per year in the 1980s to between five and seven launches each month today. There were 46 Falcon 9 launches out of the Vandenberg base in 2024 alone, per Gee.</p>
<p>Gee joined a project called ECOBOOM (Environmental and Community Observation of Sonic Booms) to study the factors that can impact just how jarring those sonic booms might be, conducted jointly by BYU and California State University, Bakersfield, with cooperation from the Space Force. "Space Force is interested in this because they feel a sense of stewardship," said Gee. "These rockets from SpaceX and other providers are launched from the base for a variety of missions and they want to understand the effects both on and off base, trying to understand how they can complete the mission while minimizing [negative] impacts."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/falcon-9-sonic-booms-can-feel-more-like-seismic-waves/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OnePlus thrives on trends—if other smartphone makers are doing something, you can bet OnePlus is going to have a take. The company recently confirmed it's ditching the storied alert slider in favor of an Apple-like shortcut button called the Plus Key, and that's not the only trend it'll chase with its latest phones. OnePlus has also announced an expanded collection of AI features for translation, photography, screen capture, and more. OnePlus isn't breaking new ground here, but it is cherry-picking some of the more useful AI features we've seen on other phones.</p>
<p>The OnePlus approach covers most of the established AI use cases. There will be AI VoiceScribe, a feature that records and summarizes calls in popular messaging and video chat apps. Similarly, AI Call Assistant will record and summarize phone calls, a bit like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-phones-the-gemini-ai-stuff-reviewed/">Google's Pixel phones</a>. However, these two features are India-only for now.</p>
<p>Globally, OnePlus users will get AI Translation, which pulls together text, voice, camera, and screen translation into a single AI-powered app. AI Search, meanwhile, allows you to search for content on your phone and in OnePlus system apps in a "conversational" way. That suggests to us it's basically another chatbot on your phone, like Motorola's Ask and Search feature, which we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/motorola-razr-and-razr-ultra-2025-review-cool-as-hell-but-too-much-ai/">didn't love</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/oneplus-plans-huge-expansion-of-ai-features-on-its-phones-starting-with-13s/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The principality of Monaco is perhaps the least suitable place on the Formula 1 calendar to hold a Grand Prix. A pirate cove turned tax haven nestled between France and Italy at the foot of the Alps-Maritimes, it has also been home to Grand Prix racing since 1929, predating the actual Formula 1 world championship by two decades. The track is short, tight, and perhaps best described as riding a bicycle around your living room. It doesn’t even race well, for the barrier-lined streets are too narrow for the too-big, too-heavy cars of the 21st century. And yet, it’s F1’s crown jewel.</p>
<p>Despite the location's many drawbacks, there’s something magical about racing in Monaco that almost defies explanation. The real magic happens on Saturday, when the drivers compete against each other to set the fastest lap. With overtaking as difficult as it is here, qualifying is everything, determining the order everyone lines up in, and more than likely, finishes.</p>
<p>Coverage of the Monaco Grand Prix is now filmed in vivid 4K, and it has never looked better. I’m a big fan of the static top-down camera that’s like a real-time Apple TV screensaver.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/f1-in-monaco-no-one-has-ever-gone-faster-than-that/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Egg drop competitions are a staple of high school and college physics classes. The goal is for students to build a device using bubble wrap, straws, or various other materials designed to hold an egg and keep it intact after being dropped from a substantial height—say, 10 meters (nearly 33 feet). There's even a "naked egg" version in which a raw egg is dropped into a container below.  The competition is intended to teach students about structural mechanics and impact physics, and it is not an easy feat; most of the dropped eggs break.</p>
<p>MIT engineering professor Tal Cohen decided to investigate why the failure rate was so high and reported her team's findings in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02087-0">a paper</a> published in the journal Communications Physics. "The universal convention is that the egg should be in a vertical orientation when it hits the ground," <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/100">Cohen told Physics Magazine</a>. But their results from controlled trials simulating the egg drop challenge in the lab calls this conventional wisdom into question.</p>
<p>It is not an unreasonable assumption to make. Another popular physics party trick is to walk on several cartons of eggs without breaking them. Typically it only takes about five and a half pounds of force to crack a single eggshell, much less than the average adult human. As I <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2012/09/whats-the-best-way-to-crack-an-egg-how-physics-can-help-you-when-youre-making-your-next-souffle.html">wrote for Slate</a> back in 2012, "The key is to align the eggs so that the narrow pole is pointing upward, and step in such a way to distribute your weight over the entire surface area, to avoid overloading any one eggshell." (Being barefoot also helps.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/the-key-to-a-successful-egg-drop-experiment-drop-it-on-its-side/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>"The biggest risk is data escape."</p>
<p>Eric Ingebretsen, chief commercial officer at <a href="https://www.sktes.com/">SK TES</a>, an IT asset disposition provider, tells me this early on during a tour of a 128,000-square-foot facility in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He will restate this a few times.</p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p class="article-subhead">James Gentz has seen birds aplenty on his East Texas rice-and-crawfish farm: snow geese and pintails, spoonbills and teal. The whooping crane couple, though, he found “magnificent.” These endangered, long-necked behemoths arrived in 2021 and set to building a nest amid his flooded fields. “I just loved to see them,” Gentz says.</p>
<div class="article-content">
<div class="article-text -drop-cap">
<p>Not every farmer is thrilled to host birds. Some worry about the spread of <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2025/scientific-facts-about-h5n1-bird-flu">avian flu</a>, others are concerned that the birds will eat too much of their valuable crops. But as an unstable climate delivers too little water, careening temperatures and chaotic storms, the fates of human food production and birds are ever more linked—with the same climate anomalies that harm birds hurting agriculture too.</p>
<p>In some places, farmer cooperation is critical to the continued existence of whooping cranes and other wetland-dependent waterbird species, close to <a href="https://www.stateofthebirds.org/2022/waterfowl-and-waterbirds/">one-third of which</a> are experiencing declines. Numbers of waterfowl (think ducks and geese) <a href="https://www.stateofthebirds.org/2025/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/state-of-the-birds-sotb-2025-spreads.pdf"> have crashed</a> by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-species-north-america-da8e0d41f4c9ad85c601d17c86bb5629">20 percent since 2014</a>, and long-legged wading shorebirds like sandpipers have suffered <a href="https://americanornithology.org/north-american-shorebirds-declining-faster-than-we-ever-imagined/">steep population losses</a>. Conservation-minded biologists, nonprofits, government agencies, and farmers themselves are amping up efforts to ensure that each species survives and thrives. With federal support in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, their work is more important (and threatened) than ever.</p>
<p>Their collaborations, be they domestic or international, are highly specific, because different regions support different kinds of agriculture—grasslands, or deep or shallow wetlands, for example, favored by different kinds of birds. Key to the efforts is making it financially worthwhile for farmers to keep—or tweak—practices to meet bird forage and habitat needs.</p>
<p>Traditional crawfish-and-rice farms <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/crawfish-and-water-birds">in Louisiana</a>, as well as in Gentz’s corner of Texas, mimic natural <a href="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/portals/our_offices/research_stations/rice/features/publications/rice-and-crawfish-production-provides-essential-wildlife-habitat">freshwater</a> <a href="https://btnep.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WadingBirdsinLa.pdf">wetlands</a> that are being lost to saltwater intrusion <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969725003353">from sea level rise</a>. Rice grows in fields that are flooded to keep weeds down; fields are drained for harvest by fall. They are then re-flooded to cover crawfish burrowed in the mud; these are harvested in early spring—and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p>That second flooding coincides with fall migration—<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-021122-092239">a genetic and learned behavior</a> that determines where birds fly and when—and it lures massive numbers of egrets, herons, bitterns, and storks that dine on the crustaceans as well as on<a href="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/portals/our_offices/research_stations/rice/features/publications/rice-and-crawfish-production-provides-essential-wildlife-habitat"> tadpoles</a>, fish, and insects in the water.</p>
<p>On a biodiverse crawfish-and-rice farm, “you can see 30, 40, 50 species of birds, amphibians, reptiles, everything,” says Elijah Wojohn, a shorebird conservation biologist at nonprofit Manomet Conservation Sciences in Massachusetts. In contrast, if farmers switch to less water-intensive corn and soybean production in response to climate pressures, “you’ll see raccoons, deer, crows, that’s about it.” Wojohn often relies on word-of-mouth to hook farmers on conservation; one learned to spot whimbrel, with their large, curved bills, got “fired up” about them and told all his farmer friends. Such farmer-to-farmer dialogue is how you change things among this sometimes change-averse group, Wojohn says.</p>
<p>In the Mississippi Delta and in California, where rice is generally grown without crustaceans, conservation organizations like Ducks Unlimited have long boosted farmers’ income and staying power by helping them get paid to flood fields in winter for hunters. This attracts overwintering ducks and geese—considered an extra “crop”—that gobble leftover rice and pond plants; the birds also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880902000221">help to decompose rice stalks</a> so farmers don’t have to remove them. Ducks Unlimited’s goal is simple, says director of conservation innovation Scott Manley: Keep rice farmers farming rice. This is especially important as a changing climate makes that harder. 2024 saw a huge push, with the organization conserving 1 million acres for waterfowl.</p>
<p>Some strategies can backfire. In Central New York, where dwindling winter ice has seen waterfowl lingering past their habitual migration times, wildlife managers and land trusts are buying less productive farmland to plant with native grasses; these give migratory fuel to ducks when not much else is growing. But there’s potential for this to produce too many birds for the land available back in their breeding areas, says Andrew Dixon, director of science and conservation at the Mohamed Bin Zayed Raptor Conservation Fund in Abu Dhabi, and coauthor of <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-021122-092239">an article about the genetics of bird migration</a> in the 2024 Annual Review of Animal Biosciences. This can damage ecosystems meant to serve them.</p>

<p>Recently, conservation efforts spanning continents and thousands of miles have sprung up. One seeks to protect buff-breasted sandpipers. As they migrate 18,000 miles to and from the High Arctic where they <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Buff-breasted_Sandpiper/lifehistory">nest</a>, the birds experience extreme hunger—hyperphagia—that compels them to voraciously devour insects in short grasses where the bugs proliferate. But many stops along the birds’ round-trip route are threatened. There are water shortages affecting agriculture in Texas, where the birds forage at turf grass farms; grassland loss and degradation in Paraguay; and in Colombia, conversion of forage lands to exotic grasses and rice paddies these birds cannot use.</p>
<p>Conservationists say it’s critical to protect habitat for “buffies” all along their route, and to ensure that the winters these small shorebirds spend around Uruguay’s coastal lagoons are a food fiesta. To that end, Manomet conservation specialist Joaquín Aldabe, in partnership with Uruguay’s agriculture ministry, has so far taught 40 local ranchers how to improve their cattle grazing practices. Rotationally moving the animals from pasture to pasture means grasses stay the right length for insects to flourish.</p>
<p>There are no easy fixes in the North American northwest, where <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2023/shocking-number-birds-are-in-trouble">bird conservation is in crisis</a>. Extreme drought is causing breeding grounds, molting spots, and migration stopover sites to vanish. It is also <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2024/can-desalination-of-groundwater-grow-crops">endangering the livelihoods of farmers</a>, who feel the push to sell land to developers. From Southern Oregon to Central California, conservation allies have provided monetary incentives for water-strapped grain farmers to <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12012025/california-rice-fields-offer-threatened-migratory-waterbirds-lifeline/">leave behind harvest debris</a> to improve survivability for the <a href="https://www.sacramentoaudubon.org/pacific-flyway-conservation#:~:text=At%20least%20a%20billion%20birds,region%20called%20the%20Pacific%20Flyway.">1 billion birds</a> that pass through every year, and for <a href="https://iwjv.org/sonec-working-wet-meadows/">ranchers to flood-irrigate unused pastures</a>.</p>
<p>One treacherous leg of the northwest migration route is the parched Klamath Basin of Oregon and California. For three recent years, “we saw no migrating birds. I mean, the peak count was zero,” says John Vradenburg, supervisory biologist of the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex. He and <a href="https://www.kwua.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/October-2023-Newsletter.pdf">myriad private, public, and Indigenous partners</a> are working to conjure more water for the basin’s human and avian denizens, as perennial wetlands become seasonal wetlands, seasonal wetlands transition to temporary wetlands, and temporary wetlands turn to arid lands.</p>
<p>Taking down four power dams and one <a href="https://www.ducks.org/newsroom/work-advances-on-major-wetland-restoration-project-in-klamath-basin">levee</a> has stretched the Klamath River’s water across the landscape, creating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/salmon-klamath-river-dam.html">new streams</a> and connecting farm fields to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/salmon-klamath-river-dam.html">long-separated wetlands</a>. But making the most of this requires expansive thinking. Wetland restoration—now endangered by loss of funding from the current administration—would help drought-afflicted farmers by keeping water tables high. But what if farmers could also receive extra money for their businesses via eco-credits, akin to carbon credits, for the work those wetlands do to filter-clean farm runoff? And what if wetlands could function as aquaculture incubators for juvenile fish, before stocking rivers? Klamath tribes are invested in restoring endangered c’waam and koptu sucker fish, and this could help them achieve that goal.</p>
<p>As birds’ traditional resting and nesting spots become inhospitable, a more sobering question is whether improvements can happen rapidly enough. The blistering pace of climate change gives little chance for species to genetically adapt, although some are changing their behaviors. That means that the work of conservationists to find and secure adequate, supportive farmland and rangeland as the birds seek out new routes has become a sprint against time.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This coming weekend is a special one for most motorsport fans. There are Formula 1 races in Monaco and NASCAR races in Charlotte. And arguably towering over them both is the Indianapolis 500, being held this year for the 109th time. America's oldest race is also one of its toughest: The track may have just four turns, but the cars negotiate them going three times faster than you drive on the highway, inches from the wall. For hours. At least at Le Mans, you have more than one driver per car.</p>
<p>This year's race promises to be an exciting one. The track is sold out for the first time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/the-greatest-spectacle-in-racing-turns-100-the-2016-indy-500/">since the centenary race in 2016</a>. A rookie driver and a team new to the series took pole position. Two very fast cars are <a href="https://racer.com/2025/05/19/newgarden-power-sent-to-the-back-of-indy-500-grid-after-component-violations">starting at the back</a> thanks to <a href="https://racer.com/2025/05/18/indycar-president-boles-explains-penske-qualifying-illegalities">another conflict-of-interest</a> scandal involving Team Penske, the second in two years for a team whose owner also owns the track and the series. And the cars are trickier to drive than they have been for many years, thanks to a new supercapacitor-based hybrid system that has added more than 100 lbs to the rear of the car, shifting the weight distribution further back.</p>
<p>Ahead of Sunday's race, I spoke with a couple of IndyCar drivers and some engineers to get a better sense of how they prepare and what to expect.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/05/how-to-try-to-win-the-indianapolis-500/">Read full article</a></p>
