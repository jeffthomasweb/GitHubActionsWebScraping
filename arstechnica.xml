                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Android's open nature set it apart from the iPhone as the era of touchscreen smartphones began nearly two decades ago. Little by little, Google has traded some of that openness for security, and its next security initiative could make the biggest concessions yet in the name of blocking bad apps. Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all Android app developers, and not just those publishing on the Play Store. Google intends to <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html?m=1">verify developer identities no matter where they offer their content</a>, and apps without verification won't work on most Android devices in the coming years.</p>
<p>Google used to do very little curation of the Play Store (or Android Market, if you go back far enough), but it has long sought to improve the platform's reputation as being less secure than the Apple App Store. Years ago, you could publish actual exploits in the official store to gain root access on phones, but now there are multiple reviews and detection mechanisms to reduce the prevalence of malware and banned content. While the Play Store is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/researchers-find-north-korean-spy-apps-hosted-in-google-play/">still not perfect</a>, Google claims apps sideloaded from outside its store are 50 times more likely to contain malware.</p>
<p>This, we are led to believe, is the impetus for Google's new developer verification system. The company describes it like an "ID check at the airport." Since requiring all Google Play app developers to verify their identities in 2023, it has seen a precipitous drop in malware and fraud. Bad actors in Google Play leveraged anonymity to distribute malicious apps, so it stands to reason that verifying app developers outside of Google Play could also enhance security.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-will-block-sideloading-of-unverified-android-apps-starting-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>US Senator Ron Wyden accused the federal judiciary of “negligence and incompetence” following a recent hack, reportedly by hackers with ties to the Russian government, that exposed confidential court documents.</p>
<p>The breach of the judiciary’s electronic case filing system first <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/06/federal-court-filing-system-pacer-hack-00496916">came to light</a> in a report by Politico three weeks ago, which went on to say that the vulnerabilities exploited in the hack were known <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/12/federal-courts-hack-security-flaw-00506392">since 2020</a>. The New York Times, citing people familiar with the intrusion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/us/politics/russia-hack-federal-court-system.html">said</a> that Russia was "at least partly responsible" for the hack.</p>
<h2>A “severe threat” to national security</h2>
<p>Two overlapping filing platforms—one known as the CM/ECF (Case Management/Electronic Case Files) and the other PACER—were breached in 2020 in an attack that closely resembled the most recently reported one. The second compromise was first detected around July 5, Politico reported, citing two unnamed sources who weren’t authorized to speak to reporters. Discovery of the hack came a month after Michael Scudder, a judge chairing the Committee on Information Technology for the federal courts’ national policymaking body, <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/judge-scudder-testimony.pdf">told</a> members of the House Judiciary Committee that the federal court system is under constant attack by increasingly sophisticated hackers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/senator-to-supreme-court-justice-federal-court-hacks-threaten-us-security/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-confirms-nations-first-travel-associated-human-screwworm-case-connected-2025-08-25/">Reuters was first to report the case early Monday</a>, quoting Andrew Nixon, spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, who said in an email that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed the case on August 4 in a person who had returned from a trip to El Salvador.</p>
<p>While other outlets have since reported that the screwworm case found in Maryland is the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/25/nx-s1-5515487/new-world-screwworm-us-human-case">first human case in the US</a>, or <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-world-screwworm-first-human-case-travel-confirmed-cdc-hhs/">first travel-related case</a> in the US, or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/25/screwworm-human-maryland/">the first case in years</a>—none of those things are true. Screwworms are endemic in parts of South America and the Caribbean and travel-related cases have always been a threat and occasionally pop up in the US. While the CDC doesn't keep a public tally of the cases, experts at the agency have noted several travel-related human cases in the US in recent years, including one as recent as last year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/screwworm-larvae-eat-their-way-into-us-via-overseas-travelers-flesh/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>At first, Musk appeared fixated on ChatGPT consistently topping Apple's "Must Have" app list—which Grok has never made—claiming Apple seemed to preference OpenAI, an Apple partner, over all chatbot rivals. But Musk's <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/X-Corp-v-Apple-8-25-25-Complaint.pdf">filing</a> shows that the X and xAI owner isn't just trying to push for more Grok downloads on iPhones—he's concerned that Apple and OpenAI have teamed up to completely dash his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/elon-musks-improbable-path-to-making-x-an-everything-app/">"everything app" dreams</a>, which was the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/fast-moving-musk-makes-very-slow-progress-turning-twitter-into-everything-app/">reason he bought Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>At this point appearing to be genuinely panicked about OpenAI's insurmountable lead in the chatbot market, Musk has specifically alleged that an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-integrates-chatgpt-into-siri-ios-and-mac-os/">agreement integrating ChatGPT into the iOS</a> violated antitrust and unfair competition laws. Allegedly, the conspiracy is designed to protect Apple's smartphone monopoly and block out AI rivals to lock in OpenAI's dominance in the chatbot market.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/elon-musk-sues-apple-openai-to-block-exclusive-iphone-chatgpt-integration/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Fresh off his thorough victory over CBS News, President Trump is taking aim at ABC and NBC.</p>
<p>"Why is it that ABC and NBC FAKE NEWS, two of the absolute worst and most biased networks anywhere in the World, aren't paying Millions of Dollars a year in LICENSE FEES," Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115087160158530143">wrote</a> on Truth Social last night. "They should lose their Licenses for their unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives, but at a minimum, they should pay up BIG for having the privilege of using the most valuable airwaves anywhere at anytime!!! Crooked 'journalism' should not be rewarded, it should be terminated!!!"</p>
<p>While Trump's many threats to revoke broadcaster licenses have never led to any actual license revocations, the CBS developments show how he can use the government to influence operations at news organizations. CBS owner Paramount recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/paramount-accused-of-bribery-as-it-settles-trump-lawsuit-for-16-million/">inked a $16 million settlement</a> with Trump and then agreed to install a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/how-the-trump-fcc-justified-requiring-a-bias-monitor-at-cbs/">bias monitor</a>" in order to gain Federal Communications Commission approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance. Now Trump is turning his attention to ABC and NBC.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/cbs-caved-to-trump-now-hes-seeking-punishments-for-abc-and-nbc/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Users of X3D CPUs in ASRock motherboards seem to be at particularly high risk.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>AMD's X3D-series Ryzen chips have become popular with PC gamers because games in particular happen to benefit disproportionately from the chips' extra 64MB of L3 cache memory. But that extra memory occasionally comes with extra headaches. Not long after they were released earlier this year, some early adopters started having problems with their CPUs, ranging from failure to boot to actual physical scorching and burnout—the problems were particularly common for users of the 9800X3D processor in ASRock motherboards, and one Reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/1i5iy9a/update_and_summary_on_the_dead_9800x3ds/">currently records 157 incidents of failure</a> for that CPU model across various ASRock boards.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Korean language website <a href="https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qn_report/views/471810">Quasar Zone</a> (via <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-comments-on-burning-am5-socket-chipmaker-blames-motherboard-vendors-for-not-following-official-bios-guidelines">Tom's Hardware</a>), AMD executives David McAfee and Travis Kirsch acknowledged the problems and pointed to the most likely culprit: motherboard makers who don't follow AMD's recommended specifications. Some manufacturers have historically shipped their AMD and Intel motherboards with elevated default power settings in the interest of squeezing a bit more performance out of the chips—but those adjustments can also cause problems in some cases, especially for higher-end CPUs.</p>
<p>The AM5 socket has already been through a saga like this one before. Shortly after their release in early 2023, some Ryzen 7000-series X3D chips were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/some-ryzen-7000x3d-processors-are-burning-out-high-voltages-may-be-to-blame/">becoming physically deformed</a>, developing bulges on the bottom that could permanently damage the CPU and bend the pins in the CPU socket. AMD blamed some motherboards' incorrect voltage settings for the problem and put out BIOS updates with more limitations on voltage to fix the problem.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/like-intel-before-it-amd-blames-motherboard-makers-for-burnt-out-cpus/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Is it a conspiracy? For months, YouTubers have been quietly griping that something looked off in their recent video uploads. Following a deeper analysis by a popular music channel, Google has now confirmed that it has been testing a feature that uses AI to artificially enhance videos. The company claims this is part of its effort to "provide the best video quality," but it's odd that it began doing so without notifying creators or offering any way to opt out of the experiment.</p>
<p>Google's test raised eyebrows almost immediately after it began rolling out in YouTube Shorts earlier this year. Users reported strange artifacts, edge distortion, and distracting smoothness that gives the appearance of AI alteration. If you've ever zoomed in close after taking a photo with your smartphone only to notice things look oversharpened or like an oil painting, that's the effect of Google's video processing test.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1958199532363317467">According</a> to Rene Ritchie, YouTube's head of editorial, this isn't quite like the AI features Google has been cramming into every other product. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Ritchie said the feature is not based on generative AI but instead uses "traditional machine learning" to reduce blur and noise while sharpening the image. Although, this is a distinction without a difference—it's still AI of a sort being used to modify videos.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/08/youtube-secretly-tested-ai-video-enhancement-without-notifying-creators/">Read full article</a></p>

But all the violence and gore scared off most distributors, so the film—starring Peter Dinklage (<em>Game of Thrones</em>) in the title role—has been languishing in the vault for much of the last two years.</p>
<p>Thanks to Cineverse, <em>The Toxic Avenger</em> is finally coming to select theaters this weekend. And thanks to the folks at Bloody Disgusting (a Cineverse subsidiary), we've got a trailer by producer/actor and horror movie fan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHeOoMayGpuVBHUGCVwFqQ">Wilson Cleveland</a>, rendered in a gloriously goofy-yet-gory grindhouse style that pays homage to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2BOcrMcsbw">original trailer</a>. (You can watch the red-band trailer below.)</p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Greenhouse gas reduction is no longer a priority for the US government, but if you're looking for a new vehicle and want to buy something with the lowest life cycle carbon emissions, you're best off looking for a compact with a small battery. That's one of the findings from a group at the University of Michigan of a comprehensive study that calculates the overall cradle-to-grave carbon impact for different types of vehicles, including factors like powertrain options, location (within the country), and use patterns. Even better, <a href="https://vehicle-emissions-calculator.vercel.app">they built a tool</a> you can use yourself.</p>
<p>The study, published in Environmental Science and Technology, compares internal combustion engine powertrains with hybrid, 35- and 50-mile range plug-in hybrids, and 200-mile, 300-mile, and 400-mile battery electric powertrains across compact and midsize sedans, small and midsize SUVs, and pickup trucks, using a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/rd-greet-life-cycle-assessment-model">life cycle assessment model</a> developed by Argonne National Laboratory and data of <a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.shtml">model year 2025 vehicles</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>If you expected that a gas-powered pickup truck would have the biggest carbon footprint, you'd be right. With a driving profile of 43 percent city driving and the rest highways (no cargo), a pickup will emit about 486 g CO2e per mile. Compared to that, a compact electric sedan with a 200-mile battery has just 17 percent of the life cycle emissions and is responsible for just 81 g CO2e per mile.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/study-shows-which-vehicles-pollute-the-least-in-every-us-county/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Time and again, whenever a population was swept into a cave and survived long enough for natural selection to have its way, the eyes disappeared. “But it’s not that everything has been <em>lost</em> in cavefish,” says geneticist Jaya Krishnan of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. “Many enhancements have also happened.”</p>
<p>Though the demise of their eyes continues to fascinate biologists, in recent years, attention has shifted to other intriguing aspects of cavefish biology. It has become increasingly clear that they haven’t just lost sight but also gained many adaptations that help them to thrive in their cave environment, including some that may hold clues to treatments for <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2024/whats-next-in-the-ozempic-era">obesity</a> and <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2021/what-does-mean-have-prediabetes">diabetes</a> in people.</p>
<h2>Casting off expensive eyes</h2>
<p>It has long been debated why the eyes were lost. Some biologists used to argue that they just withered away over generations because cave-dwelling animals with faulty eyes experienced no disadvantage. But another explanation is now considered more likely, says evolutionary physiologist Nicolas Rohner of the University of Münster in Germany: “Eyes <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1500363">are very expensive</a> in terms of resources and energy. Most people now agree that there must be some advantage to losing them if you don’t need them.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/how-the-cavefish-lost-its-eyes-again-and-again/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX completed its 33rd cargo delivery to the International Space Station early Monday, when a Dragon supply ship glided to an automated docking with more than 5,000 pounds of scientific experiments and provisions for the lab's seven-person crew.</p>
<p>The resupply flight is part of the normal rotation of cargo and crew missions that keep the space station operating. The Dragon spacecraft's cargo haul comprised packages of fresh food, including some 1,500 tortillas, and equipment for numerous research investigations demonstrating 3D printing in microgravity and examining how the human body responds to long-duration spaceflight.</p>
<p>The cargo manifest is typical of most Dragon resupply flights traveling to the International Space Station. What's different with this mission is a new rocket pack mounted inside the Dragon spacecraft's rear trunk section. In the coming weeks, SpaceX and NASA will use this first-of-its-kind propulsion system to begin boosting the altitude of the space station's orbit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacexs-latest-dragon-mission-will-breathe-more-fire-at-the-space-station/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Allan Brooks, a 47-year-old corporate recruiter, spent three weeks and 300 hours convinced he'd discovered mathematical formulas that could crack encryption and build levitation machines. According to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html">New York Times investigation</a>, his million-word conversation history with an AI chatbot reveals a troubling pattern: More than 50 times, Brooks asked the bot to check if his false ideas were real. More than 50 times, it assured him they were.</p>
<p>Brooks isn't alone. Futurism <a href="https://futurism.com/commitment-jail-chatgpt-psychosis">reported</a> on a woman whose husband, after 12 weeks of believing he'd "broken" mathematics using ChatGPT, almost attempted suicide. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/">documented</a> a 76-year-old man who died rushing to meet a chatbot he believed was a real woman waiting at a train station. Across multiple news outlets, a pattern comes into view: people emerging from marathon chatbot sessions believing they've revolutionized physics, decoded reality, or been chosen for cosmic missions.</p>
<p>These vulnerable users fell into reality-distorting conversations with systems that can't tell truth from fiction. Through reinforcement learning driven by user feedback, some of these AI models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-rolls-back-update-that-made-chatgpt-a-sycophantic-mess/">have evolved</a> to validate every theory, confirm every false belief, and agree with every grandiose claim, depending on the context.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/with-ai-chatbots-big-tech-is-moving-fast-and-breaking-people/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Towering 404 feet (123.1 meters) tall, the rocket was supposed to lift off during a one-hour launch window beginning at 6:30 pm CDT (7:30 pm EDT; 23:30 UTC) Sunday. But SpaceX called off the launch attempt about an hour before liftoff to investigate a ground system issue at Starbase, located a few miles north of the US-Mexico border.</p>
<p>SpaceX didn't immediately confirm when it might try again to launch Starship, but it could happen as soon as Monday evening at the same time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/whats-the-goal-of-spacexs-10th-starship-test-flight-right-the-ship/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Donald Trump recently claimed, during what was supposed to be a press conference about a European Union trade deal, that wind turbines were a "con job" that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Asznj3uWKA">drive whales "loco," kill birds and even people</a>, he wasn’t just repeating old myths. He was tapping into a global pattern of conspiracy theories around renewable energy—particularly wind farms. (Trump calls them “windmills”—a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kevinleecaster.bsky.social/post/3lv4hczf33k2b">climate denier trope</a>.)</p>
<p>Like 19th century fears that telephones would <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/819772/pdf">spread diseases</a>, wind farm conspiracy theories reflect deeper anxieties about change. They combine distrust of government, nostalgia for the fossil fuel era, and a resistance to confronting the complexities of the modern world.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-022-01164-w?fromPaywallRec=false">research shows</a> that, once these fears are embedded in someone’s worldview, no amount of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/28/are-trump-claims-about-wind-power-correct">fact-checking</a> is likely to shift them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/why-wind-farms-attract-so-much-misinformation-and-conspiracy-theory/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Most experimental brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that have been used for synthesizing human speech have been implanted in the areas of the brain that translate the intention to speak into the muscle actions that produce it. A patient has to physically attempt to speak to make these implants work, which is tiresome for severely paralyzed people.</p>
<p>To go around it, researchers at the Stanford University built a BCI that could decode inner speech—the kind we engage in silent reading and use for all our internal monologues. The problem is that those inner monologues often involve stuff we don’t want others to hear. To keep their BCI from spilling the patients’ most private thoughts, the researchers designed a first-of-its-kind “mental privacy” safeguard.</p>
<h2>Overlapping signals</h2>
<p>The reason nearly all neural prostheses used for speech are designed to decode attempted speech is that our first idea was to try the same thing we did with controlling artificial limbs: record from the area of the brain responsible for controlling muscles. “Attempted movements produced very strong signal, and we thought it could also be used for speech,” says Benyamin Meschede Abramovich Krasa, a neuroscientist at Stanford University who, along with Erin M. Kunz, was a co-lead author of the study.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/an-inner-speech-decoder-reveals-some-mental-privacy-issues/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Four men in Georgia, all living in the same county, mysteriously became infected with a potentially deadly soil bacterium that's normally found in the tropics and subtropics, particularly Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The four cases were tied together not just by their shared location but also by the bacterial strain; whole genome sequencing showed the bacteria causing all four infections were highly related, suggesting a shared source of their infections.</p>
<p>But this bacterium doesn't tend to jump from person to person. And none of the men had recent travel that explained the infection. In fact, only one of the men had ever been to a place where the bacterium lives, but it was decades before his infection. And there's another twist: The four infections spanned decades. The first occurred in 1983, the second in 1989, and the last two occurred a day apart in September 2024.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/25-0804_article">a newly published study in Emerging Infectious Diseases</a>, state and federal health researchers suggest that the four linked cases indicate that the dangerous bacterium—<em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em>—has been lurking in the Georgia area the entire time. They also think they know what triggered its recent reemergence: Hurricane Helene.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/two-men-fell-gravely-ill-last-year-their-infections-link-to-deaths-in-the-80s/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A hobbyist developer building AI language models that speak Victorian-era English "just for fun" got an unexpected history lesson this week when his latest creation mentioned real protests from 1834 London—events the developer didn't know had actually happened until he Googled them.</p>
<p>"I was interested to see if a protest had actually occurred in 1834 London and it really did happen," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mvnmjo/my_llm_trained_from_scratch_on_only_1800s_london/">wrote</a> Reddit user Hayk Grigorian, who is a computer science <a href="https://github.com/haykgrigo3">student</a> at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>For the past month, Grigorian has been developing what he calls <a href="https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM">TimeCapsuleLLM</a>, a small AI language model (like a pint-sized distant cousin to ChatGPT) which has been trained entirely on texts from 1800–1875 London. Grigorian wants to capture an authentic Victorian voice in the AI model's outputs. As a result, the AI model ends up spitting out text that's heavy with biblical references and period-appropriate rhetorical excess.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/ai-built-from-1800s-texts-surprises-creator-by-mentioning-real-1834-london-protests/">Read full article</a></p>
