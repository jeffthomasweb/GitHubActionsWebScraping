<p>The launch of Firefly's Initial Public Offering (IPO) comes as the company works to build on a historic success in March, when Firefly's Blue Ghost lander touched down on the surface of the Moon. Firefly plans to sell 16.2 million shares of common stock, at a price of between $35 and $39 per share. Under those terms, Firefly could raise up to $631.8 million on the public market.</p>

                        <![CDATA[The plot makes no sense, but that retro-futuristic Tomorrowland vibe and superb cast make it (mostly) work.]]>
                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Marvel Studios officially kicked off Phase Six of its cinematic universe with the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantastic_Four:_First_Steps"><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em></a>, and the film is already garnering solid reviews and a <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/fantastic-four/">strong start</a> at the box office. The cast is terrific across the board, and the production design is, well, pretty darn fantastic, evoking Disney's Tomorrowland (the park, not the film) with its 1960s retro-alt-future aesthetic. Just let your brain relax and don't try to make too much of the nonsensical plot.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>Director Matt Shakman (<em>WandaVision</em>) took a page from James Gunn's <em>Superman</em> playbook and skipped the usual origin story for our heroes. How the Fantastic Four acquired their unique abilities is recapped via brief flashbacks, along with some of their early exploits, thanks to the Four being featured celebrities on a popular talk show hosted by Ted Gilbert (Mark Gatiss). Reed Richard/Mister Fantastic (Pedro Pascal) and Sue Storm/Invisible Woman (Vanessa Kirby) are even expecting their first child, to the delight of Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Joseph Quinn) and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/review-fantastic-four-first-steps-is-the-best-film-version-so-far/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Smart home device maker Futurehome is forcing its customers’ hands by suddenly requiring a subscription for basic functionality of its products.</p>
<p>Launched in 2016, Futurehome’s Smarthub is marketed as a central hub for controlling Internet-connected devices in smart homes. For years, the Norwegian company sold its products, which also include smart thermostats, smart lighting, and smart fire and carbon monoxide alarms, for a one-time fee that included access to its companion app and cloud platform for control and automation. As of June 26, though, those core features require a 1,188 NOK (about $116.56) annual subscription fee, turning the smart home devices into dumb ones if users don't pay up.</p>
<p>“You lose access to controlling devices, configuring; automations, modes, shortcuts, and energy services,” a company <a href="https://support.futurehome.no/hc/en-no/articles/28158944965277-FAQ-Subscription">FAQ page</a> says.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/bankrupt-futurehome-suddenly-makes-its-smart-home-hub-a-subscription-service/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The next front in Donald Trump's trade war will be chip tariffs—which could come by next month—but national security experts are warning that the president may have already made a huge misstep that threatens to disrupt both US trade and national security.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ari.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Letter-to-Secretary-Lutnick-on-H20-restrictions.pdf">letter</a> Monday to Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, 20 policymakers and professionals with a background in national security policy urged Trump to reverse course and block exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China.</p>
<p>In April, the Trump administration decided against imposing additional export curbs on H20 chips after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang paid $1 million for a seat at a Mar-a-Lago dinner, NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5356480/nvidia-china-ai-h20-chips-trump">reported</a>. Apparently, Nvidia's promise to invest $500 billion in AI data centers helped persuade Trump to change course, as did the terms of a temporary truce with China, in which the US promised to halt H20 chip controls in exchange for China restoring imports of rare earth minerals into the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/trump-caving-on-nvidia-h20-export-curbs-may-disrupt-his-bigger-trade-war/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Popular open source 3D modeling tool Blender's social media channels and subreddit have regularly seen people asking for a tablet version for years now. And according to <a href="https://code.blender.org/2025/07/beyond-mouse-keyboard/">a blog post</a> by Dalai Felinto from the Blender team, the developers of the application have now committed to build just that.</p>
<p>"The idea is to bring the full power of Blender to these devices," the blog post explains. "This requires adapting to platform-specific paradigms, but also to offer more task-oriented user interfaces with reduced information density. This will be achieved by extending existing input methods and improving workspaces and application templates, running on top of a regular Blender build."</p>
<p>The long-term goal is to build out not just a standalone tablet interface, but to offer the same advantages something like an iPad Pro offers to PC-connected graphics tablet peripherals, too—and it goes both ways. Ultimately, a standalone tablet + a keyboard and trackpad should offer the same experience as on desktop, and a desktop PC with a graphics tablet should be the same as a standalone tablet in terms of experience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/popular-3d-application-blender-will-get-a-tablet-version/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Maybe they should change the button to say, "I am a robot"?</p>
<p>On Friday, OpenAI's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/chatgpts-new-ai-agent-can-browse-the-web-and-create-powerpoint-slideshows/">ChatGPT Agent</a>, which can perform multistep tasks for users, proved it can pass through one of the Internet's most common security checkpoints by clicking Cloudflare's anti-bot verification—the same checkbox that's supposed to keep automated programs like itself at bay.</p>
<p>ChatGPT Agent is a feature that allows OpenAI's AI assistant to control its own web browser, operating within a sandboxed environment with its own virtual operating system and browser that can access the real Internet. Users can watch the AI's actions through a window in the ChatGPT interface, maintaining oversight while the agent completes tasks. The system requires user permission before taking actions with real-world consequences, such as making purchases. Recently, Reddit users discovered the agent could do something particularly ironic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/openais-chatgpt-agent-casually-clicks-through-i-am-not-a-robot-verification-test/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/skydance-deal-allows-trumps-fcc-to-censor-speech-and-silence-dissent-on-cbs/">approval</a> of CBS owner Paramount's $8 billion merger with Skydance came with a condition to install an ombudsman, which FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has described as a "bias monitor." It appears that the bias monitor will make sure the news company's reporting meets standards demanded by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"One of the things they're going to have to do is put an ombudsman in place for two years, so basically a bias monitor that will report directly to the president [of Paramount]," Carr <a href="https://www.newsmaxtv.com/Shows/Greg-Kelly-Reports/vid/f0e96a10-6902-11f0-9ecf-dbf20182fcd7">told Newsmax on Thursday</a>, right after the FCC announced its approval of the merger.</p>
<p>The Carr FCC claims there is precedent for such a bias monitor. But the precedent cited in last week's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-25-43A1.pdf">merger approval</a> points to a very different case involving NBC and GE, one in which an ombudsman was used to protect NBC's editorial independence from interference by its new owner.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/how-the-trump-fcc-justified-requiring-a-bias-monitor-at-cbs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>According to <em>US News and World Report</em>, the state of Oklahoma <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education/prek-12?sort=rank-desc">ranks 48th in the United States</a> for its pre-K to 12th grade education system. But the current hot-button issue consuming the Oklahoma State Board of Education isn't about improving this position; it's about whether someone was streaming video of nude women gathered around a "chiropractic table" to a TV visible during a Board of Education meeting last week.</p>
<p>Indeed, so serious has the issue become that it has already progressed from a media complaint to a <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2025/07/25/probe-needed-after-reports-of-nude-women-on-state-superintendents-office-tv-oklahoma-speaker-says/">state probe</a> to an <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/6887a662c40af63ee1a56c4c/omes-asks-oklahoma-county-sheriff-to-review-incident-in-ryan-walters-office">Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office</a> investigation in just a few days.</p>
<p>State House Speaker Kyle Hilbert (R) is <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2025/07/25/probe-needed-after-reports-of-nude-women-on-state-superintendents-office-tv-oklahoma-speaker-says/">already suggesting</a> that Superintendent Ryan Walters, the state's hard-right head of education—the man who wants to <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/education/newsroom/2025/july/supt--walters-asks-the-oklahoma-supreme-court-to-move-forward-wi.html">put Bibles in every classroom</a>—"unlock and turn over all relevant devices and fully cooperate with an investigation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/oklahomas-new-scandal-nude-women-streamed-to-tv-during-state-board-meeting/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Russia’s biggest airline cancelled dozens of flights on Monday following a failure of the state-owned company’s IT systems and, according to a Russian lawmaker and pro-Ukrainian hackers, was the result of a cyberattack, it was widely reported.</p>
<p>The airline, Aeroflot, said it cancelled about 40 flights following a “technical failure.” An online departure board for Sheremetyevo airport showed dozens of others were delayed. The cancellations and delays hobbled traffic throughout Russia and left travelers stranded at airports. The affected routes were mostly within Russia but also included routes to Belarusian capital Minsk and Yerevan, the capital of Armenia.</p>
<h2>“The damage is strategic”</h2>
<p>Russian prosecutors confirmed to Reuters that the disruption was caused by a hack and have opened a criminal investigation into it. Russian lawmakers also hinted a cyberattack was the cause of the outage, with one of them, Anton Gorelkin, saying Russia was under digital attack, possibly at the hands of hacktivists with help from unfriendly states.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/pro-ukrainian-hackers-take-credit-for-attack-that-snarls-russian-flight-travel/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The flagship health journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has grown quiet this year, and a report from <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/116670">MedPage Today</a> indicates that a variety of actions by the Trump administration may be to blame for hamstringing the critical resource.</p>
<p>Most strikingly, sources told MedPage that the journal's scientific articles must now obtain clearance for publication from health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has no health, science, or medical background. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services disputed this claim, calling it "false."</p>
<p>Regardless, there's no denying that the journal appears to have been muffled in some ways since the new administration took office. Publications have slowed and press are no longer getting early access to studies under the standard embargo system. And, for the first time in its more than 60-year history, the journal—<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html">the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)</a>—was not published on schedule amid a blanket federal communication freeze in January.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/trump-admin-is-muffling-cdcs-flagship-health-journal-report-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Pixel 6a was a widely beloved phone when it launched in 2022, offering almost all the capabilities of the more expensive Pixel 6 phones at a much lower price. Just a few years into their Pixel love affair, though, owners have been dismayed to learn that a new software update will destroy the phone's battery life. Google says the update is necessary to limit the risk of battery failure, but it would seem that in at least one case, even this heavy-handed update wasn't enough—a user has reported their up-to-date Pixel 6a recently exploded overnight.</p>
<p>In early July, Google's monthly Pixel patch included a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/a-mess-of-its-own-making-google-nerfs-second-pixel-phone-battery-this-year/">major change for the Pixel 6a</a>. Due to the risk of battery fires, Google said that devices with more than 400 charge cycles could see their capacity and charging speed drastically reduced. The company offered a pittance in Google Store credit or a free battery swap in recompense, but taking advantage of either <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/how-google-nerfed-my-pixel-4a-then-stuck-it-to-me-too/">can be a pain</a>. This came just months after a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/google-pixel-4as-ruinous-battery-performance-update-is-a-bewildering-mess/">similar update rolled out to the Pixel 4a</a> that killed its battery due to similar fire risks.</p>

<p>A Redditor using the handle /u/footymanageraddict has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ma6hpa/im_the_3rd_one_posting_this_for_this_month_pixel/">posted photos</a> of a pile of slag that used to be a Pixel 6a (spotted by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6a-battery-fire-after-update-3581462/">Android Authority</a>). This is not the first public report of a catastrophically failed battery in a 6a—a string of similar fires in the spring led Google to release this controversial update. Importantly, this phone reportedly had the battery safety update installed, which was supposed to prevent this kind of occurrence.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/another-google-pixel-6a-catches-fire-after-battery-nerfing-update/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The National Air and Space Museum welcomed the public into five more of its renovated galleries on Monday, including two showcasing spaceflight artifacts. The new exhibitions shine modern light on returning displays and restore the museum's almost 50-year-old legacy of adding objects that made history but have yet to become historical.</p>
<p>Visitors can again enter through the "Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall," which has been closed for the past three years and has on display some of the museum's most iconic items, including John Glenn's Friendship 7 Mercury capsule and an Apollo lunar module.</p>
<p>From there, visitors can tour through the adjacent "Futures in Space," a new gallery focused on the different approaches and technology that spaceflight will take in the years to come. Here, the Smithsonian is displaying for the first time objects that were recently donated by commercial spaceflight companies, including items used in space tourism and in growing the low-Earth orbit economy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/smithsonian-air-and-space-opens-halls-for-milestone-and-future-artifacts/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Porn sites may have blown up Meta's key defense in a copyright fight with book authors who earlier this year <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">said that Meta torrented</a> "at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries" to train its AI models.</p>
<p>Meta has defeated most of the authors' claims and claimed there is no proof that Meta ever uploaded pirated data through seeding or leeching on the BitTorrent network used to download training data. But authors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-rejects-metas-claim-that-torrenting-is-irrelevant-in-ai-copyright-case/">still have a chance to prove that Meta may have profited</a> off its massive piracy, and a new <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Strike-3-Holdings-v-Meta-Complaint-7-23-25.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by adult sites last week appears to contain evidence that could help authors win their fight, TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-lawsuit-accuses-meta-of-pirating-adult-films-for-ai-training/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit was filed last Friday in a US district court in California by Strike 3 Holdings—which says it attracts "over 25 million monthly visitors" to sites that serve as "ethical sources" for adult videos that "are famous for redefining adult content with Hollywood style and quality."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/meta-pirated-and-seeded-porn-for-years-to-train-ai-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Scientists long thought that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1814087116">Neanderthals were avid meat eaters</a>. Based on chemical analysis of Neanderthal remains, it seemed like they’d been feasting on as much meat as apex predators such as lions and hyenas. But as a group, hominins—that’s Neanderthals, our species, and other extinct close relatives—aren’t specialized flesh eaters. Rather, they’re more omnivorous, eating plenty of plant foods, too.</p>
<p>It is possible for humans to subsist on a very carnivorous diet. In fact, many traditional northern hunter–gatherers such as the <a href="https://doi.org/10.14430/arctic4625">Inuit subsisted</a> mostly on animal foods. But hominins simply cannot tolerate consuming the high levels of protein that large predators can. If humans eat as much protein as hypercarnivores do over long periods without consuming enough other nutrients, it can lead to protein poisoning—a debilitating, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-4165(83)90006-5">even lethal</a> condition historically known as “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-6733-6">rabbit starvation</a>.”</p>
<p>So, what could explain the chemical signatures found in Neanderthal bones that seem to suggest they were healthily eating tons of meat?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/fermented-meat-with-a-side-of-maggots-a-new-look-at-the-neanderthal-diet/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The X-37B, the US Space Force's secretive space plane, will soon take flight again.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Space Force <a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/4256759/us-space-force-scheduled-to-launch-eighth-x-37b-mission/">announced</a> that it will fly the small, Space Shuttle-shaped vehicle on the program's eighth mission next month. The launch of the vehicle, on a Falcon 9 rocket, is scheduled to occur no earlier than August 21 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>There are two active X-37Bs in the Space Force fleet, both built by Boeing. The first made its debut flight in April 2010. Since then, the two uncrewed spacecraft have made a succession of longer flights. The first made its longest and latest flight from 2020 to 2022 over a span of 908 days. The second flew more recently, landing at Vandenberg Space Force Base on March 7 after 434 days in orbit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/a-secretive-space-plane-is-set-to-launch-and-test-quantum-navigation-technology/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">The Belgian tourist board provided nothing to this article; the writer just really <em>really</em> loves Spa-Francorchamps. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Formula 1 made its annual stop at Spa-Francorchamps, the historic track that winds its way through the hills and trees of the Ardennes. I’ll admit, I’d been waiting for this one; in fact, I’ve become somewhat of a Spa bore, having fallen in love with the place all over again a few weeks ago while attending the Crowdstrike 24-hour GT3 race.</p>
<p>The 4.3 mile (6.9 km) track delivers, whether that’s as a challenge to the drivers—corners like Eau Rouge, Raidillon, Pouhon, and Blanchiment are the equal of any. There’s elevation change, something that neither Monza nor Silverstone nor Montreal can offer. It has history, dating back well before the start of the Formula 1 world championship in 1949, albeit in a much longer, much scarier version that was truncated by more than half in 1979. The views are spectacular from almost anywhere you choose to watch from, and despite the track’s size, its a pleasant and easy walk through the forest paths (just as long as you can stop imagining that one scene from <em>Band of Brothers</em>).</p>
<p>The food and drink in the region are worth a visit by themselves, and architecture fans will enjoy the Belgians' chaotic attitude toward planning permission and house renovations, which appears to boil down to “do whatever you like as long as it looks good and won’t fall down.” Pretty good driving roads in the area, too, although they get even better toward the Nürburgring, just over an hour away in Germany.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/f1-in-belgium-the-best-racetrack-in-the-world/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>HBO Max dropped the hotly anticipated full trailer for S2 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacemaker_(TV_series)"><em>Peacemaker</em></a>—James Gunn's Emmy-nominated series spun off from his 2021 film, <em>The Suicide Squad</em>—at San Diego Comic-Con this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/watch-the-first-s2-teaser-for-peacemaker/">previously reported</a>, the eight-episode first season was set five months after the events of <em>The Suicide Squad. </em>Having survived a near-fatal shooting, Peacemaker—aka Christopher Smith—is recruited by the US government for a new mission: the mysterious Project Butterfly, led by a mercenary named Clemson Murn (Chukwudi Iwuji). The team also includes A.R.G.U.S. agent John Economos (Steve Agee) of the Belle Reve Penitentiary, National Security Agency agent and former Waller aide Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), and new team member Leota Adebayo (Danielle Brooks).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/peacemaker-s2-trailer-finds-our-anti-hero-in-a-parallel-world/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Next month marks the 20th anniversary of one of the most devastating natural disasters in US history: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, a Category 3 storm that made landfall on August 29, 2005. The storm itself was bad enough, but the resulting surge of water caused havoc for New Orleans in particular when the city's protective levees failed, flooding much of New Orleans and killing 1,392 people. National Geographic is marking the occasion with a new documentary series: <em>Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time</em>.</p>
<p>The five-part documentary is directed by Oscar nominee Traci A. Curry (<em>Attica</em>) and co-produced by Ryan Coogler's Proximity Media, in conjunction with Lightbox. The intent was to go beyond the headlines of yesteryear and re-examine the many systemic failures that occurred while also revealing "stories of survival, heroism, and resilience," Proximity's executive producers said in a statement. "It's a vital historical record and a call to witness, remember and reckon with the truth of Hurricane Katrina's legacy."</p>
<p><em>Race Against Time</em> doesn't just rehash the well-worn narrative of the disaster; it centers the voices of the people who were there on the ground: residents, first responders, officials, and so forth. Among those interviewed for the documentary is geologist/marine scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_van_Heerden">Ivor Van Heerden</a>, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Storm-During-Hurricane-Katrina-Scientist/dp/0143112139"><i>The Storm: What Went Wrong and Why During Hurricane Katrina: the Inside Story from One Louisiana Scientist</i></a> (2006).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/20-years-after-katrina-natgeo-and-new-orleans-remember/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For decades we’ve been trying to make the robots smarter and more physically capable by mimicking biological intelligence and movement. “But in doing so, we’ve been just replicating the results of biological evolution—I say we need to replicate its methods,” argues Philippe Wyder, a developmental robotics researcher at Columbia University. Wyder led a team that demonstrated a machine with a rudimentary form of what they’re calling a metabolism.</p>
<p>He and his colleagues built a robot that could consume other robots to physically grow, become stronger, more capable, and continue functioning.</p>
<h2>Nature’s methods</h2>
<p>The idea of robotic metabolism combines various concepts in AI and robotics. The first is artificial life, which Wyder termed “a field where people study the evolution of organisms through computer simulations.” Then there is the idea of modular robots: reconfigurable machines that can change their architecture by rearranging collections of basic modules. That was pioneered in the US by Daniela Rus or Mark Yim at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1990s.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/robots-eating-other-robots-the-benefits-of-machine-metabolism/">Read full article</a></p>
