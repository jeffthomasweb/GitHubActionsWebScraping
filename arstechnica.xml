              <![CDATA[<p>Baxter International, a prominent health care and pharmaceutical manufacturer, reports that President Trump's tariffs will likely cost the company $60 million to $70 million this year, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/05/01/baxter-international-tariff-impact/">according to the Chicago Tribune</a>.</p>
<p>The hefty toll was revealed by Baxter's executive vice president and chief financial officer, Joel Grade, during an earnings call Thursday.</p>
<p>"We are able to mitigate a portion of these impacts," Grade reportedly said in the call. "Currently a majority of Baxter’s products sold in the US are manufactured in the US and made largely from US-made components. However, international procurement is part of our business operations and as such we are impacted from the US and retaliatory tariffs that have been issued."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/health-care-company-says-trump-tariffs-will-cost-it-60m-70m-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[The advertising remedy trial will begin on September 22.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>We sometimes think of Google as a search company, but that's merely incidental—Google is really the world's biggest advertiser. That's why the antitrust case focused on Google's ad tech business could have even more lasting effects than cases focused on search or mobile apps. The court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/google-loses-ad-tech-monopoly-trial-faces-additional-breakups/">ruled against Google last month</a>, and now both sides are lining up to present their proposed remedies in a trial later this year.</p>
<p>In today's hearing, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema set the beginning of that trial for September 22 of this year. Just like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">the search case</a>, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is aiming to hack off pieces of Google to level the playing field. Specifically, the DOJ is asking the court to force Google to sell two parts of the ad business: the ad exchange and the publisher ad server. The ad exchange is the world's largest marketplace for bidding on advertising space. The ad server, meanwhile, is a tool that publishers use to list and sell ads on their sites.</p>
<p>While Google lost the liability phase of the case, it won on the subject of ad networks. The court decided that the government had not proven that Google's acquisition of ad networks like DoubleClick and Admeld had harmed competition. So, Google won't have to worry about losing those parts of the business.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/doj-confirms-it-wants-to-break-up-googles-ad-business/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the last two weeks, in response to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/">Executive Order 14035</a>, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has discontinued funding for research on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as well as support for researchers from marginalized backgrounds. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">Executive Order 14168</a> ordered the NSF (and other federal agencies) to discontinue any research that focused on women, women in STEM, gender variation, and transsexual or transgender populations—and, oddly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2025/03/07/this-is-whats-behind-the-uproar-over-transgenic-mice/">transgenic mice</a>.</p>
<p>Then, another round of cancellations targeted research on misinformation and disinformation, a subject (among others) that Republican Senator Ted Cruz views as <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2024/10/new-cruz-investigation-reveals-how-biden-harris-diverted-billions-from-scientific-research-to-dei-activists">advancing neo-Marxist perspectives and class warfare</a>.</p>
<p>During the previous three years, I served as a program officer at the NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sosdci-science-science-discovery-communication-impact">Science of Science</a> (SOS) program. We reviewed, recommended, and awarded competitive research grants on science communication, including research on science communication to the public, communication of public priorities to scientists, and citizen engagement and participation in science. Projects my team reviewed and funded on misinformation are among the many others at NSF that have now been canceled (see the growing list <a href="https://airtable.com/appGKlSVeXniQZkFC/shrFxbl1YTqb3AyOO?jntvk%3Asort=eyJwZWw4ZlRSME8ycmFObWNUYyI6eyJjb2x1bW5JZCI6ImZsZHBpSTZqZUVYRWx3Und1IiwiYXNjZW5kaW5nIjp0cnVlfX0&amp;detail=eyJwYWdlSWQiOiJwYWduMzBQcXBvSzBCcHE2SCIsInJvd0lkIjoicmVjWnUwU3hLOVNRN25lcEYiLCJzaG93Q29tbWVudHMiOmZhbHNlLCJxdWVyeU9yaWdpbkhpbnQiOnsidHlwZSI6InBhZ2VFbGVtZW50IiwiZWxlbWVudElkIjoicGVsOGZUUjBPMnJhTm1jVGMiLCJxdWVyeUNvbnRhaW5lcklkIjoicGVsa25QS3haQU95am50dmsifX0">here</a>).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/editorial-censoring-the-scientific-enterprise-one-grant-at-a-time/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A judge who may be the first to rule on whether AI training data is fair use appeared skeptical Thursday at a hearing where Meta faced off with book authors over the social media company's alleged copyright infringement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meta, like most AI companies, holds that training must be deemed fair use, or else the entire AI industry could face immense setbacks, wasting precious time negotiating data contracts while falling behind global rivals. Meta urged the court to rule that AI training is a transformative use that only references books to create an entirely new work that doesn't replicate authors' ideas or replace books in their markets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the hearing that followed after both sides requested summary judgment, however, Judge Vince Chhabria pushed back on Meta attorneys arguing that the company's Llama AI models posed no threat to authors in their markets, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/judge-meta-case-weighs-key-question-ai-copyright-lawsuits-2025-05-01/">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/judge-on-metas-ai-training-i-just-dont-understand-how-that-can-be-fair-use/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is investigating two leading toothpaste makers over their use of fluoride, suggesting that they are "illegally marketing" the teeth cleaners to parents and kids "in ways that are misleading, deceptive, and dangerous."</p>
<p>The toothpaste makers in the crosshairs are Colgate-Palmolive Company, maker of Colgate toothpastes, and Proctor &amp; Gamble Manufacturing Co., which makes Crest toothpastes. In <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-launches-investigations-companies-illegally-marketing-toothpaste">an announcement Thursday</a>, Paxton said he has sent Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the companies.</p>
<p>The move is an escalation in an ongoing battle over fluoride, which effectively prevents dental cavities and improves oral health. Community water fluoridation has been hailed by health and dental experts as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html">one of the top 10 great public health interventions</a> for advancing oral health across communities, regardless of age, education, or income. But, despite the success, fluoride has always had detractors—from conspiracy theorists in the past suggesting the naturally occurring mineral is a form of communist mind control, to more recent times, in which low-quality, controversial studies have suggested that high doses may lower IQ in children.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/texas-goes-after-toothpaste-in-escalating-fight-over-fluoride/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the US Office of Management and Budget sent Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate's Appropriations Committee, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">an outline</a> of what to expect from the Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal. As expected, the budget includes widespread cuts, affecting nearly every branch of the federal government.</p>
<p>In keeping with the administration's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/nsf-director-resigns-amid-55-budget-cut-mass-layoffs-from-trump-admin/">attacks on research agencies</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-administrations-attack-on-university-research-accelerates/">places research gets done</a>, research funding will be taking an enormous hit, with the National Institutes of Health taking a 40 percent cut and the National Science Foundation losing 55 percent of its 2025 budget. But the budget goes well beyond those highlighted items, with nearly every place science gets done or funded targeted for cuts.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more shocking is the language used to justify the cuts, which reads more like a partisan rant than a serious budget document.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trumps-2026-budget-proposal-crippling-cuts-for-science-across-the-board/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Chevrolet provided flights from Washington, DC, to Charlotte and accommodation so Ars could drive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-chevrolet-blazer-ev-ss-first-drive-a-big-ride-and-handling-upgrade/">the Blazer EV SS</a>. I also took the opportunity to interview Ken Morris. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>CONCORD, N.C.—We weren't allowed cameras past the lobby of General Motors' shiny new Charlotte Technical Center. It's the automaker's new motorsport hub in the heart of NASCAR country, but the 130,000-square-foot (12,000 m2) facility is for much more than just stock cars. There are cutting-edge driver-in-the-loop simulators, shaker rigs for punishing suspension, and even an entire gym for drivers to work on their fitness.</p>
<p>It's also home to GM's racing command centers—conference rooms with walls of monitors where engineers and strategists provide remote support for GM's teams at their respective racetracks. It's pretty busy most weekends; this Saturday and Sunday, Chevrolet is racing in both IndyCar (in Alabama) and NASCAR (in Texas), next week, it's Chevrolet and Cadillac in Belgium for the World Endurance Championship and Northern California for IMSA, plus NASCAR in Kansas. Starting next year, F1's 24 races a year will be added to the mix as well.</p>
<p>The technical center had been sanitized before our group of journalists arrived, perhaps rendering the camera ban moot anyway. The smells, on the other hand, were intriguing—solvents, 3D printers, some other rapid prototyping, or maybe all of it all at once. If only websites were scratch and sniff.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/ai-strategists-formula-1-even-an-electric-nascar-we-talk-racing-with-gm/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This is not a drill. Screwworms are possibly the most aptly named parasites imaginable, both literally and figuratively. Screwworms—technically, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/myiasis/about-new-world-screwworm-myiasis/index.html">New World Screwworms</a>—are flies that lay eggs on the mucous membranes, orifices, and wounds of warm-blooded animals.

            <![CDATA[New feature searches hundreds of sources to build a document—but is it accurate?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/integrations">announced</a> significant upgrades to its AI assistant Claude, extending its research capabilities to run for up to 45 minutes before delivering comprehensive reports. The company also expanded its integration options, allowing Claude to connect with popular third-party services.</p>
<p>Much like Google's Deep <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">Research</a> (which debuted on December 11) and ChatGPT's <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">deep research</a> features (February 2), Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/research">announced</a> its own "Research" feature on April 15. Each can autonomously browse the web and other online sources to compile research reports in document format, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/after-24-hour-hackathon-hugging-faces-ai-research-agent-nearly-matches-openais-solution/">open source clones</a> of the technique have debuted as well.</p>
<p>Now, Anthropic is taking its Research feature a step further. The upgraded mode enables Claude to conduct "deeper" investigations across "hundreds of internal and external sources," Anthropic says. When users toggle the Research button, Claude breaks down complex requests into smaller components, examines each one, and compiles a report with citations linking to original sources.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/claudes-ai-research-mode-now-runs-for-up-to-45-minutes-before-delivering-reports/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After several years of escalating AI hysteria, we are all familiar with Google's desire to put Gemini in every one of its products. That can be annoying, but NotebookLM is not—this one actually works. NotebookLM, which helps you parse documents, videos, and more using Google's advanced AI models, has been available on the web <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-new-notebooklm-app-builds-a-custom-ai-based-on-a-source-document/">since 2023</a>, but Google recently confirmed it would finally get an Android app. You can get a look at the app now, but it's not yet available to install.</p>
<p>Until now, NotebookLM was only a website. You can visit it on your phone, but the interface is clunky compared to the desktop version. The arrival of the mobile app will change that. Google said it plans to release the app at Google I/O in late May, but the listing is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.labs.language.tailwind">live in the Play Store early</a>. You can pre-register to be notified when the download is live, but you'll have to tide yourself over with the screenshots for the time being.</p>
<p>NotebookLM relies on the same underlying technology as Google's other chatbots and AI projects, but instead of a general purpose robot, NotebookLM is only concerned with the documents you upload. It can assimilate text files, websites, and videos, including multiple files and source types for a single agent. It has a hefty context window of 500,000 tokens and supports document uploads as large as 200MB. Google says this creates a queryable "AI expert" that can answer detailed questions and brainstorm ideas based on the source data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-finally-reveals-notebooklm-android-app-but-you-cant-use-it-yet/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The distinctive chirps of singing cicadas are a highlight of summer in regions where they proliferate; those chirps even featured prominently on Lorde's 2021 album <em>Solar Power</em>. Now, Japanese scientists at the University of Tsukuba have figured out how to transform cicadas into cyborg insects capable of "playing" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachelbel's_Canon">Pachelbel's Canon</a>. They described their work in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16459">a preprint</a> published on the physics arXiv. You can listen to the sounds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p49K0L2fSig">here</a>.</p>
<p>Scientists have been intrigued by the potential of cyborg insects since the 1990s, when researchers began implanting tiny electrodes into cockroach antennae and shocking them to direct their movements. The idea was to use them as hybrid robots for search-and-rescue applications.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2015, Texas A&amp;M scientists <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2014.1363">found that</a> implanting electrodes into a cockroach's ganglion (the neuron cluster that controls its front legs) was remarkably effective at successfully steering the roaches 60 percent of the time. They outfitted the roaches with tiny backpacks synced with a remote controller and administered shocks to disrupt the insect's balance, forcing it to move in the desired direction</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/cyborg-cicadas-play-pachelbels-canon/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump escalated his attack on NPR and PBS on Thursday when he signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ending-taxpayer-subsidization-of-biased-media/">executive order</a> demanding the end of all federal funding supporting the news outlets.</p>
<p>In his order, Trump claimed that unlike in the 1960s, when the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was funded to ensure Americans had access to critical news, there are plenty of news options today. He has joined other Republicans accusing NPR and PBS of promoting a left-leaning bias. In a White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/president-trump-finally-ends-the-madness-of-npr-pbs/">statement</a>, he ordered any agency directly or indirectly funding the outlets' allegedly "woke propaganda" to "end the madness" as soon as possible, cutting off current funding "to the maximum extent allowed by law" and declining "to provide future funding."</p>
<p>Trump's authority to cut off CPB's funding continues to be disputed. In March, his administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/white-house-aims-to-defund-npr-and-pbs-in-move-slammed-as-cultural-sabotage/">reportedly</a> planned to direct Congress to rescind CPB funding—as both NPR and PBS are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/02/nx-s1-5384790/trump-orders-end-to-federal-funding-for-npr-and-pbs">fully funded through 2027</a>—but <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-signs-executive-order-directing-federal-funding-cuts-to-pbs-and-npr">according to PBS</a>, budget director Russell Vought has yet to send over any guidance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/blatantly-unlawful-trump-slammed-for-trying-to-defund-pbs-npr/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Have you ever pulled an all-nighter because of anxiety? Found yourself doomscrolling on your phone when you should have gone to bed hours ago? Purposely downed too many cups of coffee at three in the morning? There are some insomniac flies who would like a word.</p>
<p>It appears that fruit flies that spend their days lazily buzzing through the lush orchards and rainforests of Queensland, Australia, live in paradise. That changes at sunset. After dark, the flies are plagued by the <i>Gamasodesqueenslandicus </i>mites, which can attach themselves like ticks and literally eat the flies alive in their sleep. Researchers led by University of Cincinnati biologist Joshua Benoit have now discovered that flies that have had enough of the mites will stay awake at the expense of their health.</p>
<p>These mite-resistant flies drain their nutrient reserves to stay up all night, making them more susceptible to starvation. Insomniacs consumed more oxygen and were generally more active than non-resistant flies; they also experienced changes in gene activity related to their metabolisms.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/some-flies-go-insomniac-to-ward-off-parasites/">Read full article</a></p>

A "skinny" budget simply means that while the document contains top-line numbers for agencies and their programs, it does not provide much in the way of specific allocations.</p>
<p>The document was delivered to the Senate Committee on Appropriations on Friday and signed by Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. A "full fiscal plan" will follow in the coming weeks. This is the first step in the budget process, in which Congress has the critical role of actually writing a budget.</p>
<p>"I look forward to working with you to achieve significant budgetary savings for the American people within the spending programs under your jurisdiction," Vought wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/white-house-budget-seeks-to-end-sls-orion-and-lunar-gateway-programs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a federal court <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Contempt-order.pdf">issued a scathing order</a> Wednesday night that found Apple in "willful violation" of an injunction meant to allow iOS apps to provide alternate payment options, app developers are capitalizing on the moment. Spotify may be the quickest of them all.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple had sought to thwart <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/">a 2021 injunction</a> and engaged in an "obvious cover-up" around its actions, <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-01/following-landmark-court-ruling-spotify-submits-new-app-update-to-apple-to-benefit-u-s-consumers/">Spotify announced in a blog post</a> that it had submitted an updated app to Apple. The updated app can show specific plan prices, link out to Spotify's website for plan changes and purchases that avoid Apple's 30 percent commission on in-app purchases, and display promotional offers, all of which were disallowed under Apple's prior App Store rules.</p>
<p>Spotify's post adds that Apple's newly court-enforced policy "opens the door to other seamless buying opportunities that will directly benefit creators (think easy-to-purchase audiobooks)." Spotify posted on X (formerly Twitter) Friday morning that <a href="https://x.com/SpotifyNews/status/1918295378283172230">the updated app was approved by Apple</a>. Apple made substantial modifications to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">its App Review Guidelines</a> on Friday and emailed registered developers regarding the changes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/spotify-jumps-on-apples-court-loss-gets-approved-for-non-app-store-payments/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It has been over six years since Epic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/epic-undercuts-steam-with-new-store-that-gives-devs-more-money/">started undercutting Steam's 30 percent revenue share for developers</a>, asking for just 12 percent of sales on its then-new Epic Games Store. Now, Epic is going even further by reducing those fees to zero for a game's first $1 million in annual sales.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">newly announced fee structure</a> will go into effect in June, Epic said, and will apply to a developer's revenue on a "per app" basis. After the first $1 million in annual sales, apps will be charged the usual 12 percent fee for listing on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Epic has offered a financial break to smaller developers. Back in 2011, the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/02/no-royalties-on-unreal-development-kit-until-5000-in-sales/">eschewed royalty payments for the first $50,000 in sales</a> for projects made with the newly free Unreal Development Kit. By 2020, that royalty-free grace period for Unreal Engine projects <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/unreal-engine-is-now-royalty-free-until-a-game-makes-a-whopping-1-mill/">was increased to cover the first $1 million in lifetime sales</a> for a project.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/epic-games-store-completely-eliminates-revenue-fees-for-smaller-developers/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In the nearly two months since former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/former-google-ceo-eric-schmidt-is-the-new-leader-of-relativity-space/">acquired Relativity Space</a>, the billionaire has not said much publicly about his plans for the launch company. However, his intentions for Relativity now appear to be increasingly clear: He wants to have the capability to launch a significant amount of computing infrastructure into space.</p>
<p>We know this because Schmidt appeared before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/HXoXMETZUiE">during a hearing</a> in April, speaking on the future of AI and US competitiveness. Among the topics raised then was the need for more electricity—both renewable and non-renewable—to power data centers that will facilitate the computing needs for AI development and applications. Schmidt noted that an average nuclear power plant in the United States generates 1 gigawatt of power.</p>
<p>"People are planning 10 gigawatt data centers," Schmidt said. "Gives you a sense of how big this crisis is. Many people think that the energy demand for our industry will go from 3 percent to 99 percent of total generation. One of the estimates that I think is most likely is that data centers will require an additional 29 gigawatts of power by 2027, and 67 more gigawatts by 2030. These things are industrial at a scale that I have never seen in my life."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/eric-schmidt-apparently-bought-relativity-space-to-put-data-centers-in-orbit/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Rockstar's highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will finally launch on May 26, 2026, Rockstar Games said in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">a Friday morning announcement</a>.</p>
<p>That means the game will miss the "2025" release window that the developer announced alongside <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">the game's first trailer in late 2023</a>. That delay is needed, Rockstar said, so the company can use "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected," Rockstar wrote in its announcement. "The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/gta-vi-will-miss-2025-after-all-new-target-is-may-26-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A young man with no government experience who has yet to even complete his undergraduate degree is working for Elon Musk’s so-called <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/doge/">Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</a> at the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hud-systems-access-ai-proptech-real-estate-mobile-home/">Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)</a> and has been tasked with using artificial intelligence to rewrite the agency’s rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Christopher Sweet was introduced to HUD employees as being originally from San Francisco and, most recently, a third-year student at the University of Chicago, where he was studying economics and data science, in an email sent to staffers earlier this month.</p>
<p>“I'd like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,’” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hud-systems-access-ai-proptech-real-estate-mobile-home/">Scott Langmack</a>, a DOGE staffer and chief operating officer of an AI real estate company, wrote in an email widely shared within the agency and reviewed by WIRED. “With family roots from Brazil, Chris speaks Portuguese fluently. Please join me in welcoming Chris to HUD!”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/doge-put-a-college-student-in-charge-of-using-ai-to-rewrite-regulations/">Read full article</a></p>
