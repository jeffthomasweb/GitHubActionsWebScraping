<p>If you've been sleeping on the Akira Kurosawa-inspired, <em>Assassin's Creed</em>-esque samurai game <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, you've been missing out. Given that it recently got a PC release, this is a great time to catch up on it—but now there's even more reason to do so, as Sony just announced a sequel titled <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>.</p>
<p>Slated for a 2025 release, the game bears similarities to its predecessor. It follows a wandering samurai who rides horses across picturesque, wind-swept fields, befriends animals, and defeats enemies in katana duels.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>was set on Tsushima Island during the time of the Mongol invasion, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is (fittingly) set around the foot of Mount Yōtei, one of Japan's most picturesque locales—the area is called Hokkaido today.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052227#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052227&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When security researcher Johann Rehberger recently reported a vulnerability in ChatGPT that allowed attackers to store false information and malicious instructions in a user’s long-term memory settings, OpenAI summarily closed the inquiry, labeling the flaw a safety issue, not, technically speaking, a security concern.</p>
<p>So Rehberger did what all good researchers do: He created a proof-of-concept exploit that used the vulnerability to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. OpenAI engineers took notice and issued a partial fix earlier this month.</p>
<h2>Strolling down memory lane</h2>
<p>The vulnerability abused long-term conversation memory, a feature OpenAI began testing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/amnesia-begone-soon-chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-tell-it-between-sessions/">in February</a> and made more broadly available <a href="https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/">in September</a>. Memory with ChatGPT stores information from previous conversations and uses it as context in all future conversations. That way, the LLM can be aware of details such as a user’s age, gender, philosophical beliefs, and pretty much anything else, so those details don’t have to be inputted during each conversation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052198#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052198&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Caroline Ellison was sentenced Tuesday to 24 months for her role in covering up <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/ftx-fraudster-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-to-25-years-in-prison/">Sam Bankman-Fried's rampant fraud</a> at FTX—which caused <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/ftx-to-pay-12-7b-to-victims-of-sam-bankman-frieds-massive-scheme/">billions in customer losses</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing the judge at sentencing, Ellison started out by explaining "how sorry I am" for concealing FTX's lies, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-09-24/caroline-ellison-sentencing?srnd=phx-latest">reported live</a> from the hearing.</p>
<p>"I participated in a criminal conspiracy that ultimately stole billions of dollars from people who entrusted their money with us," Ellison reportedly said while sniffling. "The human brain is truly bad at understanding big numbers," she added, and "not a day goes by" that she doesn't "think about all of the people I hurt.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052068#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052068&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, Stability AI <a href="https://stability.ai/news/james-cameron-joins-stability-ai-board-of-directors">announced</a> that renowned filmmaker James Cameron—of <em>Terminator</em> and Skynet fame—has joined its board of directors. Stability is best known for its pioneering but highly controversial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a> series of AI image-synthesis models, first launched in 2022, which can generate images based on text descriptions.</p>

<p>"I’ve spent my career seeking out emerging technologies that push the very boundaries of what’s possible, all in the service of telling incredible stories," said Cameron in a statement. "I was at the forefront of CGI over three decades ago, and I’ve stayed on the cutting edge since. Now, the intersection of generative AI and CGI image creation is the next wave."</p>
<p>Cameron is perhaps best known as the director behind blockbusters like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>Titanic</em>, and <em>Aliens</em>, but in AI circles, he may be most relevant for the co-creation of the character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a>, a fictional AI system that triggers nuclear Armageddon and dominates humanity in the <em>Terminator</em> media franchise. Similar fears of AI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/">taking over the world</a> have since jumped into reality and recently sparked attempts to regulate existential risk from AI systems through measures like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/08/as-contentious-california-ai-safety-bill-passes-critics-push-governor-for-veto/">SB-1047</a> in California.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052114#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052114&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <p><em>This is an excerpt from Chapter 11 of the book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/759707/reentry-by-eric-berger/"><em>REENTRY: SpaceX, Elon Musk and the Reusable Rockets that Launched a Second Space Age</em></a> by our own Eric Berger. The book will be published on September 24, 2024. This excerpt describes a fateful meeting 10 years ago at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, where the space agency's leaders met to decide which companies should be awarded billions of dollars to launch astronauts into orbit.</em></p>
    

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the early 2010s, NASA's Commercial Crew competition boiled down to three players: Boeing, SpaceX, and a Colorado-based company building a spaceplane, Sierra Nevada Corporation. Each had its own advantages. Boeing was the blue blood, with decades of spaceflight experience. SpaceX had already built a capsule, Dragon. And some NASA insiders nostalgically loved Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser space plane, which mimicked the shuttle's winged design.</p>
<p>This competition neared a climax in 2014 as NASA prepared to winnow the field to one company, or at most two, to move from the design phase into actual development. In May of that year Musk revealed his Crew Dragon spacecraft to the world with a characteristically showy event at the company’s headquarters in Hawthorne. As lights flashed and a smoke machine vented, Musk quite literally raised a curtain on a black-and-white capsule. He was most proud to reveal how Dragon would land. Never before had a spacecraft come back from orbit under anything but parachutes or gliding on wings. Not so with the new Dragon. It had powerful thrusters, called SuperDracos, that would allow it to land under its own power.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051373#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051373&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB3048">vetoed</a> a bill that would have required makers of web browsers and mobile operating systems to let consumers send opt-out preference signals that could limit businesses' use of personal information.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB3048">bill</a> approved by the State Legislature last month would have required an opt-out signal "that communicates the consumer's choice to opt out of the sale and sharing of the consumer's personal information or to limit the use of the consumer's sensitive personal information." It would have made it illegal for a business to offer a web browser or mobile operating system without a setting that lets consumers "send an opt-out preference signal to businesses with which the consumer interacts."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AB-3048-Veto-Message.pdf">veto message</a> sent to the Legislature Friday, Newsom said he would not sign the bill. Newsom wrote that he shares the "desire to enhance consumer privacy," noting that he previously signed a bill "requir[ing] the California Privacy Protection Agency to establish an accessible deletion mechanism allowing consumers to request that data brokers delete all of their personal information."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052064#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052064&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The old joke about the dinosaurs going extinct because they didn't have a space program may be overselling the need for one. It turns out you can probably divert some of the more threatening asteroids with nothing more than the products of a nuclear weapons program. But it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/04/a-gentle-nudge-with-a-nuke-deflecting-earth-bound-asteroids/">doesn't work</a> the way you probably think it does.</p>
<p>Obviously, nuclear weapons are great at destroying things, so why not asteroids? That won't work because a lot of the damage that nukes generate comes from the blast wave as it propagates through the atmosphere. And the environment around asteroids is notably short on atmosphere, so blast waves won't happen. But you can still use a nuclear weapon's radiation to vaporize part of the asteroid's surface, creating a very temporary, very hot atmosphere on one side of the asteroid. This should create enough pressure to deflect the asteroid's orbit, potentially causing it to fly safely past Earth.</p>
<p>But will it work? Some scientists at Sandia National Lab have decided to tackle a very cool question with one of the cooler bits of hardware on Earth: <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/#The%20Sandia%20Z-Machine-1">the Z machine</a>, which can create a pulse of X-rays bright enough to vaporize rock. They estimate that a nuclear weapon can probably impart enough force to deflect asteroids as large as 4 kilometers across.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052055#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052055&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>United Launch Alliance is free to compete for NASA contracts with its new Vulcan rocket after a successful test flight earlier this year, ending a period where SpaceX was the only company competing for rights to launch the agency's large science missions.</p>
<p>For several years, ULA was unable to bid for NASA launch contracts after the company sold all of its remaining Atlas V rockets to other customers, primarily for Amazon's Project Kuiper Internet network. ULA could not submit its new Vulcan rocket, which will replace the Atlas V, for NASA to consider in future launch contracts until the Vulcan completed at least one successful flight, according to Tim Dunn, senior launch director at NASA's Launch Services Program.</p>
<p>The Vulcan rocket's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/ulas-vulcan-rocket-shot-for-the-moon-on-debut-launch-and-hit-a-bullseye/">first certification flight on January 8</a>, called Cert-1, was nearly flawless, demonstrating the launcher's methane-fueled BE-4 engines built by Blue Origin and an uprated twin-engine Centaur upper stage. A second test flight, known as Cert-2, is scheduled to lift off no earlier than October 4 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Assuming the upcoming launch is as successful as the first one, the US Space Force aims to launch its first mission on a Vulcan rocket by the end of the year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051934#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051934&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Software fixes are now responsible for more than 1 in 5 automotive recalls. That's the key finding from a decade's worth of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recall data, according to an analysis from the law firm DeMayo Law. While that's a sign of growing inconvenience for drivers, the silver lining is that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/jaguar-i-pace-fire-risk-leads-to-recall-instructions-to-park-outdoors/">a software patch</a> is usually a much quicker fix than something requiring hardware replacement.</p>
<p>"Our analysis suggests we're witnessing a shift in how automotive recalls are handled. The growing number of software-related recalls, coupled with the ability to address issues remotely, could revolutionize the recall process for both manufacturers and vehicle owners," said a spokesperson for DeMayo Law.</p>
<p>In 2014, 34 of 277 automotive recalls were software fixes. The percentage of software recalls floated around 12–13 percent (apart from a spike in 2015) before growing steadily from 2020. In 2021, 16 percent of automotive recalls (61 out of 380) were for software. In 2022, almost 22 percent of recalls were software fixes (76 out of 348), and last year topped 23 percent (82 out of 356).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052050#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052050&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Broadcom is accusing AT&amp;T of trying to "rewind the clock and force" Broadcom "to sell support services for perpetual software licenses... that VMware has discontinued from its product line and to which AT&amp;T has no contractual right to purchase.” The statement comes from legal documents Broadcom filed in response to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/att-sues-broadcom-for-refusing-to-renew-perpetual-license-support/">AT&amp;T's lawsuit against Broadcom</a> for refusing to renew support for its VMware perpetual licenses [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Broadcom_court_filing.pdf">PDF</a>].</p>
<p>On August 29, AT&amp;T filed a lawsuit [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/att_broadcom.pdf">PDF</a>] against Broadcom, alleging that Broadcom is breaking a contract by refusing to provide a one-year renewal for support for perpetually licensed VMware software. Broadcom famously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">ended perpetual VMware license</a> sales shortly after closing its acquisition in favor of a subscription model featuring about two bundles of products rather than many SKUs.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T claims its VMware contract (forged before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/05/broadcom-will-pay-61-billion-to-become-the-latest-company-to-acquire-vmware/">Broadcom's acquisition</a> closed in November) entitles it to three one-year renewals of perpetual license support, and it's currently trying to enact the second one. AT&amp;T says it uses VMware products to run 75,000 virtual machines (VMs) across about 8,600 servers. The VMs are for supporting customer services operations and operations management efficiency, per AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T is asking the Supreme Court of the State of New York to stop Broadcom from ending VMware support services for AT&amp;T and for "further relief" as deemed necessary.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052026#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052026&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Sony's decision to require a PlayStation Network sign-in for the PC port of the single-player <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> is drawing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/zeosg2/god_of_war_rag_being_review_bombed_on_metacritic/">expected levels</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1d4gnpe/god_of_war_ragnarok_pc_requires_a_psn_account/">ire</a> from frustrated PC gamers. Now, though, those angry players can actually do something about the problem thanks to a new mod that removes the PSN log-in requirement from the game entirely.</p>
<p>The NoPSSDK mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description">hosted on NexusMods</a>, promises to "fully strip the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement for <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>." The <a href="https://github.com/iArtorias/nopssdk">open source mod</a> makes use of a simple <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Detours">Microsoft Detours</a> library to get around the game's calls to the PlayStation Network API without "touch[ing] or modify[ing] any original game code."</p>
<p>The mod, which has already seen one update related to simulating offline mode, has been downloaded just under 2,000 times as of this writing. "I will try to maintain the tool even if something changes, but hopefully nothing crucial happens," mod author iArtorias <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=posts">wrote in a NexusMods post</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052034#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052034&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>There are lots of laptops—maybe all of them—on which you can run a Linux desktop. There are a few vendors that offer laptops with extensive Linux compatibility. And then there are a select few that specialize in Linux laptops, support them, and even customize them.</p>
<p><a href="https://kfocus.org/">Kubuntu Focus</a> is one of the select few. It sent me one of its laptops to test the <a href="https://kfocus.org/spec/spec-ir14.html">Ir14 Gen 2</a>, which runs, of course, <a href="https://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>, the KDE desktop variant of Ubuntu. The “Focus” in the company name comes from what it is hoping to provide: a device on which you can just do your work without worrying about what’s happening deeper in your system. Go ahead and <code>sudo apt update</code>, says the Focus team; we’ve got you.</p>
<p>I used the Ir14 Gen 2 for Ars Technica work and my personal needs for at least two weeks. Setting the system up with Focus’ guided wizard, installing apps from its store, and refusing to touch any of the deeper system files, I achieved something pretty remarkable: no unexpected behaviors on a Linux laptop. Had anything gone wrong, I could reasonably lean back on the system’s rollbacks, which I used a couple of times with no problem.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051198#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051198&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Twenty days after it rolled out to Blue Origin's launch site in Florida, the second stage of the massive New Glenn rocket underwent a successful hot-fire test on Monday.</p>
<p>The second stage—known as GS2 for Glenn stage 2—ignited for 15 seconds as part of the "risk reduction" hot-fire test, <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenn-completes-second-stage-hotfire">the company said</a>. The two BE-3U engines, fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen and each producing 173,000 pounds of thrust, burned with a nearly transparent flame that approached a temperature of 6,000° Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>This marked the first time that Blue Origin, a space company founded by Jeff Bezos more than two decades ago, has integrated and fired an orbital rocket stage. After the test, Blue Origin said it is still tracking toward a November launch of the New Glenn rocket.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051943#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051943&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The H5N1 bird flu appears to be stampeding through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/bird-flu-reaches-cows-in-california-the-countrys-largest-milk-producer/">dairy farms in California</a>, the country's largest milk producer. Over the weekend, the total number of confirmed infected cow herds stunningly doubled, going from <a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal_Health/HPAI.html">17 last Thursday</a> to <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">34 Monday morning</a>, according to state and federal officials.</p>
<p>With the new tally, California now ranks second among all affected states for having the most herds with avian influenza. Only Colorado, which has adopted bulk milk-tank surveillance, has more, with 64 herds confirmed. California's high ranking is despite the fact that it only reported its first three infected herds on August 30, while the dairy outbreak was first confirmed on March 25 and thought to have begun late last year.</p>
<p>To date, 232 herds in 14 states have been infected with the bird flu.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051926#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051926&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman outlined his vision for an AI-driven future of tech progress and global prosperity in a new personal blog post titled "<a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/">The Intelligence Age</a>." The essay paints a picture of human advancement accelerated by AI, with Altman suggesting that superintelligent AI could emerge within the next decade.</p>

<p>"It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there," he wrote.</p>
<p>OpenAI's current goal is to <a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/">create AGI</a> (artificial general intelligence), which is a term for hypothetical technology that could match human intelligence in performing many tasks without the need for specific training. By contrast, superintelligence surpasses AGI, and it could be seen as a hypothetical level of machine intelligence that can dramatically outperform humans at any intellectual task, perhaps even to an unfathomable degree.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051754#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051754&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Late last week, Russia's military planned to launch a Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on a test flight from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Imagery captured over the weekend from commercial satellites suggests the missile exploded before or during launch.</p>
<p>This is at least the second time an RS-28 Sarmat missile has failed in less than two years, dealing a blow to the country's nuclear forces days after the head of the Russian legislature issued a veiled threat to use the missile against Europe if Western allies approved Ukraine's use of long-range weapons against Russia.</p>
<p>Commercial satellite imagery collected by Maxar and Planet show before-and-after views of the Sarmat missile silo at Plesetsk, a military base about 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of Moscow. The view from one of Maxar's imaging satellites Saturday revealed unmistakable damage at the launch site, with a large crater centered on the opening to the underground silo.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051740#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051740&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Five years ago, researchers made a grim discovery—a legitimate Android app in the Google Play market that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/google-play-app-with-100-million-downloads-executed-secret-payloads/">surreptitiously made malicious</a> by a library the developers used to earn advertising revenue. With that, the app was infected with code that caused 100 million infected devices to connect to attacker-controlled servers and download secret payloads.</p>
<p>Now, history is repeating itself. Researchers from the same Moscow, Russia-based security firm <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/necro-infects-android-users/52201/">reported Monday</a> that they found two new apps, downloaded from Play 11 million times, that were infected with the same malware family. The researchers, from Kaspersky, believe a malicious software developer kit for integrating advertising capabilities is once again responsible.</p>
<h2>Clever tradecraft</h2>
<p>Software developer kits, better known as SDKs, are apps that provide developers with frameworks that can greatly speed up the app-creation process by streamlining repetitive tasks. An unverified SDK module incorporated into the apps ostensibly supported the display of ads. Behind the scenes, it provided a host of advanced methods for stealthy communication with malicious servers, where the apps would upload user data and download malicious code that could be executed and updated at any time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051854#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051854&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2024/cloudflare-helps-content-creators-regain-control-of-content-from-ai/">announced</a> new tools Monday that it claims will help end the era of endless AI scraping by giving all sites on its network the power to block bots in one click.</p>
<p>That will help stop the firehose of unrestricted AI scraping, but, perhaps even more intriguing to content creators everywhere, Cloudflare says it will also make it easier to identify which content that bots scan most, so that sites can eventually wall off access and charge bots to scrape their most valuable content. To pave the way for that future, Cloudflare is also creating a marketplace for all sites to negotiate content deals based on more granular AI audits of their sites.</p>
<p>These tools, Cloudflare's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2024/cloudflare-helps-content-creators-regain-control-of-content-from-ai/">blog</a> said, give content creators "for the first time" ways "to quickly and easily understand how AI model providers are using their content, and then take control of whether and how the models are able to access it."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051732#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051732&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
