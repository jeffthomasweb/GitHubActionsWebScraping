              <![CDATA[<p>Boeing's Starliner spacecraft safely landed empty in the New Mexico desert about eight weeks ago, marking a hollow end to the company's historic first human spaceflight. The vehicle's passengers during its upward flight to the International Space Station earlier this summer, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, remain in space, awaiting a ride home on SpaceX's Crew Dragon.</p>
<p>Boeing has been steadfastly silent about the fate of Starliner since then. Two senior officials, including Boeing's leader of human spaceflight, John Shannon, were originally due to attend a post-landing news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston. However, just minutes before the news conference was to begin, two seats were removed—the Boeing officials were no-shows.</p>
<p>In lieu of speaking publicly, Boeing issued a terse statement early on the morning of September 8, attributing it to Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's commercial crew program. "We will review the data and determine the next steps for the program," Nappi said, in part.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/nearly-two-months-after-starliners-return-boeing-remains-mum-on-its-future/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.18 of the Rocket Report! One of the most intriguing bits of news this week is the rolling of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket out to its launch complex in Florida. With two months remaining in 2024, will the company make owner Jeff Bezos' deadline for getting to orbit this year? We'll have to see, as the Rocket Report is not prepared to endorse any timelines at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>ESA selects four companies for reusable launch</strong>. The European Space Agency announced this week the selection of Rocket Factory Augsburg, The Exploration Company, ArianeGroup, and Isar Aerospace to develop reusable rocket technology, <a href="https://europeanspaceflight.com/esa-selects-four-companies-to-develop-reusable-rocket-technology/">European Spaceflight reports</a>. The four awardees are divided into two initiatives focused on the development of reusable rocket technology: the Technologies for High-thrust Reusable Space Transportation (THRUST!) project and the Boosters for European Space Transportation (BEST!) project. The awarded companies will now begin contract negotiations with ESA to further develop and test their solutions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/rocket-report-new-glenn-shows-out-ula-acknowledges-some-fairing-issues/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The European Commission announced Thursday it plans to sign a contract with the continent's leading space companies before the end of the year to begin development of a 290-satellite broadband Internet network estimated to cost more than 10 billion euros (about $10.9 billion).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/iris2-european-commission-awards-concession-contract-spacerise-consortium-2024-10-31_en">press release announcing the contract award</a> to IRIS²—known as Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite—did not specify the financial details of the agreement, but European media has widely reported the 10 billion euro cost. The commission's decision follows an evaluation of the best-and-final offer from the SpaceRISE consortium formed by European satellite network operators SES, Eutelsat, and Hispasat.</p>
<h2>We’ll do it ourselves</h2>
<p>The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/europes-major-satellite-players-line-up-to-build-starlink-competitor/">managing the IRIS² program</a>, which will also receive funding from the European Space Agency and European industry in a public-private partnership. European governments previously expected to provide around 60 percent of the funding for the initiative. Under that plan, European industry would supply roughly 40 percent of the money in a public-private partnership. The specifics of the final cost-sharing arrangement were not available Thursday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/finally-a-sign-of-life-for-europes-sovereign-satellite-internet-constellation/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. used a Zoom call to tell his supporters that Donald Trump had promised him "control" of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the federal agency that includes the Centers for Disease Control, Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, as well as the Department of Agriculture. Given Kennedy's support for debunked anti-vaccine nonsense, this represents a potential public health nightmare.</p>
<p>A few days after, Howard Lutnick, a co-chair of Trump's transition team, appeared on CNN to deny that RFK Jr. would be put in charge of HHS. But he followed that with a long rant in which he echoed Kennedy's spurious claims about vaccines. This provides yet another indication of how anti-vaccine activism has become deeply enmeshed with Republican politics, to the point where it may be just as bad even if Kennedy isn't appointed.</p>
<h2>Trump as Kennedy’s route to power</h2>
<p>Kennedy has a long history of misinformation regarding health, with a special focus on vaccines. This includes the extensively debunked suggestion that there is a correlation between vaccinations and autism incidence, and it extends to a general skepticism about vaccine safety. That's mixed with conspiracy theories regarding collusion between federal regulators and pharmaceutical companies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/rfk-jr-claims-trump-promised-to-put-him-in-charge-of-nih-cdc-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Colorado Department of State said it accidentally posted a spreadsheet containing "partial passwords" for voting systems. The department said there is no "immediate security threat" because two passwords are needed for each component, but it is trying to complete password changes by the end of today. There were reportedly hundreds of BIOS passwords accessible on the website for over two months before being removed last week.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/newsRoom/pressReleases/2024/PR20241029Passwords.html">government statement issued Tuesday</a> said the agency "is aware that a spreadsheet located on the Department's website improperly included a hidden tab including partial passwords to certain components of Colorado voting systems. This does not pose an immediate security threat to Colorado's elections, nor will it impact how ballots are counted."</p>
<p>Secretary of State Jena Griswold <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/10/30/interview-jena-griswold-voting-equipment-passwords-posted-online/">told Colorado Public Radio</a> that "we do not think there is an immediate security threat to Colorado elections, in part because partial passwords don't get you anywhere. Two unique passwords are needed for every election equipment component. Physical access is needed. And under Colorado law, voting equipment is stored in secure rooms that require secure ID badges. There's 24/7 video cameras. There's restricted access to the secure ballot areas, strict chain of custody, and it's a felony to access voting equipment without authorization."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/colorado-scrambles-to-change-voting-system-passwords-after-accidental-leak/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>You might think that since <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> (which was released last Friday) is the 21st game in the franchise, it wouldn't be that highly anticipated. You'd be wrong. Last week's entry set multiple records when it launched.</p>
<p>Specifically, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the game set new records for Game Pass subscribers, particularly for a first-day game launch. That's, of course, to be expected—Call of Duty was a major reason why Microsoft acquired Activision, the longtime publisher of the series.</p>
<p>It gets a little zanier, though. The Internet service provider Comcast says <em>Black Ops 6</em> was directly responsible for 19 percent of its overall traffic the week of the launch, according to a report in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">The Verge</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-accounted-for-19-of-comcast-internet-traffic-this-week/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Residents in the Southwest District Health in Idaho are no longer able to get COVID-19 vaccines from public health clinics after the district's board of directors voted 4–3 recently to stop administering the shot.</p>
<p>The vote came during a hearing swamped by misinformation and conspiracy theories about the lifesaving vaccines. It's a chilling reminder of how dangerous anti-vaccine sentiment and misinformation have infested communities nationwide, causing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/us-vaccinations-fall-again-as-more-parents-refuse-lifesaving-shots-for-kids/">vaccination rates to slip across the country</a> and making way for deadly outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>
<h2>Safety net</h2>
<p>In a hearing last week, Perry Jansen, the health district’s medical director, gave the only presentation that favored keeping COVID-19 vaccines available through district clinics. He echoed the points that all health experts and major health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have pointed out for years: that COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be safe, lifesaving immunizations that are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?s_cid=SEM.GA:PAI:RG_AO_GA_TM_A18_C-CVD-StayUpToDate-Brd:covid%20vaccine%20schedule:SEM00028&amp;utm_id=SEM.GA:PAI:RG_AO_GA_TM_A18_C-CVD-StayUpToDate-Brd:covid%20vaccine%20schedule:SEM00028&amp;gad_source=1">recommended for everyone ages 6 months and up</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/idaho-health-district-abandons-covid-shots-amid-flood-of-anti-vaccine-nonsense/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What's the point of recruiting hundreds of thousands of X users to fact-check misleading posts before they go viral if those users' accurate Community Notes are never displayed?</p>
<p>That's the question the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) is asking after digging through a million notes in a <a href="https://x.com/i/communitynotes/download-data">public X dataset</a> to find out how many misleading claims spreading widely on X about the US election weren't quickly fact-checked.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://counterhate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CCDH.CommunityNotes.FINAL-30.10.pdf">report</a>, the CCDH flagged 283 misleading X posts fueling election disinformation spread this year that never displayed a Community Note. Of these, 74 percent were found to have accurate notes proposed but ultimately never displayed—apparently due to toxic X users gaming Community Notes to hide information they politically disagree with.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/toxic-x-users-sabotage-community-notes-that-could-derail-disinfo-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Halloween is upon us, which means costumes, candy, and settling in for a nice long night of scary movies. For those who crave a bit of humor with their blood-soaked scares, I've compiled a list of some of my favorite horror comedies for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>What constitutes a horror comedy? Is it merging classic creature features with goofy slapstick humor? Is it primarily super scary with a few notes of humor? Is the humor sharply satirical or primarily delivered by wisecracking characters? Is it parody? Or does good horror comedy go full meta, poking fun at the tropes while sneaking in incisive cultural commentary?</p>
<p>Horror comedy is all of those things and more, which is why picking films to include on this list proved so tricky. For instance, <em>The Mummy</em> (1999) features a classic monster, but it fits just as well in the action/comedy category, while <em>Ghostbuster</em>s (1984) is pretty much straight-up comedy. Yet I could have included both on this list without too many complaints. In the end, I cut the list down to 20, opting for a sampler that features blockbusters, vintage films, cult classics, and contemporary offerings, each with its own unique mix of horror and comedic elements. Feel free to add your own favorites in the comments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/celebrate-halloween-with-20-of-our-favorite-horror-comedies/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google's <a href="https://about.google/">stated mission</a> is to "organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful." For a very long time, then, it has been odd that one of its biggest platforms, Android, lacked for a real default weather app. You know, weather—the kind of information that's relevant to almost everybody, every single day and is one of humanity's default topics of conversation.</p>
<p>Android phones had, for a while, a "Weather" widget (and an icon inside the "At a Glance" widget) that essentially provided a framed webpage of useful weather data, accompanied by <a href="https://screenrant.com/google-weather-frog-app-android-download-how/">a plucky frog</a> who illustrated the conditions. The frog was popular (even getting <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/new-years-eve-2019/">his own New Year's doodle</a>), and the basic weather stats were useful. But it couldn't compare to Apple's weather, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/apple-acquires-dark-sky-weather-app-and-its-bad-news-for-android-users/">nabbed</a> the minute-by-minute precipitation of Dark Sky and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/android-version-of-popular-dark-sky-weather-app-shuts-down/">ended its life on Android</a>. There were lots of third-party weather apps—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/ars-staff-mobile-apps/">Ars staffers</a> like RadarScope and Carrot Weather, for example—but it remained an odd choice for Google to mostly ignore the category.</p>
<p>Google, and its all-in AI obsession, cedes no longer. As <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/feature-drop-october-2024/#pixel-phones">suggested by Google in October</a>, and spotted by blogs like <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/30/pixel-weather-rolling-out/">9to5Google</a>, an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.weather&amp;pli=1">honest-to-goodness weather app</a>, named "Weather," is rolling out to Pixel phones model 6 and newer running Android 15, having started on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-family-the-just-hardware-review-no-ai/">the Pixel 9 models</a>. As with most Android things, the rollout is gradual, and you may not have it right away; check that you're updated to the latest Android 15 and Play Services versions to clear the way.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/pixel-phones-are-getting-an-actual-weather-app-in-2024-with-a-bit-of-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>More than 500 Amazon workers reportedly signed a letter to Amazon Web Services' (AWS) CEO this week, sharing their outrage over Amazon's upcoming return-to-office (RTO) policy that will force workers into offices <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/amazon-kills-remote-working-tells-workers-to-be-in-office-5-days-a-week/">five days per week</a>.</p>
<p>In September, Amazon announced that starting in 2025, workers will no longer be allowed to work remotely twice a week. At the time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the move would make it easier for workers "to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-workers-appalled-by-aws-ceos-return-office-remarks-urge-policy-reversal-2024-10-30/">Reuters</a> reported today that it viewed a letter from a swath of workers sent to AWS chief Matt Garman on Wednesday regarding claims he reportedly made during an all-hands meeting this month. Garman reportedly told attendees that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/amazon-exec-tells-employees-to-work-elsewhere-if-they-dislike-rto-policy/">9 out of 10 employees</a> he spoke with support the five-day in-office work policy.

              <![CDATA[<p>Russia has fined Google an amount that no entity on the planet could pay in hopes of getting YouTube to lift bans on Russian channels, including pro-Kremlin and state-run news outlets.</p>
<p>The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxvnwkl5kgo">wrote</a> that a Russian court fined Google two undecillion rubles, which in dollar terms is $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. The amount "is far greater than the world's total GDP, which is estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be $110 trillion."</p>
<p>The fine is apparently that large because it was issued several years ago and has been repeatedly doubling. An RBC news <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/29/10/2024/671fd2389a794726b01d3af3">report</a> this week provided details on the court case from an anonymous source.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/googles-compounding-fines-in-russia-add-up-to-more-than-worlds-total-gdp/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest bummers about the modern Internet has been the decline of Google Search. Once an essential part of using the web, it's now a shadow of its former self, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-search-is-losing-the-fight-with-seo-spam-study-says/">full of SEO-fueled junk</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41767648">AI-generated spam</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, OpenAI announced a new feature of ChatGPT that could potentially replace Google Search for some people: an upgraded web search capability for its AI assistant that provides answers with source attribution during conversations. The feature, officially called "ChatGPT with Search," makes web search automatic based on user questions, with an option to manually trigger searches through a new web search icon.</p>
<p>OpenAI hopes the new capability will streamline web searching by eliminating the need for multiple searches and link exploration that traditional search engines sometimes require. Users can ask follow-up questions, with ChatGPT considering the context of the entire conversation to provide answers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openai-launches-chatgpt-with-search-taking-google-head-on/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last night, Nintendo pulled off a surprise launch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ5EeImWYaI">a new Nintendo Music smartphone app</a>, offering many of the company's staple soundtrack songs as a perk to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. But the new subscription freebie could give Nintendo additional motivation to once again crack down on Internet users who have been collecting and posting Nintendo music online for years now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/nintendo-music/">The Nintendo Music app</a> includes hundreds of songs from titles to download or stream, ranging from 1985's <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> to last year's <em>Pikmin 4</em>. The current music selection is far from comprehensive, but it at least touches on many of Nintendo's most popular series, including <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Pokemon</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, <em>Fire Emblem</em>, <em>Metroid</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em> (plus some popular background music from various Wii Channels). Nintendo promises that more tracks will be "added over time," mirroring the process Nintendo has used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/n64-on-switch-reading-the-tea-leaves-on-future-game-prospects/">add to its Nintendo Switch Online classic game downloads</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo Music users can build their own playlists, of course, or choose from a number of pre-arranged playlists to suit different moods or character themes.

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google revealed today how it plans to use generative AI to enhance its mapping activities. It's the latest application of Gemini, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/google-launches-gemini-a-powerful-ai-model-it-says-can-surpass-gpt-4/">the company's</a><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/google-launches-gemini-a-powerful-ai-model-it-says-can-surpass-gpt-4/"> in-house rival</a> to GPT-4, which the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">wants to use</a> to improve the experience when searching for something. Google Maps, Google Earth, and Waze will all get feature upgrades thanks to Gemini, although in some cases only with Google's "trusted testers" at first.</p>
<h2>Google Maps</h2>
<p>More than 2 billion people use Google Maps every month, according to the company, and in fact, AI is nothing new to Google Maps. "A lot of those features that we've introduced over the years have been thanks to AI," said Chris Phillips,VP and general manager of Geo at Google. "Think of features like Lens and maps. When you're on a street corner, you can lift up your phone and look, and through your camera view, you can actually see we laid places on top of your view. So you can see a business. Is it open? What are the ratings for it? Is it busy? You can even see businesses that are out of your line of sight," he explained.</p>
<p>At some point this week, if you use the Android or iOS Google Maps app here in the US, you should start seeing more detailed and contextual search results. Maps will now respond to conversational requests—during a demo, Google asked it what to do on a night out with friends in Boston, with the app returning a set of results curated by Gemini. These included categories of places—speakeasies, for example—with review summaries and answers from users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/generative-ai-is-coming-to-google-maps-google-earth-waze/">Read full article</a></p>

The formation, known as the Sinks, spits the river back out at another feature called the Rise a quarter of a mile east, a little more voluminous and a little warmer, with brown and rainbow trout weighing as much as 10 pounds mingling in its now smooth pools. The quarter-mile journey from the Sinks to the Rise takes the river two hours.</p>
<p>Scientists first discovered this quirk of the middle fork of the Popo Agie (pronounced puh-po zuh) in 1983 by pouring red dye into the river upstream and waiting for it to resurface. Geologists attribute the river’s mysterious delay to the water passing through exceedingly small crevasses in the rock that slow its flow.</p>
<p>Like many rivers in the arid West, the Popo Agie is an important aquifer. Ranchers, farmers, businesses, and recreationists rely on detailed data about it—especially day-to-day streamflow measurements. That’s exactly the type of empirical information collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/if-trump-dismantles-the-noaa-it-will-affect-wildfires-and-food-prices/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After closing a $69 billion deal to buy virtualization technology company VMware a year ago, Broadcom wasted no time ushering in big changes to the ways customers and partners buy and sell VMware offerings—and many of those clients aren't happy.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q1/press-release-webcast">reported</a> quarterly earnings that impressed investors and showed how resilient the company is even as it spends heavily on AI.</p>
<p>Some investors have been uneasy about the company's aggressive spending on AI, while others have demanded it. During this quarter, Microsoft reported that it spent $20 billion on capital expenditures, nearly double what it had spent during the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>However, the company satisfied both groups of investors, as it revealed it has still been doing well in the short term amid those long-term investments. The fiscal quarter, which covered July through September, saw overall sales rise 16 percent year over year to $65.6 billion. Despite all that AI spending, profits were up 11 percent, too.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/microsoft-reports-big-profits-amid-massive-ai-investments/">Read full article</a></p>
