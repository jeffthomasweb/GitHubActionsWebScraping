<p>Peter Beck has been having a pretty great June. Earlier this month, he was made a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. Then, <em>Sir</em> Peter Beck presided as Rocket Lab launched its 50th Electron rocket, becoming the fastest company to launch its 50th privately developed booster.</p>
<p>Finally, last week, Rocket Lab revealed that it had signed its largest launch contract ever: 10 flights for the Japanese Earth-observation company Synspective. Ars caught up with Beck while he was in Tokyo for the announcement. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation, which touches on a variety of launch-related issues.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica</strong>: <strong>Hi Pete. We've talked about competition in small launch for years. But when I tally up the record of some of your US competitors—Firefly, Astra, Relativity Space, Virgin Orbit, and ABL—they're 7-for-21 on launch attempts. And if you remove the now-retired rockets, it's 1-for-6. Some of these competitors have, or did, exist for a decade. What does this say about the launch business?</strong></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033175#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033175&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>WordPress plugins running on as many as 36,000 websites have been backdoored in a supply-chain attack with unknown origins, security researchers said on Monday.</p>
<p>So far, five plugins are known to be affected in the campaign, which was active as recently as Monday morning, researchers from security firm Wordfence <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2024/06/supply-chain-attack-on-wordpress-org-plugins-leads-to-5-maliciously-compromised-wordpress-plugins/">reported</a>. Over the past week, unknown threat actors have added malicious functions to updates available for the plugins on WordPress.org, the official site for the open source WordPress CMS software. When installed, the updates automatically create an attacker-controlled administrative account that provides full control over the compromised site. The updates also add content designed to goose search results.</p>
<h2>Poisoning the well</h2>
<p>“The injected malicious code is not very sophisticated or heavily obfuscated and contains comments throughout making it easy to follow,” the researchers wrote. “The earliest injection appears to date back to June 21st, 2024, and the threat actor was still actively making updates to plugins as recently as 5 hours ago.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033226#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033226&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has added the ability to format external drives in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, the major software updates for iPhones and iPads due later this year.</p>
<p>While the feature likely won't be tapped by all that many users, its inclusion is fascinating in that it shows just how far Apple has moved away from its original sensibilities with the iPhone and the iPad.</p>
<p>The feature was discovered in the iPadOS 18 beta by artist and developer Kaleb Cadle, who posted about it to his Substack <a href="https://kalebcadle.substack.com/p/ipados-18-adds-another-very-useful">ByteBits</a> a couple of days ago. It was later found in iOS 18 as well.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033190#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033190&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of Windows 11's more contentious changes is that, by default, both the Home and Pro editions of the operating system require users to sign in with a Microsoft account during setup. Signing in with an account does get you some benefits, at least if you're a regular user of other Microsoft products like OneDrive, GamePass, or Microsoft 365 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rip-to-microsoft-office-henceforth-to-be-known-as-microsoft-365/">aka Office</a>). But if you don't use those services, a lot of what a Microsoft account gets you in Windows 11 is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-11-has-made-the-clean-windows-install-an-oxymoron/">repeated ads and reminders</a> about signing up for those services. Using Windows with a traditional local account is still extremely possible, but it does require a small amount of know-how beyond just clicking the right buttons.</p>

<p>On the know-how front, Microsoft has taken one more minor, but nevertheless irritating, step away from allowing users to sign in with local accounts. This <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">official Microsoft support page</a> walks users with local accounts through the process of signing in to a Microsoft account. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240612104753/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">As recently as June 12</a>, that page also included instructions for converting a Microsoft account into a local account. But according to Tom's Hardware and the Internet Wayback Machine, those instructions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240617103839/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">disappeared on or around June 17</a> and haven't been seen since.</p>
<p>Despite the documentation change, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">most of the workarounds</a> for creating a local account still work in both Windows 11 23H2 (the publicly available version of Windows 11 for most PCs) and 24H2 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/">available now on Copilot+ PCs</a>, later this fall for everyone else). The easiest way to do it on a PC you just took out of the box is to press Shift+F10 during the setup process to bring up a command prompt window, typing <code>OOBE\BYPASSNRO</code>, rebooting, and then clicking the "I don't have Internet" button when asked to connect to a Wi-Fi network.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033155#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033155&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Linux and its code are made by people, and people are not with us forever. Over the weekend, a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ds6wc3svkyre4p2rwg4f76o67xndazaeoyjwblhuzichscyxoz@5ttdvbymxr55/T/#mfd2f4928e0e013c10375ca766035c1385e18f8e0">brief message on the Linux kernel mailing list</a> reminded people of just how much one person can mean to a seemingly gargantuan project like Linux and how quickly they can disappear.</p>
<p>Denise Finger, wife of the deceased, wrote to the Linux Wireless list on Friday evening:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is to notify you that Larry Finger, one of your developers, passed away on June 21st.</p></blockquote>
<p>LWN.net reckons that <a href="https://hkfuneralhome.com/larry-finger/">Finger, 84</a>, contributed to 94 Linux kernel releases, or 1,464 commits total, at least since <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_16">kernel 2.6.16 in 2006</a> (and when the kernel started using git to track changes). Given the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/linus-torvalds-reiterates-his-tabs-versus-spaces-stance-with-a-kernel-trap/">sometimes precarious nature of contributing to the kernel</a>, this is on its own an impressive achievement—especially for someone with no formal computer training and who considered himself a scientist.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033066#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033066&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Records have sued AI music-synthesis companies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">Udio</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/mit-license-text-becomes-viral-sad-girl-piano-ballad-generated-by-ai/">Suno</a> for allegedly committing mass copyright infringement by using recordings owned by the labels to train music-generating AI models, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/music-labels-sue-ai-companies-suno-udio-us-copyright-infringement-2024-06-24/">Reuters</a>. Udio and Suno can generate novel song recordings based on text-based descriptions of music (i.e., "a dubstep song about Linus Torvalds").</p>

<p>The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in New York and Massachusetts, claim that the AI companies' use of copyrighted material to train their systems could lead to AI-generated music that directly competes with and potentially devalues the work of human artists.</p>
<p>Like other generative AI models, both Udio and Suno (which we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">covered</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/mit-license-text-becomes-viral-sad-girl-piano-ballad-generated-by-ai/">separately</a> in April) rely on a broad selection of existing human-created artworks that teach a neural network the relationship between words in a written prompt and styles of music. The record labels correctly note that these companies have been deliberately vague about the sources of their training data.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033128#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033128&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter">Jupiter</a> is particularly known for its so-called Great Red Spot, a swirling vortex in the gas giant's atmosphere that has been around since at least 1831. But how it formed and how old it is remain matters of debate. Astronomers in the 1600s, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini">Giovanni Cassini</a>, also reported a similar spot in their observations of Jupiter that they dubbed the "Permanent Spot." This prompted scientists to question whether the spot Cassini observed is the same one we see today. We now have an answer to that question: The spots are not the same, according to a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL108993">new paper</a> published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</p>
<p>“From the measurements of sizes and movements, we deduced that it is highly unlikely that the current Great Red Spot was the ‘Permanent Spot’ observed by Cassini,” <a href="https://news.agu.org/press-release/jupiters-great-red-spot-reborn-1800s/">said co-author Agustín Sánchez-Lavega</a> of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain. “The ‘Permanent Spot’ probably disappeared sometime between the mid-18th and 19th centuries, in which case we can now say that the longevity of the Red Spot exceeds 190 years.”</p>
<p>The planet Jupiter was known to Babylonian astronomers in the 7th and 8th centuries BCE, as well as to ancient Chinese astronomers; the latter's observations would eventually give birth to the Chinese zodiac in the 4th century BCE, with its 12-year cycle based on the gas giant's orbit around the Sun. In 1610, aided by the emergence of telescopes, Galileo Galilei famously observed Jupiter's four largest moons, thereby bolstering the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032984#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032984&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For a long time, Microsoft's Surface hardware was difficult-to-impossible to open and repair, and devices as recent as 2019's Surface Pro 7 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvY0qah3wSk">still managed a repairability score of just 1 out of 10</a> on iFixit's scale. 2017's original Surface Laptop needed to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/06/2017-surface-pro-least-repairable-ever-surface-laptop-is-made-of-glue/">physically sliced apart</a> to access its internals, making it essentially impossible to try to fix the machine without destroying it.</p>
<p>But in recent years, partly due to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/microsoft-is-evaluating-right-to-repair-options-for-xbox-and-surface-devices/">pressure from shareholders</a> and others, Microsoft has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/microsoft-finally-built-a-repairable-surface-laptop/">made an earnest effort</a> to improve the repairability of its devices. The company has published detailed repair manuals <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/microsoft-posts-its-own-teardown-and-repair-video-for-the-surface-laptop-se/">and videos</a> and has made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/surface-9-pro-teardown-reveals-modular-parts-microsofts-2023-repair-plans/">changes to its hardware designs</a> over the years to make it easier to open them without breaking them and easier to replace parts once you’re inside. Microsoft also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/microsoft-adds-pricey-diy-surface-repair-parts-to-online-store/">sells some first-party parts for repairs</a>, though not every part from every Surface is available, and Microsoft and iFixit have partnered to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Microsoft_Tablet">offer other parts as well</a>.</p>
<p>Now, iFixit has torn apart the most recent Snapdragon X-powered Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices and has mostly high praise for both devices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg7KXJQ0p00">in its preliminary teardown video</a>. Both devices earn an 8 out of 10 on iFixit's repairability scale, thanks to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2033069%26action%3Dedit&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownload%2Fdetails.aspx%3Fid%3D100440&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=102f803fe2b83ed4f8c861f1f46aa83a&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">Microsoft's first-party service manuals</a>, the relative ease with which both devices can be opened, and clearly labeled internal components.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033069#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033069&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The European Commission today said it found that Apple is violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA) with App Store rules and fees that "prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content." The commission "informed Apple of its preliminary view" that the company is violating the law, the regulator <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_3433">announced</a>.</p>
<p>This starts a process in which Apple has the right to examine documents in the commission's investigation file and reply in writing to the findings. There is a March 2025 deadline for the commission to make a final ruling.</p>
<p>The commission noted that it "can impose fines up to 10 percent of the gatekeeper's total worldwide turnover," or up to 20 percent for repeat infringements. For "systematic infringements," the European regulator could respond by requiring "a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it, or banning the gatekeeper from acquisitions of additional services related to the systemic non-compliance."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033091#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033091&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For more than a decade, in blog posts and scientific papers and public talks, the psychologist Hal Herzog has questioned whether owning pets makes people happier and healthier.</p>
<p>It is a lonely quest, convincing people that <a href="https://undark.org/2022/09/12/punishment-puppies-and-science-bringing-dog-training-to-heel/">puppies</a> and kittens may not actually be terrific for their physical and mental health. “When I talk to people about this,” Herzog recently said, “nobody believes me.” A prominent professor at a major public university once <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/maybe-not-but-cmon-take-a-look-at-these-hounds">described</a> him as “a super curmudgeon” who is, in effect, “trying to prove that apple pie causes cancer.”</p>
<p>As a teenager in New Jersey in the 1960s, Herzog kept dogs and cats, as well as an iguana, a duck, and a boa constrictor named Boa. Now a professor emeritus at Western Carolina University, he insists he’s not out to smear anyone’s furry friends. In <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/animals-and-us/201208/puppies-kittens-and-human-health-science-versus-wishful-thinking">a blog post</a> questioning the so-called pet effect, in 2012, Herzog included a photo of his cat, Tilly. “She makes my life better,” he wrote. “Please Don’t Blame The Messenger!”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033058#p3">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033058&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>John Romero remembers the moment he realized what the future of gaming would look like.</p>
<p>In late 1991, Romero and his colleagues at id Software had just released <em>Catacomb 3-D</em>, a crude-looking, <a href="https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/EGA_Palette">EGA-colored</a> first-person shooter that was nonetheless revolutionary compared to other first-person games of the time. "When we started making our 3D games, the only 3D games out there were nothing like ours," Romero told Ars in a recent interview. "They were lockstep, going through a maze, do a 90-degree turn, that kind of thing."</p>
<p>Despite <em>Catacomb 3-D</em>'s technological advances in first-person perspective, though, Romero remembers the team at id followed its release by going to work on the next entry in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/bethesda-revives-80s-pc-series-commander-keen-as-a-free-to-play-mobile-game/">the long-running <em>Commander Keen</em> series</a> of 2D platform games. But as that process moved forward, Romero told Ars that something didn't feel right.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032808#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032808&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an update released late Friday evening, NASA said it was "adjusting" the date of the Starliner spacecraft's return to Earth from June 26 to an unspecified time in July.</p>
<p>The announcement followed two days of long meetings to review the readiness of the spacecraft, developed by Boeing, to fly NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to Earth. According to sources, these meetings included high-level participation from senior leaders at the agency, including Associate Administrator Jim Free.</p>
<p>This "Crew Flight Test," which launched on June 5 atop an Atlas V rocket, was originally due to undock and return to Earth on June 14.

<p>As a result <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/publishers-beat-internet-archive-as-judge-rules-e-book-lending-violates-copyright/">of book publishers successfully suing the Internet Archive</a> (IA) last year, the free online library that strives to keep growing online access to books recently shrank by about 500,000 titles.</p>
<p>IA <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/06/17/let-readers-read/">reported</a> in a blog post this month that publishers abruptly forcing these takedowns triggered a "devastating loss" for readers who depend on IA to access books that are otherwise impossible or difficult to access.</p>
<p>To restore access, IA is now appealing, hoping to reverse the prior court's decision by convincing the US Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit that IA's <a href="https://archive.org/details/controlled-digital-lending-explained">controlled digital lending</a> of its physical books should be considered fair use under copyright law. An April <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.60988/gov.uscourts.ca2.60988.259.0.pdf">court filing</a> shows that IA intends to argue that the publishers have no evidence that the e-book market has been harmed by the open library's lending, and copyright law is better served by allowing IA's lending than by preventing it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032890#p3">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032890&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday announced <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-expands-approval-gene-therapy-patients-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy">expanded approval for a gene therapy to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a> (DMD)—despite the fact that it failed a Phase III clinical trial last year and that the approval came over the objections of three of FDA's own expert review teams and two of its directors.</p>
<p>In fact, the decision to expand the approval of the therapy—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delandistrogene_moxeparvovec">called Elevidys</a> (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl)—appears to have been decided almost entirely by Peter Marks, Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p>
<p>Elevidys initially gained an FDA approval last year, also over objections from staff. The therapy intravenously delivers a transgene that codes for select portions of a protein called dystrophin in healthy muscle cells; the protein is mutated in patients with DMD. Last year's initial approval occurred under an accelerated approval process and was only for use in DMD patients ages 4 and 5 who are able to walk. In the actions Thursday, the FDA granted a traditional approval for the therapy and opened access to DMD patients of all ages, regardless of ambulatory status.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032919#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032919&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Of the many oddities you can buy from Aliexpress, some of the weirdest are the recreations of retro computer systems in semi-modern designs. We're most intimately familiar with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/going-deep-with-the-book-8088-the-brand-new-laptop-that-runs-like-its-1981/">the Book 8088</a>, a recreation of the original 1981 IBM PC inside a chunky clamshell laptop. The people behind the Book 8088 are also responsible for the Hand386, which is a bit like a late-80s PC stuck inside an old Palm Pilot or Blackberry, and a second revision of the Book 8088 with more built-in ports and a VGA-capable graphics adapter installed instead of a basic CGA adapter.</p>

<p>Whoever is selling these systems is now <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805356267711.html">back with the Pocket 386</a>, which combines Hand386-style internals with a clamshell design similar to the Book 8088. The result is the kind of IBM-compatible system that would have been common during the Windows 3.1 era, when MS-DOS still dominated (especially for games) but Windows was on the upswing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032811#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032811&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Biden administration will ban all sales of Kaspersky antivirus software in the US starting in July, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-ban-us-sales-kaspersky-software-over-ties-russia-source-says-2024-06-20/">reporting from Reuters</a> and a filing from the US Department of Commerce (<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-13695.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>The US believes that security software made by Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab represents a national security risk and that the Russian government could use Kaspersky's software to install malware, block other security updates, and "collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans," said US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.</p>
<p>“When you think about national security, you may think about guns and tanks and missiles,” said Raimondo during a press briefing, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/us-bans-kaspersky-software/">as reported by Wired</a>. “But the truth is, increasingly, it's about technology, and it's about dual-use technology, and it's about data.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032766#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032766&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this week, the US Senate passed what's being called <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1111/text">the ADVANCE Act</a>, for Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy. Among a number of other changes, the bill would attempt to streamline permitting for newer reactor technology and offer cash incentives for the first companies that build new plants that rely on one of a handful of different technologies. It enjoyed broad bipartisan support both in the House and Senate and now heads to President Biden for his signature.</p>
<p>Given Biden's penchant for promoting his bipartisan credentials, it's likely to be signed into law. But the biggest hurdles nuclear power faces are all economic, rather than regulatory, and the bill provides very little in the way of direct funding that could help overcome those barriers.</p>
<h2>Incentives</h2>
<p>For reasons that will be clear only to congressional staffers, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/870/text">the Senate version of the bill</a> was attached to an amendment to the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act. Nevertheless, it passed by a margin of 88-2, indicating widespread (and potentially veto-proof) support. Having passed the House already, there's nothing left but the president's signature.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032883#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032883&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Often times, when I am researching something about computers or coding that has been around a very long while, I will come across a document on a university website that tells me more about that thing than any Wikipedia page or archive ever could.</p>
<p>It's usually a PDF, though sometimes a plaintext file, on a .edu subdirectory that starts with a username preceded by a tilde (~) character. This is typically a document that a professor, faced with the same questions semester after semester, has put together to save the most time possible and get back to their work. I recently found such a document inside Princeton University's astrophysics department: "<a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~strauss/AST303/Xintro.pdf">An Introduction to the X Window System</a>," written by <a href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/robert-lupton">Robert Lupton</a>.</p>
<p>X Window System, which <a href="https://www.talisman.org/x-debut.shtml">turned 40 years old earlier this week</a>, was something you had to know how to use to work with space-facing instruments back in the early 1980s, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100s</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX-11">VAX-11/750s</a>, and Sun Microsystems boxes would share space at college computer labs. As the member of the AstroPhysical Sciences Department at Princeton who knew the most about computers back then, it fell to Lupton to fix things and take questions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032813#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032813&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Three major features in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will not be available to European users this fall, Apple says. They include iPhone screen mirroring on the Mac, SharePlay screen sharing, and the entire Apple Intelligence suite of generative AI features.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/360751cb-7a22-48e0-9b00-6a30ff41dcfe">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183251/apple-eu-delay-ai-screen-mirroring-shareplay-dma">The Verge</a>, and others, Apple says this decision is related to the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA). Here's the full statement, which was attributed to Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two weeks ago, Apple unveiled hundreds of new features that we are excited to bring to our users around the world. We are highly motivated to make these technologies accessible to all users. However, due to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these features — iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence — to our EU users this year.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security. We are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is unclear from Apple's statement precisely which aspects of the DMA may have led to this decision. It could be that Apple is concerned that it would be required to give competitors like Microsoft or Google access to user data collected for Apple Intelligence features and beyond, but we're not sure.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032820#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032820&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

The program's stringent hardware requirements—16GB of RAM, at least 256GB of storage, and a fast neural processing unit (NPU)—disqualify all but new PCs, keeping features like Recall from running on all current Windows 11 PCs.</p>

<p>But the Copilot chatbot remains supported on all Windows 11 PCs (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/microsoft-is-revisiting-windows-10-by-backporting-the-copilot-ai-assistant/">most Windows 10 PCs</a>), and a change Microsoft has made to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/06/14/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-3785-beta-channel/">recent Windows 11 Insider Preview builds</a> is actually making the feature less useful and accessible than it is in the current publicly available versions of Windows. Copilot is being changed from a persistent sidebar into an app window that can be resized, minimized, and pinned and unpinned from the taskbar, just like any other app. But at least as of this writing, this version of Copilot can no longer adjust Windows' settings, and it's no longer possible to call it up with the Windows+C keyboard shortcut. Only newer keyboards with the dedicated Copilot key will have an easy built-in keyboard shortcut for summoning Copilot.</p>
<p>If Microsoft keeps these changes intact, they'll hit Windows 11 PCs when the 24H2 update is released to the general public later this year; the changes are already present on Copilot+ PCs, which are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/">running a version of Window 11 24H2 out of the box</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032806#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032806&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
