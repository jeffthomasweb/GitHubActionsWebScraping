<p>Popular open source Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx has been <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx">removed from GitHub</a>, and the team behind it has reportedly ceased development of the project after apparent discussions with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Ryujinx developer <a href="https://github.com/riperiperi">riperiperi</a> writes on the project's Discord server <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428">and social media</a> that fellow developer gdkchan was "contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of." While the final outcome of that negotiation is not yet public, riperiperi reports that "the organization has been removed" (presumably from GitHub) and thus "I think it's safe to say what the outcome is."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://ryujinx.org/">the Ryujinx website is still up</a> as of this writing, the download page and other links to GitHub-hosted information from that website no longer function. The developers behind the project have not posted a regular progress report update <a href="https://blog.ryujinx.org/progress-report-january-2024/">since January</a> after posting similar updates <a href="https://blog.ryujinx.org/">almost every month throughout 2023</a>. Before today, the Ryujinx social media account last posted an announcement <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1763916049647382644">in March</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053765#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053765&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The co-owner of a Chicago-based lab has pleaded guilty for his role in a COVID testing scam that raked in millions—which he used to buy stocks, cryptocurrency, and several luxury cars while still squirreling away over $6 million in his personal bank account.</p>
<p>Zishan Alvi, 45, of Inverness, Illinois, co-owned LabElite, which <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431203/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431203.1.0.pdf">federal prosecutors say</a> billed the federal government for COVID-19 tests that were either never performed or were performed with purposefully inadequate components to render them futile. Customers who sought testing from LabElite—sometimes for clearance to travel or have contact with vulnerable people—received either no results or results indicating they were negative for the deadly virus.</p>
<p>The scam, which ran from around February 2021 to about February 2022, made over $83 million total in fraudulent payments from the federal government's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which covered the cost of COVID-19 testing for people without insurance during the height of the pandemic. Local media coverage indicated that people who sought testing at LabElite were discouraged from providing health insurance information.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053766#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053766&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Imagine you're a podcaster who regularly does quick 10- to 12-minute summary reviews of written works. Now imagine your producer gives you multiple pages of nothing but the words "poop" and "fart" repeated over and over again and asks you to have an episode about the document on their desk within the hour.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I'd have trouble even knowing where to start with such a task. But when Reddit user sorryaboutyourcats gave the same prompt to Google's NotebookLM AI model, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fs9wlf/analyzing_poop_fart_written_1000_times_creating/">the result</a> was a surprisingly cogent and engaging AI-generated podcast that touches on the nature of art, the philosophy of attention, and the human desire to make meaning out of the inherently meaningless.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height: 500px;" data-embed-height="740"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fs9wlf/analyzing_poop_fart_written_1000_times_creating/">Analyzing Poop &amp; Fart written 1,000 times - Creating meaning from the meaningless</a><br>

<p>Federal prosecutors have charged a man for an alleged “hack-to-trade” scheme that earned him millions of dollars by breaking into the Office365 accounts of executives at publicly traded companies and obtaining quarterly financial reports before they were released publicly.</p>
<p>The action, taken by the office of the US Attorney for the district of New Jersey, accuses UK national Robert B. Westbrook of earning roughly $3.75 million in 2019 and 2020 from stock trades that capitalized on the illicitly obtained information. After accessing it, prosecutors said, he executed stock trades. The advance notice allowed him to act and profit on the information before the general public could. The US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a separate civil suit against Westbrook seeking an order that he pay civil penalties and return all ill-gotten gains.</p>
<h2>Buy low, sell high</h2>
<p>“The SEC is engaged in ongoing efforts to protect markets and investors from the consequences of cyber fraud,” Jorge G. Tenreiro, acting chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, said in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-153">statement</a>. “As this case demonstrates, even though Westbrook took multiple steps to conceal his identity—including using anonymous email accounts, VPN services, and utilizing bitcoin—the Commission’s advanced data analytics, crypto asset tracing, and technology can uncover fraud even in cases involving sophisticated international hacking.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053721#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053721&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, OpenAI kicked off its annual <a href="https://openai.com/devday/">DevDay</a> event in San Francisco, unveiling four major API updates for developers that integrate the company's AI models into their products. Unlike last year's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">single-location event</a> featuring a keynote by CEO Sam Altman, DevDay 2024 is more than just one day, adopting a global approach with additional events planned for London on October 30 and Singapore on November 21.</p>

<p>The San Francisco event, which was invitation-only and closed to press, featured <a href="https://x.com/swyx/status/1841173181002051911">on-stage speakers</a> going through technical presentations. Perhaps the most notable new API feature is the Realtime API, now in public beta, which supports speech-to-speech conversations using six preset voices and enables developers to build features very similar to ChatGPT's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/when-counting-quickly-openais-new-voice-mode-stops-to-catch-its-breath/">Advanced Voice Mode</a> (AVM) into their applications.</p>
<p>OpenAI says that the Realtime API streamlines the process of creating voice assistants. Previously, developers had to use multiple models for speech recognition, text processing, and text-to-speech conversion. Now, they can handle the entire process with a single API call.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053625#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053625&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>T-Mobile has agreed to pay a $15.75 million fine and improve its security in a settlement over a series of data breaches over three years that affected tens of millions of customers.</p>
<p>"T-Mobile suffered data breaches in 2021, 2022, and 2023," the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau said in an <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-860A1.pdf">order approving a consent decree</a> yesterday. "Combined, these breaches affected millions of current, former, or prospective T-Mobile customers and millions of end-user customers of T-Mobile wireless service resellers, which operate on T-Mobile's network infrastructure and are known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)."</p>
<p>Four breaches occurring over three years exposed personal information, including customer names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, the features customers subscribed to, and the number of lines on their accounts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053671#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053671&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On February 3, 2023, a train carrying chemicals jumped the tracks in East Palestine, Ohio, rupturing railcars filled with hazardous materials and fueling chemical fires at the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>The disaster <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/news-services/ap/20230205-89080/">drew global attention</a> as the governors of <a href="https://x.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1622409784593993729">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://x.com/GovernorShapiro/status/1622682965988761600">Pennsylvania</a> urged <a href="https://ema.ohio.gov/media-publications/news/dewine-020523">evacuations for a mile</a> around the site. Flames and smoke billowed from burning chemicals, and an acrid odor radiated from the derailment area as chemicals entered the air and spilled into a nearby creek.</p>

<p>Broadcom quoted AT&amp;T a 1,050 percent price hike for VMware offerings, AT&amp;T has claimed in legal documents.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/att-sues-broadcom-for-refusing-to-renew-perpetual-license-support/">AT&amp;T sued Broadcom</a> on August 29, accusing Broadcom of unlawfully denying it the second of three one-year renewals for support services that AT&amp;T thinks it's entitled to. AT&amp;T cites a contract signed before Broadcom bought VMware. The telecommunications firm says it has 75,000 virtual machines (VMs) across approximately 8,600 servers running on VMware. Broadcom, which has stopped selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">VMware perpetual licenses</a>, has said that AT&amp;T missed its opportunity to renew support and that the contract between VMware and AT&amp;T has an "End of Availability" provision allowing VMware to retire products and services.</p>
<p>Legal filings from September 27 and spotted by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/01/att_broadcom_filings_update/">The Register</a> today show an email [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ATT_Johnson_affidavit-1.pdf">PDF</a>] that AT&amp;T EVP and GM of wireline transformation and global supply chain Susan A. Johnson apparently sent to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan pointing to "an impasse" over VMware.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053645#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053645&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A group of more than 5,000 car dealers have made public their worries about a lack of demand for electric vehicles. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/car-dealers-step-up-opposition-to-white-house-fuel-efficiency-targets/">Earlier this year</a> the group lobbied the White House to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/new-epa-doe-fuel-regs-give-automakers-longer-to-reduce-co2-emissions/">water down</a> impending federal fuel efficiency regulations that would require automakers to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/automakers-may-have-to-sell-4x-more-evs-under-new-proposed-cafe-rules/">sell many more EVs</a>. Now, they're sounding an alarm over impending EV mandates, particularly in the so-called Zero Emissions Vehicle states.</p>
<p>The ZEV states—California, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia—all follow the emissions standards laid out by the California Air Resources Board, which require that by 2035, 100 percent of all new cars and light trucks be zero-emissions vehicles (which includes plug-in hybrid EVs as well as battery EVs).</p>
<p>That goes into effect starting with model-year 2026 (i.e. midway through next calendar year) and would require a third of all new vehicles to be a BEV, claim the car dealers. But there is not enough customer demand for electrified vehicles to buy those cars, the dealers say. Worse yet, it would make gasoline-powered cars more expensive.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053652#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053652&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>eBay has defeated a lawsuit that the US Department of Justice raised last fall, which alleged that eBay violated environmental protection and public safety laws by allowing users to sell hundreds of thousands of banned products.</p>
<p>Among products targeted by the DOJ suit were at least 343,011 "aftermarket products for motor vehicles" used to "tamper with or disable vehicle emissions control systems" and at least 23,000 "unregistered, misbranded, or restricted use pesticides." The DOJ also took issue with sales of products containing methylene chloride, which is used as a "thinning agent in paint and coating removal products." Most uses of that chemical were <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-ban-most-uses-methylene-chloride-protecting#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20Today%2C%20April%2030%2C,well%20as%20neurotoxicity%2C%20liver%20harm">banned</a> by the Environmental Protection Agency this April to prevent causing cancer, liver harm, and death.</p>
<p>In her <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Us-v-eBay-order-9-30-24.pdf">order</a>, US District Judge Orelia Merchant agreed with eBay that the DOJ failed to prove that eBay was liable for selling some of these targeted products. Ultimately, Merchant ruled that whether the products violated environmental laws or not, Section 230 barred all of the DOJ's claims, as eBay is shielded from liability for third-party postings (in this case, listings) on its platform.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053636#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053636&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Readers of a certain age might remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)">Dolly</a>, a Finn-Dorset sheep born in 1996 to three mothers and some proud Scottish scientists. Dolly generated global headlines just by being alive, as she was the first mammal to be cloned using DNA taken from body (somatic) cells.</p>
<p>In this form of cloning, a somatic cell provides the cloned animal's complete DNA, which is then injected into an unfertilized egg cell that has had its existing genetic material removed. Zap the egg with a bit of current, implant it into the womb of a surrogate mother, wait a few months, and bam—out pops Dolly.</p>
<p>The process proved that the magic of embryonic development wasn't hidden only in eggs and sperm; even somatic cells from mature animals were capable of reproducing the whole creature and of generating any cell needed by the developing embryo.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053473#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053473&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft will begin rolling <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/10/01/how-to-get-new-experiences-for-windows-11/">this year's annual Windows 11 update</a> out to consumers starting today, the company announced at a Windows- and Copilot-centric event today. The Windows 11 2024 Update, also known as Windows 11 24H2, will roll out in phases, starting with Windows 11 PCs running versions 22H2 or 23H2 that have opted in to getting new feature updates faster.</p>
<p>New features in 24H2 include an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/energy-saver">Energy Saver feature</a> that replaces the older Battery Saver settings, support for Wi-Fi 7 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/usb-c-naming-to-somehow-get-worse-with-usb4-version-2-0/">80Gbps USB4 Version 2.0 ports</a>, text labels for common actions like copy and paste in the right-click/context menu, and tweaks to how the Quick Settings panels work.</p>

<p>For the handful of PCs that meet Microsoft's requirements for the Copilot+ program—16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a neural processing unit (NPU) capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS)—Windows 11 24H2 will eventually add support for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/microsoft-details-security-privacy-overhaul-for-windows-recall-ahead-of-relaunch/">the overhauled Recall feature</a>, a better Windows Search function, a "super resolution" feature for the Photos app that offers to upscale older pictures, generative fill and erase features in the Paint app, and other features.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053307#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053307&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It should not be so exciting to eat a breakfast quesadilla in your car.</p>
<p>But this quesadilla was from Wawa, this Wawa hosted a Tesla Supercharger, and this car was the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV, hooked up to that Supercharger through a NACS/CCS adapter. More than a year after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/gms-evs-will-get-access-to-teslas-supercharger-network-in-2024/">GM’s switch to NACS was announced</a>, and following some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/tesla-does-180-on-superchargers-rehiring-laid-off-staff-amid-new-plans/">Tesla internal chaos</a> that made it seem like a dead deal, Tesla unlocked access to its conveniently placed EV charging stations <a href="https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2024/sep/0918-nacs.html">to General Motors cars</a> in late September. It wasn’t every Supercharger, but it was more than 17,000 spots, many in places that were previously dark zones in any road trip plan.</p>
<p>I bought my car knowing that road trips would be an infrequent but real inconvenience. With Tesla's network available now, the anxiety of rolling the CCS dice in unknown lands has lessened considerably. To understand just how this feels, you must first hear about the Before Times.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053424#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053424&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Regardless of the outcome of this year’s election, the United States will have a new president in a few months. Although there are myriad issues of greater importance than spaceflight to most Americans, a new leader of the country will inevitably take a fresh look at the nation’s space policy.</p>
<p>Among the highest priorities for the next administration should be shoring up NASA’s Artemis plan to return humans to the Moon. This ambitious and important program is now half a decade old, and while the overall aims remain well supported in Congress and the space community, there are some worrying cracks in the foundation.</p>
<p>These issues include:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039513#p3">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039513&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Scientists at the University of Waterloo have identified one of the doomed crew members of Captain Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition">John S. Franklin</a>'s 1846 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition">Arctic expedition</a> to cross the Northwest Passage. According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X24003766">recent paper</a> published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, DNA analysis revealed that a tooth recovered from a mandible at one of the relevant archaeological sites was that of Captain James Fitzjames of the HMS <em>Erebus</em>. His remains show clear signs of cannibalism, confirming early Inuit reports of desperate crew members resorting to eating their dead.</p>
<p>"Concrete evidence of James Fitzjames as the first identified victim of cannibalism lifts the veil of anonymity that for 170 years spared the families of individual members of the 1845 Franklin expedition from the horrific reality of what might have befallen the body of their ancestor," the authors wrote in their paper. "But it also shows that neither rank nor status was the governing principle in the final desperate days of the expedition as they strove to save themselves."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/fresh-images-of-hms-terror-shipwreck-could-clear-up-lingering-mysteries/">previously reported</a>, Franklin's two ships, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Erebus_(1826)">HMS <em>Erebus</em></a> and the HMS <em>Terror</em>, became icebound in the Victoria Strait, and all 129 crew members ultimately died. It has been an enduring mystery that has captured imaginations ever since. Novelist Dan Simmons immortalized the expedition in his 2007 horror novel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_(novel)"><em>The Terror</em></a>, which was later adapted into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_(TV_series)">anthology TV series</a> for AMC in 2018.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053415#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053415&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/ceo-of-health-care-terrorists-faces-contempt-charges-after-senate-no-show/">infamous CEO of a failed hospital system</a> is suing an entire Senate committee for being held in contempt of Congress on civil and criminal charges that were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/senate-holds-rich-ceo-of-third-world-medicine-hospitals-in-contempt/">unanimously approved by the full Senate last week</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.273227/gov.uscourts.dcd.273227.1.0.pdf">a federal lawsuit filed Monday</a>, Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre claimed the senators "bulldozed over [his] constitutional rights" as they tried to "pillory and crucify him as a loathsome criminal" in a "televised circus."</p>
<p>The Senate committee—the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), led by Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)—issued a rare subpoena to de la Torre in July, compelling him to testify before the lawmakers. They sought to question the CEO on the deterioration of his hospital system, which previously included more than 30 hospitals across eight states. Steward filed for bankruptcy in May.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053520#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053520&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A married couple can't sue Uber over severe injuries they suffered in a 2022 car accident because of a mandatory arbitration provision in the ride-sharing company's terms of use, according to a <a href="https://www.njcourts.gov/system/files/court-opinions/2024/a1368-23.pdf">ruling</a> issued by the New Jersey Superior Court appellate division.</p>
<p>In November 2023, a lower court denied Uber's motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the complaint filed by plaintiffs Georgia and John McGinty. But the lower-court ruling was reversed on September 20 in a unanimous decision by three appellate court judges.</p>
<p>Georgia McGinty had agreed to Uber's arbitration clause long before the accident. But the couple challenged the terms in part because they say their minor daughter, then 12, was the one who clicked the most recent terms agreement when the girl ordered food through Uber Eats. Those newer terms were also allegedly less specific about users waiving the right to a jury trial.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053490#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053490&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reddit's VP of community, going by Go_JasonWaterfalls, made the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1fsyzjd/a_change_to_community_type_settings/">announcement</a> about what Reddit calls Community Types today. Reddit's permission is also required to make subreddits restricted or to go from NSFW to safe-for-work (SFW). Reddit's employee claimed that requests will be responded to “in under 24 hours.”</p>
<p>Reddit’s employee said that “temporarily going restricted is exempt” from this requirement, adding that “mods can continue to instantly restrict posts and/or comments for up to 7 days using <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/27018580066708-Temporary-events">Temporary Events</a>.” Additionally, if a subreddit has fewer than 5,000 members or is less than 30 days old, the request “will be automatically approved,” per Go_JasonWaterfalls.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053478#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053478&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Public records systems that courts and governments rely on to manage voter registrations and legal filings have been riddled with vulnerabilities that made it possible for attackers to falsify registration databases and add, delete, or modify official documents.</p>
<p>Over the past year, software developer turned security researcher Jason Parker has found and reported dozens of critical vulnerabilities in no fewer than 19 commercial platforms used by hundreds of courts, government agencies, and police departments across the country. Most of the vulnerabilities were critical.</p>
<p><a href="https://govtech.cc/README-2024-09-27-georgia-voter-registration-cancellation.md">One flaw</a> he uncovered in the voter registration cancellation portal for the state of Georgia, for instance, allowed anyone visiting it to cancel the registration of any voter in that state when the visitor knew the name, birthdate, and county of residence of the voter. In another case, document management systems used in local courthouses across the country <a href="https://github.com/qwell/disclosures/blob/main/README-2023-11-30-disorder-in-the-court.md">contained</a> multiple <a href="https://github.com/qwell/disclosures/blob/main/README-2024-05-17-maricopa.md">flaws</a> that allowed unauthorized people to access sensitive filings such as psychiatric evaluations that were under seal. And in one case, unauthorized people could assign themselves privileges that are supposed to be available only to clerks of the court and, from there, create, delete, or modify filings.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053460#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053460&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The arrival of competent electric vehicles is a boon for car enthusiasts as much as those who consider driving a chore and their vehicle a driving appliance. Electric motors can respond faster than the revviest naturally aspirated engines this side of a mid-2000s Formula 1 engine, and with more immediate torque than the mightiest of turbochargers. They are the way forward, for performance as well as energy efficiency. Such is apparent after spending some time behind the wheel of a $128,000 Audi RS7 Performance after a diet of mostly EV performance cars.</p>
<p>For a long time, the RS7 was the Audi to go for if you wanted something with more than two doors, because the R8 doesn't work with your lifestyle. Based on the more humble A7 fastback sedan, it was worked over by Audi Sport, the four rings' racing offshoot based up the road from Ingolstadt in Neckarsulm, Germany. The designers there gave it a restyle, with aggressively flared arches to envelope larger wheels and tires, and new aerodynamic features to keep the car planted at speed. The result is one of the brand's handsomest creations, at least to this observer.</p>
<p>Under the hood, a twin-turbo 4.0L V8 is now even more potent than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/the-2020-audi-rs7-our-all-time-favorite-fastback-just-got-even-better/">when we first drove the RS7</a> in 2019, with 621 hp (463 kW) and 627 lb-ft (850 Nm) at your right foot's beck and call, sent to all four wheels via an eight-speed ZF 8 HP transmission and, at the rear axle, a torque-vectoring rear differential.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053421#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
