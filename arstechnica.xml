              <![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s taken a while, but I’ve finally found the thing I want generative AI to do for me: program a damn fine cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="p1">Program, that is, but not make—that’s the job of the <a href="https://fellowproducts.com/products/aiden-precision-coffee-maker">Fellow Aiden</a>, a coffee maker that <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/fellow-aiden-precision-coffee-maker/">crafts automated, precision pour-overs</a> in a countertop-ready cube. Thanks to other folks who love their Aidens, as well as API tweaking and large language model training, I can hand this mechanical robot a GPT-generated recipe and get impressive coffee out of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Strictly speaking, absolutely none of this is necessary. Humans can make great coffee with fresh beans, decent gear, time, patience, and experience. Experiments will reveal the differences in light and dark roasts, Ethiopian and Venezuelan, washed and honey-processed beans, or how often one agitates the grounds. But faced with something brand new, even an experienced brewer can be stumped and spend a good deal of time and none-too-cheap beans trying to get everything just right.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/the-tinkerers-who-opened-up-a-fancy-coffee-maker-to-ai-brewing/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here every Monday morning</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: We're five episodes into this season of <em>The Last of Us</em>, and most of the infected we've seen have still been of the "mindless, screeching horde" variety. But in the first episode of the season, we saw Ellie encounter a single "smart" infected person, a creature that retained some sense of strategy and a self-preservation instinct. It implied that the show's monsters were not done evolving and that the seemingly stable fragments of civilization that had managed to take root were founded on a whole bunch of incorrect assumptions about what these monsters were and what they could do.</p>
<p>Amidst all the human-created drama, the changing nature of the Mushroom Zombie Apocalypse is the backdrop of this week's entire episode, starting and ending with the revelation that a 2003-vintage cordyceps nest has become a hotbed of airborne spores, ready to infect humans with no biting required.</p>
<p>This is news to me, as a Non-Game Player! But Kyle, I'm assuming this is another shoe that you knew the series was going to drop.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Actually, no. I suppose it's possible I'm forgetting something, but I think the "some infected are actually pretty smart now" storyline is completely new to the show. It's just one of myriad ways the show has diverged enough from the games at this point that I legitimately don't know where it's going to go or how it's going to get there at any given moment, which is equal parts fun and frustrating.</p>
<p>I will say that the "smart zombies" made for my first real "How are Ellie and Dina going to get out of this one?" moment, as Dina's improvised cage was being actively torn apart by a smart and strong infected. But then, lo and behold, here came Deus Ex Jesse to save things with a timely re-entrance into the storyline proper. You had to know we hadn't seen the last of him, right?</p>

<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: As with last week's subway chase, I'm coming to expect that any time Ellie and Dina seem to be truly cornered, some other entity is going to swoop down and "save" them at the last minute. This week it was an actual ally instead of another enemy that just happened to take out the people chasing Ellie and Dina. But it's the same basic narrative fake-out.</p>
<p>I assume their luck will run out at some point, but I also suspect that if it comes, that point will be a bit closer to the season finale.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Without spoiling anything from the games, I will say you can expect both Ellie and Dina to experience their fair share of lucky and unlucky moments in the episodes to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of unlucky moments, while our favorite duo is hiding in the park we get to see how the local cultists treat captured WLF members, and it is extremely not pretty. I'm repeating myself a bit from last week, but the lingering on these moments of torture feels somehow more gratuitous in an HBO show, even when compared to similarly gory scenes in the games.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Well we had just heard these cultists compared to "Amish people" not long before, and we already know they don't have tanks or machine guns or any of the other Standard Issue <em>The Last of Us</em> Paramilitary Goon gear that most other people have, so I guess you've got to do something to make sure the audience can actually take the cultists seriously as a threat. But yeah, if you're squeamish about blood-and-guts stuff, this one's hard to watch.</p>
<p>I do find myself becoming more of a fan of Dina and Ellie's relationship, or at least of Dina as a character. Sure, her tragic backstory's a bit trite (she defuses this criticism by pointing out in advance that it is trite), but she's smart, she can handle herself, she is a good counterweight to Ellie's rush-in-shooting impulses. They are still, as Dina points out, doing something stupid and reckless. But I am at least rooting for them to make it out alive!</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personality wise the Dina/Ellie pairing has just as many charms as the Joel/Ellie pairing from last season. But while I always felt like Joel and Ellie had a clear motivation and end goal driving them forward, the thirst for revenge pushing Dina and Ellie deeper into Seattle starts to feel less and less relevant the more time goes on.</p>
<p>The show seems to realize this, too, stopping multiple times since Joel's death to kind of interrogate whether tracking down these killers is worth it when the alternative is just going back to Jackson and prepping for a coming baby. It's like the writers are trying to convince themselves even as they're trying (and somewhat failing, in my opinion) to convince the audience of their just and worthy cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, I did notice the points where Our Heroes paused to ask "are we sure we want to be doing this?" And obviously, they <em>are</em> going to keep doing this, because we have spent all this time setting up all these different warring factions and we're going to <em>use</em> them, dang it!! But this has never been a thing that was going to bring Joel back, and it only seems like it can end in misery, especially because I assume Jesse's plot armor is not as thick as Ellie or Dina's.</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personally I think the "Ellie and Dina give up on revenge and prepare to start a post-apocalyptic family (while holding off zombies)" would have been a brave and interesting direction for a TV show. It would have been even braver for the game, although very difficult for a franchise where the main verbs are "shoot" and "stab."</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah if <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> had been a city-building simulator where you swap back and forth between managing the economy of a large town and building defenses to keep out the hordes, fans of the first game might have been put off. But as an <em>Adventure of Link</em> fan I say: bring on the sequels with few-if-any gameplay similarities to their predecessors!</div>

      The cordyceps threat keeps evolving.

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: "We killed Joel" team member Nora definitely would have preferred if Ellie and Dina were playing that more domestic kind of game. As it stands, Ellie ends up pursuing her toward a miserable-looking death in a cordyceps-infested basement.</p>
<p>The chase scene leading up to this mirrors a very similar one in the game in a lot of ways. But while I found it easy to suspend my disbelief for the (very scripted) chase on the PlayStation, watching it in a TV show made me throw up my hands and say "come on, these heavily armed soldiers can't stop a little girl that's making this much ruckus?"</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah Jesse can pop half a dozen "smart" zombies in half a dozen shots, but when it's a girl with a giant backpack running down an open hallway everyone suddenly has <em>Star Wars</em> Stormtrooper aim. The visuals of the cordyceps den, with the fungified guys breathing out giant clouds of toxic spores, is effective in its unsettling-ness, at least!</p>
<p>This episode's <em>other</em> revelation is that what Joel did to the Fireflies in the hospital at the end of last season is apparently <em>not</em> news to Ellie, when she hears it from Nora in the episode's final moments. It could be that Ellie, Noted Liar, is lying about knowing this. But Ellie is also totally incapable of controlling her emotions, and I've got to think that if she had been surprised by this, we would have been able to tell.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, saying too much about what Ellie knows and when would be risking some major spoilers. For now I'll just say the way the show decided to mix things up by putting this detailed information in Nora's desperate, spore-infested mouth kind of landed with a wet thud for me.</p>
<p>I was equally perplexed by the sudden jump cut from "Ellie torturing a prisoner" to "peaceful young Ellie flashback" at the end of the episode. Is the audience supposed to assume that this is what is going on inside Ellie's head or something? Or is the narrative just shifting without a clutch?</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: I took it to mean that we were about to get a timeline-breaking departure episode next week, one where we spend some time in flashback mode filling in what Ellie knows and why before we continue on with Abby Quest. But I guess we'll see, won't we!</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Oh, I've been waiting with bated breath for a bevy of flashbacks I knew were coming in some form or another. But the particular <em>way</em> they shifted to the flashback here, with mere seconds left in this particular brutal episode, was baffling to me.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: I think you do it that way to get people hyped about the possibility of seeing Joel again next week. Unless it's just a cruel tease! But it's probably not, right? Unless it is!</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Now I kind of hope the next episode just goes back to Ellie and Dina and doesn't address the five seconds of flashback at all. Screw you, audience!</div>

      John Cena reprises his titular role for the second season of <em>Peacemaker</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>What's a reformed villain gotta do to impress the Justice League? That's the dilemma faced by John Cena's titular antihero in the first teaser for S2 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacemaker_(TV_series)"><em>Peacemaker</em></a>, James Gunn's Emmy-nominated series spun off from his  2021 film, <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. We've got the same colorful cast of characters, but the new season will serve as something of a "soft reboot" as part of the new DC Universe (DCU) franchise.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 and <em>The Suicide Squad</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>The eight-episode first season was set five months after the events of <em>The Suicide Squad.</em> Having survived a near-fatal shooting, Peacemaker—aka Christopher Smith—is recruited by the US government for a new mission: the mysterious Project Butterfly, led by a mercenary named Clemson Murn (Chukwudi Iwuji). The team also included A.R.G.U.S. agent John Economos (Steve Agee) of the Belle Reve Penitentiary, National Security Agency agent and former Waller aide Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), and new team member Leota Adebayo (Danielle Brooks).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/watch-the-first-s2-teaser-for-peacemaker/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A starry sky can be stunning—even inside a hospital emergency room.</p>
<p>But instead of celestial bodies sparkling in the night, doctors in South Korea were gazing at bright brain lesions punctuating a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The resulting pattern, called a "starry sky," meant that their 57-year-old patient had a dangerous form of tuberculosis. The doctors <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2415077?logout=true">report the case</a> in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>The man had previously been treated for the infection in his lungs but came into the hospital's emergency department after two weeks of unexplained headaches, neck pain, and tingling in his right hand. The MRI and Computed-Tomography (CT) scans clearly revealed the problem: rare nodules and lesions, called tuberculomas, speckling his lungs and central nervous system, including both cerebral hemispheres, the basal ganglia deep inside the brain, the cerebellum at the back of the brain, the brain stem, and the upper spinal cord.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/when-doctors-describe-your-brain-scan-as-a-starry-sky-its-not-good/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/">unveiled</a> LegoGPT, an AI model that creates physically stable Lego structures from text prompts. The new system not only designs Lego models that match text descriptions (prompts) but also ensures they can be built brick by brick in the real world, either by hand or with robotic assistance.</p>
<p>"To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions," the researchers wrote in their paper, which was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05469">posted</a> on arXiv, "and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction."</p>
<p>This trained model generates Lego designs that match text prompts like "a streamlined, elongated vessel" or "a classic-style car with a prominent front grille." The resulting designs are simple, using just a few brick types to create primitive shapes—but they stand up. As one Ars Technica staffer joked this morning upon seeing the research, "It builds Lego <a href="https://www.toysperiod.com/lego-set-reference/by-decade/1970s/">like it's 1974</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/new-ai-model-generates-buildable-lego-creations-from-text-descriptions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fitness tracker company Whoop has upset some long-time customers by ending an upgrade system that promised free hardware upgrades to anyone who had a subscription with the company for at least six months.</p>
<p>Whoop makes fitness tracker bracelets that let users access things like sleep tracking, menstrual tracking, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) via a subscription companion app. Since the first Whoop wearable came out in 2015, the Boston-based company’s business has been built on subscriptions. Whoop has traditionally lured customers in by giving its hardware away for “free” to Whoop app subscribers. Further, customers who subscribed to the Whoop app for at least six months got access to free hardware upgrades.</p>
<p>“Instead of purchasing new hardware every time an updated model is produced, WHOOP members receive the next-generation device for free after having been a member for six months or more,” said a webpage on Whoop’s website that is no longer active but was accessible as recently as March 28, as reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664111/whoop-5-0-upgrade-anger-wearables">The Verge</a> and confirmed via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250328102036/https:/www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/best-fitness-trackers/">the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/wearables-firms-endless-free-hardware-upgrades-were-too-good-to-be-true/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last year, United States District Court Judge Amit Mehta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">ruled that Google violated antitrust law</a> by illegally maintaining a monopoly in search. Now, Google and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have had their say in the remedy phase of the trial, which wraps up today. It will determine the consequences for Google's actions, potentially changing the landscape for search as we rocket into the AI era, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>The remedy trial featured over 20 witnesses, including representatives from some of the most important technology firms in the world. Their statements about the past, present, and future of search moved markets, but what does the testimony mean for Google?</p>
<h2>Everybody wants Chrome</h2>
<p>One of the DOJ's proposed remedies is to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">force Google to divest Chrome</a> and the open source Chromium project. Google has been adamant both in and out of the courtroom that it is the only company that can properly run Chrome. It says selling Chrome would negatively impact privacy and security because Google's technology is deeply embedded in the browser. And regardless, Google Chrome would be too expensive for anyone to buy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Intel's i486 was the first "computer number" I ever really understood. Sure, my elementary school computer lab had both the Apple IIGS and Apple IIc, and one of them was slightly more useful, for reasons unexplained to me. But soon after my father brought home his office's discarded Gateway desktop with a 486DX 33 MHz inside, I was catapulted into my first Intel sorting scheme. I learned there was an x86 before this one (i386), and there were models with different trailing numbers (16–100 MHz) and "DX" levels. This was my first grasp of what hardware I was actually using and what could improve inside it.</p>
<p>More than 36 years after the release of the 486 and 18 years after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061009060120/http://developer.intel.com/design/pcn/Processors/D0106013.pdf">Intel stopped making them</a>, leaders of the Linux kernel believe the project can improve itself by leaving i486 support behind. Ingo Molnar, <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250425084216.3913608-1-mingo@kernel.org/">quoting Linus Torvalds</a> regarding "zero real reason for anybody to waste one second" on 486 support, submitted a patch series to the 6.15 kernel that updates its minimum support features. Those requirements now include TSC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter">Time Stamp Counter</a>) and CX8 (i.e., "fixed" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Older_implementations">CMPXCH8B</a>, its own <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000008595/processors.html">whole thing</a>), features that the 486 lacks (as do some early non-Pentium 586 processors).</p>
<p>It's not the first time Torvalds has suggested dropping support for 32-bit processors and relieving kernel developers from implementing archaic emulation and work-around solutions. "We got rid of i386 support back in 2012. Maybe it's time to get rid of i486 support in 2022," <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wikUaRM5H_y1Bc+QyvGi40dKDL8fnCTyz7ECbwK7aHNPQ@mail.gmail.com/">Torvalds wrote in October 2022</a>. Failing major changes to the 6.15 kernel, which will likely arrive <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-rc4-Released">late this month</a>, i486 support will be dropped.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/linux-to-end-support-for-1989s-hottest-chip-the-486-with-next-release/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump said he is killing a broadband grant program that was authorized by Congress, claiming that the Digital Equity Act of 2021 is racist and unconstitutional.</p>
<p>"I have spoken with my wonderful Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, and we agree that the Biden/Harris so-called 'Digital Equity Act' is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL. No more woke handouts based on race! The Digital Equity Program is a RACIST and ILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway. I am ending this IMMEDIATELY, and saving Taxpayers BILLIONS OF DOLLARS!"

<p>Various school districts, including some in <a href="https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/what-is-the-chromebook-challenge/">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://www.nj.com/education/2025/05/nj-student-set-chromebook-on-fire-for-viral-tiktok-challenge-cops-say.html">New Jersey,</a> <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article306019916.html">North Carolina</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/chromebook-challenge-school-laptops-smoking-fire-social-media/3910008/">Washington</a>, have sent letters to parents warning about the trend that’s largely taken off on TikTok.</p>
<p>Per reports from school districts and videos that Ars Technica has reviewed online, the so-called Chromebook Challenge includes students sticking things into Chromebook ports to short-circuit the system. Students are using various easily accessible items to do this, including writing utensils, paper clips, gum wrappers, and pushpins.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/tiktok-trend-sees-kids-setting-chromebooks-on-fire-at-least-one-kid-hospitalized/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Alex Mashinsky—the disgraced founder of the Celsius Network cryptocurrency bank who deceived hundreds of thousands into losing billions with the catchy slogan "unbank yourself"—was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Thursday.</p>
<p>In December, Mashinsky pleaded guilty to securities fraud and commodities fraud. Federal prosecutors slammed him for reaping $48 million in profits while causing billions in investor losses by artificially inflating the value of his network's token, Cel. The Department of Justice and dozens of victims urged the court to order a maximum sentence of 20 years, while Mashinsky hoped the court would agree that he had shown remorse and should only serve one year and one day, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/celsius-founder-alex-mashinsky-gets-12-years-prison-crypto-fraud-2025-05-08/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Mashinsky's downfall started in 2022, when the Celsius Network <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/06/cryptocurrency-plunges-as-crypto-bank-celsius-suspends-withdrawals/">suddenly stopped allowing withdrawals</a>, claiming that "extreme market conditions" were to blame, a shady move that caused some customers to question the crypto bank's financial health. One month later, the bank filed for bankruptcy, exposing a $1.19 billion deficit in its balance sheets and still holding onto customers' funds while scoffing at supposed "misinformation" that their money would be lost.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/celsius-founder-gets-12-years-for-multi-billion-dollar-crypto-lending-scam/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday's naming of Chicago native Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV—the first American-born leader of the Catholic church—has already led to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bennyheis.bsky.social/post/3loolfxng2c2a">plenty</a> of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/calliopeanim.bsky.social/post/3loot346axs2m">jokes</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pearlmania500/video/7502177512856816942?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-8wD5lhDRLCB">memes</a> about his potential interactions with various bits of American pop culture. And that cultural exposure apparently extends to some casual video games, making Leo XIV our first confirmed gamer pope.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/brothers-of-pope-leo-xiv-share-their-reactions-239211077911">Speaking to NBC5 Chicago</a> Thursday, papal sibling John Prevost confirmed that the soon-to-be-pope played a couple of games just before flying to the papal conclave earlier this week. "First we do <em>Wordle</em>, because this is a regular thing," Prevost said. "Then we do <em>Words with Friends</em>. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world..."</p>
<p>OK, so the pope's love of casual word games doesn't exactly put him in the same category of people who are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/12-years-six-hours-and-23211-demons-defeating-one-of-doom-2s-hardest-maps/">speedrunning <em>Doom</em> slaughter maps</a>. But it's still striking to realize that the 69-year-old pontiff is among the reported <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2024-data/">44 percent of American Baby Boomer men who play video games regularly</a> and the <a href="https://civicscience.com/the-wordle-trend-is-still-going-strong/">15 percent of Americans aged 55 and over</a> who have played <em>Wordle</em> specifically<em>.</em></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/newly-anointed-pope-leo-xiv-is-our-first-confirmed-gamer-pontiff/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The British car industry got a big break from US President Donald Trump yesterday afternoon. Trump and UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer have agreed to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/05/11929/">a bilateral trade agreement</a> that cuts tariffs on a range of imports from the UK, including pharmaceuticals, aluminum and steel, and cars.</p>
<p>Now, the first 100,000 cars that come to the US from the UK will only be subject to a 10 percent tariff rather than the 27.5 percent they have been under since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/">the start of this trade war in April</a>.</p>
<p>"The car industry is vital to the UK’s economic prosperity, sustaining 250,000 jobs," said Jaguar Land Rover CEO Adrian Mardell. "We warmly welcome this deal which secures greater certainty for our sector and the communities it supports. We would like to thank the UK and US Governments for agreeing this deal at pace and look forward to continued engagement over the coming months," Mardell said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/trump-cuts-tariff-on-uk-cars-american-carmakers-not-happy-about-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[
<p>For decades now, you could count on there being a certain rhythm to a Doom game. From <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/doom-doom-ii-is-a-great-excuse-to-jump-back-into-hell-for-free-or-for-10/">the ’90s originals</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/">series’ resurrection</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/">recent years</a>, the Doom games have always been about using constant, zippy motion to dodge through a sea of relatively slow-moving bullets, maintaining your distance while firing back at encroaching hordes of varied monsters. The specific guns and movement options you could call on might change from game to game, but the basic rhythm of that dodge-and-shoot gameplay never has.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes in, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> throws out that traditional <i>Doom</i> rhythm almost completely. The introduction of a crucial shield adds a whole suite of new verbs to the Doom vocabulary; in addition to running, dodging, and shooting, you’ll now be blocking, parrying, and stunning enemies for counterattacks. In previous Doom games, standing still for any length of time often led to instant death. In <i>The Dark Ages</i>, standing your ground to absorb and/or deflect incoming enemy attacks is practically required at many points.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/">a preview event earlier this year</a>, the game’s developers likened this change to the difference between flying a fighter jet and piloting a tank. That’s a pretty apt metaphor, and it's not exactly an unwelcome change for a series that might be in need of a shake-up. But it only works if you go in ready to play like a tank and not like the fighter jet that has been synonymous with Doom for decades.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/doom-the-dark-ages-review-shields-up/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The program will invest €500 million ($568 million) between 2025 and 2027 to recruit specialists in various fields of knowledge to come and work in Europe. The initiative also includes a target for member states to allocate 3 percent of their GDP to R&amp;D projects by 2030.</p>
<p>“The role of science in today’s world is questioned,” warned Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/speech_25_1130">statement</a> on Tuesday. “What a gigantic miscalculation. I believe that science holds the key to our future here in Europe. Without it, we simply cannot address today’s global challenges—from health to new tech, from climate to oceans.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/europe-launches-program-to-lure-scientists-away-from-the-us/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Back in 2024, a system set up to identify objects that suddenly brighten found something unusual. Unfortunately, the automated system that was supposed to identify it couldn't figure out what it was looking at. Now, about a year later, we know it's the first tidal disruption event—meaning a star being ripped apart by a supermassive black hole—identified at visual wavelengths. It's also a rather unusual one, in that the supermassive black hole in question does not reside at the center of its galaxy. Instead, there's an even more massive object there, which is feeding on matter at the same time.</p>
<h2>A mystery object</h2>
<p>The object, now called AT2024tvd, was identified by the <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu">Zwicky Transient Facility</a>, which is set up to scan the entire northern sky over a period of just two days, after which it repeats the process. Combined with software that scans the data for changes, these repeated exposures allow the system to identify objects that suddenly brighten (or, potentially, anything that suddenly goes dark). Among the events it can identify are tidal disruption events, where a star gets spaghettified by the enormous gravity of a supermassive black hole.</p>
<p>Normally, supermassive black holes live at the center of galaxies. So, the software that does the scanning will only flag something as a potential tidal disruption event if it coincides with the presence of a previous light source at the same location. And that wasn't the case with AT2024tvd, which appeared to be over 2,500 light-years from the center of the galaxy. As a result, the software didn't flag it as a potential tidal disruption event; people didn't figure out what it was until they looked more closely at it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/a-star-has-been-destroyed-by-a-wandering-supermassive-black-hole/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.43 of the Rocket Report! There's been a lot of recent news in hypersonic testing. We cover some of that in this week's newsletter, which is just a taste of the US military's appetite for fielding its own hypersonic weapons, and conversely, the Pentagon's emphasis on the detection and destruction of an enemy's hypersonic missiles. China has already declared its first hypersonic weapons operational, and Russia claims to have them, too. Now, the Pentagon is finally close to placing hypersonic missiles with combat units. Many US rocket companies believe the hypersonics sector is a lucrative business. Some companies have enough confidence in this emerging market<span class="s1">—or lack of faith in the traditional space launch market</span><span class="s1">—to pivot entirely toward hypersonics. I'm interested in seeing if their bets pay off.</span></p>

<p><b>Stratolaunch tests reusable hypersonic rocket plane. </b>Stratolaunch has finally found a use for the world's largest airplane. Twice in the last five months, the company launched a hypersonic vehicle over the Pacific Ocean, accelerated it to more than five times the speed of sound, and autonomously landed at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/stratolaunch-successfully-flies-a-modern-replacement-for-the-x-15-rocket-plane/">Ars reports</a>. Stratolaunch used the same Talon-A vehicle for both flights, demonstrating its reusability, a characteristic that sets it apart from competitors. Zachary Krevor, Stratolaunch's president and CEO, said his team aims to ramp up to monthly flights by the end of the year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-rocket-lab-to-demo-cargo-delivery-americas-new-icbm-in-trouble/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Far fewer babies went to the hospital struggling to breathe from RSV, a severe respiratory infection, after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/cdc-greenlights-rsv-vaccine-during-pregnancy-but-only-for-seasonal-use/">the debut of a new vaccine</a> and treatment this season, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7416a1.htm">an analysis published today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>RSV, or respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants in the US. An estimated 58,000–80,000 children younger than 5 years old are hospitalized each year. Newborns—babies between 0 and 2 months—are the most at risk of being hospitalized with RSV. The virus circulates seasonally, typically rising in the fall and peaking in the winter, like many other respiratory infections.</p>
<p>But the 2024–2025 season was different—there were two new ways to protect against the infection. One is a maternal vaccine, Pfizer's Abrysvo, which is given to pregnant people when their third trimester aligns with RSV season (generally September through January). Maternal antibodies generated from the vaccination pass to the fetus in the uterus and can protect a newborn in the first few months of life. The other new protection against RSV is a long-acting monoclonal antibody treatment, nirsevimab, which is <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Nirsevemab-Visual-Guide.pdf?_gl=1*1biad03*_gcl_au*OTcwNDQ2OTIwLjE3NDY3Mzc4MjQ.*_ga*NDY1NjY3NzQyLjE3NDExMjMzNDQ.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NDY3Mzc4MjQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NDY3Mzc4MjQkajAkbDAkaDA.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NDY3Mzc4MjQkbzQkZzAkdDE3NDY3Mzc4MjQkajAkbDAkaDA.">given to babies under 8 months old</a> as they enter or are born into their first RSV season and may not be protected by maternal antibodies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/baby-hospitalizations-from-rsv-fell-up-to-71-with-new-vaccine-treatment/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Kosmos 482, a Soviet-era spacecraft shrouded in Cold War secrecy, will reenter the Earth's atmosphere in the next few days after misfiring on a journey to Venus more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p>On average, a piece of space junk the size of Kosmos 482, with a mass of about a half-ton, falls into the atmosphere about once per week. What's different this time is that Kosmos 482 was designed to land on Venus, with a titanium heat shield built to withstand scorching temperatures, and structures engineered to survive atmospheric pressures nearly 100 times higher than Earth's.</p>
<p>So, there's a good chance the spacecraft will survive the extreme forces it encounters during its plunge through the atmosphere. Typically, space debris breaks apart and burns up during reentry, with only a small fraction of material reaching the Earth's surface. The European Space Agency, one of several institutions that track space debris, says Kosmos 482 is "highly likely" to reach Earth's surface in one piece.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/a-soviet-era-spacecraft-built-to-land-on-venus-is-falling-to-earth-instead/">Read full article</a></p>
