<p>Ethan Zuckerman wants to release a tool that would allow Facebook users to control what appears in their newsfeeds. His privacy-friendly browser extension, Unfollow Everything 2.0, is designed to essentially give users a switch to turn the newsfeed on and off whenever they want, providing a way to eliminate or curate the feed.</p>

<p>The tool is nearly ready to be released, Zuckerman told Ars, but the University of Massachusetts Amherst associate professor is afraid that Facebook owner Meta might threaten legal action if he goes ahead. And his fears appear well-founded. In 2021, Meta sent a cease-and-desist letter to the creator of the original Unfollow Everything, Louis Barclay, leading that developer to shut down his tool after thousands of Facebook users had eagerly downloaded it.</p>
<p>Zuckerman is <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zuckerman-v-Meta-Complaint.pdf">suing</a> Meta, asking a US district court in California to invalidate Meta's past arguments against developers like Barclay and rule that Meta would have no grounds to sue if he released his tool.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022922#p3">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022922&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you watched yesterday's <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">iPad-a-palooza event</a> from Apple, then you probably saw the segment about cool new features coming to the iPad version of Logic Pro, Apple's professional audio recording software. But what the event did not make clear was that all the same features are coming to the Mac version of Logic Pro—and both the Mac and iPad versions will get newly numbered. After many years, the Mac version of Logic Pro will upgrade from X (ten) to 11, while the much more recent iPad version increments to 2.</p>
<p>Both versions will be released on May 13, and both are free upgrades for existing users. (Sort of—iPad users have to pay a subscription fee to access Logic Pro, but if you already pay, you'll get the upgrade. This led many people to speculate online that Apple would move the Mac version of Logic to a similar subscription model; thankfully, that is not the case. Yet.)</p>
<p>Both versions will gain an identical set of new features, which were touched on briefly in Apple's event video. But thanks to a lengthy <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/logic-pro-takes-music-making-to-the-next-level-with-new-ai-features/">press release</a> that Apple posted after the event, along with updates to <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Apple's main Logic page</a>, we now have a better sense of what these features are, what systems they require, and just how much Apple has gone all-in on AI. Also, we get some pictures.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023010#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023010&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Researchers on Wednesday reported critical vulnerabilities in a widely used networking appliance that leaves some of the world’s biggest networks open to intrusion.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities reside in BIG-IP Next Central Manager, a component in the latest generation of the BIG-IP line of appliances, which organizations use to manage traffic going into and out of their networks. Seattle-based F5, which sells the product, <a href="https://www.f5.com/c/emea-2020/event/f5-myforum">says</a> its gear is used in 48 of the top 50 corporations as tracked by Fortune. F5 <a href="https://www.f5.com/products/big-ip-services/big-ip-next">describes</a> the Next Central Manager as a “single, centralized point of control” for managing entire fleets of BIG-IP appliances.</p>
<p>As devices performing load balancing, DDoS mitigation, and inspection and encryption of data entering and exiting large networks, BIG-IP gear sits at their perimeter and acts as a major pipeline to some of the most security-critical resources housed inside. Those characteristics have made BIG-IP appliances ideal for hacking. In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/to-security-pros-dread-another-critical-server-vulnerability-is-under-exploit/">2021</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/05/hackers-are-actively-exploiting-big-ip-vulnerability-with-a-9-8-severity-rating/">2022</a>, hackers actively compromised BIG-IP appliances by exploiting vulnerabilities carrying severity ratings of 9.8 out of 10.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022973#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022973&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After reversing its positioning on remote work, Dell is reportedly implementing new tracking techniques on May 13 to ensure its workers are following the company's return-to-office (RTO) policy, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/08/dell_return_office/">The Register</a> reported today, citing anonymous sources.</p>
<p>Dell has allowed people to work remotely for over 10 years. But in February, it issued an RTO mandate, and come May 13, most workers will be classified as either totally remote or hybrid. Starting this month, hybrid workers have to go into a Dell office at least 39 days per quarter. Fully remote workers, meanwhile, are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/dell-tells-remote-workers-that-they-wont-be-eligible-for-promotion/">ineligible for promotion</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dell-remote-workers-promotion-return-office-push-flexible-work-2024-3">Business Insider</a> reported in March.</p>
<p>Now The Register reports that Dell will track employees' badge swipes and VPN connections to confirm that workers are in the office for a significant amount of time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022891#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022891&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Software is almost impossibly easy to download, distribute, and access compared to 40 years ago. Everything is bigger, faster, and more flexible, but there's a certain charm to the ways of diskettes and cassettes that is hard to recapture. That doesn't mean we can't try.</p>
<p>By the time you read this, it's likely that <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/software?id=0021603"><em>Kontrabant 2</em></a> will have already hit the airwaves on <a href="https://radiostudent.si/">Radio Študent</a> in Slovenia. At 9:30 pm Slovenia time (UTC+2 in Daylight Savings Time), if you are tuned to 89.3 FM, hitting record on a cassette tape will capture a buzzing sound that will run until just over 50KB have been transmitted. If all went well, you can load the tape into your working <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/rip-sir-clive-sinclair-creator-of-uks-famed-zx-spectrum-gaming-computer/">ZX Spectrum</a> or bring it to the Computer History Museum in Slovenia and use theirs to try it out.</p>

<p>The United States Marine Forces Special Operations Command (<a href="https://www.marsoc.marines.mil/">MARSOC</a>) is currently evaluating a new generation of robotic "dogs" developed by <a href="https://www.ghostrobotics.io/">Ghost Robotics</a>, with the potential to be equipped with gun systems from defense tech company Onyx Industries, reports <a href="https://www.twz.com/sea/rifle-armed-robot-dogs-now-being-tested-by-marine-special-operators">The War Zone</a>.</p>

<p>While MARSOC is testing Ghost Robotics' quadrupedal unmanned ground vehicles (called "<a href="https://www.ghostrobotics.io/vision-60">Q-UGVs</a>" for short) for various applications, including reconnaissance and surveillance, it's the possibility of arming them with weapons for remote engagement that may draw the most attention. But it's not unprecedented: The US Marine Corps has also tested <a href="https://www.twz.com/marines-test-fire-robot-dog-armed-with-rocket-launcher">robotic dogs armed with rocket launchers</a> in the past.</p>
<p>MARSOC is currently in possession of two armed Q-UGVs undergoing testing, as confirmed by Onyx Industries staff, and their gun systems are based on Onyx's <a href="https://onyx-ind.com/otss/">SENTRY remote weapon system</a> (RWS), which features an AI-enabled digital imaging system and can automatically detect and track people, drones, or vehicles, reporting potential targets to a remote human operator that could be located anywhere in the world. The system maintains a human-in-the-loop control for fire decisions, and it cannot decide to fire autonomously.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022843#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022843&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Most of the activities that go on inside cells—the activities that keep us living, breathing, thinking animals—are handled by proteins. They allow cells to communicate with each other, run a cell's basic metabolism, and help convert the information stored in DNA into even more proteins. And all of that depends on the ability of the protein's string of amino acids to fold up into a complicated yet specific three-dimensional shape that enables it to function.</p>
<p>Up until this decade, understanding that 3D shape meant purifying the protein and subjecting it to a time- and labor-intensive process to determine its structure. But that changed with the work of DeepMind, one of Google's AI divisions, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/google-details-its-protein-folding-software-academics-offer-an-alternative/">released Alpha Fold in 2021</a>, and a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/google-details-its-protein-folding-software-academics-offer-an-alternative/">similar academic effort</a> shortly afterward. The software wasn't perfect; it struggled with larger proteins and didn't offer high-confidence solutions for every protein. But many of its predictions turned out to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/googles-ai-software-brings-order-to-protein-chaos/">remarkably accurate</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, these structures only told half of the story. To function, almost every protein has to interact with something else—other proteins, DNA, chemicals, membranes, and more. And, while the initial version of AlphaFold could handle some protein-protein interactions, the rest remained black boxes. Today, DeepMind is announcing the availability of version 3 of AlphaFold, which has seen parts of its underlying engine either heavily modified or replaced entirely. Thanks to these changes, the software now handles various additional protein interactions and modifications.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022871#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022871&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US crackdown on exports to Huawei now includes even stronger restrictions than the company has already faced. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf965960-b083-49ee-bae1-6ce95fe872a3">The Financial Times</a> reports that Intel and Qualcomm have had their Huawei export licenses revoked, so Huawei will no longer be able to buy chips from either company.</p>
<p>The export ban has been around since 2020 and means that any company wishing to ship parts to Huawei must get approval from the government on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes these come with restrictions, like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-huawei-tech/qualcomm-receives-u-s-permission-to-sell-4g-chips-to-huawei-in-exception-to-ban-idUSKBN27U0MW/">Qualcomm's license</a>, which allowed it to ship smartphone chips to Huawei, but not "5G" chips. That led to Qualcomm creating special <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/huaweis-latest-flagship-phone-has-harmonyos-a-qualcomm-soc-and-no-5g/">4G-only versions</a> of its 5G chips for Huawei, and the company ended up with 4G-only Snapdragon 888 phones in 2021.</p>
<p>Since then, Huawei has been working on its own Arm chips from its chip design division, HiSilicon. In April, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/huawei-phone-has-a-pop-out-camera-lens-just-like-a-point-and-shoot-camera/">Huawei Pura 70</a> smartphone launched with an in-house HiSilicon Kirin 9010 SoC made at SMIC, a Chinese chip fab that is also facing export restrictions. With what is probably still a<a href="https://www.techinsights.com/blog/techinsights-finds-smic-7nm-n2-huawei-mate-60-pro"> 7 nm manufacturing process</a>, it's <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_matepad_pro_13_2-review-2644p4.php#pt">more of a 2020 chip</a> than a 2024 chip, but that's still fast enough for many use cases.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022821#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022821&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's a fundamental flaw in current car safety tech: It's limited to line of sight. Or, perhaps, line of "sensing" is more accurate, because the way cameras and lidar work is to inspect the perimeter of a vehicle and use predictive algorithms to understand the motion of an object in relation to the motion of the vehicle itself. Which is good, because as carmakers have added elements such as pedestrian and cyclist detection, they're trying to prevent drivers from hurting the most vulnerable road users. And unfortunately this is necessary, because even though 2023 saw a slight reduction in drivers striking cyclists and pedestrians, according to the most recent data from the <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/resources/news-releases/pedestrians-preliminary24">Governor's Highway Safety Association</a>, since 2019 pedestrian fatalities are still up 14 percent—and cyclist deaths are up 50 percent since 2010.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean lidar and cameras have "failed," but because they rely on what the sensors can pick up, they cannot necessarily ID hazards (and alert drivers) as quickly as we need them to, particularly if that's a cyclist in your lane 300 feet down the road, just over the next rise. Yes, current sensing works well now with figuring out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/mercedes-benzs-level-3-autonomous-driving-system-takes-over-in-heavy-traffic/">the pace of a traffic jam</a>, and automatic emergency braking <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/automatic-emergency-braking-should-become-mandatory-feds-say/">can step in to stop your car if you fail to</a>. But for non-automotive obstacles, they're still limited.</p>
<p>For that, we need better tech, which is emerging and is called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/qualcomm-covers-all-the-bases-with-a-cellular-vehicle-to-everything-chipset/">Connected Vehicle to Everything</a> (C-V2X). The idea isn't that complicated. Boiled down, it's a chipset that operates on a portion of the cellular bandwidth, and vehicles with this tech embedded (say in an e-bike or car) monitor anything with a C-V2X chip as well as broadcast their own location at a pulse of 10 times a second. This precision location system would then warn a driver of a cyclist on the road ahead, even beyond line of sight, and in an emergency—possibly because a cyclist was right in a car's path—could prevent a collision.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022851#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022851&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Those short, easily missable words always mean that there's a lower-end version of the chip coming that <em>doesn't </em>include that many CPU cores, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/specs/">the tech specs page for the new iPad Pro</a> has the full details: iPad Pros with 256GB or 512GB of storage use a version of the M4 with three high-performance CPU cores and six smaller efficiency cores. Only the models with 1TB and 2TB of storage have an M4 with all four high-performance CPU cores enabled.</p>

<p>The 256GB and 512GB models also ship with 8GB of RAM, where the 1TB and 2TB models come with 16GB of memory installed. Though these changes are clearly spelled out on the Tech Specs page, the actual configuration page for the iPad Pros in Apple's online store doesn't give any indication that upgrading storage also upgrades your CPU and RAM.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022820#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022820&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission clarified its net neutrality rules to prohibit more kinds of fast lanes.</p>
<p>While the FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-restores-net-neutrality-rules-that-ban-blocking-and-throttling-in-3-2-vote/">voted to restore net neutrality rules</a> on April 25, it didn't release the <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-52A1.pdf">final text</a> of the order until yesterday. The final text has some changes compared to the draft version released a few weeks before the vote.</p>
<p>Both the draft and final rules ban paid prioritization, or fast lanes that application providers have to pay Internet service providers for. But some net neutrality proponents <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/isps-can-charge-extra-for-fast-gaming-under-fccs-internet-rules-critics-say/">raised concerns</a> about the draft text because it would have let ISPs speed up certain types of applications as long as the application providers don't have to pay for special treatment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022823#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022823&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's more bad news for Tesla. On Monday, we learned that CEO Elon Musk is continuing to slash his way through the company payroll as Tesla went through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/tesla-announces-fourth-round-of-layoffs-in-four-weeks/">a fourth round of layoffs in four weeks.</a> Yesterday, we discovered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/nhtsa-wants-autopilot-answers-from-tesla-after-20-post-recall-crashes/">exactly what questions</a> the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants answered about the safety of Tesla's Autopilot driver assist. And today, it emerged that the US Department of Justice is investigating whether or not Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by making misleading statements about Autopilot and its so-called "Full Self-Driving" (FSD) option.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08/">Reuters reported</a> that three people familiar with the matter told it about the investigation. One of the sources also told Reuters that the Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Tesla's claims about its driver assists.</p>
<h2>Not the first time</h2>
<p>This isn't the first time Tesla has been accused of securities fraud. In 2018, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/elon-musk-settles-fraud-charge-he-and-tesla-to-pay-40-million-in-penalties/">Musk agreed to a settlement</a> with the SEC over his infamous "funding secured" tweet that sent the company's share price skyrocketing despite the fact that there was never actually a possibility that he would take the company private. As a result, Musk was required to step down as chairman, and both Musk and Tesla were ordered to pay $20 million in penalties, to be distributed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/08/tesla-is-already-facing-its-first-lawsuit-over-musks-buyout-tweets/">investors who lost money after being misled by Musk</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022790#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022790&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A jury has found Activision Blizzard liable for $23.4 million in damages in a patent infringement lawsuit first brought to court in 2015.</p>
<p>The case centers on patents first filed by Boeing in 2000, one that describes a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6701344B1/en">"distributed game environment"</a> across a host and multiple computers and another that <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6732147B1/en">describes a simple method for disconnecting from such a network</a>. Those patents were acquired in 2015 by Acceleration Bay, which accused Activision Blizzard of using infringing technology to develop <em>World of Warcraft</em> and at least two <em>Call of Duty</em> titles.</p>
<p>Those accusations succeeded in court earlier this week, as a jury <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/movalxmnbpa/ACTIVISION%20PATENT%20TRIAL%20verdict.pdf">found</a> a "preponderance of evidence" that the patents were infringed. The decision came following <a href="https://www.kramerlevin.com/en/perspectives-search/kramer-levin-secures-dollar234m-patent-infringement-verdict-on-behalf-of-acceleration-bay.html">a one-week trial</a> in which Activision Blizzard argued that its networking technology works differently from what is described in the patents, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/activision-hit-with-234-mln-us-patent-verdict-multiplayer-gaming-case-2024-05-06/">reported by Reuters</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022794#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022794&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>About five miles south of Broken Bow, in the heart of central Nebraska, thousands of cattle stand in feedlots at Adams Land &amp; Cattle Co., a supplier of beef to the meat giant Tyson Foods.</p>
<p>From the air, the feedlots look dusty brown and packed with cows—not a vision of happy animals grazing on open pastureland, enriching the soil with carbon. But when the animals are slaughtered, processed, and sent onward to consumers, labels on the final product can claim that they were raised in a “climate friendly” way.</p>
<p>In late 2022, Tyson—one of the country’s “big four” meat packers—applied to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), seeking a “climate friendly” label for its Brazen Beef brand. The production of Brazen Beef, the label claims, achieves a “10 percent greenhouse gas reduction.” Soon after, the USDA approved the label.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022789#p3">Read 48 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022789&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon Prime Video subscribers will see new types of advertisements this <a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/broadcast-year#:~:text=More%20Definitions%20of%20Broadcast%20Year,September%20of%20the%20following%20year.">broadcast year</a>. Amazon announced today that it's adding new ad formats to its video streaming service, hoping to encourage people to interact with the ads and shop on Amazon.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-jacks-up-price-of-ad-free-prime-video-by-2-99-starting-in-2024/">Prime Video streams included commercials</a> unless subscribers paid $3 extra per month. That has meant that watching stuff on Prime Video ad-free costs $12 per month or, if you're also a Prime subscriber, $18 per month.</p>
<h2>New types of Prime Video ads</h2>
<p>Amazon has heightened focus on streaming ads this year. Those who opted for Prime Video with commercials will soon see shoppable carousel ads, interactive pause ads, and interactive brand trivia ads, as Amazon calls them. Amazon said that advertisers could buy these new displays to be shown "across the vast majority of content on Prime Video, wherever it’s streamed." All the new ad formats allow a viewer to place advertised products in their Amazon cart.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022688#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022688&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the US moves toward criminalizing deepfakes—deceptive AI-generated audio, images, and videos that are increasingly hard to discern from authentic content online—tech companies have rushed to roll out tools to help everyone better detect AI content.</p>
<p>But efforts so far have been imperfect, and experts fear that social media platforms may not be ready to handle the ensuing AI chaos during major global elections in 2024—despite <a href="https://www.aielectionsaccord.com/uploads/2024/02/Press-Release-AI-Elections-Accord-16-Feb-2024.pdf">tech giants committing</a> to making tools specifically to combat AI-fueled election disinformation. The best AI detection remains observant humans, who, by paying close attention to deepfakes, can pick up on flaws like AI-generated people with extra fingers or AI voices that speak without pausing for a breath.</p>
<p>Among the splashiest tools announced this week, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online">shared</a> details today about a new AI image detection classifier that it claims can detect about 98 percent of AI outputs from its own <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">sophisticated image generator, DALL-E 3</a>. It also "currently flags approximately 5 to 10 percent of images generated by other AI models," OpenAI's blog said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022700#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022700&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One Raspberry Pi often leads to another. Soon enough, you're running out of spots in your free RealVNC account for your tiny boards and "real" computers. Even if you go the hardened route of SSH or an X connection, you have to keep track of where they all are. All of this is not the easiest thing to tackle if you're new to single-board computers or just eager to get started.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/">Raspberry Pi Connect</a>, a new built-in way to access a Raspberry Pi from nearly anywhere you can open a browser, whether to control yourself or provide remote assistance. On a Raspberry Pi 4, 5, or Pi 400 kit, you install Pi connect with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html">a single terminal line</a>, reboot the Pi, and then click a new tray icon to connect the Pi to <a href="https://id.raspberrypi.com/sign-up">a Raspberry Pi ID</a> (and then enable two-factor authentication, of course).</p>
<p>From then on, visiting <a href="http://connect.raspberrypi.com">connect.raspberrypi.com</a> gives you an encrypted connection to your desktop. It's a direct connection if possible, and if not, it runs through relay servers in London, encrypting it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security">DTLS</a> and keeping only the metadata needed for the service to work. The Pi will show a notification in its tray that somebody has connected, and you can manage screen sharing from there. The Pi's docs site has <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html">a lot more on the particulars</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022695#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022695&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Panera Bread will stop selling its highly caffeinated "Charged" drinks, which have been the subject of at least three lawsuits and linked to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/12/man-dies-on-way-home-from-panera-after-having-three-charged-lemonades/">at least two deaths</a>.</p>
<p>It is unclear when exactly the company will pull the plug on the potent potables, but in a statement to Ars Tuesday, Panera said it was undergoing a "menu transformation" that includes an "enhanced beverage portfolio." The company plans to roll out various new drinks, including a lemonade and tea, but a spokesperson confirmed that the new flavors would not contain added caffeine as the "charged" drinks did.</p>
<p>The fast-casual cafe-style chain <a href="https://www.today.com/food/restaurants/panera-charged-lemonade-caffeine-viral-tiktok-rcna62126">drew national attention in 2022</a> for the unexpectedly high caffeine levels in the drinks, which were initially offered as self-serve with free refills.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022740#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022740&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has a new lineup of iPad Pro and Air models for the first time in well over a year. Most people would probably be hard-pressed to tell the new ones from the old ones just by looking at them, but after hands-on sessions with both sizes of both tablets, the small details (especially for the Pros) all add up to a noticeably refined iPad experience.</p>
<h2>iPad Airs: Bigger is better</h2>
<p>But let's begin with the new Airs since there's a bit less to talk about. The 11-inch iPad Air (technically the sixth-generation model) is mostly the same as the previous-generation A14 and M1 models, design-wise, with identical physical dimensions and weight. It's still the same slim-bezel design Apple introduced with the 2018 iPad Pro, just with a 60 Hz LCD display panel and Touch ID on the power button rather than Face ID.</p>

<p>So when Apple says the device has been "redesigned," the company is mainly referring to the fact that the webcam is now mounted on the long edge of the tablet rather than the short edge. This makes its positioning more laptop-y when it's docked to the Magic Keyboard or some other keyboard.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022530#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022530&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since at least 2019, a shadowy figure hiding behind several pseudonyms has publicly gloated for extorting millions of dollars from thousands of victims he and his associates had hacked. Now, for the first time, “LockBitSupp” has been unmasked by an international law enforcement team, and a $10 million bounty has been placed for his arrest.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350921/dl">indictment</a> unsealed Tuesday, US federal prosecutors unmasked the flamboyant persona as Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, a 31-year-old Russian national. Prosecutors said that during his five years at the helm of LockBit—one of the most prolific ransomware groups—Khoroshev and his subordinates have extorted $500 million from some 2,500 victims, roughly 1,800 of which were located in the US. His cut of the revenue was allegedly about $100 million.</p>
<h2>Damage in the billions of dollars</h2>
<p>“Beyond ransom payments and demands, LockBit attacks also severely disrupted their victims' operations, causing lost revenue and expenses associated with incident response and recovery,” federal prosecutors wrote. “With these losses included, LockBit caused damage around the world totaling billions of US dollars. Moreover, the data Khoroshev and his LockBit affiliate co-conspirators stole—containing highly sensitive organizational and personal information—remained unsecure and compromised in perpetuity, notwithstanding Khoroshev’s and his co-conspirators' false promises to the contrary.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022656#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022656&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
