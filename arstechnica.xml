                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Following our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-makes-customers-wait-35-days-to-unlock-fully-paid-off-phones/">report last week</a> that Verizon is forcing people to wait 35 days for phone unlocks after paying off device installment plans, Verizon is apparently trying to eliminate the inconvenient delay. But Verizon hasn't confirmed the plan to Ars, and a Verizon statement published by Android Authority yesterday did not provide any timeline for implementing the change.</p>
<p>As a refresher, an update to Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposed a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off the remaining balance of a device installment plan online, in the Verizon app, or with a Verizon gift card. There's also a 35-day waiting period after paying off an installment plan over the phone or at a Verizon Authorized Retailer.</p>
<p>Saying restrictions are needed to counter fraud, Verizon will only unlock a phone immediately when someone pays off their device-plan balance at a Verizon corporate store or when someone pays off an installment plan on schedule via automatic payments. If you're partway into one of Verizon’s <a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/device-payment-faqs/">36-month device installment plans</a> and pay off the remaining balance early, but without making a trip to a Verizon corporate store, you'd have to wait 35 days for an unlock that would allow you to switch the phone to a different carrier's network.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-might-drop-its-annoying-35-day-wait-for-unlocking-paid-off-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>2026 is looking like a pretty good year for affordable electric vehicles. There's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/2026-nissan-leaf-review-the-best-budget-ev-on-sale-right-now/">a new Nissan Leaf</a> that starts at a hair under $30,000 (as long as you ignore the destination charge). We'll soon drive the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/the-chevrolet-bolt-is-back-but-for-how-long/">reborn</a> Chevrolet Bolt—with a new lithium iron phosphate battery, it also has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/its-back-the-2027-chevy-bolt-gets-an-all-new-lfp-battery-but-what-else/">a price tag starting with a two</a> (again, ignoring the destination charge). And the closer you get to $40,000, the more your options expand: the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better/">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/the-chevrolet-equinox-ev-is-high-on-comfort-and-convenience/">Chevy Equinox EV</a>, Toyota bZ, Tesla Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Subaru Solterra all fall within that price bracket, and some of those are pretty good cars.</p>
<p>But what if you only want to spend a fraction of that? Well, you won't be buying anything new, but then neither do three-quarters of American car buyers, and there's nothing wrong with that. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/how-far-does-5000-go-when-you-want-an-electric-car/">we looked at what passes for the used EV bargain basement</a>—ones that cost $5,000 or less. As long as you're OK with limited range and slow charging, going electric on a shoestring is possible. But if you're prepared to spend twice that, it turns out you've got plenty of options.</p>
<p>As before, we stress that you should have a reliable place to charge an EV if you're going to buy one, which means at home at night or at work during the day. At this price range, you're unlikely to find something that DC fast charges quickly, and relying on public AC charging sounds stressful. You'll probably find a car with some battery degradation, but for the vast majority of models that use active battery cooling, this should be minimal; <a href="https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/">about 2 percent a year appears to be the average</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/chevy-bolt-bmw-i3-or-something-else-at-10k-you-have-lots-of-ev-options/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/American-Public-Health-Association-v-EPA-Petition-for-Review-2-18-26.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency was accused of abandoning its mission to protect public health after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/as-expected-trumps-epa-guts-climate-endangerment-finding/">repealing an "endangerment finding"</a> that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-trumps-epa-hopes-to-avoid-greenhouse-gas-regulations/">served as the basis for federal climate change regulations</a> for 17 years.</p>
<p>The lawsuit came from more than a dozen environmental and health groups, including the American Public Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), the Clean Air Council, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Sierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>
<p>The groups have asked the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the EPA decision, which also eliminated requirements controlling greenhouse gas emissions in new cars and trucks. Urging a return to the status quo, the groups argued that the Trump administration is anti-science and illegally moving to benefit the fossil fuel industry, despite a mountain of evidence demonstrating the deadly consequences of unchecked pollution and climate change-induced floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/lawsuit-epa-revoking-greenhouse-gas-finding-risks-thousands-of-avoidable-deaths/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Archival storage poses lots of challenges. We want media that is extremely dense and stable for centuries or more, and, ideally, doesn't consume any energy when not being accessed. Lots of ideas have floated around—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/researchers-build-a-metadata-based-image-database-using-dna-storage/">even DNA has been considered</a>—but one of the simplest is to etch data into glass. Many forms of glass are very physically and chemically stable, and it's relatively easy to etch things into it.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of preliminary work demonstrating different aspects of a glass-based storage system. But in Wednesday's issue of Nature, Microsoft Research announced Project Silica, a working demonstration of a system that can read and write data into small slabs of glass with a density of over a Gigabit per cubic millimeter.</p>
<h2>Writing on glass</h2>
<p>We tend to think of glass as fragile, prone to shattering, and capable of flowing downward over centuries, although the last claim is a myth. Glass is a category of material, and a variety of chemicals can form glasses. With the right starting chemical, it's possible to make a glass that is, as the researchers put it, "thermally and chemically stable and is resistant to moisture ingress, temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interference." While it would still need to be handled in a way to minimize damage, glass provides the sort of stability we'd want for long-term storage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/microsofts-new-10000-year-data-storage-medium-glass/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed its shocking refusal to consider Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine for approval.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-refuses-to-review-modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine/">refusal was revealed last week</a> in a sharply worded press release from Moderna. Subsequent reporting found that the decision was made by political appointee Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration's top vaccine regulator, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/trump-official-overruled-fda-scientists-to-reject-modernas-flu-shot/">overruled a team of agency scientists</a> and a top career official in rejecting Moderna's application.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called music "the universal language of mankind." Is that still true when the so-called music is being generated by a probabilistic robot instead of a human? We're about to find out. Google has announced its latest Lyria 3 AI model is being <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/lyria-3/">deployed in the Gemini app</a>, vastly expanding access to AI music generation.</p>
<p>Google DeepMind has been tinkering with Lyria for a while now, offering limited access in developer-oriented products like Vertex AI. Lyria 3 is more capable than previous versions, and it's also quicker to use. Just select the new "Create music" option in the Gemini app or web UI to get started. You can describe what you want and even upload an image to help the robot get the right vibe. And in a few seconds, you get music (or something like it).</p>
<p>In case there was any uncertainty about whether Lyria tracks still counted as a human artistic endeavor, worry not! Unlike past versions of the model, you don't even have to provide lyrics in your prompt. You can be vague with your request, and the model will create suitable lyrics for the 30-second song. Although with that limit, "jingle" might be more accurate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/gemini-can-now-generate-ai-music-for-you-no-lyrics-required/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It's that time of year—a new budget Pixel phone is about to hit virtual shelves. The Pixel 10a will be available on March 5, and pre-orders go live today. The 9a will still be on sale for a while, but the 10a will be headlining Google's store. However, you might not notice unless you keep up with the Pixel numbering scheme. This year's A-series Pixel is virtually identical to last year's, both inside and out.</p>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-pixel-9a-review-all-the-phone-you-need/">Pixel 9a</a> was a notable departure from the older design language, but Google made few changes for 2026. We liked that the Pixel 9a emphasized battery capacity and moved to a flat camera bump, and this time, it's <em>really</em> flat. Google says the camera now sits totally flush with the back panel. This is probably the only change you'll be able to identify visually.</p>

<p>Google also says the new Pixel will have a slightly upgraded screen. The resolution, size, and refresh rate are unchanged, but peak brightness has been bumped from 2,700 nits to 3,000 nits (the same as the base model Pixel 10). Plus, the cover glass has finally moved beyond Gorilla Glass 3 to Gorilla Glass 7i, which supposedly has improved scratch and drop protection.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/googles-pixel-10a-arrives-on-march-5-for-499-with-specs-and-design-of-yesteryear/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In Qing dynasty China, artisans augmented decorative pieces by incorporating iridescent kingfisher feathers—a technique known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian-tsui">tian-tsui</a>. Scientists at Northwestern University's Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts have used high-energy X-ray imaging to achieve unprecedented nanoscale resolution of the unique structure of those feathers, <a href="https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2026/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/35305">presenting their findings at</a> the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/mit-scientists-create-color-shifting-films-inspired-by-19th-century-holography/" data-uri="9b4b749e6edb952fe692e0c578d6a935">previously reported</a>, nature is the ultimate nanofabricator. The bright iridescent colors in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/metamorphosis-scientists-watch-butterfly-wings-grow-inside-chrysalis-in-real-time/" data-uri="86ff6a37d2983899b6bd60278aac8cf6">butterfly wings</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/french-painters-inspire-new-insights-into-the-physics-of-soap-bubbles/2/" data-uri="8402077486195c3f4a9450074f22b433">soap bubbles</a>, opals, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/01/study-jewel-beetles-use-iridescence-for-camouflage-not-sexual-selection/" data-uri="e9e8ec9b1025fda0931d9abe57f22d26">beetle shells</a> don’t come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured—naturally occurring <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/shiny-things-an-ode-to-photonic-crystals/" data-uri="9bd92986dbfa9ceae97039c93c287f63">photonic crystals</a>. In nature, scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects), for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5783709/the-colorful-story-of-diffraction-grating" data-uri="c6b87d0b1ae84edf70bdb73e548906c9">diffraction grating</a>, except photonic crystals only produce specific colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism. In the case of kingfisher feathers, the color is due to the microscopic ridges that cover the parallel rows of keratin strands that grow along the central shaft.</p>
<p>Also known as photonic band-gap materials, photonic crystals are “tunable,” which means they are precisely ordered to block certain wavelengths of light while letting others through. Alter the structure by changing the size of the tiles, and the crystals become sensitive to a different wavelength. They are used in optical communications as waveguides and switches, as well as in filters, lasers, mirrors, and various anti-reflection stealth devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/what-the-chinese-art-of-tian-tsui-has-to-do-with-kingfishers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“ERO is too busy dressing up as Black Ops Commandos with Tactical body armor, drop down thigh rigs, balaclavas, multiple M4 magazines, and Punisher patches, to do an Admin arrest of a non criminal, non-violent EWI that weighs 90 pounds and is 5 foot 2, inside a secure Federal building where everyone has been screened for weapons,” wrote one user in July 2025. (ERO stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations; along with HSI, it’s one of the two major divisions of ICE, and is responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants.)</p>
<p>The forum describes itself as a space for current and prospective HSI agents, “designed for the seasoned HSI Special Agent as well as applicants for entry level Special Agent positions.” HSI is the division within ICE whose agents are normally responsible for investigating crimes like drug smuggling, terrorism, and human trafficking.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/inside-the-dhs-forum-where-ice-agents-trash-talk-one-another/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, evidence has piled up that psychedelic drugs can provide relatively rapid relief from the symptoms of clinical depression. The drugs seemingly work by boosting the brain's ability to remodel connections among neurons and incorporate new experiences. While we have a good picture of which proteins are responsible for the drug's hallucinogenic effects, we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/variant-of-a-toad-based-psychedelic-can-act-as-an-antidepressant/">still figuring out</a> how those pathways plug into the brain's ability to change itself.</p>
<p>Those lingering uncertainties aren't standing in the way of people trying to develop potentially life-altering treatments. One of the big challenges is probably the hallucinations themselves, which can potentially incapacitate someone for hours after a treatment. But researchers have now described a study showing that the shortest-acting psychedelic, DMT, appears to be just as effective as the rest.</p>
<h2>Fast-acting</h2>
<p>DMT, or dimethyltryptamine, is probably best known as a key component of ayahuasca, a liquid made from a combination of two or more plants. The mixture is important because the body produces an enzyme that rapidly digests DMT, blocking its effects. The additional plants contain a chemical that inhibits this enzyme, providing a longer-lasting experience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/hallucinogen-dmt-an-effective-antidepressant-in-small-clinical-trial/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>For a while now, Mac owners have been able to use tools like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/directx-12-support-comes-to-crossover-on-mac-with-latest-update/">CrossOver</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Game Porting Toolkit</a> to get many Windows games running on their operating system of choice. Now, GameSir plans to add its own potential solution to the mix, announcing that a version of its existing Windows emulation tool for Android will be coming to macOS.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-based GameSir has primarily made a name for itself as a manufacturer of gaming peripherals—the company's <a href="https://x.com/mygamesir/">social media profile</a> includes a self-description as "the Anti-Stick Drift Experts." Early last year, though, GameSir rolled out <a href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/">the Android GameHub app</a>, which includes a GameFusion emulator that the company claims "provides complete support for Windows games to run on Android through high-precision compatibility design."</p>
<p>In practice, GameHub and GameFusion for Android haven't quite lived up to that promise. Testers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retroid/comments/1poztuy/gamehub_lite_compatibility_chart_for_rp5_50_games/">on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.emuready.com/listings?deviceIds=%5B%22767ae07b-86c4-441d-8a72-fe8a5e625502%22%2C%226313f4b5-5a26-40c3-b223-2d2ddaa8386b%22%5D&amp;page=1&amp;emulatorIds=%5B%2209203574-33b7-4f56-85b1-851b51e0ab2a%22%2C%22062c86d7-d1a8-4e73-bb15-0f76f0e64610%22%5D">sites like EmuReady</a> report hit-or-miss compatibility for popular Steam titles on various Android-based handhelds. At least one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1pdjmzc/comment/ns5rmoi/">suggests</a> that "any Unity, Godot, or Game Maker game tends to just work" through the app, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1nlg5j6/gamehub_really_has_terrible_compatibility/">another reports "terrible compatibility"</a> across a wide range of games.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/gamehub-will-give-mac-owners-another-imperfect-way-to-play-windows-games/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the past 15 years, password managers have grown from a niche security tool used by the technology savvy into an indispensable security tool for the masses, with an <a href="https://www.security.org/digital-safety/password-manager-annual-report/">estimated</a> 94 million US adults—or roughly 36 percent of them—having adopted them. They store not only passwords for pension, financial, and email accounts, but also cryptocurrency credentials, payment card numbers, and other sensitive data.</p>
<p>All eight of the top password managers have adopted the term “zero knowledge” to describe the complex encryption system they use to protect the data vaults that users store on their servers. The definitions vary slightly from vendor to vendor, but they generally boil down to one bold assurance: that there is no way for malicious insiders or hackers who manage to compromise the cloud infrastructure to steal vaults or data stored in them. These promises make sense, given <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/lastpass-says-hackers-have-obtained-vault-data-and-a-wealth-of-customer-info/">previous</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/lastpass-hackers-infected-employees-home-computer-and-stole-corporate-vault/">breaches</a> of LastPass and the reasonable expectation that state-level hackers have both the motive and capability to obtain password vaults belonging to high-value targets.</p>
<h2>A bold assurance debunked</h2>
<p>Typical of these claims are those made by Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, which together are used by roughly 60 million people. Bitwarden, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/pdf/resources-zero-knowledge-encryption-white-paper.pdf">for example</a>, says that “not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data (even if we wanted to).” Dashlane, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/download/whitepaper-en.pdf">says</a> that without a user’s master password, “malicious actors can’t steal the information, even if Dashlane’s servers are compromised.” LastPass <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/how-zero-knowledge-keeps-passwords-safe">says</a> that no one can access the “data stored in your LastPass vault, except you (not even LastPass).”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/password-managers-promise-that-they-cant-see-your-vaults-isnt-always-true/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Talk show host Stephen Colbert said CBS forbade him from interviewing Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico because of a Federal Communications Commission threat to enforce the equal-time rule on late-night and daytime talk shows.</p>
<p>Talarico "was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast," Colbert <a href="https://youtu.be/oh7DPSP65JA?t=95">said on last night's episode</a> of <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>. "Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on, and because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this."</p>
<p>Colbert went on to describe some of the background Ars readers are already familiar with. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/trump-fcc-tries-to-get-more-republicans-on-late-night-and-daytime-talk-shows/">issued a warning</a> to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the <em>bona fide</em> news exemption to the equal-time rule, and subsequently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">opened an investigation</a> into ABC’s <em>The View</em> after an interview with Talarico.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/stephen-colbert-says-cbs-forbid-interview-of-democrat-because-of-fcc-threat/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>More than two years after Broadcom took over VMware, the virtualization company’s customers are still grappling with higher prices, uncertainty, and the challenges of reducing vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>Today, CloudBolt Software released a report, "<a href="https://www.cloudbolt.io/cii-report-the-mass-exodus-that-never-was/">The Mass Exodus That Never Was: The Squeeze Is Just Beginning,</a>" that provides insight into those struggles. CloudBolt is a hybrid cloud management platform provider that aims to identify VMware customers’ pain points so it can <a href="https://www.cloudbolt.io/cloud-provider/vmware/">sell them</a> relevant solutions. In the report, CloudBolt said it surveyed 302 IT decision-makers (director-level or higher) at North American companies with at least 1,000 employees in January. The survey is far from comprehensive, but it offers a look at the obstacles these users face.</p>
<p>Broadcom closed its VMware acquisition in November 2023, and last month, 88 percent of survey respondents still described the change as “disruptive.” Per the survey, the most cited drivers of disruption were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/broadcoms-prohibitive-vmware-prices-create-a-learning-barrier-it-pro-says/">price increases</a> (named by 89 percent of respondents), followed by uncertainty about Broadcom’s plans (85 percent), support quality concerns (78 percent), Broadcom shifting VMware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/some-vmware-perpetual-license-owners-are-unable-to-download-security-patches/">from perpetual licenses to subscriptions</a> (72 percent), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/more-vmware-cloud-partners-axed-as-broadcom-launches-new-invite-only-program/">changes to VMware’s partner program</a> (68 percent), and the forced bundling of products (65 percent).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/most-vmware-users-still-actively-reducing-their-vmware-footprint-survey-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Imagine turning the key or pressing the start button of your car—and nothing happens. Not because the battery is dead or the engine is broken but because a server no longer answers. For a growing number of cars, that scenario isn’t hypothetical.</p>
<p>As vehicles become platforms for software and subscriptions, their longevity is increasingly tied to the survival of the companies behind their code. When those companies fail, the consequences ripple far beyond a bad app update and into the basic question of whether a car still functions as a car.</p>
<p>Over the years, automotive software has expanded from performing rudimentary engine management and onboard diagnostics to powering today’s interconnected, software-defined vehicles. Smartphone apps can now handle tasks like unlocking doors, flashing headlights, and preconditioning cabins—and some models won’t unlock at all unless a phone running the manufacturer’s app is within range.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/what-happens-to-a-car-when-the-company-behind-its-software-goes-under/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ram-shortage-delays-valves-steam-machine-desktop-and-steam-frame-headset/">announced</a> it was delaying the release of its new Steam Machine desktop and Steam Frame VR headset due to memory and storage shortages that have been cascading across the PC industry since late 2025. But those shortages are also coming for products that have already launched.</p>
<p>Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">noting</a> that the device would be "out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages." None of Valve's three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished">certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations</a> that Valve sometimes offers.</p>
<p>Valve hasn't announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck's de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344310/valve-discontinues-steam-deck-lcd-oled-versions-remain#g344310-2">announced in December</a> that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn't be restocked once it sold out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/valves-steam-deck-intermittently-out-of-stock-as-ram-shortage-drags-on/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Officially, Warner Bros. is still committed to Netflix. The company today scheduled a special meeting date of March 20 and recommended that shareholders vote for the Netflix merger. But Warner Bros. is simultaneously opening negotiations with Paramount despite calling all of its previous offers deficient.</p>
<p>"Netflix has provided WBD a limited waiver under the terms of WBD’s merger agreement with Netflix, permitting WBD to engage in discussions with Paramount Skydance for a seven-day period ending on February 23, 2026 to seek clarity for WBD stockholders and provide PSKY the ability to make its best and final offer," Warner Bros. <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001437107/649b516f-3377-4625-b31f-1263ec96869c.pdf">said today</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/warner-bros-gives-paramount-one-more-week-to-beat-netflix-merger-offer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>No one will supplant American and Chinese dominance in the space launch arena anytime soon, but several longtime US allies now see sovereign access to space as a national security imperative.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of private launch initiatives already underway within their own borders, several middle and regional powers have approved substantial government funding for commercial startups to help them reach the launch pad. Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are among the nations that currently lack the ability to independently put their own satellites into orbit but which are now spending money to establish a domestic launch industry. Others talk a big game but haven't committed the cash to back up their ambitions.</p>
<p>The moves are part of a wider trend among US allies to increase defense spending amid strained relations with the Trump administration. Tariffs, trade wars, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/us/politics/munich-democrats-cortez-greenland-trump.html">threats to invade the territory of a NATO ally</a> have changed the tune of many foreign leaders.

<p>At long last, we have the official full trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_and_Grogu"><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em></a>, a feature film spinoff from Disney's megahit Star Wars series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/reunited-din-djarin-and-grogu-face-new-battles-in-the-mandalorian-s3-trailer/"><em>The</em> <em>Mandalorian</em></a>.</p>
<p>Grogu (fka "Baby Yoda") <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/our-fave-star-wars-duo-is-back-in-mandalorian-and-grogu-teaser/">won viewers’ hearts</a> from the moment he first appeared onscreen in the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, and the relationship between the little green creature and his father-figure bounty hunter, the titular Mandalorian, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), has only gotten stronger. With the 2023 Hollywood strikes delaying production on season 4 of the series, director Jon Favreau got the green light to make this spinoff film.</p>
