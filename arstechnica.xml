                            <![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, tech entrepreneur Siqi Chen <a href="https://github.com/blader/humanizer">released</a> an open source plugin for Anthropic's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/">Claude Code</a> AI assistant that instructs the AI model to stop writing like an AI model. Called "Humanizer," the simple prompt plugin feeds Claude a list of 24 language and formatting patterns that Wikipedia editors have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing">listed</a> as chatbot giveaways. Chen published the plugin on GitHub, where it has picked up over 1,600 stars as of Monday.</p>
<p>"It's really handy that Wikipedia went and collated a detailed list of 'signs of AI writing,'" Chen <a href="https://x.com/blader/status/2013015738622284156">wrote</a> on X. "So much so that you can just tell your LLM to ... not do that."</p>
<p>The source material is a guide from WikiProject AI Cleanup, a group of Wikipedia editors who have been hunting AI-generated articles since late 2023. French Wikipedia editor Ilyas Lebleu founded the project. The volunteers have tagged over 500 articles for review and, in August 2025, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing">published</a> a formal list of the patterns they kept seeing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/new-ai-plugin-uses-wikipedias-ai-writing-detection-rules-to-help-it-sound-human/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Helix Nebula is one of the most well-known and commonly photographed planetary nebulae because it resembles the "<a href="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1000w,f_auto,q_auto:best/streams/2012/February/120220/61361-6330284.jpg">Eye of Sauron</a>." It is also one of the closest bright nebulae to Earth, located approximately 655 light-years from our Solar System.</p>
<p>You may not know what this particular nebula looks like when reading its name, but the Hubble Space Telescope has taken some iconic images of it over the years. And almost certainly, you'll recognize a photograph of the Helix Nebula, shown below.</p>
<p>Like many objects in astronomy, planetary nebulae have a confusing name, since they are formed not by planets but by stars like our own Sun, though a little larger. Near the end of their lives, these stars shed large amounts of gas in an expanding shell that, however briefly in cosmological time, put on a grand show.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/webb-has-given-us-with-a-stunning-new-view-of-a-well-known-planetary-nebula/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Still feeling uneasy about Meta's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, the Federal Trade Commission will be appealing a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/meta-wins-monopoly-trial-convinces-judge-that-social-networking-is-dead/">November ruling</a> that cleared Meta of allegations that it holds an illegal monopoly in a market dubbed "personal social networking."</p>
<p>The FTC hopes the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will agree that "robust evidence at trial" showed that Meta's acquisitions were improper. In the initial trial, the FTC sought a breakup of Meta's apps, with Meta risking forced divestments of Instagram or WhatsApp.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2026/01/ftc-appeals-ruling-meta-monopolization-case">press release</a> Tuesday, the FTC confirmed that it "continues to allege" that "for over a decade Meta has illegally maintained a monopoly in personal social networking services through anticompetitive conduct—by buying the significant competitive threats it identified in Instagram and WhatsApp."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/zuck-stuck-on-trumps-bad-side-ftc-appeals-loss-in-meta-monopoly-case/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Verizon has started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division, one week after the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fcc-lets-verizon-lock-phones-for-longer-making-it-harder-to-switch-carriers/">waived a requirement</a> that Verizon unlock handsets 60 days after they are activated on its network.</p>
<p>Verizon was previously required to unlock phones automatically after 60 days due to restrictions imposed on its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/05/verizon-we-promise-to-honor-the-block-c-open-access-rules/">spectrum licenses</a> and <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-21-121A1.pdf">merger conditions</a> that helped Verizon obtain approval of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/verizon-to-buy-tracfone-expanding-big-carriers-control-of-prepaid-industry/">purchase of TracFone</a>. But an update applied today to the <a href="https://www.tfwunlockpolicy.com/wps/portal/home/">TracFone unlocking policy</a> said new phones will be locked for at least a year and that each customer will have to request an unlock instead of getting it automatically.</p>
<p>The "new" TracFone policy is basically a return to the yearlong locking it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210922001247/https://www.tfwunlockpolicy.com/wps/portal/home">imposed</a> before Verizon bought the company in 2021. TracFone first agreed to provide unlocking in a 2015 <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-334195A1.pdf">settlement with the Obama-era FCC</a>, which alleged that TracFone failed to comply with a commitment to unlock phones for customers enrolled in the Lifeline subsidy program. TracFone later shortened the locking period from a year to 60 days as a condition of the Verizon merger.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-starts-requiring-365-days-of-paid-service-before-it-will-unlock-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>YouTubers have been increasingly frustrated with Google's management of the platform, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/youtube-explains-how-banned-creators-can-get-a-second-chance/">disinformation welcomed back</a> and an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/googles-updated-veo-model-can-make-vertical-videos-from-reference-images-with-4k-upscaling/">aggressive push for more AI</a> (except where Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/youtube-bans-two-popular-channels-that-created-fake-ai-movie-trailers/">doesn't like it</a>). So it's no surprise that creators have been up in arms over the suspicious removal of YouTube's advanced SRV3 caption format. You don't have to worry too much just yet—Google says this is only temporary, and it's working on a fix for the underlying bug.</p>
<p>Google added support for this custom subtitle format around 2018, giving creators more customization options than with traditional captions. SRV3 (also known as YTT or YouTube Timed Text) allows for custom colors, transparency, animations, fonts, and precise positioning in videos. Uploaders using this format can color-code and position captions to help separate multiple speakers, create sing-along animations, or style them to match the video.</p>
<p>Over the last several days, creators who've become accustomed to this level of control <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1qdvgmc/uploading_srv3_subtitles_got_brokendisabled/?sort=new">have been dismayed</a> to see that YouTube is no longer accepting videos with this Google-created format. Many worried Google had ditched the format entirely, which could be problematic for all those previously uploaded videos.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/google-temporarily-disabled-youtubes-advanced-captions-without-warning/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00526.html">a health alert to clinicians</a> Tuesday, warning that the savage, flesh-eating parasitic fly—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/screwworms-are-coming-and-theyre-just-as-horrifying-as-they-sound/">the New World Screwworm</a>—is not only approaching the Texas border, but also felling an increasing number of animals in the bordering Mexican state of Tamaulipas.</p>
<p>The advisory, released through the agency's Health Alert Network, directs doctors, veterinarians, and other health workers to be on the lookout for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/screwworm-larvae-eat-their-way-into-us-via-overseas-travelers-flesh/">patients with wounds teeming with ferocious maggots</a> burrowing into their living flesh. The alert also provides guidance on what to do if any such festering wounds are encountered—namely, remove each and every maggot to prevent the patient from dying, and, under no circumstance allow any of the parasites to survive and escape.</p>
<p>The New World Screwworm (NWS) is a fly that lays its eggs—up to 400 at a time—in the wounds, orifices, and mucus membranes of any warm-blooded animal. The eggs hatch into flesh-eating maggots, which look and act much like screws, twisting and boring into their victims while eating them alive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/be-on-the-lookout-for-flesh-eating-flies-cdc-tells-clinicians-in-alert/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Recent advances in brain-computer interfaces have made it possible to more accurately extract speech from neural signals in humans, but language is just one of the tools we use to communicate. “When my young nephew asks for ice cream before dinner and I say ‘no,’ the meaning is entirely dictated by whether the word is punctuated with a smirk or a stern frown,” says Geena Ianni, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania. That’s why in the future, she thinks, neural prostheses meant for patients with a stroke or paralysis will decode facial gestures from brain signals in the same way they decode speech.</p>
<p>To lay a foundation for these future facial gesture decoders, Ianni and her colleagues designed an experiment to find out how neural circuitry responsible for making faces really works. “Although in recent years neuroscience got a good handle on how the brain perceives facial expressions, we know relatively little about how they are generated,” Ianni says. And it turned out that a surprisingly large part of what neuroscientists assumed about facial gestures was wrong.</p>
<h2>The natural way</h2>
<p>For a long time, neuroscientists thought facial gestures in primates stemmed from a neat division of labor in the brain. “Case reports of patients with brain lesions suggested some brain regions were responsible for certain types of emotional expressions while other regions were responsible for volitional movements like speech,” Ianni explains. We’ve developed a clearer picture of speech by tracing the origin of these movements down to the level of individual neurons. But we’ve not done the same for facial expressions. To fill this gap, Ianni and her team designed a study using macaques—social primates that share most of their complex facial musculature with humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/macaque-facial-gestures-are-more-than-just-a-reflex-study-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The sprawling International Space Station is due to be decommissioned less than five years from now, and the US space agency has yet to formally publish rules and requirements for the follow-on stations being designed and developed by several different private companies.</p>
<p>Although there are expected to be multiple bidders in "phase two" of NASA's commercial space station program, there are at present four main contenders: Voyager Technologies, Axiom Space, Blue Origin, and Vast Space. At some point later this year, the space agency is expected to select one, or more likely two, of these companies for larger contracts that will support their efforts to build their stations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/the-first-commercial-space-station-haven-1-is-now-undergoing-assembly-for-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—Preparations for the first human spaceflight to the Moon in more than 50 years took a big step forward this weekend with the rollout of the Artemis II rocket to its launch pad.</p>
<p>The rocket reached a top speed of just 1 mph on the four-mile, 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At the end of its nearly 10-day tour through cislunar space, the Orion capsule on top of the rocket will exceed 25,000 mph as it plunges into the atmosphere to bring its four-person crew back to Earth.</p>
<p class="p1">"This is the start of a very long journey," said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. "We ended our last human exploration of the moon on Apollo 17."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-artemis-ii-rocket-rolls-to-launch-pad-but-key-test-looms-ahead/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It has been nearly three years now since <em>Destiny</em> maker (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/sony-to-acquire-bungie-destiny-series-for-3-6-billion/">Sony subsidiary</a>) Bungie <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/remember-marathon-bungies-pre-halo-and-destiny-shooter-its-back-kind-of/">formally announced</a> a revival of the storied <em>Marathon</em> FPS franchise. And it has been about seven months since the game's originally announced release date of September 23, 2025, was <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">pushed back indefinitely</a> after a reportedly poor response to the game's first Alpha test.</p>
<p>But today, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/bungie-unveils-marathon/">a post on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Bungie revealed that the new <em>Marathon</em> would finally be hitting PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on March 5, narrowing down the monthlong March release window <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">announced back in December</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Destiny 2</em>, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/destiny-2-will-become-free-to-play-later-this-year-fully-cross-platform/">transitioned to a free-to-play model in 2019</a>, the new <em>Marathon</em> sells a Standard Edition for $40 or a $60 Deluxe Edition that includes some digital rewards and cosmetics. That mirrors the pricing of the somewhat similar <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which recently hit 12 million sales in less than 12 weeks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/bungies-delayed-marathon-revival-will-finally-launch-march-5/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Mac power users waiting on new high-end MacBook Pro models may have been disappointed last fall when Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/m5-macbook-pro-review-fifth-generation-apple-silicon-in-a-familiar-wrapper/">released an M5 upgrade for the low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> without touching the M4 Pro or Max versions of the laptop. But the wait for M5 Pro and M5 Max models may be nearing its end.</p>
<p>The tea-leaf readers at MacRumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/18/macbook-pro-up-to-two-month-wait/">noticed</a> that shipping times for a handful of high-end MacBook Pro configurations have slipped into mid-to-late February, rather than being available immediately as most Mac models are. This is often, though not always, a sign that Apple has slowed down or stopped production of an existing product in anticipation of an update.</p>
<p>Currently, the shipping delays affect the M4 Max versions of both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. If you order them today, these models will arrive sometime between February 3 and February 24, depending on the configuration you choose; many M4 Pro versions are still available for same-day shipping, though adding a nano-texture display or upgrading RAM can still add a week or so to the shipping time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/signs-point-to-a-sooner-rather-than-later-m5-macbook-pro-refresh/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk is going for some substantial damages in his lawsuit accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission and "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/openai-wouldnt-exist-without-me-elon-musk-says-reviving-lawsuit/">making a fool out of him" as an early investor</a>.</p>
<p>On Friday, Musk filed a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Musk-v-Altman-Notice-of-Remedies.pdf">notice</a> on remedies sought in the lawsuit, confirming that he's seeking damages between $79 billion and $134 billion from OpenAI and its largest backer, co-defendant Microsoft.</p>
<p>Musk hired an expert he has never used before, C. Paul Wazzan, who reached this estimate by concluding that Musk's early contributions to OpenAI generated 50 to 75 percent of the nonprofit's current value. He got there by analyzing four factors: Musk's total financial contributions before he left OpenAI in 2018, Musk's proposed equity stake in OpenAI in 2017, Musk's current equity stake in xAI, and Musk's nonmonetary contributions to OpenAI (like investing time or lending his reputation).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/elon-musk-accused-of-making-up-math-to-squeeze-134b-from-openai-microsoft/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>An unconfirmed report early this month suggested Asus was pulling back on its smartphone plans, but the company declined to comment at the time. Asus chairman Jonney Shih has now confirmed during an event in Taiwan the wind-down of its smartphone business. Instead, Asus will focus on AI products like robots and smart glasses.</p>
<p>Shih addressed the company's future plans during a 2026 kick-off event in Taiwan, as reported by <a href="https://www.inside.com.tw/article/40522-asus-phone-nomore">Inside</a>. "Asus will no longer add new mobile phone models in the future," said Shih (machine translated).</p>
<p>So don't expect a new Zenfone or ROG Phone from Asus in 2026. That said, very few phone buyers were keeping tabs on the latest Asus phones anyway, which is probably why Asus is throwing in the towel. Shih isn't saying Asus won't ever release a new phone, but the company will take an "indefinite wait-and-see" approach. Again, this is a translation and could be interpreted in multiple ways.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/asus-confirms-its-smartphone-business-is-on-indefinite-hiatus/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Currently, Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/project-xcloud-preview-serves-as-a-passable-portable-xbox-one/">long-running</a> Cloud Gaming service is limited to players who have a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">Microsoft's Game Pass subscription</a>. Now, new reporting suggests Microsoft is planning to offer non-subscribers access to game streams paid for by advertising in the near future, but only in extremely limited circumstances.</p>
<p>The latest wave of rumors was set off late last week when The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomwarren.co.uk/post/3mcljqyff4k2d">shared an Xbox Cloud Gaming loading screen</a> with a message mentioning "1 hour of ad supported playtime per session." That leaked message comes after <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-getting-next-gen-treatment-too">Windows Central reported last summer</a> that Microsoft has been "exploring video ads for free games for quite some time," à la <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/faq/#nv-accordion-f0f63b4f7a-item-28f64413e6">the two-minute sponsorships that appear before free-tier game streams on Nvidia's GeForce Now service</a>.</p>
<p>Don't get your hopes up for easy, free, ad-supported access to the entire Xbox Cloud Gaming library, though. Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-cloud-gaming-will-get-an-ad-supported-tier-this-year-rumors-coalesce-after-ad-support-notices-appear-prematurely">now reports</a> that Microsoft will be using ads merely to slightly expand access to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/buy-and-stream">its "Stream your own game" program</a>. That program currently offers subscribers to the Xbox Game Pass Essentials tier (or higher) the privilege of streaming versions of some of the Xbox games they've already purchased digitally. Windows Central's unnamed sources suggest that a "session-based ad-supported access tier" to stream those purchased games will be offered to non-subscribers as soon as "this year."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/reports-of-ad-supported-xbox-game-streams-show-microsofts-lack-of-imagination/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I have been writing about the Giant Magellan Telescope for a long time. <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/time-running-out-in-race-to-build-largest-1791289.php">Nearly two decades ago</a>, for example, I wrote that time was "running out" in the race to build the next great optical telescope on the ground.</p>
<p>At the time the proposed telescope was one of three contenders to make a giant leap in mirror size from the roughly 10-meter-diameter instruments that existed then, to approximately 30 meters. This represented a huge increase in light-gathering potential, allowing astronomers to see much further into the universe—and therefore back into time—with far greater clarity.</p>
<p>Since then the projects have advanced at various rates. An international consortium to build the Thirty Meter Telescope in Hawaii ran into local protests that have bogged down development. Its future came further into question when the US National Science Foundation <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2025/05/funding-cuts-may-doom-the-long-stalled-thirty-meter-telescope/">dropped support</a> for the project in favor of the Giant Magellan Telescope. Meanwhile the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) has advanced on a faster schedule, and this 39.5-meter telescope could observe its first light in 2029.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/as-europes-large-ground-telescope-project-advances-how-is-its-us-competitor-faring/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bAk4PFEuWKQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p><em>Far Side</em> fans might recall a classic 1982 cartoon called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools">Cow Tools</a>," featuring a cow standing next to a jumble of strange objects—the joke being that cows don't use tools. That's why a pet Swiss brown cow in Austria named Veronika has caused a bit of a sensation: she likes to pick up random sticks and use them to scratch herself. According to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01597-0">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, this is a form of multipurpose tool use and suggests that the cognitive capabilities of cows have been underestimated by scientists.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/11/parrot-in-captivity-manufactures-tools-something-not-seen-in-the-wild/">previously reported</a>, tool use was once thought to be one of the defining features of humans, but examples of it were eventually observed in primates and other mammals. Dolphins can toss objects as a form of play, which some scientists consider to be a type of tool use, particularly when it involves another member of the same species. Potential purposes include a means of communication, social bonding, or aggressiveness. (Octopuses have also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/take-that-octopuses-caught-on-camera-vigorously-throwing-debris-at-each-other/">been observed</a> engaging in similar throwing behavior.)</p>
<p>But the biggest surprise came when birds were observed using tools in the wild. After all, birds are the only surviving dinosaurs, and mammals and dinosaurs hadn’t shared a common ancestor for hundreds of millions of years. In the wild, observed <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2010/09/for-crows-a-little-tool-use-goes-a-long-way/">tool use has been limited</a> to the corvids (crows and jays), which show a variety of other complex behaviors—they’ll <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/bird-brains-crows-remember-your-face-and-know-youre-hiding-in-there/">remember your face</a> and recognize the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/birds-of-a-feather-flock-together-even-in-death/">passing of their dead</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/meet-veronika-the-tool-using-cow/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you've ever used a 3D printer, you may recall the wondrous feeling when you first printed something you could have never sculpted or built yourself. Download a model file, load some plastic filament, push a button, and almost like magic, a three-dimensional object appears. But the result isn't polished and ready for mass production, and creating a novel shape requires more skills than just pushing a button. Interestingly, today's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">AI coding agents</a> feel much the same way.</p>
<p>Since November, I have used <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">Claude Code</a> and Claude Opus 4.5 through a personal Claude Max account to extensively experiment with AI-assisted software development (I have also used OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">Codex</a> in a similar way, though not as frequently). Fifty projects later, I'll be frank: I have not had this much fun with a computer since I learned BASIC on my <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/440/shining-a-rotten-apple">Apple II Plus</a> when I was 9 years old. This opinion comes not as an endorsement but as personal experience: I voluntarily undertook this project, and I paid out of pocket for both OpenAI and Anthropic's premium AI plans.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have dabbled in programming as a utilitarian coder, writing small tools or scripts when needed. In my web development career, I wrote some small tools from scratch, but I primarily modified other people's code for my needs. Since 1990, I've programmed in BASIC, C, Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, Perl, Python, Ruby, MUSHcode, and some others. I am not an expert in any of these languages—I learned just enough to get the job done. I have developed my own hobby games over the years using BASIC, Torque Game Engine, and Godot, so I have some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/10-things-i-learned-from-burning-myself-out-with-ai-coding-agents/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The global cost of greenhouse gas emissions is nearly double what scientists previously thought, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02533-5">study</a> published Thursday by researchers at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>
<p>It is the first time a social cost of carbon (SCC) assessment—a key measure of economic harm caused by climate change—has included damages to the ocean. Global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction are estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion annually, fundamentally changing how we measure climate finance.</p>
<p>“For decades, we’ve been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,” said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. “Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/ocean-damage-nearly-doubles-the-cost-of-climate-change/">Read full article</a></p>
