<p>Welcome to Edition 6.40 of the Rocket Report! There was a lot of exciting news this week. For the first time, SpaceX launched a reusable Falcon 9 booster for a 20th flight. A few miles away at Cape Canaveral, Boeing and United Launch Alliance completed one of the final steps before the first crew launch of the Starliner spacecraft. But I think one of the most interesting things that happened was NASA's decision to ask the space industry for more innovative ideas on how to do Mars Sample Return. I have no doubt that space companies will come up with some fascinating concepts, and I can't wait to hear about them.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>Going vertical Down Under. </b>Gilmour Space has raised its privately-developed Eris rocket vertical on a launch pad in North Queensland for the first time, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-12/australias-first-locally-made-orbital-rocket-goes-vertical/103692582?utm_source=abc_news_app&amp;utm_medium=content_shared&amp;utm_campaign=abc_news_app&amp;utm_content=link">the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports</a>. This milestone marks the start of the next phase of launch preparations for Eris, a three-stage rocket powered by hybrid engines. If successful, Eris would become the first Australian-built rocket to reach orbit. Gilmour says the maiden flight of Eris is scheduled for no earlier than May 4, pending launch permit approvals. This presumably refers to a commercial launch license from the Australian government.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018466#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018466&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday senior Boeing officials leading the Space Launch System program, including David Dutcher and Steve Snell, convened an all-hands meeting for the more than 1,000 employees who work on the rocket.</p>
<p>According to two people familiar with the meeting, the officials announced that there would be a significant number of layoffs and reassignments of people working on the program. They offered a handful of reasons for the cuts, including the fact that timelines for NASA's Artemis lunar missions that will use the SLS rocket are slipping to the right.</p>
<p>Later on Thursday, in a statement provided to Ars, a Boeing spokesperson confirmed the cuts to Ars: "Due to external factors unrelated to our program performance, Boeing is reviewing and adjusting current staffing levels on the Space Launch System program."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018532#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018532&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Since 2021, federal law has required hospitals to publicly post their prices, allowing Americans to easily anticipate costs and shop around for affordable care—as they would for any other marketed service or product. But hospitals have mostly failed miserably at complying with the law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/ongoing-challenges-with-hospital-price-transparency/">A 2023 KFF analysis</a> on compliance found that the pricing information hospitals provided is "messy, inconsistent, and confusing, making it challenging, if not impossible, for patients or researchers to use them for their intended purpose." A <a href="https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/semi-annual-report-feb2024?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=sendto_localnewslettertest&amp;stream=top#_ga=2.87797776.98993747.1713459754-1027137399.1713459754">February 2024 report</a> from the nonprofit organization Patient Rights Advocate found that only 35 percent of 2,000 US hospitals surveyed were in full compliance with the 2021 rule.</p>
<p>But even if hospitals dramatically improved their price transparency, it likely wouldn't help when patients need emergency trauma care. After an unexpected, major injury, people are sent to the closest hospital and aren't likely to be shopping around for the best price from the back of an ambulance. If they did, though, they might also need to be treated for shock.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018504#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018504&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Subscribers lodged thousands of complaints related to inaccuracies in Amazon's Prime Video catalog, including incorrect content and missing episodes, according to a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-video-viewers-ditching-shows-due-to-catalog-errors-2024-4">Business Insider</a> report this week. While Prime Video users aren't the only streaming users dealing with these problems, Insider's examination of leaked "internal documents" brings more perspective into the impact of mislabeling and similar errors on streaming platforms.</p>
<p>Insider didn't publish the documents but said they show that "60 percent of all content-related customer-experience complaints for Prime Video last year were about catalogue errors," such as movies or shows labeled with wrong or missing titles.</p>
<p>Specific examples reportedly named in the document include Season 1, Episode 2 of <em>The Rings of Power</em> being available before Season 1, Episode 1; character names being mistranslated; <em>Continuum</em> displaying the wrong age rating; and the Spanish-audio version of <em>Die Hard With a Vengeance </em>missing a chunk of audio.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018222#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018222&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>X's chatbot Grok is supposed to be an AI engine crunching the platform's posts to surface and summarize breaking news, but this week, Grok's flaws were once again exposed when the chatbot got confused and falsely accused an NBA star of criminal vandalism.</p>
<p>"Klay Thompson Accused in Bizarre Brick-Vandalism Spree," Grok's headline read in an AI-powered trending-tab <a href="https://twitter.com/i/trending/1780463179388117057?s=09">post</a> that has remained on X (formerly Twitter) for days. Beneath the headline, Grok went into even more detail to support its fake reporting:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a bizarre turn of events, NBA star Klay Thompson has been accused of vandalizing multiple houses with bricks in Sacramento. Authorities are investigating the claims after several individuals reported their houses being damaged, with windows shattered by bricks. Klay Thompson has not yet issued a statement regarding the accusations. The incidents have left the community shaken, but no injuries were reported. The motive behind the alleged vandalism remains unclear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grok appears to be confusing a common basketball term, where players are said to be throwing "bricks" when they take an airball shot that doesn't hit the rim. <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/klay-thompson-accused-brick-vandalism-spree-ai-19407952.php">According to SF Gate</a>, which was one of the first outlets to report the Grok error, Thompson had an "all-time rough shooting" night, hitting none of his shots on what was his emotional last game with the Golden State Warriors before becoming an unrestricted free agent.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018467#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018467&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ah, Reddit! It's a constant source of amazing stories that sound too good to be true... and yet! The latest example <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fossils/comments/1c4hldl/found_a_mandible_in_the_travertin_floor_at_my/">comes to us</a> from a user named Kidipadeli75, a dentist who visited his parents after the latter's kitchen renovation and noticed what appeared to be a human-like jawbone embedded in the new travertine tile. Naturally, he posted a photograph to Reddit seeking advice and input. And Reddit was happy to oblige.</p>
<p>User MAJOR_Blarg, for instance, is a dentist "with forensic odontology training" and offered the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>While all old-world monkeys, apes, and hominids share the same dental formula, 2-1-2-3, and the individual molars and premolars can look similar, the specific spacing in the mandible itself is very specifically and characteristically human, or at least related and very recent hominid relative/ancestor. Most likely human given the success of the proliferation of H.s. and the (relatively) rapid formation of travertine.</p>
<p>Against modern Homo sapiens, which may not be entirely relevant, the morphology of the mandible is likely not northern European, but more similar to African, middle Eastern, mainland Asian.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another user, deamatrona, who claims to hold an anthropology degree, also thought the dentition looked Asiatic, "which could be a significant find." The thread also drew the attention of <a href="https://johnhawks.net/johnhawks/">John Hawks</a>, an anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and longtime science blogger who <a href="https://johnhawks.net/weblog/how-many-bathrooms-have-neandertals-in-the-tile/">provided some valuable context</a> on his own website. (Hawks has been involved with the team that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/anthropologists-find-evidence-that-homo-naledi-buried-their-dead-used-symbols/">discovered <em>Homo naledi</em></a> at the Rising Star cave system in 2013.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018331#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018331&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Thursday, Meta unveiled early versions of its <a href="https://llama.meta.com/llama3/">Llama 3</a> open-weights AI model that can be used to power text composition, code generation, or chatbots. It also announced that its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-ai-assistant-built-with-llama-3/">Meta AI Assistant</a> is now <a href="https://www.meta.ai/?utm_source=ai_meta_site&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=MetaAI_page&amp;utm_campaign=April_moment">available on a website</a> and is going to be integrated into its major social media apps, intensifying the company's efforts to position its products against other AI assistants like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Google's Gemini.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/">Llama 2</a>, Llama 3 is notable for being a freely available, open-weights large language model (LLM) provided by a major AI company. Llama 3 technically does not quality as "open source" because that term has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">specific meaning</a> in software (as we have mentioned in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/elon-musks-xai-releases-grok-source-and-weights-taunting-openai/">other coverage</a>), and the industry has not yet settled on terminology for AI model releases that ship either code or weights with restrictions (you can read Llama 3's license <a href="https://llama.meta.com/llama3/license/">here</a>) or that ship without providing training data. We typically call these releases "open weights" instead.</p>
<p>At the moment, Llama 3 is available in two parameter sizes: 8 billion (8B) and 70 billion (70B), both of which are available as free downloads through Meta's website with a <a href="https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads">sign-up.</a> Llama 3 comes in two versions: pre-trained (basically the raw, next-token-prediction model) and instruction-tuned (fine-tuned to follow user instructions). Each has a 8,192 token context limit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018303#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018303&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Meta has announced it's permanently lowering the price of its aging Quest 2 headset to $199 for a 128GB base model, representing the company's lowest price yet for a full-featured untethered VR headset.</p>
<p>The Quest 2, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/review-we-do-not-recommend-the-299-oculus-quest-2-as-your-next-vr-system/">launched in 2020 at $299</a>, famously defied tech product convention by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/meta-quest-2-vr-headset-price-jumps-100-to-399-gets-zero-new-features/"><em>increasing</em> its MSRP to $399</a> amid inflation and supply chain issues in mid-2022. Actual prices for the headset at retail have fallen since then, though; Best Buy offered new units <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231028115543/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb-gray/6473553.p?skuId=6473553">for $299 as of last October</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231124064121/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb-gray/6473553.p?skuId=6473553">for $250 by the 2023 post-Thanksgiving shopping season</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>And the Quest 2 is far from the company's state-of-the-art headset at this point. Meta launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-absurdly-expensive-quest-pro-is-now-slightly-less-absurdly-expensive/">the surprisingly expensive Quest Pro</a> in late 2022 before dropping that headset's price from $1,499 to $999 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-absurdly-expensive-quest-pro-is-now-slightly-less-absurdly-expensive/">less than five months later</a>. And last year's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">launch of the Quest 3</a> at a $499 starting price brought some significant improvements in resolution, processing power, thickness, and full-color passthrough images over the Quest 2.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018413#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018413&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google is doing <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/building-ai-future-april-2024/">a major re-org</a> of Android, Chrome, and the Google hardware division: They're merging! Google Hardware SVP Rick Osterloh will lead the new "Platforms and Devices” division. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's previous head of software platforms like Android and ChromeOS, will be headed to "some new projects" at Google.</p>
<p>"Having a unified team across Platforms &amp; Devices will help us deliver higher quality products and experiences for our users and partners," writes Google CEO Sundar Pichai. "It will help us turbocharge the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bring the best innovations to partners faster — as we did with Circle to Search with Samsung. And internally, it will also speed up decision-making."</p>
<p>Google also justifies the decision the same way it does most decisions nowadays: by saying it's AI-related. The announcement is a few paragraphs in a wide-ranging post by Pichai, titled, "Building for our AI future," and the new division is taking a chunk of Google Research along with it, specifically the group that has been working on computational photography. Pichai wants the team to live in "the intersection of hardware, software, and AI."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018279#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018279&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX is reportedly working with at least one major US defense contractor, Northrop Grumman, on a constellation of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/northrop-grumman-working-with-musks-spacex-us-spy-satellite-system-2024-04-18/">According to Reuters</a>, development of the network of hundreds of spy satellites by SpaceX is being coordinated with multiple contractors to avoid putting too much control of a highly sensitive intelligence program in the hands of one company.</p>
<p>"It is in the government's interest to not be totally invested in one company run by one person," one of the news agency's sources said, most likely referring to SpaceX founder Elon Musk.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018357#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018357&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination does not prohibit police officers from forcing a suspect to unlock a phone with a thumbprint scan, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday. The ruling does not apply to all cases in which biometrics are used to unlock an electronic device but is a significant decision in an unsettled area of the law.</p>
<p>The US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had to grapple with the question of "whether the compelled use of Payne's thumb to unlock his phone was testimonial," the <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2024/04/17/22-50262.pdf">ruling</a> in <em>United States v. Jeremy Travis Payne</em> said. "To date, neither the Supreme Court nor any of our sister circuits have addressed whether the compelled use of a biometric to unlock an electronic device is testimonial."</p>
<p>A three-judge panel at the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously against Payne, affirming a US District Court's denial of Payne's motion to suppress evidence. Payne was a California parolee who was arrested by California Highway Patrol (CHP) after a 2021 traffic stop and charged with possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, and cocaine.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018347#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018347&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Password-manager LastPass users were recently targeted by a convincing phishing campaign that used a combination of email, SMS, and voice calls to trick targets into divulging their master passwords, company officials said.</p>
<p>The attackers used an advanced phishing-as-a-service kit <a href="https://www.lookout.com/threat-intelligence/article/cryptochameleon-fcc-phishing-kit">discovered in February</a> by researchers from mobile security firm Lookout. Dubbed CryptoChameleon for its focus on cryptocurrency accounts, the kit provides all the resources needed to trick even relatively savvy people into believing the communications are legitimate. Elements include high-quality URLs, a counterfeit single sign-on page for the service the target is using, and everything needed to make voice calls or send emails or texts in real time as targets are visiting a fake site. The end-to-end service can also bypass multi-factor authentication in the event a target is using the protection.</p>
<h2>LastPass in the crosshairs</h2>
<p>Lookout said that LastPass was one of dozens of sensitive services or sites CryptoChameleon was configured to spoof. Others targeted included the Federal Communications Commission, Coinbase and other cryptocurrency exchanges, and email, password management, and single sign-on services including Okta, iCloud, and Outlook. When Lookout researchers accessed a database one CryptoChameleon subscriber used, they found that a high percentage of the contents collected in the scams appeared to be legitimate email addresses, passwords, one-time-password tokens, password reset URLs, and photos of driver’s licenses. Typically, such databases are filled with junk entries.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018339#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018339&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Long-time <em>Fallout</em> fans are used to long waits between titles, and, depending on their preferences, inconsistent results. But when Amazon's <em>Fallout </em>series showed up on Prime and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/three-episodes-in-the-fallout-tv-series-absolutely-nails-it/">absolutely nailed it</a>, it spurred a lot of players to crack open their libraries and commence some post-apocalyptic replaying. And maybe first-time playing, too.</p>
<p><em>Fallout 76</em>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/fallout-76s-wastelanders-expansion-makes-west-virginia-feel-like-home/">online multiplayer title</a> that is the most recent full release, saw perhaps the biggest delta. The game hit its all-time peak of 43,887 simultaneous players on Wednesday, April 17, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340">according to SteamCharts</a>, roughly one week after the Amazon series' debut. For the year leading up to that peak, <em>Fallout 76</em> had hovered around 7,000-10,000 players through most of 2024, and then jumped after the series' debut. Of course, that number only counts PC players, and only those on Steam; the game, which launched simultaneously on consoles, and is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/fallout-76">available on Microsoft's Game Pass</a>, likely has many more players.</p>
<p>SteamDB, another Steam stats tracker, suggested on X (formerly Twitter) that the <em>Fallout</em> game series as a whole had <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1779459741984379079">more than doubled its concurrent player count by April 14</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018228#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018228&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, Colorado <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1058">expanded the scope of its privacy law</a> initially designed to protect biometric data like fingerprints or face images to become first in the nation to also shield sensitive neural data.</p>
<p>That could stop companies from hoarding brain activity data without residents realizing the risks. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/science/colorado-brain-data-privacy.html">reported</a> that neural data is increasingly being collected and sold nationwide. And after a <a href="https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/546252348/global-neurotech-industry-investment-digest-2021">market analysis</a> showed that investments in neurotechnology leapt by 60 percent globally from 2019 to 2020—and were valued at $30 billion in 2021—Big Tech companies have significantly intensified plans to develop their own products to rake in potentially billions.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2023, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/mark-zuckerberg-ar-glasses-neural-interface-luxottica">Meta demoed a wristband</a> with a neural interface used to control its smart glasses and unveiled an <a href="https://medium.com/ai-agi/meta-just-achieved-mind-reading-with-ai-a-breakthrough-in-brain-computer-interface-technology-98cf7deb6858">AI system that could be used to decode the mind</a>. In January, Elon Musk announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/01/elon-musks-neuralink-puts-brain-chip-in-first-human-amid-federal-scrutiny/">Neuralink implanted its first brain chip in a human</a> that can be used to control a device with their thoughts. And just last month, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/03/21/future-apple-vision-pro-brainwave-sensors-could-improve-mental-and-physical-health">Apple Insider reported</a> that "Apple is working on technology that could turn the Apple Vision Pro into a brainwave reader to improve mental health, assist with training and workouts, and help with mindfulness."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018276#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018276&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The United States has won an important battle in its war to keep low-cost Chinese electric vehicles from American car buyers. Today, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mexico-facing-us-pressure-will-halt-incentives-chinese-ev-makers-2024-04-18/">Reuters reports</a> that the Mexican federal government has responded to pressure from the US and will not offer incentives to Chinese automakers, like BYD, that are looking to establish North American manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>BYD last met with Mexican officials in January, according to Reuters, where it learned that Chinese automakers would not be offered tax breaks or cheap land to build factories.</p>
<p>Until now, Mexico has offered <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mexican-state-grants-tesla-153-million-incentives-factory-2023-12-14/">foreign automakers generous subsidies</a> that have made the country <a href="https://www.madeinmexicoinc.com/tax-incentives-in-mexico/">a cheap place to build cars</a>.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple's decision earlier this month to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/">open the iOS App Store to generic retro game emulators</a> is already bearing fruit. Delta <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">launched Wednesday</a> as one of the first officially approved iOS apps to emulate Nintendo consoles from the NES through the N64 and the Game Boy through the Nintendo DS (though unofficial options have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/nessnes-emulator-sneaks-into-ios-app-store/">snuck through in the past</a>).</p>
<p>Delta is an outgrowth of developer Riley Testut's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/10/ios-8-1-plugs-security-hole-that-made-it-easy-to-install-emulators/">earlier sideloadable GBA4iOS project</a>, which recently had its own<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/apple-removes-the-first-ios-game-boy-emulator-released-under-new-app-store-rules/"> unauthorized clone removed from the App Store</a>. Before Wednesday, iOS users could load Delta onto their devices only through <a href="https://altstore.io/">AltStore</a>, an iOS marketplace that used a Developer Mode workaround to sideload apps from a self-hosted server. European users can now get that AltStore directly on their iOS devices (for a small 1.50 euro/year fee), while North American users can simply <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">download Delta for free from the iOS App Store</a>, with no ads or user tracking to boot.</p>
<p>All that history means Delta is far from a slapdash app quickly thrown together to take advantage of Apple's new openness to emulation. The app is obviously built with iOS in mind and already integrates some useful features designed for the mobile ecosystem. While there are some updates we'd like to see in the future, this represents a good starting point for where Apple-approved game emulation can go on iOS.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018249#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018249&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2024/01/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-promises-another-year-of-google-layoffs/">promised more layoffs</a> at Google this year, and the company is delivering. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-layoffs-more-employees-2024-4">Business Insider</a> was the first to report the latest cuts are to "several teams" in Google's real estate and finance departments. The report adds: "One current employee said the changes were 'pretty large-scale' and that some roles are being moved abroad."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/17/google-restructures-finance-team-as-a-part-of-ai-shift-cfo-tells-employees-in-memo.html">CNBC</a> has a copy of the memo that Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat sent out to employees about the layoffs. Porat blames AI for the layoffs, saying, “The tech sector is in the midst of a tremendous platform shift with Al. As a company, this means we have the opportunity to make more helpful products for billions of users and provide faster solutions to our customers, but it also means we collectively have to make tough decisions, including how and where we work to align with our highest priority areas.” It's not clear how or if AI is actually taking over roles in real estate and finance.</p>
<p>Google has been making cuts across a ton of departments since 2022, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/google-ceo-calls-for-a-more-focused-and-efficient-google/">Pichai declared</a> Google was not productive enough. There was a big set of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/google-cuts-12000-jobs-the-largest-layoff-in-the-companys-history/">12,000 layoffs</a> in January 2023, and an almost uncountable number of smaller cuts since then. Google's cuts are aligned with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/apple-joins-amazon-google-and-microsoft-in-tech-industry-layoffs/">massive wave of layoffs</a> across the tech industry.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018195#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018195&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Blue whales have been considered the largest creatures to ever live on Earth. With a maximum length of nearly 30 meters and weighing nearly 200 tons, they are the all-time undisputed heavyweight champions of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Now, digging on a beach in Somerset, UK, a team of British paleontologists found the remains of an ichthyosaur, a marine reptile that could give the whales some competition. “It is quite remarkable to think that gigantic, blue-whale-sized ichthyosaurs were swimming in the oceans around what was the UK during the Triassic Period,” said Dean Lomax, a paleontologist at the University of Manchester who led the study.</p>
<h2>Giant jawbones</h2>
<p>Ichthyosaurs were found in the seas through much of the Mesozoic era, appearing as early as 250 million years ago. They had four limbs that looked like paddles, vertical tail fins that extended downward in most species, and generally looked like large, reptilian dolphins with elongated narrow jaws lined with teeth. And some of them were really huge. The largest ichthyosaur skeleton so far was found in British Columbia, Canada, measured 21 meters, and belonged to a particularly massive ichthyosaur called <em>Shonisaurus sikanniensis</em>. But it seems they could get even larger than that.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018235#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018235&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Mercedes-Benz's E Class badge possesses a lot of canon. When asked to picture a '90s-or-newer Mercedes full-size sedan, it's hard not to conjure up mental snapshots of W124-and-up generations schlepping around well-heeled suburban communities. I bet a lot of folks also picture the taxi lineup outside any German train station, too.</p>
<p>Well, at least I do. But I'm not talking about envisioning surly Munich cabbies but rather the faithful four-doors they putter around in. A lot of them are E Classes, which further proves that the cars have always been quintessential Mercedes luxury workhorses.</p>
<p>The brand-new 2024 E 350 4Matic, with its thrifty turbo-four powerplant, might have the most direct lineage in the US market to those cream-colored rickety diesels. It's easy on fuel for its size and ready to soak up all the miles across both traffic-ridden cityscapes and high-speed stretches of highway. And with its expansive suite of tech and mild hybrid propulsion, it's an overall great next chapter for the badge.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018186#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018186&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last October, I received an email with a hell of an opening line: “I fired a nuke at the US Copyright Office this morning.”</p>
<p>The message was from Elisa Shupe, a 60-year-old retired US Army veteran who had just filed a copyright registration for a novel she’d recently self-published. She’d used OpenAI's ChatGPT extensively while writing the book. Her application was an attempt to compel the US Copyright Office to overturn its policy on work made with AI, which generally requires would-be copyright holders to exclude machine-generated elements.</p>
