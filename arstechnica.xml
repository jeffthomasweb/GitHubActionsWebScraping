              <![CDATA[<p>In the growing canon of AI security, the indirect prompt injection has emerged as the most powerful means for attackers to hack large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-4 or Microsoft’s Copilot. By exploiting a model's inability to distinguish between, on the one hand, developer-defined prompts and, on the other, text in external content LLMs interact with, indirect prompt injections are remarkably effective at invoking harmful or otherwise unintended actions. Examples include divulging end users’ confidential contacts or emails and delivering falsified answers that have the potential to corrupt the integrity of important calculations.</p>
<p>Despite the power of prompt injections, attackers face a fundamental challenge in using them: The inner workings of so-called closed-weights models such as GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini are closely held secrets. Developers of such proprietary platforms tightly restrict access to the underlying code and training data that make them work and, in the process, make them black boxes to external users. As a result, devising working prompt injections requires labor- and time-intensive trial and error through redundant manual effort.</p>
<h2>Algorithmically generated hacks</h2>
<p>For the first time, academic researchers have devised a means to create computer-generated prompt injections against Gemini that have much higher success rates than manually crafted ones. The new method abuses fine-tuning, a feature offered by some closed-weights models for training them to work on large amounts of private or specialized data, such as a law firm’s legal case files, patient files or research managed by a medical facility, or architectural blueprints. Google makes its <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/model-tuning">fine-tuning for Gemini’s API</a> available free of charge.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/gemini-hackers-can-deliver-more-potent-attacks-with-a-helping-hand-from-gemini/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.37 of the Rocket Report! It's been interesting to watch how quickly European officials have embraced ensuring they have a space launch capability independent of other countries. A few years ago, European government satellites regularly launched on Russian Soyuz rockets, and more recently on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets from the United States. Russia is now <em>non grata</em> in European government circles, and the Trump administration is widening the trans-Atlantic rift. European leaders have cited the Trump administration and its close association with Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, as prime reasons to support sovereign access to space, a capability currently offered only by Arianespace. If European nations can reform how they treat their commercial space companies, there's enough ambition, know-how, and money in Europe to foster a competitive launch industry.</p>

<p><b>Isar Aerospace aims for weekend launch. </b>A German startup named Isar Aerospace is will try to launch its first rocket Saturday, aiming to become the first in a wave of new European launch companies to reach orbit, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/this-launcher-is-about-to-displace-the-v-2-as-germanys-largest-rocket/">Ars reports</a>. The Spectrum rocket consists of two stages, stands about 92 feet (28 meters) tall, and can haul payloads up to 1 metric ton (2,200 pounds) into low-Earth orbit. Based in Munich, Isar was founded by three university graduate students in 2018. Isar scrubbed a launch attempt Monday due to unfavorable winds at the launch site in Norway.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/rocket-report-stoke-is-stoked-sovereignty-is-the-buzzword-in-europe/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"Plaintiffs bring this action to vindicate their right to serve the remainder of their respective terms, to defend the integrity of the Commission, and to continue their work for the American people," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278902/gov.uscourts.dcd.278902.1.0_2.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya in US District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Trump last week sent Slaughter and Bedoya notices that said, "I am writing to inform you that you have been removed from the Federal Trade Commission, effective immediately."

            <![CDATA[Researchers ascribe it to "animus or prejudice against minority drivers."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that "driving while black" is a real phenomenon. Study after study has shown that minority drivers are ticketed at a higher rate, and data from speed cameras suggests that it's not because they commit traffic violations more frequently. But this leaves open the question of why. Bias is an obvious answer, but it's hard to eliminate an alternative explanation: Minority groups may engage in more unsafe driving, and the police are trying to deter that.</p>
<p>But now, Lyft has given a group of researchers access to detailed data from their drivers. The results confirm that minority drivers get more tickets, and they pay higher fines when they do. And the results also show that minorities aren't in any way more likely to speed or engage in unsafe driving. Which suggests, in their words, that the problem is "animus" against minority drivers.</p>
<h2>Giving research a Lyft</h2>
<p>The work was done thanks to cooperation from the ridesharing company Lyft, which provided data on its drivers in Florida, all 222,838 of them, along with a record of all the GPS pings their tracking systems sent into the company's servers. Combined with a detailed map of Florida's roads, along with their speed limits, they could determine when a given driver was speeding. They also obtained Florida police records of any accidents and cross-referenced their locations to any vehicle that experienced a sudden stop in that spot at the same time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/study-of-lyft-rideshare-data-confirms-minorities-get-more-tickets/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a long and gloomy winter, many people are looking forward to some summer travel. Google has some new tools to help you plan, but like most of what Google does now, the new features <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">lean heavily on AI</a>. And unusually, the most interesting of these additions is launching first on iOS.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.google/products/search/summer-travel-tips-ai-overviews-hotel-price-tracking/">Google says</a> that lots of people tend to take screenshots when they're planning a trip. Instead of letting those images become lost in your camera roll, Google will let you feed them into Maps. The new screenshot list feature will let you add those images to Maps, where Gemini will scan them to identify locations.</p>
<p>This feature is opt-in, and the AI doesn't appear to detect locations with image recognition. Instead, it looks for place names in text, allowing you to review the results before marking them on the map for later perusal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-announces-maps-screenshot-analysis-ai-itineraries-to-help-you-plan-trips/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This isn't the first we've heard about plans for an IPO; an article in The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/technology/discord-ipo.html">claimed</a> that Discord had begun exploratory meetings with bankers earlier this month. Even way back in 2022, Discord was exploring the option of a direct listing, but it now seems the company plans to go with a traditional IPO.</p>
<p>Launched in 2015, Discord was initially conceived as an improved way to facilitate communication while playing video games—and gaming-related uses still account for more than 90 percent of its activity. While some previous tools focused mainly on in-game voice chat, Discord supports text, voice, and video, as well as game streaming. It also has robust features for managing communities outside the game and has developer APIs for developing bots, tools, and games that can be used within its channels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) don't have to turn over information related to their government cost-cutting operations, at least for now, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday.</p>
<p>A federal judge previously ruled that 14 states suing the federal government can serve written discovery requests on Musk and DOGE. Musk, DOGE, and President Trump turned to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/us-tries-to-keep-doge-and-musk-work-secret-in-appeal-of-court-ordered-discovery/">attempt to block that order</a>.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel at the appeals court granted an emergency motion for a stay in an <a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/orders/docs/2025/03/25-5072LDSN2.pdf">order</a> issued yesterday, putting the lower-court ruling on hold pending further orders from the appeals court. "Petitioners have satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay," the panel ruling said. "In particular, petitioners have shown a likelihood of success on their argument that the district court was required to decide their motion to dismiss before allowing discovery."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/elon-musk-and-trump-win-fight-to-keep-doges-work-secret/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I played a lot of Obsidian's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/avowed-review-wait-are-we-the-baddies/"><em>Avowed</em> after it came out</a>. I appreciate that the game offers both a whole lot of world-building lore if you want it, but also the ability to skip it all if you want to get back to grimoires, guns, and scarfing food while dodging attacks. But all those gods and races and islands must have sunk in. As I neared the end of <em>Avowed</em>'s journey, I find myself wondering about the earlier games in Obsidian's world of Eora in its <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> series, which passed me by entirely.</p>
<p>The same thing happened with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-early-impressions-youll-spend-whole-weeks-in-here-and-love-it/"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/the-shove-mechanic-in-baldurs-gate-3-can-ruin-an-encounter-and-i-love-it/">pulled me in deep</a> and left me wondering if I'd dig the earlier titles. But after an hour or two in the first entry, I was done, for much the same reason as with the first <em>Pillars: </em>I just can't hack it (pun intended) in real-time-with-pause combat.</p>
<p>"Real-time-with-pause" has never been a perfect descriptor; technically, <em>Avowed</em> plays out in real time, as do most games, which also offer pausing. But look at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYjG-3dIt6g&amp;list=PLszYe7po2j10XXleTCi1qFasJ9ztmbvxp">couple</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT8NaZI5ofA">videos</a> and you'll get the gist: Your party hacks, slashes, and casts largely on its own, but you can interject to redirect, re-equip, or force a potion on one of your crew. If you have control issues, or don't have the clicking speed you had as a younger gamer, real-time-with-pause can be a humbling experience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-turn-based-combat-all-but-demanding-replays/">Read full article</a></p>

Located in eastern China, not far from Shanghai, the new laboratory represented a partnership between China's national space agency and a local public college, the University of Science and Technology of China.</p>
<p>Not much is known outside of China about the laboratory, but it has recently revealed some very ambitious plans to explore the Solar System, including the outer planets. This week, as part of a presentation, Chinese officials shared some public dates about future missions.</p>

The HHS's 28 divisions will be cut down to 15, while five of the department's 10 regional offices will close.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Switch players who buy their games on physical cards are used to being able to share those games with other players simply by handing them the card. Now, Nintendo is planning a process to allow players to share their digital Switch purchases in a similar way.</p>
<p>The new "virtual game card" system—which Nintendo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwyh74MXXY">announced today</a> ahead of a planned late April rollout—will allow players to "load" and "eject" digital games via a dedicated management screen. An ejected digital game can't be played on the original console, but it can be digitally loaded onto a new console and played there without restriction by any user logged into that system.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>While an Internet connection is required when loading and ejecting digital games in this way, the Internet will not be required to play the shared digital game after that initial process is complete. And while both Switch consoles will need to be synced up via a "local connection" the first time such sharing is done, subsequent shares won't require the consoles to be in physical proximity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">Read full article</a></p>

One option is to develop processors that are a better match to the sort of computational needs of neural networks, which require many trips to memory and a lot of communication between artificial neurons that might not necessarily reside on the same processor. Termed "neuromorphic" processors, this alternative approach to hardware tends to have lots of small, dedicated processing units with their own memory and an extensive internal network connecting them.</p>
<p>Examples like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/understanding-neuromorphic-computing-and-why-intels-excited-about-it/">Intel's Loihi chips</a> tend to get competitive performance out of far lower clock speeds and energy use, but they require a lot of silicon to do so. Other options <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/08/ibm-team-builds-low-power-analog-ai-processor/">give up on silicon entirely</a> and perform the relevant computation in a form of phase change memory.</p>
<p>A paper published in Nature on Wednesday describes a way to get plain-old silicon transistors to behave a lot like an actual neuron. And unlike the dedicated processors made so far, it only requires two transistors to do so.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/researchers-get-spiking-neural-behavior-out-of-a-pair-of-transistors/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Space Force celebrated its fifth birthday last year, when it boasted an annual budget of $29 billion, about 3.5 percent of the Pentagon's overall funding level.</p>
<p>On March 15, President Donald Trump signed a stopgap spending bill that set the Space Force's budget for fiscal year 2025 at $28.7 billion. This was the first cut to the Space Force's budget since Trump created the military's newest service branch in 2019.</p>
<p>Gen. Chance Saltzman, the top general in the Space Force, worries that the budget crunch will hamstring the military's ability to match China's fast-growing space architecture. The Space Force is charged with developing and operating satellites, ground systems, and weapons that the Pentagon could use to track and target enemy forces on the ground and in space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/maybe-trump-should-go-back-to-calling-his-missile-shield-the-iron-dome/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday afternoon, once the markets were closed and could no longer react immediately, US President Donald Trump announced that starting on April 2, all imported automobiles and many imported car parts will now be subject to an extra 25 percent tariff. Despite Trump's rhetoric during his election campaign and since taking office, tariffs are paid for by those importing the goods, not the exporters, so we can look forward to most new cars and trucks—and their maintenance costs—getting a lot more expensive.</p>
<p>During his first term in office, Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/tariffs-on-biggest-us-trading-partners-likely-to-spike-cost-of-cars-tech/">started trade wars</a> with key US trading partners like Canada, the European Union, and China. Upon his return in 2025, more trade wars have been the name of the game. A 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico was threatened and then implemented at the beginning of March, before being partially reversed just two days later. Additionally, a 10 percent tariff on Chinese exports was also levied.</p>
<p>Less than two weeks later, a new 25 percent tariff on all steel and aluminum imports also joined the club.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>His comments come less than a month after the White House hailed the investment from TSMC, the world’s largest chip manufacturer, as an important milestone in efforts to bring production of the most advanced semiconductors back on to US soil.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have R&amp;D in the US, you will not have semiconductor leadership in the US,” Gelsinger said. “All of the R&amp;D work of TSMC is in Taiwan, and they haven’t made any announcements to move that.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/tsmcs-100-billion-pledge-wont-resurrect-us-chipmaking-says-intels-ex-ceo/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The arrival of OpenAI's DALL-E 2 in the spring of 2022 marked a turning point in AI, when text-to-image generation suddenly became accessible to a select group of users, creating a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/when-ai-images-were-mind-blowing-early-users-recall-the-first-days-of-dall-e-2/">community of digital explorers</a> who experienced wonder and controversy as the technology automated the act of visual creation.</p>
<p>But like many early AI systems, DALL-E 2 struggled with consistent text rendering, often producing garbled words and phrases within images. It also had limitations in following complex prompts with multiple elements, sometimes missing key details or misinterpreting instructions. These shortcomings left room for improvement that OpenAI would address in subsequent iterations, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">DALL-E 3</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">announced</a> new multimodal image-generation capabilities that are directly integrated into its GPT-4o AI language model, making it the default image generator within the ChatGPT interface. The integration, called "4o Image Generation" (which we'll call "4o IG" for short), allows the model to follow prompts more accurately (with better text rendering than DALL-E 3) and respond to chat context for image modification instructions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openais-new-ai-image-generator-is-potent-and-bound-to-provoke/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The first ever fatal crash involving a fully driverless vehicle occurred in San Francisco on January 19. The driverless vehicle belonged to Waymo, but the crash was not Waymo’s fault.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened: A Waymo with no driver or passengers stopped for a red light. Another car stopped behind the Waymo. Then, according to Waymo, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCQqu_ZBzic" rel="">a human-driven SUV rear-ended the other vehicles</a> at high speed, causing a six-car pileup that killed one person and injured five others. Someone’s dog also died in the crash.</p>
<p>Another major Waymo crash occurred in October in San Francisco. Once again, a driverless Waymo was stopped for a red light. According to Waymo, a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction crossed the double yellow line and crashed into an SUV that was stopped to the Waymo’s left. The force of the impact shoved the SUV into the Waymo. One person was seriously injured.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/after-50-million-miles-waymos-crash-a-lot-less-than-human-drivers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon discontinued <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/review-amazons-kindle-oasis-is-a-pricey-look-at-the-future-of-e-readers/">2016's Kindle Oasis</a> in early 2024, and since then, the company hasn't offered a new e-reader with physical page turn buttons or any other alternative to touchscreen input. There still isn't a Kindle with buttons, and the feature seems unlikely to return, but buyers of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/review-amazons-2024-kindle-paperwhite-makes-the-best-e-reader-a-little-better/">the latest Kindle Paperwhite</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazons-first-color-kindle-e-reader-the-kindle-colorsoft-will-run-you-280/">the Kindle Colorsoft</a> are getting a possible consolation prize in the new 5.18.1 software update: a "double tap to page turn" feature that will turn the page or move to the next screen when you double-tap on the back or side of the device.</p>
<p>The 5.18.1 software update is available on all Kindle readers going back to 2018's "10th generation" models, but the double-tap feature only works on the newest 12th-generation Paperwhite and the Colorsoft, not on any older Kindles or either Kindle Scribe model. We verified this firsthand by installing 5.18.1 on a 10th-generation Paperwhite, but we also checked the release notes for each individual Kindle on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW">Amazon's software update page</a>.</p>
<p>All Kindles that get the 5.18.1 update also gain access to new book summaries for "thousands of bestselling English language Kindle books," aiming to make it easier to pick up a new book in an ongoing series.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/newer-kindles-get-a-work-around-for-touchscreen-page-turning-in-new-software-update/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An eruption of measles is spreading quickly in Kansas, with cases doubling in a week and spreading to three new counties, some with vaccination coverage among kindergartners at pitiful levels as low as 41 percent. Coverage of 95 percent or greater is thought to protect communities from onward spread of the extremely contagious virus.</p>
<p>In an update Wednesday, March 26, Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) reported <a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y">23 measles cases across six counties</a>—up from 10 cases across three counties on March 21. The 23 people ill with the dangerous virus are mostly children, including six who are 0 to 4 years old, nine who are 5 to 10, three who are 11 to 13, three who are 14 to 17, and two adults between the ages of 25 and 44. Fortunately, none of the cases have been hospitalized so far, and there have been no deaths.</p>
<p>Twenty of the 23 cases were <a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Data">unvaccinated</a>. One case was "not age appropriately vaccinated," one was "age appropriately vaccinated," and the remaining case's vaccination status is pending.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/measles-quickly-spreading-in-kansas-counties-with-alarmingly-low-vaccination/">Read full article</a></p>
