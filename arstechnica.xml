<p>Last Tuesday, loads of Linux users—many running packages released as early as this year—started reporting their devices were failing to boot. Instead, they received a cryptic error message that included the phrase: “Something has gone seriously wrong.”</p>
<p>The cause: an <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-2601">update</a> Microsoft issued as part of its monthly patch release. It was intended to close a <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-2601">2-year-old vulnerability</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB">GRUB</a>, an open source boot loader used to start up many Linux devices. The vulnerability, with a severity rating of 8.6 out of 10, made it possible for hackers to bypass secure boot, the industry standard for ensuring that devices running Windows or other operating systems don’t load malicious firmware or software during the bootup process. CVE-2022-2601 was discovered in 2022, but for unclear reasons, Microsoft patched it only last Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Multiple distros, both new and old, affected</h2>
<p>Tuesday’s update left dual-boot devices—meaning those configured to run both Windows and Linux—no longer able to boot into the latter when Secure Boot was enforced. When users tried to load Linux, they received the message: “Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation.” Almost immediately <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1euuiwv/please_help_error_verifying_shim_sbat_data_failed/">support</a> and <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1523353/windows-aug-13-update-broke-my-ubuntu-system">discussion</a> forums <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/sbat-verification-error-booting-linux-after-windows-update/56354">lit up</a> with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1euuha4/please_help_error_message_verifying_shim_sbat/">​​reports</a> of the <a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=427297&amp;sid=dab5f35699069b1d030e710a1eb3c793">failure</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044381#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044381&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In news that will delight some and disappoint others, Disney has canceled Star Wars series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/06/star-wars-behind-the-scenes-creating-the-unique-aesthetic-of-the-acolyte/"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> after just one season, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/the-acolyte-canceled-no-season-2-star-wars-disney-plus-1236044233/">Deadline Hollywood reports</a>. The eight-episode series got off to a fairly strong start, with mostly positive reviews and solid ratings, albeit lower than prior Star Wars series. But it couldn't maintain and build upon that early momentum, and given the production costs, it's not especially surprising that Disney pulled the plug.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> arguably wrapped up its major narrative arc pretty neatly in the season finale, but it also took pains to set the stage for a possible sophomore season. In this streaming age, no series is ever guaranteed renewal. Still, it would have been nice to see what showrunner Leslye Headland had planned; when given the chance, many shows hit their stride on those second-season outings.</p>

We'll give you another heads-up when we get to major spoilers.)</strong></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044253#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044253&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the more than 30 hospitals in the Steward Health Care System scrounged for cash to cover supplies, shuttered pediatric and neonatal units, closed maternity wards, laid off hundreds of health care workers, and put patients in danger, the system paid out at least $250 million to its CEO and his companies, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/steward-health-ceo-ralph-de-la-torre-deabfe4b">according to a report by The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>The newly revealed financial details bring yet more scrutiny to Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre, a Harvard University-trained cardiac surgeon who, in 2020, took over majority ownership of Steward from the private equity firm Cerberus. De la Torre and his companies were reportedly paid at least $250 million since that takeover. In May, Steward, <a href="https://www.steward.org/network/our-hospitals">which has hospitals in eight states</a>, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Critics—including members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP)—allege that de la Torre and stripped the system's hospitals of assets, siphoned payments from them, and loaded them with debt, all while reaping huge payouts that made him obscenely wealthy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044320#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044320&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're a gamer of a certain age, you probably have fond memories of Peter Molyneux as the mind behind ambitious games like <em>Populous</em>, <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, and the <em>Fable</em> series. If you're of a slightly younger age, you probably remember him as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/on-kickstarter-everyone-is-peter-molyneux/">the serial overpromiser</a> behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/12/peter-molyneuxs-introspective-attempt-to-revive-the-god-game/"><em>Project Godus</em></a> and a recent NFT game that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/peter-molyneux-raises-54m-on-promise-of-play-to-earn-nft-game-legacy/">somehow attracted $54 million in player pre-investment</a> (it <a href="https://x.com/pmolyneux/status/1717558557413933076">did actually launch in some form last year</a>).</p>
<p>I bring up this history because, after years of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/serial-over-promiser-peter-molyneux-promises-to-stop-over-promising/">keeping his head down</a>, Molyneux made a surprise appearance at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT5ilwECdrA">Gamescom's Opening Night Live event</a>. He was there to introduce <em>Masters of Albion</em>, a title that host Geoff Keighley said Molyneux has "secretly been working on for the past three years" and which Molyneux himself describes as "an open-world god game full of combat, choices, mysteries, and story."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lqo48WyiHQ">short, early trailer</a> for the game takes us back to <em>Fable</em>'s "familiar vast world of Albion, packed with stories, quests, treasures, and monsters." There, the residents of the town of Oakridge have to work to gather and process resources by day and then defend themselves from hordes of creatures by night.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044312#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044312&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>At first glance, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review-satisfying-straightforward-nazi-hunting/"><em>Wolfenstein: The New Order</em></a> developer MachineGames might seem like an awkward fit for the first (non-Lego) Indiana Jones video game <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/06/this-week-in-game-releases-june-8-14-2009/">since the Wii era</a>. While there's some overlap in the over-the-top Nazi villain department, the "shoot your way through every obstacle" nature of the new <em>Wolfenstein</em> games doesn't seem to lend itself well to Indy's more free-wheeling, adventurous exploration style.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/first-look-at-indiana-jones-game-suggests-a-wolfenstein-like-romp/">the upcoming <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>, director Jerk Gustafsson said that going from first-person shooter to a "MachineGames adventure" style change has been a difficult tightrope walk for the developers. While the team never wanted to prevent the player from using their revolver during action scenes, there was the potential that giving a player that freedom would allow them to "just shoot their way through" in a way that's antithetical to Jones' character.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/STrKl828Aeg?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>To help avoid this problem, Creative Director Alex Torvenius said most of the game has been balanced so that "it's dangerous to shoot your gun and it's dangerous to be shot at." Guns-blazing action will be a winning strategy in some in-game situations, but "[there are] many scenarios where you can go through the environment without using guns at all," he continued.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044166#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044166&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Back in 2013, Nvidia introduced a new technology called G-Sync to eliminate screen tearing and stuttering effects and reduce input lag when playing PC games. The company accomplished this by tying your display's refresh rate to the actual frame rate of the game you were playing, and similar variable refresh-rate (VRR) technology has become a mainstay even in budget monitors and TVs today.</p>

<p>The issue for Nvidia is that G-Sync isn't what has been driving most of that adoption. G-Sync has always required extra dedicated hardware inside of displays, increasing the costs for both users and monitor manufacturers. The VRR technology in most low-end to mid-range screens these days is usually some version of the royalty-free AMD FreeSync or the similar <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/new-adaptive-sync-tiers-crack-down-on-misleading-response-times-flicker/">VESA Adaptive-Sync</a> standard, both of which provide G-Sync's most important features without requiring extra hardware. Nvidia more or less acknowledged that the free-to-use, cheap-to-implement VRR technologies had won <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/nvidia-certifies-select-freesync-monitors-as-g-sync-compatible/">in 2019</a> when it announced its "G-Sync Compatible" certification tier for FreeSync monitors. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/">The list of G-Sync Compatible screens</a> now vastly outnumbers the list of G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate screens.</p>
<p>Today, Nvidia is announcing a change that's meant to keep G-Sync alive as its own separate technology while eliminating the requirement for expensive additional hardware. Nvidia <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mediatek-g-sync-displays/">says</a> it's partnering with chipmaker MediaTek to build G-Sync capabilities directly into scaler chips that MediaTek is creating for upcoming monitors. G-Sync modules ordinarily replace these scaler chips, but they're <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/245463/nvidia-g-sync-hdr-module-adds-usd-500-to-monitor-pricing">entirely separate boards</a> with expensive FPGA chips and dedicated RAM.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044240#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044240&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Back in 2010, Gary Wolf, then the editor of Wired magazine, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_wolf_the_quantified_self?subtitle=en">delivered a TED talk</a> in Cannes called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02self-measurement-t.html">“the quantified self.”</a> It was about what he termed a “new fad” among tech enthusiasts. These early adopters were using gadgets to monitor everything from their physiological data to their mood and even the number of nappies their children used.</p>
<p>Wolf acknowledged that these people were outliers—tech geeks fascinated by data—but their behavior has since permeated mainstream culture.</p>
<p>From the smartwatches that track our steps and heart rate, to the fitness bands that log sleep patterns and calories burned, these gadgets are now ubiquitous. Their popularity is emblematic of a modern obsession with quantification—the idea that if something isn’t logged, it doesn’t count.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044255#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044255&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Disney said it is abandoning its motion to compel arbitration in a case filed by a man who alleges his wife died from anaphylaxis after a restaurant at a Disney complex failed to honor requests for allergen-free food.</p>
<p>Disney's <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-05-31-Defendant-Walt-Disney-Parks-and-Resorts-Motion-to-Compel-Arbitration-and-Stay-Case.pdf">motion</a> to compel arbitration controversially cited the Disney+ streaming service's subscriber agreement, which includes a binding arbitration clause. The plaintiff's lawyer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/disney-fighting-restaurant-death-suit-with-disney-terms-absurd-lawyer-says/">called the argument</a> "absurd."</p>
<p>Disney confirmed this week that it will withdraw the motion, which it filed on May 31.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044230#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044230&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Sunday, Procreate <a href="https://x.com/Procreate/status/1825311104584802470">announced</a> that it will not incorporate generative AI into its popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procreate_(software)">iPad illustration app</a>. The decision comes in response to an ongoing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/artstation-artists-stage-mass-protest-against-ai-generated-artwork/">backlash</a> from some parts of the art community, which has raised concerns about the ethical implications and potential consequences of AI use in creative industries.</p>

<p>"Generative AI is ripping the humanity out of things," Procreate <a href="https://procreate.com/ai">wrote</a> on its website. "Built on a foundation of theft, the technology is steering us toward a barren future."</p>
<p>In a video <a href="https://x.com/Procreate/status/1825311104584802470">posted on X</a>, Procreate CEO James Cuda laid out his company's stance, saying, "We’re not going to be introducing any generative AI into our products.

<p>When I first spoke with space entrepreneurs Jose Acain and Matt Gialich a little more than two years ago, I wondered whether I would ever talk to them again.</p>
<p>That is not meant to be offensive; rather, it is a reflection of the fact that the business they entered into—mining asteroids for platinum and other precious metals—is a perilous one. To date, NASA and other space agencies have spent billions of dollars returning a few grams of rocky material from asteroids. Humanity has <em>never</em> visited a metal-rich asteroid, although that will finally change with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/10/nasa-is-about-to-launch-a-mission-of-pure-discovery-to-a-metal-asteroid/">NASA's $1.4 billion Psyche mission</a> in 2029. And so commercial asteroid mining seems like a stretch, and indeed, other similarly minded startups have come and gone.</p>
<p>But it turns out that I did hear from Acain and Gialich again about their asteroid mining venture, AstroForge. On Tuesday the co-founders announced that they have successfully raised $40 million in Series A funding and shared plans for their next two missions. AstroForge has now raised a total of $55 million to date.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044016#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044016&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the odder propaganda phenomena in Russia, of late, is seemingly spontaneous groups of elderly Russian pensioners gathering outdoors and espousing some random bit of agitprop.</p>
<p>From a Western perspective, these are obviously staged and hilarious to behold. For example, last year <a href="https://www.the-express.com/news/world-news/113090/vladimir-putin-squad-north-america-fascism-ukraine-war">a very earnest-looking group of elderly women</a> and a few men urged Russia to "take back Alaska" in an attempt to preserve the United States from fascism. One of the women in the video also advocated for a military alliance with Mexico, saying, "In order to effectively fight fascism, we must establish military relations with Mexico to prevent the fascism from spreading further. We must form a military alliance with Mexico."</p>
<p>There are entire <a href="https://t.me/s/otryady_putina">Telegram channels</a> devoted to these "Putin's squads" videos, and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0Ktc21_lgVNiZRY9Py1Fg">find them on YouTube</a> as well. It is not clear whether these "man on the street" videos are having any impact on Russian opinion, but evidently someone in the Kremlin believes they are helping to shape domestic opinions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044124#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044124&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first stage of Rocket Factory Augsburg's first orbital launcher was destroyed in a fireball during a test-firing Monday evening at a spaceport in Scotland, the company said.</p>
<p>The German launch startup aimed to send its first rocket into space later this year and appeared to be running ahead of several competitors in Europe's commercial launch industry that are also developing rockets to deploy small satellites in orbit.</p>
<p>Within the last few months, Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA) delivered all three stages of its first rocket, named RFA One, to its launch site at SaxaVord Spaceport, located on Unst, one of the Shetland Islands and the northernmost inhabited island in the United Kingdom. The company is based in Augsburg, Germany.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044112#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044112&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the country experiencing a relatively large summer wave of COVID-19, the Food and Drug Administration is considering signing off on this year's strain-matched COVID-19 vaccines as soon as this week, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/health/fda-updated-covid-19-vaccines/index.html">according to a report by CNN</a> that cited unnamed officials familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Last year, the FDA gave the green light for the 2023–2024 COVID shots on September 11, close to the peak of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in that year's summer wave. This year, the summer wave began earlier and, by some metrics, is peaking at much higher levels than in previous years.</p>
<p>Currently, wastewater detection of SARS-CoV-2 shows "very high" virus levels in 32 states and the District of Columbia. An additional 11 states are listed as having "high" levels. Looking at trends, the southern and western regions of the country are currently reporting SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater that rival the 2022–2023 and 2023–2024 winter waves, which both peaked at the very end of December.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044101#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044101&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Windows zero-day vulnerability recently patched by Microsoft was exploited by hackers working on behalf of the North Korean government so they could install custom malware that’s exceptionally stealthy and advanced, researchers reported Monday.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38193">CVE-2024-38193</a>, was one of six zero-days—meaning vulnerabilities known or actively exploited before the vendor has a patch—fixed in Microsoft’s monthly update release last Tuesday. Microsoft said the vulnerability—in a class known as a "use after free"—was located in AFD.sys, the binary file for what’s known as the ancillary function driver and the kernel entry point for the Winsock API. Microsoft warned that the zero-day could be exploited to give attackers system privileges, the maximum system rights available in Windows and a required status for executing untrusted code.</p>
<h2>Lazarus gets access to the Windows kernel</h2>
<p>Microsoft warned at the time that the vulnerability was being actively exploited but provided no details about who was behind the attacks or what their ultimate objective was. On Monday, researchers with Gen—the security firm that discovered the attacks and reported them privately to Microsoft—said the threat actors were part of Lazarus, the name researchers use to track a hacking outfit backed by the North Korean government.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044100#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044100&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In April, the National Library of France <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/25/french-national-library-quarantines-books-believed-to-be-laced-with-arsenic">removed four 19th century books</a>, all published in Great Britain, from its shelves because the covers were likely laced with arsenic. The books have been placed in quarantine for further analysis to determine exactly how much arsenic is present. It's part of an ongoing global effort to test cloth-bound books from the 19th and early 20th centuries because of the common practice of using toxic dyes during that period.</p>
<p>Chemists from Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, have also been studying Victorian books from that university's library collection in order to identify and quantify levels of poisonous substances in the covers. They reported their initial findings this week at <a href="https://acs.digitellinc.com/live/32/page/1049">a meeting</a> of the American Chemical Society in Denver. Using a combination of spectroscopic techniques, they found that several books had lead concentrations more than twice the limit imposed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</p>
<p>The Lipscomb effort was inspired by the University of Delaware's <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/poisonbookproject/">Poison Book Project</a>, established in 2019 as an interdisciplinary crowdsourced collaboration between university scientists and the Winterthur Museum, Garden, and Library. The initial objective was to analyze all the Victorian-era books in the Winterthur circulating and rare books collection for the presence of an arsenic compound called cooper acetoarsenite, an emerald green pigment that was very popular at the time to dye wallpaper, clothing, and cloth book covers. Book covers dyed with chrome yellow—<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/SC/C5SC04362J#!divAbstract">favored by Vincent van Gogh</a>—aka lead chromate, were also examined, and the project's scope has since expanded worldwide.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043776#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043776&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AMD has agreed to buy artificial intelligence infrastructure group ZT Systems in a $4.9 billion cash and stock transaction, extending a run of AI investments by the chip company as it seeks to challenge market-leader Nvidia.</p>
<p>The California-based group said the acquisition would help accelerate the adoption of its Instinct line of AI data center chips, which compete with Nvidia’s popular graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>
<p>ZT Systems, a private company founded three decades ago, builds custom computing infrastructure for the biggest AI “hyperscalers.” While the company does not disclose its customers, the hyperscalers include the likes of Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044066#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044066&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A federal judge who bought more than $15,000 worth of Tesla stock has rejected a motion that could have forced him to recuse himself from a lawsuit that Elon Musk's X Corp. filed against the nonprofit Media Matters for America.</p>
<p>US District Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas bought Tesla stock valued between $15,001 and $50,000 in 2022, a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25034203/o-39-connor-reed-annual-2022.pdf">financial disclosure report</a> shows. He was overseeing two lawsuits filed by X and recused himself from only one of the cases.</p>
<p>Media Matters <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MMFA-Reply-ISO-Motion-to-Compel-Corrected-Certificate-of-Interested-Persons.pdf">argued</a> in a July court filing that Tesla should be disclosed by X as an "interested party" in the case because of the public association between Musk and the Tesla brand. O'Connor rejected the Media Matters motion in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.383454/gov.uscourts.txnd.383454.81.0_1.pdf">ruling</a> issued Friday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044042#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044042&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two NASA spacecraft built by Rocket Lab are on the road from California to Florida this weekend to begin preparations for launch on Blue Origin's first New Glenn rocket.</p>
<p>These two science probes must launch between late September and mid-October to take advantage of a planetary alignment between Earth and Mars that only happens once every 26 months. NASA tapped Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company, to launch the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission with a $20 million contract.</p>
<p>Last November, the space agency confirmed the $79 million ESCAPADE mission will launch on the inaugural flight of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. With this piece of information, the opaque schedule for Blue Origin's long-delayed first New Glenn mission suddenly became more clear.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043958#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043958&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Companies are often caught between wanting to cut emissions but also grow profits. But for airlines, these two different imperatives actually align. Cutting carbon emissions means burning less fuel and spending less money buying fuel. This is why Lufthansa has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/how-the-great-white-shark-reduces-drag-while-swimming-at-different-speeds/">copying a trick from the animal kingdom</a>: applying a special film that mimics sharkskin to parts of its aircraft.</p>
<p>When it comes to decarbonization, reducing the emissions of air travel is both a high priority and something of a difficult task. Globally, air traffic accounts for about 2.5 percent of carbon emissions, but since those emissions are emitted at altitude, studies have found that the warming effect may be almost twice as large.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's extremely difficult to rival the volumetric energy density of jet fuel, which contains almost 50 times as many megajoules per liter than alternatives like hydrogen, ethanol, or lithium-ion batteries. That's less of a problem for ground or sea transportation, where weight and volume is less important, but it's a real stumbling block for switching jet airliners to a different fuel source.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044019#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044019&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
