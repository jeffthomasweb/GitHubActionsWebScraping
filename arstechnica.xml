              <![CDATA[<p>The astronauts who came home from the International Space Station last month experienced some drama on the high frontier, and some of it accompanied them back to Earth.</p>
<p>In orbit, the astronauts aborted two spacewalks, both under unusual circumstances. Then, on October 25, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/astronaut-hospitalized-after-returning-from-235-day-space-mission/">one of the astronauts was hospitalized</a> due to what NASA called an unspecified "medical issue" after splashdown aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that concluded the 235-day mission. After an overnight stay in a hospital in Florida, NASA said the astronaut was released "in good health" and returned to their home base in Houston to resume normal post-flight activities.</p>
<p>The space agency did not identify the astronaut or any details about their condition, citing medical privacy concerns. The three NASA astronauts on the Dragon spacecraft included commander Matthew Dominick, pilot Michael Barratt, and mission specialist Jeanette Epps. Russian cosmonaut A<span class="normaltextrun">lexander Grebenkin accompanied the three NASA crew members. Russia's space agency confirmed he was not hospitalized after returning to Earth.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/there-are-some-things-the-crew-8-astronauts-arent-ready-to-talk-about/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The bankruptcy estate of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX has sued the company's former rival Binance in an attempt to recover $1.76 billion or more. The lawsuit seeks "at least $1.76 billion that was fraudulently transferred to Binance and its executives at the FTX creditors' expense, as well as compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.194820/gov.uscourts.deb.194820.1.0_1.pdf">complaint</a> filed yesterday in US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware names Binance and co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao among the defendants. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried sold 20 percent of his crypto exchange to Binance in November 2019, but Binance exited that investment in 2021, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>"As Zhao would later remark, he decided to exit his position in FTX because of personal grievances he had against Bankman-Fried," the lawsuit said. "In July 2021, the parties negotiated a deal whereby FTX bought back Binance's and its executives' entire stakes in both FTX Trading and [parent company] WRS. Pursuant to that deal, FTX's Alameda Research division directly funded the share repurchase with a combination of FTT (FTX's exchange token), BNB (Binance's exchange token), and BUSD (Binance's dollar-pegged stablecoin). In the aggregate, those tokens had a fair market value of at least $1.76 billion."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ftx-sues-binance-for-1-76b-in-battle-of-crypto-exchanges-founded-by-convicts/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Anthropic's new hire is preparing for a future where advanced AI models may experience suffering.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, Anthropic quietly hired its first dedicated "AI welfare" researcher, Kyle Fish, to explore whether future AI models might deserve moral consideration and protection, reports AI newsletter <a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/anthropic-ai-welfare-researcher">Transformer</a>. While sentience in AI models is an extremely controversial and contentious topic, the hire could signal a shift toward AI companies examining ethical questions about the consciousness and rights of AI systems.</p>
<p>Fish joined Anthropic's alignment science team in September to develop guidelines for how Anthropic and other companies should approach the issue. The news follows a <a href="https://eleosai.org/papers/20241030_Taking_AI_Welfare_Seriously_web.pdf">major report co-authored</a> by Fish before he landed his Anthropic role. Titled "Taking AI Welfare Seriously," the paper warns that AI models could soon develop consciousness or agency—traits that some might consider requirements for moral consideration. But the authors do not say that AI consciousness is a guaranteed future development.</p>
<p>"To be clear, our argument in this report is not that AI systems definitely are—or will be—conscious, robustly agentic, or otherwise morally significant," the paper reads. "Instead, our argument is that there is substantial uncertainty about these possibilities, and so we need to improve our understanding of AI welfare and our ability to make wise decisions about this issue. Otherwise there is a significant risk that we will mishandle decisions about AI welfare, mistakenly harming AI systems that matter morally and/or mistakenly caring for AI systems that do not."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/anthropic-hires-its-first-ai-welfare-researcher/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Nigerian man living in the United Kingdom has been sentenced to 10 years for his role in a phishing scam that snatched more than $20 million from over 400 would-be home buyers in the US, including some savers who lost their entire nest eggs.</p>
<p>Late last week, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdal/pr/nigerian-national-sentenced-ten-years-20-million-cyber-fraud-scheme">confirmed</a> that 33-year-old Babatunde Francis Ayeni pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud through "a sophisticated business email compromise scheme targeting real estate transactions" in the US.</p>
<p>To seize large down payments on homes, Ayeni and co-conspirators sent phishing emails to US title companies, real estate agents, and real estate attorneys. When unsuspecting employees clicked malicious attachments and links, a prompt appeared asking for login information that was then shared with the hackers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/hacker-gets-10-years-for-stealing-20m-in-home-buyers-down-payments/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like a lot of competitors in the global launch industry, Russia for a long time dismissed the prospects of a reusable first stage for a rocket.</p>
<p>As late as 2016, an official with the Russian agency that develops strategy for the country's main space corporation, Roscosmos, <a href="https://tass.com/science/853567">concluded</a>, "The economic feasibility of reusable launch systems is not obvious." In the dismissal of the landing prospects of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, Russian officials were not alone. Throughout the 2010s, competitors including space agencies in Europe and Japan, and US-based United Launch Alliance, all decided to develop expendable rockets.</p>
<p>However, by 2017, when SpaceX re-flew a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time, the writing was on the wall. "This is a very important step, we sincerely congratulate our colleague on this achievement," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/after-spacex-launch-russia-now-says-it-is-interested-in-reusable-rockets/">then-Roscosmos CEO Igor Komarov said</a> at the time. He even spoke of developing reusable components, such as rocket engines capable of multiple firings.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/russia-fine-i-guess-we-should-have-a-grasshopper-rocket-project-too/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>During my first semester as a computer science graduate student at Princeton, I took <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall08/cos402/schedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">COS 402: Artificial Intelligence</a>. Toward the end of the semester, there was a lecture about neural networks. This was in the fall of 2008, and I got the distinct impression—both from that lecture and the textbook—that neural networks had become a backwater.</p>
<p>Neural networks had delivered some impressive results in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But then progress stalled. By 2008, many researchers had moved on to mathematically elegant approaches such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">support vector machines</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t know it at the time, but a team at Princeton—in the same computer science building where I was attending lectures—was working on a project that would upend the conventional wisdom and demonstrate the power of neural networks. That team, led by Prof. Fei-Fei Li, wasn’t working on a better version of neural networks. They were hardly thinking about neural networks at all.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/how-a-stubborn-computer-scientist-accidentally-launched-the-deep-learning-boom/">Read full article</a></p>

      <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> is star Anthony Mackie's first cinematic appearance as the new Captain America.

          </div>

</div>
<p>Marvel Studios dropped a full-length trailer for <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> at the first ever Brazil D23 fan event this weekend. This is star Anthony Mackie's first cinematic appearance as the new Captain America after the Phase Four 2021 TV miniseries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falcon_and_the_Winter_Soldier"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>. The event also featured a special look at Marvel's forthcoming <em>Thunderbolts*</em> film, followed by a new trailer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/anthony-mackie-wields-the-shield-in-captain-america-brave-new-world-teaser/">previously reported</a>, it's the fifth film in the MCU's Phase Five, directed by Julius Onah (<em>The Cloverfield Paradox</em>) and building on events not just in <em>F&amp;WS</em> but also the 2008 film <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>After meeting with newly elected US President Thaddeus Ross, played by Harrison Ford in his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, Sam finds himself in the middle of an international incident. He must discover the reason behind a nefarious global plot before the true mastermind has the entire world seeing red.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to Mackie and Ford, the cast includes Liv Tyler as the president's daughter, Betty Ross, and Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns, both reprising their roles in 2008's <em>The Incredible Hulk.</em> (Ford replaces the late William Hurt, who played Ross in that earlier film.) Carl Lumbley plays Isaiah Bradley, reprising his <em>F&amp;WS</em> role as a Korean War veteran who had been secretly imprisoned and given the Super Soldier Serum against his will, enduring 30 years of experimentation. (He told Sam he couldn't imagine how any black man could take up Captain America's shield because of what it represented to people like him, and one could hardly blame him.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/marvel-drops-captain-america-brave-new-world-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The MCU's foray into streaming television has produced mixed results, but one of my favorites was the weirdly inventive, oh-so-meta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/review-wandavision-sticks-the-landing-with-a-very-marvel-esque-finale/"><em>WandaVision</em></a>. I'm happy to report that the spinoff sequel, <em>Agatha All Along,</em> taps into that same offbeat creativity, giving us a welcome reminder of just how good the MCU can be when it's firing on all storytelling cylinders.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below, including for <em>WandaVision</em> and <em>Multiverse of Madness</em>. We'll give you another heads up when major spoilers for <em>Agatha All Along</em> are imminent.)</strong></p>
<p>The true identity of nosy next-door neighbor Agnes—played to perfection by Kathryn Hahn—was the big reveal of 2021's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/review-wandavision-sticks-the-landing-with-a-very-marvel-esque-finale/"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, even inspiring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8u8md-NiHM">a jingle</a> that went viral. Agnes turned out to be a powerful witch named Agatha Harkness, who had studied magic for centuries and was just dying to learn the source of Wanda's incredible power. Wanda's natural abilities were magnified by the Mind Stone, but Agatha realized that Wanda was a wielder of "chaos magic." She was, in fact, the Scarlet Witch. In the finale, Wanda trapped Agatha in her nosy neighbor persona while releasing the rest of the town of Westview from her grief-driven Hex.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/review-catching-up-with-the-witchy-brew-of-agatha-all-along/">Read full article</a></p>

But some critics have called out the deal as contradictory to Anthropic's widely-publicized "<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety">AI safety</a>" aims.</p>
<p>On X, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/google-embroiled-in-row-over-ai-bias-research/">former Google co-head of AI ethics Timnit Gebru</a> <a href="https://x.com/timnitGebru/status/1854644626348818763">wrote</a> of Anthropic's new deal with Palantir, "Look at how they care so much about 'existential risks to humanity.'"</p>

Broadcom also bundled VMware's products into a smaller number of SKUs, resulting in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/">higher costs</a> and frustration for customers that felt like they were being forced to pay for products that they didn't want. All that, combined with Broadcom ditching some smaller <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/">VMware channel partners</a> (and <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/virtualization/2024/broadcom-takes-top-vmware-accounts-direct-effective-immediately">reportedly</a> taking the biggest clients direct), have raised doubts that Broadcom's VMware would be a good fit for smaller customers.</p>
<p>“The challenge with much of the VMware by Broadcom changes to date and before the announcement [of the vSphere Enterprise Plus subscription tier] is that it also forced many organizations to a much higher offering and much more components to a stack that they were previously uninterested in deploying," Rick Vanover, Veeam's product strategy VP, told Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/new-smb-friendly-subscription-tier-may-be-too-late-to-stop-vmware-migrations/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Matter, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/matter-and-thread-could-fix-smart-home-compatibility-but-dont-get-excited-yet/">smart home standard</a> that promises an interoperable future for home automation, even if it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/matter-was-more-of-a-nice-smart-home-concept-than-useful-reality-in-2023/">scattered and a bit buggy right now</a>, is out with <a href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/">a new version, 1.4</a>. It promises more device types, improvements for working across ecosystems, and tools for managing battery backups, solar panels, and heat pumps.</p>
<p>"Enhanced Multi-Admin" is the headline feature for anybody invested in Matter's original promise, one where you can buy a device and it doesn't matter if your other gear is meant for Amazon (Alexa), Google, Apple, or whatever, it should just connect and work. With 1.4, a home administrator should be able to let a device onto their network just once, and then have that device picked up by whatever controller they're using. There have technically been ways for a device to be set up on, say, Alexa and Apple Home, but the process has been buggy, involves generating "secondary codes," and is kind of an unpaid junior sysadmin job.</p>
<p>What's now available is "Fabric Sync," which sounds like something that happens in a static-ridden dryer. But "Fabrics" is how the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) describes smart home systems, like Alexa or Google Home. In theory, with every tech company doing their best, you'd set up a smart light bulb with your iPhone, add it to your Apple Home, but still have it be able to be added to a Google Home system, Android phones included. Even better, ecosystems that don't offer controls for entire categories, like Apple and smart displays (because it doesn't make any), should still be able to pick up and control them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/matter-1-4-has-some-solid-ideas-for-the-future-home-now-lets-see-the-support/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile are continuing their fight against fines for selling user location data, with two of the big three carriers submitting new court briefs arguing that the Federal Communications Commission can't punish them.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.3faa6ebe-fa32-ef11-a296-001dd804fa85/gov.uscourts.ca2.3faa6ebe-fa32-ef11-a296-001dd804fa85.36.0.pdf">Verizon brief</a> filed on November 4 and an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.219140/gov.uscourts.ca5.219140.53.0.pdf">AT&amp;T brief</a> on November 1 contest the legal basis for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-fines-big-three-carriers-196m-for-selling-users-real-time-location-data/">FCC fines issued in April 2024</a>. T-Mobile also <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68928957/t-mobile-usa-inc-v-fcc/">sued the FCC</a>, but briefs haven't been filed yet in that case.</p>
<p>"Verizon's petition for review stems from the multiple and significant errors that the FCC, in purporting to enforce statutory consumer data privacy provisions, made in overstepping its authority," Verizon wrote. "The FCC's Forfeiture Order violated both the Communications Act and the Constitution, while failing to benefit the consumers it purported to protect."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/verizon-att-tell-courts-fcc-cant-punish-us-for-selling-user-location-data/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Michigan man who ran chat rooms and Discord servers targeting children playing online games and coercing them into self-harm, sexually explicit acts, suicide, and other violence was sentenced to 30 years in prison Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/member-violent-764-terror-network-sentenced-30-years-prison-sexually-exploiting-child">According to the US Department of Justice</a>, Richard Densmore was a member of an online terrorist network called 764, which the FBI considers a "tier one" terrorist threat. He pled guilty to sexual exploitation of a child as "part of a broader indictment that charged him with other child exploitation offenses." In the DOJ's press release, FBI Director Christopher Wray committed to bring to justice any abusive groups known to be preying on vulnerable kids online.</p>
<p>“This defendant orchestrated a community to target children through online gaming sites and used extortion and blackmail to force his minor victims to record themselves committing acts of self-harm and violence,” Wray said. “If you prey on children online, you can’t hide behind a keyboard. The FBI will use all our resources and authorities to arrest you and hold you accountable.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/discord-terrorist-known-as-rabid-gets-30-years-for-preying-on-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The global space community awoke to a new reality on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The founder of this century's most innovative space company, Elon Musk, successfully used his fortune, time, and energy to help elect Donald Trump to president of the United States. Already, Musk was the dominant Western player in space. SpaceX launches national security satellites and NASA astronauts and operates a megaconstellation. He controls the machines that provide essential space services to NASA and the US military. And now, thanks to his gamble on backing Trump, Musk has strong-armed himself into Trump's inner circle.</p>
<p>Although he may not have a cabinet-appointed position, Musk will have a broad portfolio in the new administration for as long as his relations with Trump remain positive. This gives Musk extraordinary power over a number of areas, including spaceflight. Already this week, he has been soliciting ideas and input from colleagues. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-benefits.html">New York Times reported</a> that Musk has advised Trump to hire key employees from SpaceX into his administration, including at the Department of Defense. This reflects the huge conflict of interest that Musk will face when it comes to space policy. His actions could significantly benefit SpaceX, of which he is the majority owner and has the final say in major decisions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/space-policy-is-about-to-get-pretty-wild-yall/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>People have long been fascinated by the haunting plaster casts of the bodies of people who died in Pompeii when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. Archaeologists have presented certain popular narratives about who these people might have been and how they might have been related. But ancient DNA analysis has revealed that those preferred narratives were not entirely accurate and may reflect certain cultural biases, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01361-7">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. The results also corroborate prior research suggesting that the people of ancient Pompeii were the descendants of immigrants from the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/archaeologists-find-evidence-of-neurons-in-glassy-brain-of-vesuvius-victim/">previously reported</a>, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius released thermal energy roughly equivalent to 100,000 times the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, spewing molten rock, pumice, and hot ash over the cities of Pompeii and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum">Herculaneum</a> in particular. The vast majority of people in Pompeii and Herculaneum—the cities hardest hit—perished from asphyxiation, choking on the thick clouds of noxious gas and ash. But at least some of the Vesuvian victims <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/extreme-heat-of-vesuvius-eruption-vaporized-body-fluids-exploded-skulls/">probably died instantaneously</a> from the intense heat of fast-moving lava flows, with temperatures high enough to boil brains and explode skulls.</p>
<p>In the first phase, immediately after the eruption, a long column of ash and pumice blanketed the surrounding towns, most notably Pompeii and Herculaneum. By late night or early morning, pyroclastic flows (fast-moving hot ash, lava fragments, and gases) swept through and obliterated what remained, leaving the bodies of the victims frozen in seeming suspended action.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/dna-shows-pompeiis-dead-arent-who-we-thought-they-were/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Meta has defeated a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zuckerman-v-Meta-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a>—for now—that attempted to invoke Section 230 protections for a third-party tool that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/professor-sues-meta-to-allow-release-of-feed-killing-tool-for-facebook/">would have made it easy for Facebook users to toggle on and off their news feeds</a> as they pleased.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by Ethan Zuckerman, a professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst. He feared that Meta might sue to block his tool, Unfollow Everything 2.0, because Meta threatened to sue to block the original tool when it was released by another developer. In May, Zuckerman told Ars that he was "suing Facebook to make it better" and planned to use Section 230's shield to do it.</p>
<p>Zuckerman's novel legal theory argued that Congress always intended for Section 230 to protect third-party tools designed to empower users to take control over potentially toxic online environments.

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwood_Edwards">Elwood Edwards</a>, the voice behind the online service America Online's iconic "You've got mail" greeting, died at age 74, one day before his 75th birthday, according to Cleveland's <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/life/people/elwood-edwards-wkyc-employee-voice-aol-youve-got-mail-greeting-dies-74/95-940b6ed4-b90b-4c4c-b0d5-6c57fddb6546">WKYC Studios</a>, where he worked for many years. The greeting became a cultural touchstone in the 1990s and early 2000s in the early Internet era; it was heard by hundreds of millions of users when they logged in to the service and new email was waiting for them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110712181649/https://whosevoice.org/home/2010/8/12/aols-got-elwood.html">story</a> of Edwards' famous recording began in 1989 when Steve Case, CEO of Quantum Computer Services (which later became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">America Online</a>—or AOL for short), wanted to add a human voice to the company's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Link">Quantum Link</a> online service. Karen Edwards, who worked as a customer service representative, heard Case discussing the plan and suggested her husband Elwood, a professional broadcaster.</p>
<p>Edwards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110712181649/https://whosevoice.org/home/2010/8/12/aols-got-elwood.html">recorded the famous phrase</a> (and several others) into a cassette recorder in his living room in 1989 and was paid $200 for the service. His voice recordings of "Welcome," "You've got mail," "File's done," and "Goodbye" went on to reach millions of users during AOL's <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-golden-age-of-america-online">rise to dominance</a> in the 1990s online landscape.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/the-voice-of-america-onlines-youve-got-mail-has-died-at-age-74/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ask a few random people about Apple Intelligence and you’ll probably get quite different responses.</p>
<p>One might be excited about the new features. Another could opine that no one asked for this and the company is throwing away its reputation with creatives and artists to chase a fad. Another still might tell you that regardless of the potential value, Apple is simply too late to the game to make a mark.</p>
<p>The release of Apple’s first Apple Intelligence-branded AI tools in iOS 18.1 last week makes all those perspectives understandable.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/despite-unforced-errors-the-future-of-apple-intelligence-could-be-bright/">Read full article</a></p>
