                            <![CDATA[<p>The popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss medications continues to soar—and their uptake is helping to push down obesity rates on a national scale—but a safe, evidence-based way off the drugs isn’t yet in clear view.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2841273">analysis published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine</a> found that most participants in a clinical trial who were assigned to stop taking tirzepatide (Zepbound from Eli Lilly) not only regained significant amounts of the weight they had lost on the drug, but they also saw their cardiovascular and metabolic improvements slip away. Their blood pressure went back up, as did their cholesterol, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (used to assess glucose control levels), and fasting insulin.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2841278">an accompanying editorial</a>, two medical experts at the University of Pittsburgh, Elizabeth Oczypok and Timothy Anderson, suggest that this new class of drugs should be rebranded from “weight loss” drugs to “weight management” drugs, which people may need to take indefinitely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/glp-1-drugs-improve-heart-health-but-only-if-you-keep-taking-them/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Plex is starting to enforce its new rules, which prevent users from remotely accessing a personal media server without a subscription fee.</p>
<p>Previously, people outside of a server owner’s network could access the owner’s media library through Plex for free. Under the new rules <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/plex-ups-its-price-for-first-time-in-a-decade-changes-remote-streaming-access/">announced in March</a>, a server owner needs to have a Plex Pass subscription, which starts at $7 per month, to grant users remote access to their server. Alternatively, someone can remotely access another person’s Plex server by buying their own Plex Pass or a <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/remote-watch-pass-overview/">Remote Watch Pass</a>, which is a subscription with fewer features than a Plex Pass and that Plex started selling in April for a $2/month starting price.</p>
<p>Plex’s new rules took effect on April 29. According to a recent <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/changes-coming-to-remote-streaming-on-roku/933671">Plex forums</a> post by a Plex employee that <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/plex-is-now-enforcing-remote-play-restrictions-on-tvs/">How-To Geek</a> spotted today, the changes are rolling out this week, with a subscription being required for people using Plex’s Roku OS app for remote access.

                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s not a bad time to upgrade your gaming PC. Graphics card prices in the 2020s have undulated continuously as the industry has dealt with pandemic and AI-related shortages, but it’s actually possible to get respectable mainstream- to high-end GPUs like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/review-at-349-amds-16gb-radeon-rx-9060-xt-is-the-new-midrange-gpu-to-beat/">AMD’s Radeon RX 9060 XT</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/">9070 series</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-and-5060-review-putting-the-mid-in-mid-range/">Nvidia’s RTX 5060</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-no-its-not-4090-performance-at-549/">5070</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review-more-like-a-4080-super-super/">5080 series</a> for at or slightly under their suggested retail prices right now. This was close to impossible through the spring and summer.</p>
<p>But it’s <em>not</em> a good time to build a new PC or swap your older motherboard out for a new one that needs DDR5 RAM. And the culprit is a shortage of RAM and flash memory chips that has suddenly sent SSD and (especially) memory prices into the stratosphere, caused primarily by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/perfect-storm-of-demand-and-supply-driving-up-storage-costs">the ongoing AI boom</a> and exacerbated by panic-fueled buying by end users and device manufacturers.</p>
<p>To illustrate just how high things have jumped in a short amount of time, let’s compare some of the RAM and storage prices listed in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/ars-technica-system-guide-back-to-pc-building-for-back-to-school/">our system guide from three months ago</a> to the pricing for the exact same components today. Note that several of these are based on the last available price and are currently sold out; we also haven’t looked into things <a href="http://These%20companies%20buy%20components%20in%20large%20quantities%20and%20they%20typically%20do%20so%20ahead%20of%20time,%20dulling%20the%20impact%20of%20the%20increases%20in%20the%20short-term.">like microSD or microSD Express cards</a>, which could also be affected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/spiking-memory-prices-mean-that-it-is-once-again-a-horrible-time-to-build-a-pc/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An unpiloted Chinese spacecraft launched late Monday and linked up with the country’s Tiangong space station a few hours later, providing a lifeboat for three astronauts stuck in orbit without a safe ride home.</p>
<p>A Long March 2F rocket fired its engines and lifted off with the Shenzhou 22 spacecraft, carrying cargo instead of a crew, at 11:11 pm EST Monday (04:11 UTC Tuesday). The spacecraft docked with the Tiangong station nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers) above the Earth about three-and-a-half hours later.</p>
<p>Chinese engineers worked fast to move up the launch of the Shenzhou 22, originally set to fly next year. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/landing-postponed-for-chinese-astronauts-after-suspected-space-debris-strike/">On November 4</a>, astronauts discovered one of the two crew ferry ships docked to the Tiangong station had a damaged window, likely from an impact with a small fragment of space junk. The crew members used a microscope to photograph the defect from different angles, confirming a small triangular area with a crack, Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China’s human spaceflight program, <a href="https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?item_id=10019182519331817860&amp;toc_style_id=feeds_default&amp;share_to=copy_url&amp;track_id=eeadf48e-ee14-4fb9-89fe-ed392776e175">told Chinese state media</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/china-launches-an-emergency-lifeboat-to-bring-three-astronauts-back-to-earth/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>RealPage has agreed to settle an antitrust lawsuit raised by the Department of Justice, alleging that landlords used its tools to coordinate efforts to artificially raise rental prices across the US.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-realpage-end-sharing-competitively-sensitive-information-and">press release</a>, the DOJ promised the proposed settlement “would help restore free market competition in rental markets for millions of American renters.”</p>
<p>For years since the pandemic started, rental prices outpaced inflation, and the DOJ suspected that RealPage was the dominant force driving a market that never favored renters. Recent Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf">data</a> covering a 12-month period ending this September showed rents are still rising by 3.5 percent amid an affordability crisis, leaving some US renters in fear of housing instability.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/realpage-agrees-to-change-algorithm-so-landlords-cant-collude-on-price-hikes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After Valve announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">its upcoming Steam Machine living room box</a> earlier this month, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">some analysts suggested to Ars</a> that Valve could and should aggressively subsidize that hardware with “loss leader” pricing that leads to more revenue from improved Steam software sales. In <a href="https://youtu.be/yvu66Y2VLq8?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu">a new interview with YouTube channel Skill Up</a>, though, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais ruled out that kind of console-style pricing model, saying that the Steam Machine will be “more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market.”</p>
<p>Griffais said the AMD Zen 4 CPU and RDNA3 GPU in the Steam Machine were designed to outperform the bottom 70 percent of machines that opt-in to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Valve’s regular hardware survey</a>. And Steam Machine owners should expect to pay roughly what they would for desktop hardware with similar specs, he added.</p>
<p>“If you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that’s the general price window that we aim to be at,” Griffais said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valves-steam-machine-looks-like-a-console-but-dont-expect-it-to-be-priced-like-one/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Our exploration of the outer Solar System has revealed a host of icy moons, many with surface features that suggest a complex geology. In some cases, these features—most notably the geysers of Enceladus—hint at the presence of oceans beneath the icy surfaces. These oceans have been ascribed to gravitational interactions that cause flexing and friction within the moon, creating enough heat to melt the body’s interior.</p>
<p>Something that has received a bit less attention is that some of these orbital interactions are temporary or cyclical. The orbits of any body are not always regular and often have long-term cycles. That’s also true for the other moons that provide the gravitational stress. As a result, the internal oceans may actually come and go, as the interiors of the moons melt and refreeze.</p>
<p>A new study, released today by Nature Astronomy, looks at one of the consequences of the difference in density between liquid water and ice (about 10 percent): the potential for the moon’s interior to shrink as it melts, leaving an area of low pressure immediately below its icy shell. If the moon is small enough, this study suggests, that could cause the surface of the ocean to boil.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/formation-of-oceans-within-icy-moons-could-cause-the-waters-to-boil/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most prominent change for most users is that in the consumer app experiences (web, mobile, and desktop), Claude will be less prone to abruptly hard-stopping conversations because they have run too long. The improvement to memory within a single conversation applies not just to Opus 4.5, but to any current Claude models in the apps.</p>
<p>Users who experienced abrupt endings (despite having room left in their session and weekly usage budgets) were hitting a hard context window (200,000 tokens). Whereas some large language model implementations simply start trimming earlier messages from the context when a conversation runs past the maximum in the window, Claude simply ended the conversation rather than allow the user to experience an increasingly incoherent conversation where the model would start forgetting things based on how old they are.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/anthropic-introduces-opus-4-5-cuts-api-pricing-and-enables-much-longer-claude-chats/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After Donald Trump curiously started referring to the Department of Government Efficiency exclusively in the past tense, an official finally confirmed Sunday that DOGE “doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-doesnt-exist-with-eight-months-left-its-charter-2025-11-23/">Talking to Reuters</a>, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Kupor confirmed that DOGE—a government agency notoriously created by Elon Musk to rapidly and dramatically slash government agencies—was terminated more than eight months early. This may have come as a surprise to whoever runs the <a href="https://x.com/DOGE">DOGE account</a> on X, which continued posting up until two days before the Reuters report was published.</p>
<p>As Kupor explained, a “centralized agency” was no longer necessary, since OPM had “taken over many of DOGE’s functions” after Musk left the agency last May. Around that time, DOGE staffers were embedded at various agencies, where they could ostensibly better coordinate with leadership on proposed cuts to staffing and funding.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/doge-doesnt-exist-anymore-but-expert-says-its-still-not-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Arduino updated its ToS and<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/"> privacy policy</a> this month, which is about a month after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/arduino-retains-its-brand-and-mission-following-acquisition-by-qualcomm/">Qualcomm announced that it’s acquiring</a> the open source hardware and software company.

                            <![CDATA[<p>The emergence of synthetic pigments in the 19th century had an immense impact on the art world, particularly the availability of emerald-green pigments, prized for their intense brilliance by such masters as Paul Cézanne, Edvard Munch, Vincent van Gogh, and Claude Monet. The downside was that these pigments often degraded over time, resulting in cracks and uneven surfaces and the formation of dark copper oxides—even the release of arsenic compounds.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s a major concern for conservationists of such masterpieces. So it should be welcome news that European researchers have used synchrotron radiation and various other analytical tools to determine whether light and/or humidity are the culprits behind that degradation and how, specifically, it occurs, according to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady1807">a paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances.</p>
<p>Science has become a valuable tool for art conservationists, especially various X-ray imaging methods. For instance, in 2019, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/scientists-develop-new-tool-to-study-acne-in-georgia-okeefe-paintings/">we reported</a> on how many of the oil paintings at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico, had been developing tiny, pin-sized blisters, almost like acne, for decades. Chemists concluded that the blisters are actually metal carboxylate soaps, the result of a chemical reaction between metal ions in the lead and zinc pigments and fatty acids in the binding medium used in the paint. The soaps start to clump together to form the blisters and migrate through the paint film.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/why-synthetic-emerald-green-pigments-degrade-over-time/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>LAS VEGAS—Formula 1 held the third annual Las Vegas Grand Prix this past weekend in the Nevada city. The race is an outlier in so many ways, and a divisive one at that. Some love the bright lights that make it appear to be set in Mega-City One or <em>F-Zero</em>. Others resent the rampant commercialism of F1 at its most excessive. And this time, Ars was on the ground, making one of our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/why-f1s-switch-from-13-inch-to-18-inch-tires-is-important/">periodic visits</a> to the series. The race we saw was something of a damp squib, seemingly leaving McLaren’s Lando Norris in control of the championship.</p>
<p>At least that’s how it looked when I left the track on Saturday night. Within a few hours, Norris and his teammate (and one of his two title rivals) Oscar Piastri were both disqualified for having worn away too much of the “legality plank” underneath the car—more on that in a while.</p>

      I was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/f1-succeeds-in-making-its-las-vegas-debut-a-spectacular-one/"&gt;a huge skeptic of the idea&lt;/a&gt; when the Las Vegas race was announced, but the first two events put on a good show. Year 3 was a little more dull, however.

<h2>Emblematic of the new F1</h2>
<p>Unlike most Grands Prix, Liberty Media promotes this one itself. It spent half a billion dollars to get ready for the 2023 event, some of that on the pit lane and paddock complex, yet more on resurfacing the roads to the standards preferred by these thoroughbred racing cars. The track layout—which looks like a pig on its back—is typical of North American street circuits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/f1-in-las-vegas-this-sport-is-a-200-mph-soap-opera/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hacker conferences—like all conventions—are notorious for giving attendees a parting gift of mystery illness. To combat “con crud,” New Zealand’s premier hacker conference, Kawaiicon, quietly launched a real-time, room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system for attendees.</p>
<p>To get the system up and running, event organizers installed DIY CO<sub>2</sub> monitors throughout the Michael Fowler Centre venue before conference doors opened on November 6. Attendees were able to check a public online dashboard for clean air readings for session rooms, kids’ areas, the front desk, and more, all before even showing up. “It’s ALMOST like we are all nerds in a risk-based industry,” the organizers <a href="https://kawaiicon.org/health-and-safety/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://kawaiicon.org/health-and-safety/" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">wrote</a> on the convention’s website.</p>
<p>“What they did is fantastic,” Jeff Moss, founder of the <a href="https://defcon.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://defcon.org/" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">Defcon</a> and <a href="https://blackhat.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://blackhat.com/" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">Black Hat</a> security conferences, told WIRED. “CO<sub>2</sub> is being used as an approximation for so many things, but there are no easy, inexpensive network monitoring solutions available. Kawaiicon building something to do this is the true spirit of hacking.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/this-hacker-conference-installed-a-literal-antivirus-monitoring-system/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the world’s premier security organizations has canceled the results of its annual leadership election after an official lost an encryption key needed to unlock results stored in a verifiable and privacy-preserving voting system.</p>
<p>The International Association of Cryptologic Research (IACR) <a href="https://www.iacr.org/news/item/27138">said Friday</a> that the votes were submitted and tallied using <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/about">Helios</a>, an open source voting system that uses peer-reviewed cryptography to cast and count votes in a verifiable, confidential, and privacy-preserving way. Helios encrypts each vote in a way that assures each ballot is secret. Other cryptography used by Helios allows each voter to confirm their ballot was counted fairly.</p>
<h2>An “honest but unfortunate human mistake”</h2>
<p>Per the association’s bylaws, three members of the election committee act as independent trustees.
