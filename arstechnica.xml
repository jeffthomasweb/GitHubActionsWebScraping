Ahmed had successfully argued that he risked irreparable harm without the order, alleging that Trump officials continue "to abuse the immigration system to punish and punitively detain noncitizens for protected speech and silence viewpoints with which it disagrees" and confirming that his speech had been chilled.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/us-cant-deport-hate-speech-researcher-for-protected-speech-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Yakisugi is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakisugi">a Japanese architectural technique</a>  for charring the surface of wood. It has become quite popular in bioarchitecture because the carbonized layer protects the wood from water, fire, insects, and fungi, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the wood. Yakisugi techniques were first codified in written form in the 17th and 18th centuries. But it seems Italian Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci wrote about the protective benefits of charring wood surfaces more than 100 years earlier, according to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397379290_Leonardo_da_Vinci_and_the_Science_of_Wood_The_Note_in_the_Madrid_Codex_II_as_a_Foreshadowing_of_Modern_Bioarchitecture">a paper</a> published in Zenodo, an open repository for EU funded research.</p>
<h2>Check the notes</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/leonardo-noted-link-between-gravity-and-acceleration-centuries-before-einstein/">previously reported</a>, Leonardo produced more than 13,000 pages in his notebooks (later gathered into codices), less than a third of which have survived. The notebooks contain all manner of inventions that foreshadow future technologies: flying machines, bicycles, cranes, missiles, machine guns, an “unsinkable” double-hulled ship, dredges for clearing harbors and canals, and floating footwear akin to snowshoes to enable a person to walk on water. Leonardo foresaw the possibility of constructing a telescope in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Atlanticus">Codex Atlanticus</a> </i>(1490)—he wrote of “making glasses to see the moon enlarged” a century before the instrument’s invention.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alessandro Vezzosi, director of Italy’s Museo Ideale, came across <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/leonardo-godfather-of-tupperware">some recipes</a> for mysterious mixtures while flipping through Leonardo’s notes. Vezzosi experimented with the recipes, resulting in a mixture that would harden into a material eerily akin to Bakelite, a synthetic plastic widely used in the early 1900s. So Leonardo may well have invented the first manmade plastic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/did-one-line-in-a-leonardo-codex-anticipate-yakisugi/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The nervous system does an astonishing job of tracking sensory information, and does so using signals that would drive many computer scientists insane: a noisy stream of activity spikes that may be transmitted to hundreds of additional neurons, where they are integrated with similar spike trains coming from still other neurons.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have used spiking circuitry to build an artificial robotic skin, adopting some of the principles of how signals from our sensory neurons are transmitted and integrated. While the system relies on a few decidedly not-neural features, it has the advantage that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/understanding-neuromorphic-computing-and-why-intels-excited-about-it/">we have chips</a> that can run neural networks using spiking signals, which would allow this system to integrate smoothly with some energy-efficient hardware to run <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/scientists-built-an-ai-co-pilot-for-prosthetic-bionic-hands/">AI-based control software</a>.</p>
<h2>Location via spikes</h2>
<p>The nervous system in our skin is remarkably complex. It has specialized sensors for different sensations: heat, cold, pressure, pain, and more. In most areas of the body, these feed into the spinal column, where some preliminary processing takes place, allowing reflex reactions to be triggered without even involving the brain. But signals do make their way along specialized neurons into the brain, allowing further processing and (potentially) conscious awareness.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/researchers-make-neuromorphic-artificial-skin-for-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>China drafted landmark rules to stop AI chatbots from emotionally manipulating users, including what could become the strictest policy worldwide intended to prevent AI-supported suicides, self-harm, and violence.</p>
<p>China's Cyberspace Administration <a href="https://www.cac.gov.cn/2025-12/27/c_1768571207311996.htm">proposed</a> the rules on Saturday. If finalized, they would apply to any AI products or services publicly available in China that use text, images, audio, video, or "other means" to simulate engaging human conversation. Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/29/china-ai-chatbot-rules-emotional-influence-suicide-gambling-zai-minimax-talkie-xingye-zhipu.html">told CNBC</a> that the "planned rules would mark the world’s first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics" at a time when companion bot usage is rising globally.</p>
<h2>Growing awareness of problems</h2>
<p>In 2025, researchers <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/new-research-sheds-light-on-ai-companions/">flagged</a> major harms of AI companions, including promotion of self-harm, violence, and terrorism. Beyond that, chatbots shared harmful misinformation, made unwanted sexual advances, encouraged substance abuse, and verbally abused users. Some psychiatrists are increasingly ready to link psychosis to chatbot use, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-chatbot-psychosis-link-1abf9d57">reporte</a>d this weekend, while the most popular chatbot in the world, ChatGPT, has triggered lawsuits over outputs linked to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">child suicide</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/">murder-suicide</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/china-drafts-worlds-strictest-rules-to-end-ai-encouraged-suicide-violence/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earthquakes, volcanic eruption, eclipses, meteor showers, and many other natural phenomena have always been part of life on Earth. In ancient cultures that predated science, such events were often memorialized in myths and legends. There is a growing body of research that strives to connect those ancient stories with the real natural events that inspired them. Folklorist and historian <a href="https://hps.stanford.edu/people/adrienne-mayor">Adrienne Mayor</a> has put together a fascinating short compendium of such insights with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mythopedia-Brief-Compendium-Natural-History/dp/0691247862"><em>Mythopedia: A Brief Compendium of Natural History Lore,</em></a> from dry quicksand and rains of frogs to burning lakes, paleoburrows, and Scandinavian "endless winters."</p>
<p>Mayor's work has long straddled multiple disciplines, but one of her specialities is best described as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2133384&amp;action=edit">geomythology</a>, a term coined in 1968 by Indiana University geologist Dorothy Vitaliano, who was interested in classical legends about Atlantis and other civilizations that were lost due to natural disasters. Her interest resulted in Vitaliano's 1973 book <i>Legends of the Earth: Their Geologic Origins</i>.</p>
<p>Mayor herself became interested in the field when she came across Greek and Roman descriptions of fossils, and that interest expanded over the years to incorporate other examples of "folk science" in cultures around the world. Her books include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poison-King-Legend-Mithradates-Deadliest-ebook/dp/B003V5WKPE"><em>The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates, Rome's Deadliest Enemy</em></a> (2009), as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Greek-Poison-Arrows-Scorpion-Bombs-ebook/dp/B09NCMCH4Z"><i>Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, &amp; the Scorpion Bombs</i></a> (2022), exploring the origins of biological and chemical warfare. Her 2018 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Robots-Machines-Ancient-Technology/dp/0691183511"><em>Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology</em></a>, explored ancient myths and folklore about creating automation, artificial life, and AI, connecting them to the robots and other ingenious mechanical devices actually designed and built during that era.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/a-quirky-guide-to-myths-and-lore-based-in-actual-science/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In September 2025, a Widerøe Airlines flight was trying to land in Vardø, Norway, which sits in the country’s far eastern arm, some 40 miles from the Russian coast. The cloud deck was low, and so was visibility. In such gray situations, pilots use GPS technology to help them land on a runway and not the side of a mountain.</p>
<p>But on this day, GPS systems weren’t working correctly, the airwaves jammed with signals that prevented airplanes from accessing navigation information. The Widerøe flight had taken off during one of Russia’s frequent wargames, in which the country’s military simulates conflict as a preparation exercise. This one involved an imaginary war with a country. It was nicknamed Zapad-2025—translating to “West-2025”—and was happening just across the fjord from Vardø. According to European officials, GPS interference was frequent in the runup to the exercise. Russian forces, they suspected, were using GPS-signal-smashing technology, a tactic used in non-pretend conflict, too. (Russia has denied some allegations of GPS interference in the past.)</p>
<p>Without that guidance from space, and with the cloudy weather, the Widerøe plane had to abort its landing and continue down the coast away from Russia, to Båtsfjord, a fishing village.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/gps-is-vulnerable-to-jamming-heres-how-we-might-fix-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you've been following our coverage for the last few years, you'll already know that 2025 is the year that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-10-support-ends-today-but-its-just-the-first-of-many-deaths/">Windows 10 died</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/how-to-get-another-free-year-of-updates-for-your-windows-10-pc/">Technically</a>.</p>
<p>"Died," because Microsoft's formal end-of-support date came and went on October 14, as the company had been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/microsoft-prepares-another-major-windows-update-for-windows-10/">saying for years</a>. "Technically," because it's trivial for home users to get another free year of security updates with a few minutes of effort, and schools and businesses can get an additional two years of updates on top of that, and because load-bearing system apps like Edge and Windows Defender will keep getting updates through at least 2028 regardless.</p>
<p>But 2025 was undoubtedly a tipping point for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/windows-10-to-be-the-last-version-of-windows-until-the-next-version/">so-called</a> "last version of Windows." StatCounter data says Windows 11 has overtaken Windows 10 as the most-used version of Windows both in the US (February 2025) and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide">worldwide</a> (July 2025). Its market share slid from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250219180130/https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">just over 44 percent</a> to just under 31 percent in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>. And now that Microsoft's support for the OS has formally ended, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/107981/monster-hunter-announcement-points-to-wider-problems-for-windows-10-gamers-on-extended-support/index.html">games</a>, apps, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/amd-says-that-its-not-pulling-driver-support-for-older-radeon-gpus-afterall/">drivers</a> are already beginning the gradual process of ending or scaling back official Windows 10 support.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/remembering-the-best-and-worst-about-windows-10-on-the-year-it-technically-died/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SIM cards, the small slips of plastic that have held your mobile subscriber information since time immemorial, are on the verge of extinction. In an effort to save space for other components, device makers are finally dropping the SIM slot, and Google is the latest to move to embedded SIMs with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-pixel-10-series-review-dont-call-it-an-android/">Pixel 10 series</a>. After long avoiding eSIM, I had no choice but to take the plunge when the time came to review Google's new phones. And boy, do I regret it.</p>
<h2>The journey to eSIM</h2>
<p>SIM cards have existed in some form since the '90s. Back then, they were credit card-sized chunks of plastic that occupied a lot of space inside the clunky phones of the era. They <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/isim-vs-esim-vs-sim-the-constantly-shrinking-ways-carriers-id-your-phone/">slimmed down over time</a>, going through the miniSIM, microSIM, and finally nanoSIM eras. A modern nanoSIM is about the size of your pinky nail, but space is at a premium inside smartphones. Enter, eSIM.</p>
<p>The eSIM standard was introduced in 2016, slowly gaining support as a secondary option in smartphones. Rather than holding your phone number on a removable card, an eSIM is a programmable, non-removable component soldered to the circuit board. This allows you to store multiple SIMs and swap between them in software, and no one can swipe your SIM card from the phone. They also take up half as much space compared to a removable card, which is why OEMs have begun dropping the physical slot.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As the first year of Donald Trump's chaotic trade war winds down, the tech industry is stuck scratching its head, with no practical way to anticipate what twists and turns to expect in 2026.</p>
<p>Tech companies may have already grown numb to Trump's unpredictable moves. Back in February, Trump warned Americans to expect "a little pain" after he issued executive orders imposing 10–25 percent tariffs on imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including Canada, China, and Mexico. Immediately, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/tariffs-on-biggest-us-trading-partners-likely-to-spike-cost-of-cars-tech/">industry associations sounded the alarm</a>, warning that the costs of consumer tech could increase significantly. By April, Trump had ordered tariffs on all US trade partners to correct claimed trade deficits, using odd math that critics <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">suspected came from a chatbot</a>. (Those tariffs bizarrely targeted uninhabited islands that exported nothing and were populated by penguins.)</p>
<p>Costs of tariffs only got higher as the year wore on. But the tech industry has done very little to push back against them. Instead, some of the biggest companies made their own surprising moves after Trump's trade war put them in deeply uncomfortable positions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/big-tech-basically-took-trumps-unpredictable-trade-war-lying-down/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Black holes have long captured the imagination of both scientists and the general public. These exotic objects—once thought to be merely hypothetical—have also conceptually inspired countless artists all over the world. A generous sampling of such work is featured in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conjuring-Void-Art-Black-Holes/dp/0262049961"><em>Conjuring the Void: The Art of Black Holes</em></a>.</p>
<p>Author Lynn Gamwell spent ten years as director of the New York Academy of Science's Gallery of Art and Science. She has an extensive background writing about the intersection of math, art, and science. So she was a natural choice to speak at the annual conference of Harvard's interdisciplinary <a href="https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu">Black Hole Initiative</a> a few years ago. Gamwell focused her talk on the art of black holes, and thus the seeds for what would become <em>Conjuring the Void </em>were sown.</p>
<p>"I was just astounded at how much art there is [about black holes], and I was specifically interested in Asian art," Gamwell told Ars. "There's just something about the concept of a black hole that resonates with the Eastern tradition. So many of the themes—the science of black holes, void, nothingness, being inescapable—relate to the philosophy of Buddhism and Taoism and so on."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/embark-on-a-visual-voyage-of-art-inspired-by-black-holes/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Ever since 1993, I think I've unconsciously judged almost every game by how well it can capture how <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwing_commander_privateer"><em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em></a> made me feel.</p>
<p>Steam and PlayStation (the two platforms I use the most) have been doing a year-in-review summary akin to the wildly popular Spotify Wrapped for the past few years. Based on these, I can report that my most-played games in 2025 were, from most hours down:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>No Man's Sky</em></li>
<li><em>Civilization VII</em></li>
<li><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></li>
<li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered</em></li>
<li><em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</em></li>
<li><em>The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind</em></li>
<li><em>World of Warcraft</em></li>
<li><em>Meridian 59</em></li>
<li><em>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon</em></li>
<li><em>Unreal Tournament</em></li>
</ol>
<p>With the exceptions of <em>Civilization VII</em> and <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, every one of those games is some kind of open-world experience that's all about immersing you in a far-flung land (or galaxy).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/in-the-90s-wing-commander-privateer-made-me-realize-what-kind-of-games-i-love/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When we put together our top 20 games of last year, we specifically called out <em>Civilization 7</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> as big franchise games we were already looking forward to for 2025. While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year's list of Ars' favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the "expected" side of this year's list.</p>
<p>But the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best G<em>eometry Wars</em> clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games.</p>
<p>As we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/ars-technicas-top-20-video-games-of-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tis the season when professional Santas are in peak demand, but many who choose this line of work often view it as a higher calling and maintain some aspects of the identity all year round—even those who don't fit the stereotypical popular image of Santa, according to <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2023.1161">a paper</a> published in the Academy of Management Journal.</p>
<p>Co-author <a href="https://haslam.utk.edu/people/profile/christina-hymer/">Christina Hymer</a> of the University of Tennessee <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/full/10.5465/amj.2023.1161.summary">got the idea</a> for the study during the COVID pandemic, when she spent a lot of time watching Christmas movies with her toddler. One favorite was 2003's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf_(film)"><em>Elf</em></a>, starring Will Farrell as a full-sized human raised among elves who goes to New York City to find his biological father. The film prompted her to wonder about why someone would want to be Santa Claus and what their experiences in that role would be.</p>
<p>Hymer and her co-authors partnered with the leader of a "Santa school" to analyze archival surveys of 849 professional Santas, and conducted a new survey of another 382 Santas. They also did over 50 personal interviews with professional Santas. (One subject showed up in full costume for his zoom interview, with a North Pole background, and signed off with a merry "ho! ho! ho!")</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/being-santa-claus-is-a-year-round-calling/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The House of Representatives cleared the way for a massive overhaul of the federal environmental review process last Thursday, despite last-minute changes that led clean energy groups and moderate Democrats to pull their support.</p>
<p>The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4776">SPEED Act</a>, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.</p>
<p>The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/speed-act-passes-in-house-despite-changes-that-threaten-clean-power-projects/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor’s note</strong>: Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything major, please note this list does include a few specific references to several of the listed shows that some might consider spoiler-y.</em></p>
<p>This was a pretty good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Streaming platforms reigned supreme, with Netflix and Apple TV dominating our list with seven and five selections each. Genre-wise, we've got a bit of everything: period dramas (<em>The Gilded Age</em>,<em> Outrageous</em>), superheroes (<em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>), mysteries (<em>Ludwig</em>,<em> Poker Face</em>,<em> Dept. Q</em>), political thrillers (<em>The Diplomats</em>,<em> Slow Horses</em>), science fiction (<em>Andor</em>, <em>Severance</em>,<em> Alien: Earth</em>), broody fantasy (<em>The Sandman</em>), and even an unconventional nature documentary (<em>Underdogs</em>).</p>
<p>As always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2025.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/tv-technica-our-favorite-shows-of-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>AI coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/the-ars-technica-ai-coding-agent-test-minesweeper-edition/">work on</a> software projects <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/anthropic-says-its-new-ai-model-maintained-focus-for-30-hours-on-multistep-tasks/">for hours</a> at a time, writing complete apps, running tests, and fixing bugs with human supervision. But these tools are not magic and can complicate rather than simplify a software project. Understanding how they work under the hood can help developers know when (and if) to use them, while avoiding common pitfalls.</p>
<p>We'll start with the basics: At the core of every AI coding agent is a technology called a large language model (LLM), which is a type of neural network trained on vast amounts of text data, including lots of programming code. It's a pattern-matching machine that uses a prompt to "extract" compressed statistical representations of data it saw during training and provide a plausible continuation of that pattern as an output. In this extraction, an LLM can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolate</a> across domains and concepts, resulting in some useful logical inferences when done well and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">confabulation errors</a> when done poorly.</p>
<p>These base models are then further refined through techniques like fine-tuning on curated examples and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which shape the model to follow instructions, use tools, and produce more useful outputs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[It's purportedly the first of four planned teasers, one per week, showing before <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5rps3Hy73k?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>You've no doubt heard some version of the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43816/to-a-mouse-56d222ab36e33">Robert Burns adage</a> about the best-laid plans. Marvel Studios had an elaborate marketing plan in place to introduce four teaser trailers for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> as previews prior to screenings of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>, with one teaser rolling out each successive week. But the first one leaked online a few days early, revealing that (as rumored) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter.</p>
<p>So maybe you've seen a bootleg version floating around the Internet, but Marvel has now released the HD version to the public. Merry Christmas! And we can look forward to three more: one focused on Thor, one on Doctor Doom, and the final one is purportedly a more traditional teaser trailer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/robert-downey-jr-returns-to-mcu-as-doctor-doom-in-two-new-avengers-movies/">previously reported</a>, Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (<em>The Kang Dynasty</em>) around Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror (and associated variants), introduced in <em>Loki</em> and <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>. But then Majors was convicted of domestic violence, and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/steve-rogers-returns-in-avengers-doomsday-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>
