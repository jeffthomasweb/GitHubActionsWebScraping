                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>As bird flu continues to rampage in dairy farms and poultry facilities around the country, the office tasked with coordinating the federal government's response to pandemic threats, including bird flu, has been sidelined by President Trump and sits nearly empty, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/health/pandemic-preparedness-office-trump-bird-flu/index.html">according to CNN</a>.</p>
<p>The White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR)—established by a Congressional statute in 2022 in response to failures during the COVID-19 pandemic—used to include a staff of about around 20 people. Now, only one staffer remains, and it's unclear who they report to. The OPPR director has been moved to the National Security Council (NSC).</p>
<p>The report on the vacancies comes amid other moves that call into question the country's ability to respond to a pandemic threat under the Trump administration. The USDA has shifted its response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak away from the health threat. For instance, in late February, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins touted a $1 billion effort to combat bird flu as a "<a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices">strategy to deliver affordable eggs</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/bird-flu-continues-spread-as-trumps-pandemic-experts-are-mia/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11433">new study</a> examining meme creation found that AI-generated meme captions on existing famous meme images scored higher on average for humor, creativity, and "shareability" than those made by people. Even so, people still created the most exceptional individual examples.</p>
<p>The research, which will be presented at the <a href="https://iui.acm.org/2025/">2025 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces</a>, reveals a nuanced picture of how AI and humans perform differently in humor creation tasks. Still, the results were surprising enough to have one expert declaring victory for the machines.</p>
<p>"I regret to announce that the meme Turing Test has been passed," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3lkjvtg6wmk2i">wrote</a> Wharton professor Ethan Mollick on Bluesky after reviewing the study results. Mollick studies AI academically, and he's referring to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">famous test</a> proposed by computing pioneer Alan Turing in 1950 that seeks to determine whether humans can distinguish between AI outputs and human-created content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-beats-humans-at-meme-humor-but-the-best-joke-is-still-human-made/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Latest DESI results fall short of discovery threshold but strengthen evidence for dynamical dark energy.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/dark-energy-might-not-be-constant-after-all/">we reported</a> on an exciting hint of new physics in the first data analysis results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)—namely that the dark energy, rather than being constant, might vary over time. Granted, those hints were still below the necessary threshold to claim discovery and hence fell under the rubric of "huge, if true."</p>
<p>But now we have more data from DESI, combined with other datasets, and those hints have gotten significantly stronger—so much so that Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas, who co-chairs one of the DESI working groups, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077212?">said that</a> "we are getting to the point of no return" for confirming dynamical dark energy. Ishak-Boushaki and several other DESI team members presented their results at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit today in Anaheim, California. Several relevant papers have also <a href="https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/papers/">been posted</a> to the physics arXiv.</p>
<p>Einstein’s cosmological constant (lambda) implied the existence of a repulsive form of gravity. (For a more in-depth discussion of the history of the cosmological constant and its significance for dark energy, see our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/dark-energy-might-not-be-constant-after-all/">2024 story.</a>) Quantum physics holds that even the emptiest vacuum is teeming with energy in the form of “virtual” particles that wink in and out of existence, flying apart and coming together in an intricate quantum dance. This roiling sea of virtual particles could give rise to dark energy, giving the Universe a little extra push so that it can continue accelerating. The problem is that the quantum vacuum contains too <em>much</em> energy: roughly 10<sup>120</sup> times too much.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/hints-grow-stronger-that-dark-energy-changes-over-time/">Read full article</a></p>

      Ana de Armas stars as an assassin in training in <em>From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Lionsgate dropped a new trailer for <em>Ballerina</em>—or, as the studio is now calling it, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_World_of_John_Wick:_Ballerina">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</a>,</em> because what every film needs is a needlessly clunky title. There's nothing clunky about this new trailer, however: It's the stylized, action-packed dose of pure adrenaline one would expect from the franchise, and it ends with Ana de Armas' titular ballerina facing off against none other than John Wick himself (Keanu Reeves).</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for 2019's <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>.)</strong></p>
<p>Chronologically, <em>Ballerina</em> takes place during the events of <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/high-octane-ballerina-trailer-has-plenty-of-action-and-a-john-wick-cameo/">previously reported</a>, <em>Parabellum</em> found Wick declared excommunicado from the High Table for killing crime lord Santino D'Antonio on the grounds of the Continental. On the run with a bounty on his head, he makes his way to the headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston). That's where we learned Wick was originally named Jardani Jovonovich and trained as an assassin with the syndicate. The Director also trains young girls to be ballerina-assassins, and one young ballerina (played by Unity Phelan) is shown rehearsing in the scene. That dancer, Eve Macarro, is the main character in <em>Ballerina</em>, now played by de Armas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/its-ana-de-armas-vs-john-wick-in-new-ballerina-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A United States District Court for the Northern District of California judge has signed off on a settlement agreement between HP and its customers who sued the company for issuing firmware updates that prevented their printers from working with non-HP ink and toner.</p>
<p>In December 2020, Mobile Emergency Housing Corp. and a company called Performance Automotive &amp; Tire Center filed a class-action complaint against HP [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/complaint.pdf">PDF</a>], alleging that the company “wrongfully compels users of its printers to buy and use only HP ink and toner supplies by transmitting firmware updates without authorization to HP printers over the Internet that lock out its competitors’ ink and toner supply cartridges.” The complaint centered on a firmware update issued in November 2020; it sought a court ruling that HP’s actions broke the law, an injunction against the firmware updates, and monetary and punitive damages.</p>
<p>“HP’s firmware ‘updates’ act as malware—adding, deleting or altering code, diminishing the capabilities of HP printers, and rendering the competitors’ supply cartridges incompatible with HP printers,” the 2020 complaint reads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/hp-avoids-monetary-damages-over-bricked-printers-in-class-action-settlement/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Human speech arises courtesy of some significant neural horsepower. Different areas of the brain are involved in determining the meaning that's desired, finding the words to express it, and then converting those words to a specific series of sounds—and all that comes before the correct sequence of nerve impulses is sent to the muscles that produce the final output. Humans are far from alone in the animal kingdom with an impressive range of vocalizations, though. That raises the prospect that we can understand a bit more about our own speech by studying how vocalization is managed in different animals.</p>
<p>One group of species that's especially interesting is birds. They're distant relatives compared to other animals with interesting vocal capabilities, like whales and elephants, and their brains have some notable differences from ours. They also show a range of behaviors, from complex songs to vocal mimicry to whatever it is that you want to call what parrots do. Thanks to a newly released study, however, we now have evidence that these different types of vocalization are the product of different control systems in the brain.</p>
<p>The study relied on electrodes placed in the brains of parrots and songbirds and tracked the behavior of neurons in a region that controls vocalization. It showed that the two relied on different types of control, with parrots having a system that operates similarly to the one used by humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/brains-of-parrots-unlike-songbirds-use-human-like-vocal-control/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The European Commission is not backing down from efforts to rein in Big Tech. In a series of press releases today, the European Union's executive arm has announced actions against both Apple and Google. Regulators have announced that Apple will be required to open up support for non-Apple accessories on the iPhone, but it may be too late for Google to make changes. The commission says the search giant has violated the Digital Markets Act, which could lead to a hefty fine.</p>
<p>Since returning to power, Donald Trump has railed against European regulations that target US tech firms. In spite of rising tensions and tough talk, the European Commission seems unfazed and is continuing to follow its more stringent laws, like the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This landmark piece of EU legislation aims to make the digital economy more fair. Upon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/on-dma-eve-google-whines-apple-sounds-alarms-and-tiktok-wants-out/">coming into force last year</a>, the act labeled certain large tech companies, including Apple and Google, as "gatekeepers" that are subject to additional scrutiny.</p>
<p>Europe's more aggressive regulation of Big Tech is why iPhone users on the continent can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">install apps from third-party app markets</a> while the rest of us are stuck with the Apple App Store. As for Google, the European Commission has paid special attention to search, Android, and Chrome, all of which dominate their respective markets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/eu-accuses-google-and-apple-of-stifling-competition-under-digital-markets-act/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk and President Trump are fighting a court order to turn over information about DOGE, the US Department of Government Efficiency.</p>
<p>US District Judge Tanya Chutkan <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.61.0_1.pdf">ruled last week</a> that New Mexico and 13 other states suing Musk and the federal government can serve their <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.45.1.pdf">written discovery requests</a> on Musk, the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Service, and US DOGE Temporary Organization. The states' lawsuit alleges violations of the US Constitution's appointments clause and conduct in excess of statutory authority.</p>
<p>"Plaintiffs' requests, as amended by the court, are reasonable and narrowly tailored to their request for injunctive relief," and "expedited discovery is reasonable and necessary to evaluate Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief," Chutkan, a judge at US District Court for the District of Columbia, wrote in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463/gov.uscourts.dcd.277463.60.0.pdf">memorandum opinion</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/us-tries-to-keep-doge-and-musk-work-secret-in-appeal-of-court-ordered-discovery/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Plex is a bit hard to explain these days. Even if you don't know its roots as an outgrowth of a Mac port of the Xbox Media Center project, Plex is not your typical "streaming" service, given how most people use it. So as Plex announces its first price increase to its Plex Pass subscription in more than 10 years, it has its work cut out explaining why, what's included, and what is changing.</p>
<p>Starting April 29, the cost of a Plex Pass rises from $5 to $7 monthly, from $40 to $70 annually, and a lifetime pass now costs $250, previously $120. In a blog post, Plex cites rising costs and its commitment to an independent service that supports "personal media."</p>
<p>"We are all in on the continued success of Plex Pass and personal media," the post states. "This price increase will ensure that we can keep investing dedicated resources in developing new features, while supporting and growing your favorites." The post cites a roadmap that contains an integration with <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a>, a new "bespoke server management app" for managing server users, and "an open and documented API for server integrations," including custom metadata agents.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/plex-ups-its-price-for-first-time-in-a-decade-changes-remote-streaming-access/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Trump fired both Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission yesterday, advancing his administration's claim that the president can fire FTC commissioners despite a US law and a 1935 Supreme Court ruling stating that the president cannot do so without good cause.</p>
<p>Trump fired Democrats Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, both of whom said the firings are illegal. Trump "tried to illegally fire me. I'll see the president in court," Bedoya <a href="https://x.com/BedoyaFTC/status/1902113304434126982">wrote</a>. The FTC was created "to fight fraudsters and monopolists," but Trump "wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies," Bedoya said.</p>
<p>A statement from Slaughter said, "The President illegally fired me from my position as a Federal Trade Commissioner, violating the plain language of a statute and clear Supreme Court precedent." Slaughter <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/18/trump-fires-democratic-ftc-commissioners">said</a> Trump "fears the accountability that opposition voices would provide if the president orders Chairman [Andrew] Ferguson to treat the most powerful corporations and their executives—like those that flanked the President at his inauguration—with kid gloves."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-fires-both-ftc-democrats-in-challenge-to-supreme-court-precedent/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google can't make a move in 2025 without veering into the realm of generative AI, and the release of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/the-pixel-9a-arrives-this-month-for-499-with-streamlined-design-and-larger-battery">Pixel 9a</a> is no exception. Curiously, the AI experience on this phone may not match what you've seen from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-phones-the-gemini-ai-stuff-reviewed/">the company's high-end smartphones</a>. Google has confirmed to Ars that the phone's lower memory prevented it from implementing the full suite of Pixel AI features. You can still talk to Gemini by holding the power button or opening the Gemini app, but the on-device Gemini Nano model has seen a downgrade on the 9a.</p>
<p>Google's approach to AI has changed substantially since the Pixel 8a launched, with some of the Pixel 9's hallmark features relying on local AI processing through the smartphone-optimized Gemini Nano. The Pixel 9a has it, but it's smaller than the Gemini Nano model on other Pixel 9s. For reasons unknown, Google does not call it Gemini Pico—it's Gemini Nano 1.0 XXS (extra extra small). The Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold all run Gemini Nano XS (extra small).</p>
<p>The Pixel 9a has less RAM than the flagship Pixels, which standardized on 12GB largely to provide Gemini Nano with reserved memory without impeding performance. However, the Pixel 9a still just has 8GB of memory, which is a problem for local AI processing. This is the first Google phone to ship with a new super-small AI model. It saves on resources but can't support some of the best Pixel AI features.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Safety is Volvo's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/in-1959-volvo-gave-us-the-seat-belt-heres-what-its-safety-team-is-building-now/">big thing</a>. From three-point seatbelts to side-impact protection to blind-spot monitoring and much more, the Swedish automaker focuses its innovation on making its cars safer rather than faster around the Nürburgring. (Although in the past, it has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/the-2017-s60-polestar-a-volvo-with-a-nurburgring-lap-record/">set records there too</a>.) As part of its efforts, Volvo has collected data from tens of thousands of car crashes, which it's now leveraging in virtual worlds to put simulated cars and SUVs through the wringer with the help of something amusingly named "Gaussian splatting."</p>
<p>"We've been visiting crash sites since the '70s. We've been recording event data from a fleet of cars for many, many years," said Alwin Bakkenes, head of global software engineering at Volvo Cars. "And all of those data points have actually helped us create safety innovations... from the three-point safety belt to whiplash protection systems and now also, as we're introducing in the ES90, a function called 'lidar AS,' which helps the car steer away from vulnerable road users in the dark," he said.</p>
<p>Like some others in the industry, Volvo is an early adopter of the software-defined vehicle, or SDV. As a quick refresher, SDVs are clean-sheet designs in terms of their electronic architecture. Instead of dozens or even a hundred discrete black boxes, each with its own hardware and running its own software, each doing a discrete job (like controlling the air conditioner or managing traction control), four or five powerful central computers take over those roles, overseeing domains like infotainment, advanced driver assistance systems, handling and powertrain, and interior comfort.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/volvo-reconstructs-crashes-with-ai-in-virtual-worlds-to-make-safer-cars/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google has taken the wraps off the Pixel 9a today, a phone that has leaked about a thousand times in recent weeks, as is the Pixel tradition. Still, there are some things to know about this phone you can't glean from leaked renders or a YouTube unboxing. This phone maintains the same $499 price tag as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pixel-8a-review-googles-budget-champion-gets-even-better/">last year's A-series phone</a>, but it has a larger battery, a new camera, and a simpler design that ditches the camera bar of other recent Pixel phones.</p>
<p>The Pixel 9a has the same flat aluminum frame that has been in vogue on smartphones for the past few years. Unlike the more expensive Pixels, the back is plastic instead of Gorilla Glass. Google says it's made of 81 percent recycled material, and the aluminum is 100 percent recycled. Apparently, these percentages are a record for the Pixel series, if that's something that matters to you.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the fall of 2020, a 77-year-old man in Florida realized he had gotten one of the worst gifts imaginable—one that kept on giving.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1721_article">a case report</a> published in this month's issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the man showed up at a Gainesville hospital with chest pain that just wouldn't go away. For nearly two years prior, the man—a pastor living on a rural farm with dogs and goats—had been in and out of hospitals and on and off of various antibiotics.</p>
<p>Generally, the man wasn't in the best health. His medical history included Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. For the latter, he had an automated implantable cardiac defibrillator (AICD) placed—and it was not his first. The man had a notable history of having gone through multiple defibrillators and revisions, including getting a new generator in 2018. Some possible reasons for such a history could include heavy use of the device and infections.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/florida-man-eats-feral-pig-meat-contracts-rare-biothreat-bacteria/">Read full article</a></p>

But the passage of time hasn't stopped one company from taking advantage of this week's Game Developers Conference to poke fun at the erstwhile gaming executive for his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meet-the-stadia-developers-blindsided-by-googles-latest-product-shutdown/">alleged mistreatment of developers</a>.</p>
<p>VGC <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/has-a-harrison-fired-you-lately-savage-planet-devs-taunt-former-stadia-boss-phil-harrison-with-gdc-billboard/">spotted a conspicuous billboard</a> in San Francisco's Union Square Monday featuring the overinflated, completely bald head of <em>Gunther</em> Harrison, the fictional Alta Interglobal CEO who was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-will-serve-up-its-dish-in-may-2025/">recently revealed</a> as the blatantly satirical antagonist in the upcoming game <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. A large message atop the billboard asks passersby—including the tens of thousands in town for GDC—"Has a Harrison fired <em>you</em> lately? You might be eligible for emotional support."</p>

<p>While Gunther Harrison probably hasn't fired any GDC attendees, the famously bald Phil Harrison was responsible for the firing of plenty of developers when he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/report-stadia-undershot-to-the-tune-of-hundreds-of-thousands-of-users/">shut down Google's short-lived Stadia Games &amp; Entertainment (SG&amp;E) publishing imprint</a> in early 2021. That shutdown <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/">surprised a lot of newly jobless game developers</a>, perhaps none more so than those at Montreal-based Typhoon Games, which Google had <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/google-buys-triple-a-game-dev-typhoon-studio-to-beef-up-stadia/">acquired in late 2019</a> to make what Google's Jade Raymond said at the time would be "platform-defining exclusive content" for Stadia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/developers-gdc-billboard-pokes-at-despised-former-google-stadia-exec/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>During Tuesday's Nvidia GTX keynote, CEO Jensen Huang unveiled two so-called "personal AI supercomputers" called DGX Spark and DGX Station, both powered by the Grace Blackwell platform. In a way, they are a new type of AI PC architecture specifically built for running neural networks, and five major PC manufacturers will build them.</p>
<p>These desktop systems, first previewed as "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/nvidias-first-desktop-pc-can-run-local-ai-models-for-3000/">Project DIGITS</a>" in January, aim to bring AI capabilities to developers, researchers, and data scientists who need to prototype, fine-tune, and run large AI models locally. DGX systems can serve as standalone desktop AI labs or "bridge systems" that allow AI developers to move their models from desktops to DGX Cloud or any AI cloud infrastructure with few code changes.</p>
<p>Huang explained the rationale behind these new products in a <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-dgx-spark-and-dgx-station-personal-ai-computers">news release</a>, saying, "AI has transformed every layer of the computing stack. It stands to reason a new class of computers would emerge—designed for AI-native developers and to run AI-native applications."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-dgx-desktop-personal-ai-supercomputers/">Read full article</a></p>
