              <![CDATA[<p>It started, like so many overwrought home optimization projects, during the pandemic.</p>
<p>My wife and I, like many people stuck inside, were ordering takeout more frequently. We wanted to support local restaurants, reduce the dish load, and live a little. It became clear early on that app-based delivery services like DoorDash and Uber Eats were not the best way to support local businesses. If a restaurant had its own ordering site or a preferred service, we wanted to use that—or even, heaven forfend, call the place.</p>
<p>The secondary issue was that we kept ordering from the same places, and we wanted to mix it up. Sometimes we'd want to pick something up nearby. Sometimes we wanted to avoid an entire category ("Too many carbs this week, no pasta") or try the newest places we knew about, or maybe a forgotten classic. Or just give me three places randomly, creative constraints, please—it's Friday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/making-tiny-no-code-webapps-out-of-spreadsheets-is-a-weirdly-fulfilling-hobby/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[What do eating rocks, rat genitals, and Willy Wonka have in common? AI, of course.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's been a wild year in tech thanks to the intersection between humans and artificial intelligence. 2024 brought a parade of AI oddities, mishaps, and wacky moments that inspired odd behavior from both machines and man. From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.</p>
<p>Why the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/chatgpts-success-could-have-come-sooner-says-former-google-ai-researcher/">Transformer-based</a> AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">launched in June</a> held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">OpenAI's o1</a> used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/">NotebookLM</a> also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">music synthesis models</a> and also better <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/">AI video generators</a>, including several from China.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hey, look at that! Another year has flown by, and I suspect many people would say "good riddance" to 2024.</p>
<p>The 2020s have been quite the decade so far. No matter what insanity has transpired by a particular December 31, the following year has shown up and promptly said, "Hold my beer."</p>
<p>The biggest news at Ars in 2024 was our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/welcome-to-our-latest-design-update-ars-9-0/">first site redesign in nearly a decade</a>. We're proud of Ars 9.0 (we're up to 9.0.3 now), and we have continued to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-9-0-1-redesign-is-now-live-with-density-tweaks-and-visited-link-colors/">make changes based on your feedback</a>. The best kind of feedback, however, is your clicks. Those clicks power this recap, so read on to learn which stories our readers found especially compelling.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/12/the-20-most-read-stories-of-2024-on-ars-technica/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their favorite film that serves as alternative Christmas movie fare, with <em>Die Hard</em> (1988) and <em>Lethal Weapon</em> (1987) typically topping the list—at least when all you want for Christmas is buddy-cop banter, car chases, shootouts, and glorious explosions. (Massive gratuitous property damage is a given.) I love me some <em>Lethal Weapon</em> but it's high time to give some holiday love to another great action flick set during the Christmas season: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Kiss_Goodnight"><em>The Long Kiss Goodnight</em></a> (1996), starring Geena Davis as an amnesiac school teacher who turns out to have been a government assassin in her former life.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below for this nearly 30-year-old film.)</strong></p>
<p>At the time, Davis was married to director Renny Harlin, coming off a disastrous showing for their previous collaboration, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroat_Island"><em>Cutthroat Island</em></a> (1995), which remains one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. (It is indeed a pretty bad movie.) But Shane Black's smart, savvy script for <em>The Long Kiss Goodnight</em> seemed like the perfect next project for them; it was promising enough that New Line Cinema bought it for what was then a record $4 million.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/why-the-long-kiss-goodnight-is-a-great-alt-christmas-movie/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[From wacky crime capers and dystopian video game adaptions to sweeping historical epics, 2024 had a little of everything]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor's note</strong>: Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything major, please note this list does include a few specific references to several of the listed shows that some might consider spoiler-y.</em></p>
<p>This was another good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Really, 2024 had a little of everything, from wacky crime capers (<em>Bad Monkey</em>) and Satanic Panic (<em>Hysteria</em>) to dystopian video game adaptations (<em>Fallout</em>) and sweeping historical epics (<em>Shōgun)</em>, with plenty of genre-mashup delights in between. While streaming platforms continue to dominate, the selection is more evenly distributed across them this year, with only Hulu and Netflix snagging more than two slots (depending on whether or not you lump Hulu together with Disney+ after the merger).</p>
<p>As always, we're opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our "year's best" vote at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/tv-technica-2024-our-picks-for-the-best-of-tv/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you've been too busy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-new-nvidia-app-is-probably-hurting-your-pc-gaming-performance/">fixing your video drivers</a> to take part in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/win-hardware-collectibles-and-more-in-the-2024-ars-technica-charity-drive/">this year's Ars Technica Charity Drive sweepstakes</a>, don't worry. You still have time to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $4,000 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win).</p>
<p>In the first week or so of the drive, hundreds of readers have contributed well over $16,000 to either the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is barely hanging on to a small donation lead at the moment). That's a long way off from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/">2020's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Thursday, January 2, 2025.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/reminder-donate-to-win-swag-in-our-annual-charity-drive-sweepstakes-16/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At this point, any serious retro gamer knows that a bulky cathode ray tube (CRT) TV provides <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/10/11/are-crt-tvs-important-for-retro-gaming/">the most authentic</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/video-demonstrates-the-marvel-of-crt-displays-at-380000-frames-per-second/">lag-free experience</a> for game consoles that predate the era of flat-panel HDTVs (i.e,. before the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 era). But modern gamers used to massive flat panel HD displays might balk at the display size of the most common CRTs, which tend to average in the 20- to 30-inch range (depending on the era they were made).</p>
<p>For those who want the absolute largest CRT experience possible, Sony's KX-45ED1 model (aka PVM-4300) has become the stuff of legends. The massive 45-inch CRT was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/xuhbb9/biggest_trinitron_ever_the_kx45ed1_it_was_sold/">sold in the late '80s</a> for a whopping $40,000 (over $100,000 in today's dollars), according to contemporary reports.</p>
<p>That price means it wasn't exactly a mass-market product, and the limited supply has made it something of a white whale for CRT enthusiasts to this day. While a few pictures have emerged of the PVM-4300 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/liyitz/the_picture_of_kx45ed1_aka_pvm4300/">in the wild</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/444560212348840/posts/2936345963170240/">in marketing materials</a>, no collector has stepped forward with detailed footage of a working unit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/retro-gamers-save-one-of-the-last-45-inch-crt-tvs-in-existence/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For $2,100, you could buy over a dozen upper-quality <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/the-ars-technica-guide-to-mechanical-keyboards/">mechanical keyboards</a>. Alternatively, you could buy just one mechanical keyboard kit. Costing the same as a desktop computer, The Icebreaker keyboard commands one of the highest price tags you'll see for a keyboard, and that's more due to its appearance than its capabilities.</p>
<p>The Icebreaker, spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/mechanical-keyboards/usd1-600-aluminum-icebreaker-keyboard-breaks-the-bank-sports-metal-chassis-keycaps-with-800-micro-perforations-and-via-support">Tom's Hardware</a>, became available for <a href="https://www.serene.industries/product/the-icebreaker-kit">preorder</a> on Thursday. The prohibitively priced peripheral is the primary product from Serene Industries, which founder Denis Agarkov <a href="https://www.serene.industries/home-main#updates">describes</a> as an “outlet for creativity, love of materials, experimentation, and an endless exercise in learning new things."</p>
<p>In a February interview with <a href="https://design-milk.com/serene-industries-carves-metal-into-the-icebreaker-keyboard/">Design Milk</a>, Agarkov said that the profile view of New York City’s Flatiron skyscraper inspired the keyboard’s design. The building opened in 1902 and measures 285 feet tall with a steel frame and distinct prism shape.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/2100-mechanical-keyboard-has-800-holes-nyc-skyscraper-looks/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Flu season is ramping up across the US, but Louisiana—the state that has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/louisiana-bars-health-dept-from-promoting-flu-covid-mpox-vaccines-report/">reportedly barred its health department from promoting flu shots</a>, as well as COVID-19 and mpox vaccines—is leading the country with an early and strong surge.</p>
<p>Louisiana's flu activity has reached the "Very High" category set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2024-week-50.html"> the latest data</a>. The 13-category scale is based on the percentage of doctor's visits that were for influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in the previous week. Louisiana is at the first of three "Very High" levels. Oregon is the only other state to have reached this level. The rest of the country spans the scale, with 13 jurisdictions at "High," including New York City and Washington, DC. There are 11 at "Moderate," 10 at "Low," and 19 at "Minimal."</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Health care company Ascension lost sensitive data for nearly 5.6 million individuals in a cyberattack that was attributed to a notorious ransomware gang, according to documents filed with the attorney general of Maine.</p>
<p>Ascension owns 140 hospitals and scores of assisted living facilities. In May, the organization was hit with an attack that caused <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/19/nx-s1-5010219/ascension-hospital-ransomware-attack-care-lapses">mass disruptions</a> as staff was <a href="https://about.ascension.org/cybersecurity-event">forced</a> to move to manual processes that caused errors, delayed or lost lab results, and diversions of ambulances to other hospitals. Ascension managed to restore most services by mid-June. At the time, the company said the attackers had stolen protected health information and personally identifiable information for an undisclosed number of people.</p>
<h2>Investigation concluded</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/e55264f2-ff87-4b28-874d-653cfb735fe6.html">filing</a> Ascension made earlier in December revealed that nearly 5.6 million people were affected by the breach. Data stolen depended on the particular person but included individuals' names and medical information (e.g., medical record numbers, dates of service, types of lab tests, or procedure codes), payment information (e.g., credit card information or bank account numbers), insurance information (e.g., Medicaid/Medicare ID, policy number, or insurance claim), government<br>
identification (e.g., Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver’s license numbers, or passport numbers), and other personal information (such as date of birth or address).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/health-care-giant-ascension-says-5-6-million-patients-affected-in-cyberattack/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Under Joe Biden's direction, the US Trade Representative (USTR) <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/december/ustr-initiates-section-301-investigation-chinas-acts-policies-and-practices-related-targeting">launched</a> a probe Monday into China's plans to globally dominate markets for legacy chips—alleging that China's unfair trade practices threaten US national security and could thwart US efforts to build up a domestic semiconductor supply chain.</p>
<p>Unlike the most advanced chips used to power artificial intelligence that are currently in short supply, these legacy chips rely on older manufacturing processes and are more ubiquitous in mass-market products. They're used in tech for cars, military vehicles, medical devices, smartphones, home appliances, space projects, and much more.</p>
<p>China apparently "plans to build more than 60 percent of the world's new legacy chip capacity over the next decade," and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said evidence showed this was "discouraging investment elsewhere and constituted unfair competition," Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-launches-new-us-trade-probe-into-legacy-chinese-chips-2024-12-23/">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/chinas-plan-to-dominate-legacy-chips-globally-sparks-us-probe/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Beleaguered automaker Nissan is going to throw its lot in with Honda. The two Japanese OEMs want to merge by 2026, creating the world's third-largest car company in the process. In fact, earlier this year the two signed memorandums of understanding to create a strategic partnership focused on software and electrification. Now, the changing business environment calls for deeper integration, they say.</p>
<p>"Today marks a pivotal moment as we begin discussions on business integration that has the potential to shape our future. If realized, I believe that by uniting the strengths of both companies, we can deliver unparalleled value to customers worldwide who appreciate our respective brands. Together, we can create a unique way for them to enjoy cars that neither company could achieve alone," said Makoto Uchida, Nissan's president and CEO.</p>
<p>"Creation of new mobility value by bringing together the resources including knowledge, talents, and technologies that Honda and Nissan have been developing over the long years is essential to overcome challenging environmental shifts that the auto industry is facing" said Honda director Toshihiro Mibe. "Honda and Nissan are two companies with distinctive strengths. We are still at the stage of starting our review, and we have not decided on a business integration yet, but in order to find a direction for the possibility of business integration by the end of January 2025, we strive to be the one and only leading company that creates new mobility value through chemical reaction that can only be driven through synthesis of the two teams."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/honda-and-nissan-to-merge-honda-will-take-the-lead/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Although the details remain in flux, the transition team reviewing NASA and its activities has begun to draft potential executive orders for changes to space policy under the Trump Administration.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the five people on the team, who have spent the last six weeks assessing the space agency and its exploration plans, were careful to note that such teams are advisory in nature. They do not formally set policy nor is their work always indicative of the direction an incoming presidential administration will move toward.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in trying to set clear goals for NASA and civil space policy, the ideas under consideration reflect the Trump administration's desire for "big changes" at NASA, both in terms of increasing the effectiveness and velocity of its programs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/how-might-nasa-change-under-trump-heres-what-is-being-discussed/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[This year's list features quite a bit of horror mixed in with the usual blockbuster fare—plus smaller hidden gems.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor's note:</strong> Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything too major, please note this list does include a few specific references to several of the listed films that some might consider spoiler-y.</em></p>
<p>This was the year that Marvel Studios hit the pause button on its deluge of blockbuster superhero movies, after rather saturating the market in recent years. It proved to be a smart move: the only Marvel theatrical release was the R-rated <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, a refreshingly irreverent, very meta take on the genre that delighted audiences and lit up the global box office. Perhaps audiences aren't so much bored with superhero movies as becoming more discriminating in their choices. Give us a fun, fresh take and we'll flock back to theaters.</p>
<p>Fewer superhero franchise entries meant there was more breathing room for other fare. Horror in particular had a stellar year, with numerous noteworthy offerings, touching on body horror (<em>The Substance</em>), Satanic Panic (<em>Late Night with the Devil</em>), psychological horror (<em>Heretic</em>), hauntings (<em>The Oddity</em>), a rom-com/revenge mashup (<em>Your Monster</em>), an inventive reimagining of a classic silent film (<em>Nosferatu</em>), and one very bloodthirsty child vampire with a wicked sense of humor (<em>Abigail</em>). Throw in a smattering of especially strong sequels (<em>Inside Out 2, Dune: Part 2</em>), a solid prequel (<em>Furiosa</em>), and a few hidden gems, and we had one of the better years for film in recent memory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/film-technica-our-favorite-movies-of-2024/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">A2RL provided flights from San Francisco to Tokyo and accommodation so Ars could attend its race. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>TOKYO—Racing is hard. It's hard on the teams, it's hard on the owner's bank account, it's hard on the cars, and it's especially hard on the drivers. Driving at the edge for a few hours in a vehicle cockpit that's only slightly wider than your frame can take a toll.</p>
<p>The A2RL (Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League) removes one of those elements from its vehicles but, in doing so, creates a whole new list of complexities. Say goodbye to the human driver and hello to 95 kilograms of computers and a whole suite of sensors. That setup was poised to be part of a demonstration "race" against former F1 driver Daniil Kvyat at Suzuka Circuit in Japan during the Super Formula season finale.</p>
<p>But again, racing is hard, and replacing humans doesn't change that. The people who run and participate in A2RL are aware of this, and while many organizations have made it a sport of overselling AI, A2RL is up-front about the limitations of the current state of the technology. One example of the technology's current shortcomings: The vehicles can't swerve back and forth to warm up the tires.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/man-vs-ai-race-scrapped-after-ai-car-crashes-into-wall-on-warm-up-lap/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[A relatively light year still had its fair share of interactive standouts.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When we introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2023/">last year's annual list of the best games</a> in this space, we focused on how COVID delays led to a 2023 packed with excellent big-name blockbusters and intriguing indies that seemed to come out of nowhere. The resulting flood of great titles made it difficult to winnow the year's best down to our traditional list of 20 titles.</p>
<p>In 2024 we had something close to the opposite problem. While there were definitely a few standout titles that were easy to include on this year's list (<em>Balatro</em>, <em>UFO 50</em>, and <em>Astro Bot</em> likely chief among them), rounding out the list to a full 20 proved more challenging than it has in perhaps any other year during my tenure at Ars Technica (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/01/im-a-man-of-wealth-and-taste/">way back in 2012!</a>). The games that ended up on this year's list are all strong recommendations, for sure. But many of them might have had more trouble making a Top 20 list in a packed year like 2023.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait to see if the release calendar seesaws back to a quality-packed one in 2025, but the forecast for big games like <em>Civilization 7</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, and many, many more has us thinking that it might. In the meantime, here are our picks for the 20 best games that came out in 2024, in alphabetical order.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-technicas-top-20-video-games-of-2024/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Boat collision left Charlotte stranded at the surface and in danger of predation.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Charlotte, a green sea turtle, was hit by a boat back in 2008. This left it with an affliction colloquially referred to as the “bubble butt,” a kind of floating syndrome that makes it impossible for a turtle to dive. Most sea turtles suffering from issues like this simply die at sea, since the condition leaves them stranded at the surface where they can’t forage, sleep, and avoid predators like sharks. But fate had other plans for Charlotte.</p>
<p>Charlotte didn’t end up as a shark’s lunch and didn’t starve to death floating helplessly in the ocean. Instead, it got rescued shortly after the boat accident and eventually found a home at Mystic Aquarium in Stonington, Connecticut, where it received professional care. That was the first time Charlotte got lucky. The second time came when a collaboration formed: Adia, a company specializing in 3D-printing solutions; Formlabs, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of 3D printers; and New Balance Athletic, a sportswear giant based in Boston. This team chose Charlotte as a technology showcase, which basically turned the turtle into an Oscar Pistorius of the sea—just without the criminal conviction.</p>
<h2>Weights and diet</h2>
<p>Sea turtles are marine reptiles, which means they don’t have gills like fish—they need air to breathe. The lungs also play a key role in their buoyancy regulation system, which allows them to rest for extended periods of time at the sea floor or float at a precisely chosen depth. A sea turtle can precisely choose the depth at which it achieves neutral buoyancy by inhaling the exactly right volume of air.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/injured-green-sea-turtle-relearns-how-to-swim-thanks-to-3d-printed-harness/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On May 2, 2008, the Chaitén volcano in Chile awoke with unexpected fury after more than 9,000 years of dormancy. The eruption blasted rocks and ash a dozen miles into the air, and then heavy rainfall swept the fallen debris up in immense mudflows. A river of rubble carved a destructive path through the nearby town of Chaitén before surging into the sea. The town, practically split in two by the torrent that cut through its middle, was evacuated as ash blanketed over 200,000 square kilometers of surrounding land.</p>
<p>While the terrestrial aftermath was plain to see, captured by both the local media and satellites, the impact on the sea was unknown.</p>

<p>The eruption released over 750 billion liters of lava—enough to fill more than 300,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools—mainly in the form of rock fragments. The debris flowed through rivers into the Northern Patagonian Sea, just six miles away.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/scientists-explore-frozen-scars-and-fiery-sands-on-the-seafloor/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Did OpenAI's big holiday event live up to the billing?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Over the past 12 business days, OpenAI has announced a new product or demoed an AI feature every weekday, calling the PR event "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 days of OpenAI</a>." We've covered some of the major announcements, but we thought a look at each announcement might be useful for people seeking a comprehensive look at each day's developments.</p>
<p>The timing and rapid pace of these announcements—particularly in light of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-and-openai-blitz-december-with-so-many-ai-releases-its-hard-to-keep-up/">Google's competing releases</a>—illustrates the intensifying competition in AI development. What might normally have been spread across months was compressed into just 12 business days, giving users and developers a lot to process as they head into 2025.</p>
<p>Humorously, we asked ChatGPT what it thought about the whole series of announcements, and it was skeptical that the event even took place. "The rapid-fire announcements over 12 days seem plausible," wrote ChatGPT-4o, "But might strain credibility without a clearer explanation of how OpenAI managed such an intense release schedule, especially given the complexity of the features."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/12-days-of-openai-the-ars-technica-recap/">Read full article</a></p>
