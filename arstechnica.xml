<p>If you use Google regularly, you may have noticed the company's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">AI Overviews</a> providing summarized answers to some of your questions in recent days. If you use social media regularly, you may have <a href="https://twitter.com/kinyt33/status/1793038888241401924">come across</a> many <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xydexxunicorn.bsky.social/post/3kt3p24slzk2q">examples</a> of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/caitlindeangelis.bsky.social/post/3kstxkut2c22n">those AI Overviews</a> being <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rem.postes.club/post/3ksnmkotpj22g">hilariously</a> or even <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/morte.bsky.social/post/3kt4di6uj2i26">dangerously wrong</a>.</p>
<p>Factual errors can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/nycs-government-chatbot-is-lying-about-city-laws-and-regulations/">pop up</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/chatgpt-alarms-users-by-spitting-out-shakespearean-nonsense-and-rambling/">existing LLM chatbots</a> as well, of course. But the potential damage that can be caused by AI inaccuracy gets multiplied when those errors appear atop the ultra-valuable web real estate of the Google search results page.</p>
<p>"The examples we've seen are generally very uncommon queries and aren’t representative of most people’s experiences," a Google spokesperson told Ars. "The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025825#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025825&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The launch of a classified Russian military satellite last week deployed a payload that US government officials say is likely a space weapon.</p>
<p>In a series of statements, US officials said the new military satellite, named Kosmos 2576, appears to be similar to two previous "inspector" spacecraft launched by Russia in 2019 and 2022.</p>
<p>"Just last week, on May 16, Russia launched a satellite into low-Earth orbit that the United States assesses is likely a counter-space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low-Earth orbit," said Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador to the United Nations. "Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026816#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026816&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A software maker serving more than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the world hosted an application update containing a hidden backdoor that maintained persistent communication with a malicious website, researchers reported Thursday, in the latest episode of a supply-chain attack.</p>
<p>The software, known as the JAVS Viewer 8, is a component of the <a href="https://www.javs.com/javs-suite-8-av-management-software/">JAVS Suite 8</a>, an application package courtrooms use to record, play back, and manage audio and video from proceedings. Its maker, Louisville, Kentucky-based Justice AV Solutions, says its products are used in more than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the US and 11 other countries. The company has been in business for 35 years.</p>
<h2>JAVS Viewer users at high risk</h2>
<p>Researchers from security firm Rapid7 <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/23/cve-2024-4978-backdoored-justice-av-solutions-viewer-software-used-in-apparent-supply-chain-attack/">reported</a> that a version of the JAVS Viewer 8 available for download on javs.com contained a backdoor that gave an unknown threat actor persistent access to infected devices. The malicious download, planted inside an executable file that installs the JAVS Viewer version 8.3.7, was available no later than April 1, when a <a href="https://x.com/2RunJack2/status/1775052981966377148">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) reported it. It’s unclear when the backdoored version was removed from the company’s download page. JAVS representatives didn’t immediately respond to questions sent by email.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026911#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026911&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Owners of Spotify's soon-to-be-bricked Car Thing device are begging the company to open-source the gadgets to save some the landfill. Spotify hasn't responded to pleas to salvage the hardware, which was originally intended to connect to car dashboards and auxiliary outlets to enable drivers to listen to and navigate Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify announced today that it's bricking all purchased Car Things on December 9 and not offering refunds or trade-in options. On a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">support page</a>, Spotify says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings. We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify has no further guidance for device owners beyond asking them to reset the device to factory settings and “safely” get rid of the bricked gadget by “following local electronic waste guidelines.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026806#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026806&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bing, Microsoft's search engine platform, went down in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/bing-search-outages-since-early-this-morning-442499">the very early morning today</a>. That meant that searches from Microsoft's Edge browsers that had yet to change their default providers didn't work. It also meant that services relying on Bing's search API—Microsoft's own Copilot, ChatGPT search, Yahoo, Ecosia, and DuckDuckGo—similarly failed.</p>
<p>Services were largely restored by the morning Eastern work hours, but the timing feels apt, concerning, or some combination of the two. Google, the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">consistently dominating search platform</a>, just last week <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">announced</a> and debuted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">AI Overviews as a default addition to all searches</a>. If you don't want an AI response but still want to use Google, you can hunt down <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-search-adds-web-filter-as-it-pivots-to-ai-focused-search-results/">the new "Web" option</a> in a menu, or you can, <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/05/17/google-web-search-make-default/">per Ernie Smith</a>, tack "&amp;udm=14" onto your search or use Smith's own <a href="https://udm14.com/">"Konami code" shortcut page</a>.</p>
<p>If dismay about AI's hallucinations, power draw, or <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-is-paying-reddit-60-million-for-fucksmith-to-tell-its-users-to-eat-glue/">pizza recipes</a> concern you—along with perhaps broader Google issues involving privacy, tracking, news, SEO, or monopoly power—most of your other major options were brought down by a single API outage this morning. Moving past that kind of single point of vulnerability will take some work, both by the industry and by you, the person wondering if there's a real alternative.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026559#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026559&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Windows 11 24H2 update isn’t scheduled to be released until sometime this fall, but testers can get a near-final version of it early. Microsoft has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/">released Windows 11 24H2 build 26100.712</a> to its Release Preview testing channel for Windows Insiders, a sign that the update is nearly complete and that the company has shifted into bug-fixing mode ahead of general availability.</p>
<p>Microsoft has generally stuck to smaller but more frequent feature updates during the Windows 11 era, but the annual fall updates still tend to be a bigger deal. They’re the ones that determine whether you’re still eligible for security updates, and they often (but not always) come with more significant under-the-hood changes than the normal feature drops.</p>

<p>Case in point: Windows 11 24H2 includes an updated compiler, kernel, and scheduler, all lower-level system changes made at least in part to better support Arm-based PCs. Existing Windows-on-Arm systems should also see a 10 or 20 percent performance boost when using x86 applications, thanks to improvements in the translation layer (which Microsoft is now calling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsoft-says-prism-translation-layer-does-for-arm-pcs-what-rosetta-did-for-macs/">Prism</a>).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026588#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026588&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-649043924.jpg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="1414" data-width="2121">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-649043924.jpg">YelenaYemchuk</a>)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Commercialization has not dealt kindly with the Mayan Food of the Gods. Modern chocolate products are filled with sugar and calories, contributing to the obesity epidemic in the West. And the cocoa crop is hardly in great shape; climate change is decreasing production, causing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/cocoa-prices-chocolate.html">prices to rise</a>; farmers in West Africa have responded by <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-real-cost-of-your-chocolate-habit-new-research-reveals-the-bittersweet-truth-of-cocoa-farming-in-africas-forests-206082">clear-cutting rainforests</a> to plant more cocoa plants. However, researchers at ETH Zurich may have found a path to start addressing both problems, making chocolate that has less sugar and calories and makes more efficient use of the cocoa crop. The Swiss perfected chocolate-making over 200 years ago, so if they say the chocolate is good, it is.</p>
<p>Chocolate is traditionally made by mixing dried, roasted, and ground fermented cocoa beans to make cocoa mass. The cocoa mass is then mixed with refined sugar, usually from sugar beets. Instead of sugar, this new Swiss whole fruit chocolate uses the pulp surrounding the cocoa beans along with the inner rind of the cocoa pod husk to make a cocoa gel. When mixed with cocoa mass, this produces chocolate that is higher in fiber and lower in saturated fat than conventional chocolate.</p>
<p>The “whole fruit” on its label is certainly more appealing than the air or fish oil that has previously been substituted for cocoa butter to reduce the saturated fat content of chocolate confections. (Extra cocoa butter, or fat isolated from the cocoa bean, is sometimes added to cocoa mass to make the end product smoother and waxier.) The pulp and the cocoa pods are generally discarded, so upcycling them instead of tossing them could reduce the land use impact and global warming potential of cocoa cultivation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026799#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026799&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Democratic consultant was indicted on charges of voter suppression and impersonation of a candidate after admitting that he commissioned a robocall that used artificial intelligence to imitate President Joe Biden's voice. The political consultant, Steven Kramer, is also facing a $6 million fine proposed by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/robocall-with-artificial-joe-biden-voice-tells-democrats-not-to-vote/">fake Biden robocall</a> urged Democrats not to vote and was placed to New Hampshire residents before the state's presidential primary in January. Kramer, who was working for a candidate running against Biden, acknowledged that he was responsible for the robocall in February.</p>
<p>Kramer, a 54-year-old from New Orleans, "has been charged with 13 felony counts of voter suppression... and 13 misdemeanor counts of impersonation of a candidate," New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella <a href="https://www.doj.nh.gov/news/2024/20240523-kramer-voter-suppression.html">announced today</a>. "The charges are spread across four counties based on the residence of thirteen New Hampshire residents who received the Biden robocalls."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026769#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026769&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the summer of 2022, a family gathered in South Dakota for a reunion that included a special meal—<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7320a2.htm?s_cid=mm7320a2_w">kabobs made with the meat of a black bear</a> that one of the family members had "harvested" from northern Saskatchewan, Canada, that May. Lacking a meat thermometer, the family assessed the doneness of the dark-colored meat by eye. At first, they accidentally served it rare, which a few family members noticed before a decision was made to recook it. The rest of the reunion was unremarkable, and the family members departed to their homes in Arizona, Minnesota, and South Dakota.</p>
<p>But just days later, family members began falling ill. One, a 29-year-old male in Minnesota, sought care for a mysterious illness marked by fever, severe muscle pains, swelling around his eyes (periorbital edema), high levels of infection-fighting white blood cells (eosinophilia, a common response to parasites), and other laboratory anomalies. The man sought care four times and was hospitalized twice in a 17-day span in July. It wasn't until his second hospitalization that doctors learned about the bear meat—and then it all made sense.</p>
<p>The doctors suspected the man had a condition called trichinellosis and infection of<em> Trichinella</em> nematodes (roundworms). These dangerous parasites can be found worldwide, embedded into the muscle fibers of various carnivores and omnivores, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/trichinellosis/index.html">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. But, it's quite rare to find them in humans in North America. Between 2016 and 2022, there were seven outbreaks of trichinellosis in the US, involving just 35 cases. The majority were linked to eating bear meat, but moose and wild boar meat are also common sources.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026753#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026753&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>OpenAI is sticking to its story that it never intended to copy Scarlett Johansson's voice when seeking an actor for ChatGPT's "Sky" voice mode.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/22/openai-scarlett-johansson-chatgpt-ai-voice/">provided The Washington Post</a> with documents and recordings clearly meant to support <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/openai-pauses-chatgpt-4o-voice-that-fans-said-ripped-off-scarlett-johansson/">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's defense against Johansson's claims</a> that Sky was made to sound "eerily similar" to her critically acclaimed voice acting performance in the sci-fi film <em>Her</em>.</p>
<p>Johansson has alleged that OpenAI hired a soundalike to steal her likeness and confirmed that she declined to provide the Sky voice. Experts have said that Johansson has a strong case should she decide to sue OpenAI for violating her right to publicity, which gives the actress exclusive rights to the commercial use of her likeness.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026675#p3">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026675&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google's AI Overview is a complete transformation of what Google Search is, changing from a product that searches the web to show relevant links, to a place that scrapes the web of information and shows it directly to users. Google is not done making changes, though, and next for AI Overview is ads! We're all so excited.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/ai-creativity-google-marketing-live/">Google Ads &amp; Commerce blog</a> shows what this will look like, with ads landing at the bottom of the AI Overview box. The overview box was already a massive, screen-filling box, and ads make it even longer, pushing what's left of the web results even further down the page. Google's demo shows the ads at the bottom of the overview box, and you have to scroll down to see them.</p>
<p>Google's ad placement will surely be changed and tweaked a million times in the future, and Google mentions that "in early testing, we’ve heard that people find the ads appearing above and below the AI-generated overview helpful." Leaving aside the unique perspective that ads are "helpful," there's your confirmation of the usual above-the-fold ad placement.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026600#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026600&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><span class="ars-approved-logo right"></span>I have a theory about electric vehicles, and with a few notable exceptions, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/the-driving-enthusiasts-dilemma-about-electric-cars/">it's this</a>: The cheaper, less powerful version is usually the one to get. Big power outputs and short 0–60 times have been the industry's go-to, but always with the trade-off being less range and a bigger sticker price. Today's EV is a good example. It's the BMW i4 eDrive40, a single-motor version of BMW's smaller electric fastback sedan. It has taken a while to get some seat time in one, but the wait was worth it, because this is one of the best electric sedans we've tested so far.</p>
<p>I've driven the BMW i4 a few times now since its launch in 2021, but always <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-2023-bmw-i4-is-the-electric-bmw-sedan-youve-been-waiting-for/">the very fast, very powerful, rather expensive i4 M50</a>. Which is fine, but not exciting like the M3. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/bmw-finds-its-mojo-again-with-the-55400-i4-electric-sedan/">i4 eDrive40</a> undercuts the twin-motor, all-wheel drive M50 by more than $10,000—it starts at a more reasonable $57,300 and goes more than 30 miles (48 km) farther on a single charge of the same capacity 84.3 kWh (net) battery pack, with an EPA range of 301 miles (484 km).</p>
<p>BMW made its name on the back of a string of driver-focused, rear-wheel drive sedans, and I had high expectations for the eDrive40 to live up to. With no front motor, there's less weight on the front axle, and the front wheels just have to worry about steering and braking, not laying down power as well. Less power to put down means smaller wheels, which translates into a better ride and more range, although our test car was equipped with 19-inch wheels (a $600 option), which reduced its range to 283 miles (455 km) compared to the 18-inch option.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026660#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026660&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For more than four days, a server at the very core of the Internet’s domain name system was out of sync with its 12 root server peers due to an unexplained glitch that could have caused stability and security problems worldwide. This server, maintained by Internet carrier <a href="http://www.cogentco.com/">Cogent Communications</a>, is one of the 13 root servers that provision the Internet’s root zone, which sits at the top of the hierarchical distributed database known as the domain name system, or DNS.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified recap of the way the domain name system works and how root servers fit in:</p>
<p>When someone enters wikipedia.org in their browser, the servers handling the request first must translate the human-friendly domain name into an IP address. This is where the domain name system comes in. The first step in the DNS process is the browser queries the local stub resolver in the local operating system. The stub resolver forwards the query to a recursive resolver, which may be provided by the user's ISP or a service such as 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 from Cloudflare and Google, respectively.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026566#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026566&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts—On Wednesday, AI enthusiasts and experts gathered to hear a series of presentations about the state of AI at <a href="https://event.technologyreview.com/emtech-digital-us-2024/">EmTech Digital 2024</a> on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's campus. The event was hosted by the publication MIT Technology Review. The overall consensus is that generative AI is still in its very early stages—with policy, regulations, and social norms still being established—and its growth is likely to continue into the future.</p>

<p>I was there to check the event out. MIT is the birthplace of many tech innovations—including the <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/1863/spacewar-profile-of-a-cultural-earthquake">first action-oriented computer video game</a>—among others, so it felt fitting to hear talks about the latest tech craze in the same building that hosts MIT's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab">Media Lab</a> on its sprawling and lush campus.</p>
<p>EmTech's speakers included AI researchers, policy experts, critics, and company spokespeople. A corporate feel pervaded the event due to strategic sponsorships, but it was handled in a low-key way that matches the level-headed tech coverage coming out of MIT Technology Review. After each presentation, MIT Technology Review staff—such as Editor-in-Chief Mat Honan and Senior Reporter Melissa Heikkilä—did a brief sit-down interview with the speaker, pushing back on some points and emphasizing others. Then the speaker took a few audience questions if time allowed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026462#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026462&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US government today sued Live Nation and its Ticketmaster subsidiary in a complaint that seeks a breakup of the company that dominates the live music and events market.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice is seeking "structural relief," including a breakup, "to stop the anticompetitive conduct arising from Live Nation's monopoly power." The DOJ <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.621993/gov.uscourts.nysd.621993.1.0_1.pdf">complaint</a> asked a federal court to "order the divestiture of, at minimum, Ticketmaster, along with any additional relief as needed to cure any anticompetitive harm."</p>
<p>The District of Columbia and 29 states joined the DOJ in the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. "One monopolist serves as the gatekeeper for the delivery of nearly all live music in America today: Live Nation, including its wholly owned subsidiary Ticketmaster," the complaint said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026640#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026640&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Chevrolet provided flights from Los Angeles to Detroit and accommodation so Ars could drive the Silverado EV. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>The latest addition to Chevrolet's growing family of Ultium electric vehicles recently began shipping to dealers in the form of the Silverado EV's early RST First Edition package. Silverado's top spec level now joins the lineup's previous fleet-only WT trim, meaning the general public can now purchase an enormous electric pickup that strongly resembles the Avalanche of 2001 to 2013. But despite any other similarities to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/the-hummer-ev-is-an-electric-truck-for-people-who-think-evs-are-stupid/">the Hummer EV</a>, which shares a related chassis, or ICE trucks of old, the 2024 Silverado aims to change the game for GM's market positioning despite arriving a full <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/05/the-most-important-ev-of-the-decade-we-drive-the-f-150-lightning/4/">24 months after Ford's F-150 Lightning</a>.</p>
<p>With a large crew cab, a longer truck bed, and angular sail panels, the Silverado EV looks less boxy than GMC's Hummer EV. Aero gains thanks to the smoother design pair with lower rolling-resistance tires, allowing the Silverado to achieve an EPA range estimate of up to 450 miles (724 km), though the RST First Edition I recently drove over the course of a long day in Michigan earns a rating of 440 miles (708 km).</p>
<p>On the highway, judging by wind noise around the cabin alone, the aerodynamic gains of the Silverado's styling seem to make a noticeable difference versus the Hummer. On the other hand, tire hum might cover up any aero deficiencies because the RST's single weirdest detail constantly occupies center stage here: a set of 24-inch wheels, the largest ever equipped to a car, truck, or SUV straight from the factory.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026203#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026203&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For at least a decade, a car theft trick known as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/just-pair-11-radio-gadgets-can-steal-car/">“relay attack”</a> has been the modern equivalent of hot-wiring: a cheap and relatively easy technique to steal hundreds of models of vehicles. A more recent upgrade to the radio protocol in cars' keyless entry systems known as ultra-wideband communications, rolled out to some high-end cars including the latest <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-model-3-review/">Tesla Model 3</a>, has been heralded as the fix for that ubiquitous form of grand theft auto. But when one group of Chinese researchers actually checked whether it's still possible to perform relay attacks against the latest Tesla and a collection of other cars that support that next-gen radio protocol, they found that they're as stealable as ever.</p>
<figure class="video ars-wp-video">
    <div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;">
        <video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2026474-1" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tesla-radio-hack.mp4?_=1"></source></video>    </div>
    </figure>
<p>In a video shared with WIRED, researchers at the Beijing-based automotive cybersecurity firm GoGoByte demonstrated that they could carry out a relay attack against the latest Tesla Model 3 despite its upgrade to an ultra-wideband keyless entry system, instantly unlocking it with less than a hundred dollars worth of radio equipment. Since the Tesla 3's keyless entry system also controls the car's immobilizer feature designed to prevent its theft, that means a radio hacker could start the car and drive it away in seconds—unless the driver has enabled Tesla's optional, off-by-default PIN-to-drive feature that requires the owner to enter a four-digit code before starting the car.</p>

<p>As new diabetes and weight-loss drugs help patients curb appetites and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/long-term-wegovy-study-finds-weight-loss-plateaus-a-little-after-a-year/">shed pounds</a>, food manufacturers are looking for new ways to keep their bottom lines plump.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans have begun taking the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/outrageously-priced-weight-loss-drugs-could-bankrupt-us-health-care/">pricey new drugs</a>—particularly Mounjaro, Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound—and millions more are expected to go on them in the coming years. As such, food makers are bracing for slimmer sales. In <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/obesity-drugs-market-expanded-opportunity">a report earlier this month</a>, Morgan Stanley's tobacco and packaged food analyst Pamela Kaufman said the drugs are expected to affect both the amounts and the types of food people eat, taking a bite out of the food and drink industry's profits.</p>
<p>"In Morgan Stanley Research surveys, people taking weight-loss drugs were found to eat less food in general, while half slashed their consumption of sugary drinks, alcohol, confections and salty snacks, and nearly a quarter stopped drinking alcohol completely," Kaufman said. Restaurants that sell unhealthy foods, particularly chains, may face long-term business risks, the report noted. Around 75 percent of survey respondents taking weight-loss drugs said they had cut back on going to pizza and fast food restaurants.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026494#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026494&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battery recycling company Redwood Materials will start recycling battery production scrap from General Motors' new line of electric vehicles. This morning, Redwood announced that it is working with Ultium Cells, the joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solutions that makes Ultium battery cells. Approximately 10,000 tons a year of production scrap will be sent from the Ultium Cells plants in Ohio and Tennessee to Redwood's site in northern Nevada.</p>
<p>Redwood was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/former-tesla-cto-wins-amazon-funding-for-battery-recycling-project/">started by</a> former Tesla CTO JB Straubel in 2017 and in recent years has announced partnerships with multiple OEMs, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/ford-volvo-and-redwood-materials-start-recycling-ev-batteries/">Ford, Volvo</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/volkswagen-partners-with-redwood-materials-to-recycle-ev-batteries/">Volkswagen</a>, and now General Motors. Last year, the US Department of Energy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/redwood-gets-2-billion-commitment-from-doe-for-recycled-batteries/">approved a $2 billion loan</a> to Redwood as part of its Advanced Technology Manufacturing program (which also funded Ultium Cells).</p>
<p>Redwood says that its hydrometallurgy facility is now a "commercial-scale source of lithium supply," the first to come online in the United States for decades. The facility also produces raw nickel and cobalt from battery scrap.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026304#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026304&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A team of physicists has discovered that it’s possible to build a real, actual, physical warp drive and not break any known rules of physics. One caveat: the vessel doing the warping can’t exceed the speed of light, so you’re not going to get anywhere interesting any time soon. But this research still represents an important advance in our understanding of gravity.</p>
<h2>Moving without motion</h2>
<p>Einstein’s general theory of relativity is a toolkit for solving problems involving gravity that connects mass and energy with deformations in spacetime. In turn, those spacetime deformations instruct the mass and energy how to move. In almost all cases, physicists use the equations of relativity to figure out how a particular combination of objects will move. They have some physical scenario, like a planet orbiting a star or two black holes colliding, and they ask how those objects deform spacetime and what the subsequent evolution of the system should be.</p>
<p>But it’s also possible to run Einstein’s math in reverse by imagining some desired motion and asking what kind of spacetime deformation can make it possible. This is how the Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre discovered the physical basis for a warp drive—long a staple of the <em>Star Trek </em>franchise.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025766#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025766&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
