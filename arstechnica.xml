              <![CDATA[<p>AI video startup Runway announced the availability of its newest video synthesis model today. Dubbed Gen-4, the model <a href="https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-gen-4">purports to solve</a> several key problems with AI video generation.</p>
<p>Chief among those is the notion of consistent characters and objects across shots. If you've watched any short films made with AI, you've likely noticed that they're either dream-like sequences of thematically but not realistically connected images—mood pieces more than consistent narratives.</p>
<p>Runway claims Gen-4 can maintain consistent characters and objects, provided it's given a single reference image of the character or object in question as part of the project in Runway's interface.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/with-new-gen-4-model-runway-claims-to-have-finally-achieved-consistency-in-ai-videos/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple dropped a big batch of medium-size software updates for nearly all of its products this afternoon. The iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, tvOS 18.4, and visionOS 2.4 updates are all currently available to download, and each adds a small handful of new features for their respective platforms.</p>
<p>A watchOS 11.4 update was also published briefly, but it's currently unavailable.</p>
<p>For iPhones and iPads that support Apple Intelligence, the flagship feature in 18.4 is Priority Notifications, which attempts to separate time-sensitive or potentially important notifications from the rest of them so you can see them more easily. The update also brings along the handful of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/face-with-bags-under-eyes-sets-the-tone-for-new-unicode-16-0-emoji-update/">new Unicode 16.0 emoji</a>, a separate app for managing a Vision Pro headset (similar to the companion app for the Apple Watch), and a grab bag of other fixes and minor enhancements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/apple-updates-all-its-operating-systems-brings-apple-intelligence-to-vision-pro/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has gained access "to a payroll system that processes salaries for about 276,000 federal employees across dozens of agencies," despite "objections from senior IT staff who feared it could compromise highly sensitive government personnel information" and lead to cyberattacks, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/doge-musk-federal-payroll.html">reported today</a>.</p>
<p>The system at the Interior Department gives DOGE "visibility into sensitive employee information, such as Social Security numbers, and the ability to more easily hire and fire workers," the NYT wrote, citing people familiar with the matter. DOGE workers had been trying to get access to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System for about two weeks and succeeded over the weekend, the report said.</p>
<p>"The dispute came to a head on Saturday, as the DOGE workers obtained the access and then placed two of the IT officials who had resisted them on administrative leave and under investigation, the people said," according to the NYT report. The agency's CIO and CISO are reportedly under investigation for their "workplace behavior."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/doge-accesses-federal-payroll-system-and-punishes-employees-who-objected/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's a regrettable reality that there is never time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection of such stories. March's list includes fascinating papers on such topics as how the brain responds to speaking Klingon (or Dothraki, or Navi), the discovery of creepy preclassic Salvadoran puppets, the effectiveness of "dazzle camouflage," and how male blue-lined octopuses manage not to be cannibalized by their chosen mates.</p>
<h2>Wind Cave’s rocks fluoresce under black light</h2>

<p>South Dakota's Wind Cave gets its name from the flow of air moving continually through its many passages and equalizing the atmospheric pressure between the air inside and outside—almost like the cave is "breathing." Its rock and mineral formations also boast a unique chemistry that fluoresces when exposed to black light, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RMhmcEpZnGc">talks presented</a> at the <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076978">spring meeting</a> of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. That fluorescence could shed light on how life can thrive in extreme environments, including that of Jupiter's moon, Europa.</p>
<p>University of Northern Iowa astrobiologist Joshua Sebree and several students have been mapping new areas of Wind Cave (as well as other caves in the US), recording the passages, rock formations, minerals, and lifeforms they encounter in the process. They noticed that under UV light, certain parts of Wind Cave took on otherworldly hues, thanks to different concentrations of organic and inorganic fossilized chemical compounds. Those areas seem to indicate where water once flowed, carrying minerals into the cave from the surface 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, according to their analysis of the fluorescent spectra. Sebree et al. found that Wind Cave was likely carved out by waters rich in manganese, producing zebra stripes that glow pink under UV light, revealing the calcites that grew within as a result of those waters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/research-roundup-2400-year-old-clay-puppets-this-is-your-brain-on-klingon/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Back in December, Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/elon-musk-slams-sec-as-agency-threatens-charges-in-twitter-stock-probe/">accused</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of launching a purely politically motivated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/elon-musk-denies-tweets-misled-twitter-investors-ahead-of-purchase/">probe into his Twitter purchase</a>. In a letter from his lawyer, Alex Spiro, Musk alleged that the SEC gave him 48 hours to accept a settlement or face fraud charges. Musk refused to pay the fine, demanding to know "who directed these actions," suspecting either former SEC Chair Gary Gensler or Joe Biden's White House.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Once the SEC lawsuit was <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SEC-v-Musk-1-14-25-Related-Case.pdf">filed</a> in January, Musk's condemnation of the settlement was echoed in his <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879322286291054653">claims </a>that the SEC was "totally broken." These comments seemed to further his feud with the agency following a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/elon-musk-settles-fraud-charge-he-and-tesla-to-pay-40-million-in-penalties/">contentious 2018 Tesla settlement</a> over Musk's tweets that resulted in the Supreme Court declining to hear <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/musk-asks-supreme-court-to-toss-sec-settlement-claims-free-speech-violation/">Musk's arguments against his tweets being monitored</a> by the SEC.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But after Donald Trump issued a February executive order declaring <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/trump-declares-sweeping-power-over-independent-agencies-such-as-fcc-and-sec/">sweeping powers over independent agencies</a>—including the SEC, which was accused of launching politically motivated investigations—it appeared that Musk might instead have been setting up the narrative to possibly get the probe squashed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/two-tweets-muddy-elon-musks-path-to-squashing-sec-probe/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>France's competition regulator fined Apple €150 million, saying the iPhone maker went overboard in its implementation of pop-up messages that let users consent to or reject tracking that third-party applications use for targeted advertising.</p>
<p>The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework used by Apple on iPhones and iPads since 2021 makes the use of third-party applications too complex and hurts small companies that rely on advertising revenue, said a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple">press release</a> today by the Autorité de la concurrence (Competition Authority). The system harms "smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on third-party data collection to finance their business," the agency said.</p>
<p>User consent obtained via the ATA framework "authorizes the application in question to collect user data for targeted advertising purposes," the agency said. "If consent is given, the application can access the Identifier for Advertisers ('IDFA'), the identifier by which each device can be tracked through its use of third-party applications and sites." The French investigation was triggered by a complaint lodged by advertising industry associations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/france-fines-apple-e150m-for-excessive-pop-ups-that-let-users-reject-tracking/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If you're still using a computer you bought during the Clinton administration, interesting news: Crystal Dew World, developers of apps like CrystalDiskInfo and CrystalDiskMark, have released an update to their <a href="https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystalmarkretro/">CrystalMark Retro benchmark</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/retro-gaming/crystalmark-retro-2-0-0-brings-retro-benchmarking-to-systems-from-windows-95-to-windows-11">Tom's Hardware</a>). The most interesting aspect of the update for retro computing enthusiasts is expanded operating system support: the app will now run on Windows 95, Windows 98, and old versions of Windows NT like 3.51 and 4.0. The previous version of the app only went as far back as Windows XP.</p>
<p>The app spits out benchmarking scores for five things: single-core CPU performance, multi-core CPU performance, 2D graphics performance using GDI, 3D graphics performance using OpenGL, and disk speed (broken into four sub-benchmarks for sequential and random read and write performance).</p>
<p>The app will also run on current systems, including 64-bit x86 and Arm-based PCs, and the results database is dominated by those modern systems. But searching by operating system allows you to zero in on those retro results, including nine (as of this writing) <a href="https://crystalmarkdb.com/retro?date=&amp;os_name=Windows+95&amp;display_size=&amp;keyword=">for Windows 95</a>, six for <a href="https://crystalmarkdb.com/retro?date=&amp;os_name=Windows+98&amp;display_size=&amp;keyword=">Windows 98</a>, and five for <a href="https://crystalmarkdb.com/retro?date=&amp;os_name=Windows+NT+3.51&amp;display_size=&amp;keyword=">Windows NT 3.51</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/crystalmark-retro-benchmark-extends-support-all-the-way-back-to-windows-95/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When BMW introduced the original M5 to the European motoring public in 1984, the automaker effectively established a new vehicle segment. By combining the practical and understatedly rakish E28 5-Series with the motorsport-derived six-cylinder engine from the M1 supercar, the automaker had created a “do-it-all” performance machine, a vehicle that could serve as a tasteful and luxurious sedan one moment and a charismatic sports car the next.</p>
<p>It’s a concept that has guided the development of not only subsequent generations of the M5 but also all of the other sports sedans that have dared to go toe to toe with it over the past forty years. For decades, it’s been the benchmark by which all big, fast four-doors have been judged, but after spending a week with the all-new $125,275 G99-generation M5 Touring, I can’t help but wonder if that era is coming to a close.</p>
<p>A range of factors have contributed to this seismic shift. While other automakers have been chasing the M5’s ghost around the Nürburgring, BMW has purposely started to reposition its M Division vehicles as the pinnacle representation of the brand rather than the pinnacle representation of BMW performance. It’s a move that has yielded models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/the-2023-bmw-xm-is-purpose-built-to-get-your-attention/">the XM</a>, a vehicle that certainly has plenty of firepower under the hood but ultimately prioritizes style over substance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-bmw-m5-touring-review-way-more-power-way-too-much-weight/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google released its latest and greatest Gemini AI model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">last week</a>, but it was only made available to paying subscribers. Google has moved with uncharacteristic speed to release Gemini 2.5 Pro (Experimental) for free users, too. The next time you check in with Gemini, you can access most of the new AI's features without a Gemini Advanced subscription.</p>
<p>The Gemini 2.5 branch will eventually replace 2.0, which was only released in late 2024. It supports simulated reasoning, as all Google's models will in the future. This approach to producing an output can avoid some of the common mistakes that AI models have made in the past. We've also been impressed with Gemini 2.5's vibe, which has landed it at the top of the <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot arena leaderboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1906131622736679332">Google says</a> Gemini 2.5 Pro (Experimental) is ready and waiting for free users to try on the web. Simply select the model from the drop-down menu and enter your prompt to watch the "thinking" happen. The model will roll out to the mobile app for free users soon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-new-experimental-gemini-2-5-model-rolls-out-to-free-users/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The ExoMars mission represents Europe's third attempt to land successfully on Mars, and at a cost of more than $1.3 billion. there is a lot riding on its success. But success is far from assured for a mission that has been whipsawed by geopolitical tensions, budget cuts, and an ever-changing architecture over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>The latest news, <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/ExoMars_Rosalind_Franklin_rover_will_have_a_European_landing_platform">announced Sunday</a>, is that Airbus will design and build the lander that will carry the ExoMars down to the surface of Mars. The mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than 2028 on a US rocket. But there have been so many twists and turns in the ExoMars story that it's very difficult to know what will ultimately happen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/four-different-rockets-three-landers-and-two-decades-will-exomars-ever-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>If officials at Isar Aerospace were able to pick the outcome of their first test flight, it wouldn't be this. However, the result has precedent. The first launch of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket in 2006 ended in similar fashion.</p>
<p>"Today, we know twice as much about our launch system as yesterday before launch," Daniel Metzler, Isar's co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://x.com/danielmetzler/status/1906676983758475774">wrote on X</a> early Monday.

              <![CDATA[<p>Big brands are allocating small amounts of their advertising budget to Elon Musk’s X, seeking to avoid being seen as boycotting the social media platform and triggering a public fallout with its billionaire owner.</p>
<p>Multiple marketing executives told the Financial Times that companies have felt pressure to spend a nominal sum on X following Musk’s high-profile role in US President Donald Trump’s administration.</p>
<p>They said Musk’s pursuit of legal action against groups that have stopped advertising since his $44 billion acquisition in late 2022 had also sparked alarm. X last month added about half a dozen more companies to its case including Shell, Nestlé, Pinterest, and Lego.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/big-brands-are-spending-small-sums-on-x-to-stay-out-of-musks-crosshairs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Late last week, President Donald Trump decided to upend the automotive industry by levying <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/auto-industry-braces-for-chaos-as-trump-sets-25-tariff-on-all-imports/">a new 25 percent import tariff on all imported cars</a>, which goes into effect on April 2. An additional 25 percent tariff on car parts is set to go into effect within the next month, which promises to make US-made cars more expensive as well, as many parts and subassemblies used in domestic manufacturing come from suppliers in Canada or Mexico.</p>
<p>During the election campaign (and in the years preceding it), Trump repeatedly claimed that the cost of tariffs would be borne by the exporters. But tariffs don't work that way—they're paid by the importer, at the time of import.</p>
<p>The White House does not appear to have any concerns about this, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/trump-tariffs-automaker-prices-warning-928bc7a9">despite a report</a> in The Wall Street Journal last week claiming that Trump had warned automakers not to pass the costs on to their customers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/trump-on-car-tariffs-i-couldnt-care-less-if-they-raise-prices/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>QLED TV manufacturers have dug themselves into a hole.</p>
<p>After years of companies promising that their quantum dot light-emitting diode TVs use quantum dots (QDs) to boost color, some industry watchers and consumers have recently started questioning whether QLED TVs use QDs at all. Lawsuits have been filed, accusing companies like TCL of using misleading language about whether their QLED TVs actually use QDs.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll break down why new conspiracy theories about QLED TVs are probably overblown. We'll also explore why misleading marketing from TV brands is responsible for customer doubt and how it all sets a bad precedent for the future of high-end displays, including OLED TVs and monitors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/overblown-quantum-dot-conspiracy-theories-make-important-points-about-qled-tvs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone number removed by his employer, Indiana University, and had his homes raided by the FBI. No one knows why.</p>
<p>Xiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's <a href="https://luddy.indiana.edu/">Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering</a>, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.</p>
<p>He has also co-authored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/serious-ios-bug-makes-it-easy-to-steal-users-icloud-passwords/">here</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/ios-and-android-weaknesses-allow-stealthy-pilfering-of-website-credentials/">here</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/flawed-sign-in-services-from-google-and-facebook-imperil-user-acconts/">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/computer-scientist-goes-silent-after-fbi-raid-and-purging-from-university-website/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420580122">has detected the</a> largest organic (carbon-containing) molecules ever found on the red planet. The discovery is one of the most significant findings in the search for evidence of past life on Mars. This is because, on Earth at least, relatively complex, long-chain carbon molecules are involved in biology. These molecules could actually be fragments of fatty acids, which are found in, for example, the membranes surrounding biological cells.</p>
<p>Scientists think that, if life ever emerged on Mars, it was probably microbial in nature. Because microbes are so small, it’s difficult to be definitive about any potential evidence for life found on Mars. Such evidence needs more powerful scientific instruments that are too large to be put on a rover.</p>
<p>The organic molecules found by Curiosity consist of carbon atoms linked in long chains, with other elements bonded to them, like hydrogen and oxygen. They come from a 3.7-billion-year-old rock dubbed Cumberland, encountered by the rover at a presumed dried-up lakebed in Mars’ Gale Crater. Scientists used the <a href="https://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/sam/samiam.html">Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument</a> on the NASA rover to make their discovery.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/nasas-curiosity-rover-has-found-the-longest-chain-carbon-molecules-yet-on-mars/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.</p>
<p>Under any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/">65 million people</a> in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/what-could-possibly-go-wrong-doge-to-rapidly-rebuild-social-security-codebase/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.</p>
<p>In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.</p>
<p>A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”</p>
<p>But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:</p>
<p>“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us">column Kennedy wrote</a> for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”</p>
<p>ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.</p>
<p>“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”</p>
<p>For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html">promoted them with confidence</a>. One campaign was called “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm">Get My Flu Shot</a>.” The agency’s website <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html">told medical providers</a> they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”</p>
<p>Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.</p>
<p>When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’s communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes—nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”</p>
<p>“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”</p>
<p>Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”</p>
<p>The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.</p>
<p>Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.</p>
<p>In late February, for example, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html">forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1</a> bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general US population, they said, was low.</p>
<p>In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the US is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)</p>
<p>The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”</p>
<p>This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”</p>
<p>The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”</p>
<p>Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.</p>
<p>During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated">NPR reported</a> this.</p>
<p>But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.</p>
<p>On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated <a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB">child had died</a> of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/">downplayed the seriousness</a> of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.</p>
<p>As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/">only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the CDC added <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html">an entry on Vitamin A</a> to its measles website for clinicians.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, CNN reported that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html">several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function</a>, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.</p>
<p>Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/">will hinder their ability to respond</a> to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.</p>
<p>Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20 percent of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html">nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children</a> with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html">linger in the air</a> for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.</p>
<p>This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/">rode one of its trains</a> from New York City to Washington, DC.</p>
