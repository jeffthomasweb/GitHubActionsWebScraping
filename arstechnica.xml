              <![CDATA[<p>"We're making new Pebble watches," writes original Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky on <a href="https://repebble.com/">the "rePebble" launch page</a>.</p>
<p>Eight years after Pebble's time as an upstart watchmaker <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/pebble-confirms-fitbit-sale-hardware-is-dead-software-in-maintenance-mode/">came to an end</a>, Migicovsky says that he's working with a small team on "a Pebble-like smartwatch that runs open source PebbleOS." There should be some new features, but new watches would stay "true to the core Pebble vision." With enough signups, the site claims, that watch gets built.</p>
<p>Pebble, launched in 2012, was one of the first smartphone-era smartwatches, selling 2 million models and serving as an early <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/pebble-bumps-its-week-old-kickstarter-with-the-pebble-time-steel/">success story for hardware crowdfunding</a>. After the relatively <a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/why-pebble-failed-d7be937c6232">inexperienced hardware firm</a> ran into funding gaps and stiff competition from the Apple Watch, Pebble stopped making its own watches after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pebble-a-2013-smartwatch-updated-to-work-with-2022-pixel-7/#:~:text=acquired%20in%20a%20fire%20sale%20by%20Fitbit%20in%20December%202016">an IP-only sale to Fitbit in 2016</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/google-closes-the-fitbit-acquisition-pledges-to-not-use-data-for-ads/">Google acquired Fitbit in 2021</a>, gaining some original Pebble workers as well, who then helped <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/33398/rebble-with-a-cause-how-pebble-watches-got-their-amazing-afterlife">the Rebble project</a> launch replacement web services for the watch and kept the watch working on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pebble-a-2013-smartwatch-updated-to-work-with-2022-pixel-7/">the newest Android phones</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/pebble-smartwatch-founder-is-launching-a-smaller-scale-open-source-reboot/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Retro game enthusiasts may already be acquainted with Analogue, a company that designs and manufactures updated versions of classic consoles that can play original games but also be hooked up to modern televisions and monitors. The most recent of its announcements is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/250-analogue-3d-will-play-all-your-n64-cartridges-in-4k-early-next-year/">the Analogue 3D</a>, a console designed to play Nintendo 64 cartridges.</p>
<p>Now, a company called Retro Remake is reigniting the console wars of the 1990s with its <a href="https://retroremake.co/pages/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89">SuperStation one</a>, a new-old game console designed to play original Sony PlayStation games and work with original accessories like controllers and memory cards. Currently available <a href="https://retroremake.co/products/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89">as a $180 pre-order</a>, Retro Remake expects the consoles to ship no later than Q4 of 2025.</p>
<p>The base console is modeled on the redesigned PSOne console from mid-2000, released late in the console's lifecycle to appeal to buyers on a budget who couldn't afford a then-new PlayStation 2. The Superstation one includes two PlayStation controller ports and memory card slots on the front, plus a USB-A port. But there are lots of modern amenities on the back, including a USB-C port for power, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port for new TVs, DIN10 and VGA ports that support analog video output, and an Ethernet port. Other analog video outputs, including component and RCA outputs, are located on the sides behind small covers. The console also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-fpga-powered-retro-console-re-creates-the-playstation-one-cd-rom-drive-optional/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As federal lawmakers prepare to decide whether anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. should be the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, pediatricians from around the country are making emotional pleas to protect and support lifesaving immunizations.</p>
<p>T<a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31170/AAP-using-member-stories-to-educate-federal?autologincheck=redirected">he American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has assembled nearly 200 stories</a> and dozens of testimonials on the horrors of vaccine-preventable deaths and illnesses that pediatricians have encountered over their careers. The testimonials have been shared with two Senate committees that will hold hearings later this week: the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP).</p>

Some have recalled stories of patients who became ill with devastating diseases before vaccines were available to prevent them, while others shared more recent experiences as vaccine misinformation spread and vaccination rates slipped.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/dead-babies-critically-ill-kids-pediatricians-make-moving-plea-for-vaccines/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As is custom, Apple rolled out software updates to all its platforms at once today. All users should now have access to the public releases of iOS 18.3, macOS Sequoia 15.3, watchOS 11.3, iPadOS 15.3, tvOS 15.3, and visionOS 2.3.</p>
<p>Also, as usual, the iOS update is the meatiest of the bunch. Most of the changes relate to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/despite-unforced-errors-the-future-of-apple-intelligence-could-be-bright/">Apple Intelligence</a>, a suite of features built on deep learning models. The first Apple Intelligence features were introduced in iOS 18, with additional ones added in iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2</p>
<p>iOS 18.3 doesn't add any significant new features to Apple Intelligence—instead, it tweaks what's already there. Whereas Apple Intelligence was opt-in in previous OS versions, it is now on by default in iOS 18.3 on supported devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/ios-18-3-disables-controversial-ai-generated-news-app-notifications/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has dropped the previous administration's proposal to ban bulk billing deals that require tenants to pay for a specific provider's Internet service.</p>
<p>In March 2024, then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400915A1.pdf">proposed</a> a ban on arrangements in which "tenants are required to pay for broadband, cable, and satellite service provided by a specific communications provider, even if they do not wish to take the service or would prefer to use another provider."</p>
<p>Rosenworcel's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was opposed by Internet providers and sat on the FCC's list of items on circulation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241227161434/https://www.fcc.gov/items-on-circulation">throughout 2024</a> without any final vote, despite the commission having a 3–2 Democratic majority at the time. Carr, who was elevated to the chairmanship by President Trump, emptied the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/items-on-circulation">list of items</a> under consideration by commissioners on Friday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/fcc-chair-nixes-plan-to-boost-broadband-competition-in-apartment-buildings/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Energy Information Agency has now <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/">released data</a> on the performance of the US's electric grid over the first 11 months of 2024 and will be adding the final month soon (and a month is very little time for anything to change significantly in the data). The biggest story in the data is the dramatic growth of solar energy, with a 30 percent increase in generation in a single year, which will allow solar and wind combined to overtake coal in 2024.</p>
<p>But the US energy demand saw an increase of nearly 3 percent, which is roughly double the amount of additional solar generation. Should electric use continue to grow at a similar pace, renewable production will have to continue to grow dramatically for a few years before it can simply cover the added demand.</p>
<h2>Going for the Sun</h2>
<p>In the first 11 months of 2024, the US saw its electrical use grow by 2.8 percent, or roughly 100 Terawatt-hours. While there's typically year-to-year variation in use due to weather-driven demand, the US's consumption has largely been flat since the early 2000s. There are plenty of reasons to expect increased demand, including the growth of data centers and the electrification of heating and transit, but so far, there's been no clear sign of it in the data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/us-solar-boom-continues-but-its-offset-by-rising-power-use/">Read full article</a></p>

    <div class="caption-content">
      <em>Alien: Earth</em>, an all-new original series, premieres this summer on Hulu and with Hulu On Disney+.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>FX/Hulu dropped a surprise short teaser for its upcoming spinoff series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Earth"><em>Alien: Earth</em></a>, during the AFC Championship game last night. What makes it intriguing is the way it's shot entirely from a Xenomorph's point of view as the creature races through a spaceship's corridor while a "containment breached!" warning repeats. The final shot said the spaceship is headed on a crash course toward Earth.</p>
<p>The official premise is short and sweet: "When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat." We know very little yet about the specifics of the series other than that it is set two years before the events of the first film, <em>Alien</em> (1979).</p>
<p>It's promising that showrunner Noah Hawley <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/noah-hawley-alien-series-prometheus-backstory-not-useful-1235871454/">has said</a> that the style and mythology will be closer to that film, rather than <em>Prometheus</em> (2012) or <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, both of which were also prequels. “In the prequels, Ridley [Scott] made the technology thousands of years more advanced than the technology of <em>Alien</em>, which is supposed to take place in those movies’ future," <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/noah-hawley-alien-series-prometheus-backstory-not-useful-1235871454/">he said last January</a>. "There’s something about that that doesn’t really compute for me. I prefer the retro-futurism of the first two films, and so that’s the choice I’ve made—there’s no holograms. The convenience of that beautiful Apple Store technology is not available to me.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/alien-earth-teaser-gives-us-xenomorphs-pov/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was apparently a busy weekend for key players involved in Donald Trump's efforts to make a deal to save TikTok.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most appealing option for ByteDance could be if Trump blessed a merger between TikTok and Perplexity AI—a San Francisco-based AI search company worth about $9 billion that appears to view a TikTok video content acquisition as a path to compete with major players like Google and OpenAI.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, Perplexity AI submitted a revised merger proposal to TikTok-owner ByteDance, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/26/perplexity-tiktok-revised-merger-proposal.html">reviewed</a> by CNBC, which sources <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-trump-perplexity-87988733973760927bb5681f7de9b9af">told AP News</a> included feedback from the Trump administration.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-may-leave-tiktoks-algorithm-under-bytedances-control/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Broadcom's ownership of VMware has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">discouraged many of its customers</a>, as companies are displeased with how the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/as-firms-abandon-vmware-broadcom-is-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/">trillion-dollar firm</a> has run the virtualization business since buying it in November 2023. Many have discussed reducing or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/">eliminating ties with the company</a>.</p>
<p>Now, over a year after the acquisition, the pressure is on for customers to start committing to a VMware subscription, forego VMware support, or move on from VMware technologies. The decision is complex, with long-term implications no matter which way a customer goes.</p>
<p>Ars Technica spoke with an IT vendor manager who has been using VMware's vSphere since the early 2000s. The employee, who works for a global food manufacturing firm with about 5,500 employees, asked to keep their name and company anonymous due to privacy concerns for the business.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/01/a-long-costly-road-ahead-for-customers-abandoning-broadcoms-vmware/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>DAYTONA, Florida—This might make you feel old, but the Mazda MX-5 Miata just turned 35. Still in its fourth generation—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/07/mazda-mx-5-miata-still-brilliant-after-almost-30-years/">better known to Miata nerds as the "ND"</a>—this small, affordable, lightweight sports car is the perfect antidote to, well, just about everything else on the roads. And to celebrate this latest milestone, Mazda has created a new special anniversary edition, which it unveiled at this past weekend's Rolex 24 at Daytona.</p>
<p>When the Miata debuted in 1989, it was something of a game-changer. Inspired by classic European roadsters like those built by MG and Alfa Romeo, it was small, lithe, and, most importantly, reliable. It didn't hurt that it looked nice and was great to drive.</p>
<p>It's also been something of a hit among amateur racers—Mazda is proud that each weekend, more Miatas are on track than any other make of car. That goes some way to explaining why Mazda chose this year's Rolex 24 at Daytona to reveal the new 35th Anniversary Edition—the MX-5 Cup series is probably IMSA's most exciting support series.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/mazda-celebrates-35-years-of-the-mx-5-with-anniversary-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Nvidia stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-falls-10percent-in-premarket-trading-as-chinas-deepseek-triggers-global-tech-sell-off.html">dove 17 percent</a> amid worries over the rise of Chinese AI company <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek</a>, whose R1 reasoning model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">stunned industry observers</a> last week by challenging American AI supremacy with a low-cost, freely available AI model, and whose AI assistant app <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/chinese-ai-startup-deepseek-overtakes-chatgpt-apple-app-store-2025-01-27/">jumped to the top</a> of the iPhone App Store's "Free Apps" category over the weekend, overtaking ChatGPT.</p>
<h2>What’s the big deal about DeepSeek?</h2>
<p>The drama started around January 20 when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">announced R1</a>, a new simulated reasoning (SR) model that it claimed could match OpenAI's o1 in reasoning benchmarks. Like o1, R1 is trained to work through a simulated chain of thought process before providing an answer, which can potentially improve the accuracy or usefulness of the AI models' outputs for some types of questions posed by the user.</p>
<p>That first part wasn't too surprising since other AI companies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">like Google</a> are hot on the heels of OpenAI with their own simulated reasoning models. In addition, OpenAI itself has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">announced an upcoming SR model</a> (dubbed "o3") that can surpass o1 in performance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/deepseek-spooks-american-tech-industry-as-it-tops-the-apple-app-store/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If one were to observe that I have written critically about Blue Origin over the last half-decade, they would not be wrong.</p>
<p>The reality is that the space company founded by Jeff Bezos has underperformed. Its chief executive for most of this time, Bob Smith, was poorly regarded by his employees. He brought the worst of "old space" tendencies to Blue Origin from Honeywell. And under Smith's leadership, Blue was litigious, slow, and unproductive.</p>
<p>Frankly, it was a bad look for Bezos. He was pumping something on the order of $2 billion a year into Blue Origin for what, exactly? Lawsuits against NASA? Jokes about BE-4 rocket engine delays?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/01/after-the-success-of-new-glenn-blue-origin-to-focus-on-launching-frequently/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Jeep provided a night in a hotel so Ars could attend the Wagoneer S first drive. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>This year marks the return of the Jeep Wagoneer, which formerly served as a more luxurious version of the Cherokee but now hits the market as Jeep's first full EV. The challenge? How to merge the modern electric lifestyle with the outdoorsy, rugged ethos that defines Jeep as a brand, alongside the more recent addition of the internal-combustion Grand Wagoneer SUV's enormous luxury.</p>
<p>First of all, the new Wagoneer S wound up much smaller in person than I expected. The overall profile falls more in line with the shape of mid-size electric crossovers including the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/kias-new-ev6-electric-crossover-goes-straight-to-the-head-of-the-pack/">Kia EV6</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-chevrolet-equinox-ev-shows-gm-can-make-a-car-for-the-masses/">Chevrolet Equinox</a>, and of course, Tesla's Model Y. But the interior volume belies that relatively compact exterior, with plenty of space for me at 6-foot 1-inch (185 cm) to sit comfortably in both the front and rear seats. Total cargo volumes of 30.6 cubic feet (866 L) with the second row up and 61 cubic feet (1,727 L) with the second row folded flat end up mattering less than the large floor footprint, because the height used to calculate those measurements drops with the low sloping roofline and rear window.</p>
<p>Much of the interior space can be attributed to packaging of the Wagoneer EV's battery. Rather than going for all-out kilowatt-hours in a dedicated skateboard layout, Jeep instead used the Stellantis group's STLA Large platform, in this case stuffed with a 100.5-kWh lithium-ion pack built on 400 V architecture. That's enough for an EPA-estimated 303 miles of range (487 km), a solid figure but not a seriously impressive efficiency stat. In comparison, the world-beating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-lucid-air-pure-review-lower-weight-better-steering-amazing-efficiency/">Lucid Air Pure RWD</a> manages about 40 percent more range per kilowatt-hour, and a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-2025-polestar-3-is-a-torque-vectoring-suv-thats-fun-to-drive/">Polestar 3 AWD</a> does about 18 percent worse. Claimed DC fast charge times of 23 minutes for a 20-80 percent top up, or 100 miles (160 km) in 10 minutes, similarly get the job done without standing out from the pack.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/jeeps-first-battery-ev-is-not-what-we-expected-the-2024-wagoneer-s/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's a truism at this point to say that Americans own a lot of guns. Case in point: This week, a fire chief in rural Alabama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/fire-chief-shot-deer-alabama.html">stopped to help a driver who had just hit a deer</a>. The two men walked up the driveway of a nearby home. For reasons that remain unclear, a man came out of the house with a gun and started shooting. This was a bad idea on many levels, but most practically because <em>both the fire chief and the driver were also armed</em>. Between the three of them, everyone got shot, the fire chief died, and the man who lived in the home was charged with murder.</p>
<p>But despite the ease of acquiring legal weapons, a robust black market still exists to traffic in things like "ghost guns" (no serial numbers) and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdok/media/1366621/dl?inline">machine gun converters</a> (which make a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic). According to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-atfs-publication-final-volume-national-firearms-commerce-and">major new report</a> released this month by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, there was a 1,600 percent increase in the use of privately made "ghost guns" during crimes between 2017 and 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, the seizure of machine gun converters also increased by 784 percent.</p>
<p>Ars Technica has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/with-founder-out-on-bail-whats-next-for-3d-gun-printer-defense-distributed/">covered these issues for years</a>, since both "ghost guns" and machine gun converters can be produced using 3D-printed parts, the schematics for which are now widely available online. But you can know about an issue and still be surprised when local prosecutors start talking about black market trafficking rings, inept burglary schemes, murder—and 3D printing operations being run out of a local apartment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/3d-printed-ghost-gun-ring-comes-to-my-community-and-leaves-a-man-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Nvidia last dropped Game Ready driver support for older GPUs in 2021.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia is launching the first volley of RTX 50-series GPUs based on its new Blackwell architecture, starting with the RTX 5090 and working downward from there. The company also appears to be winding down support for a few of its older GPU architectures, according to these <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html">CUDA release notes</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpu-drivers/nvidia-starts-phasing-out-maxwell-pascal-and-volta-gpus-geforce-driver-support-status-unclear">Tom's Hardware</a>.</p>
<p>The release notes say that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPU architectures "is considered feature-complete and will be frozen in an upcoming release." While all of these architectures—which collectively cover GeForce GPUs from the old GTX 700 series all the way up through 2016's GTX 1000 series, plus a couple of Quadro and Titan workstation cards—are still currently supported by Nvidia's December Game Ready driver package, the end of new CUDA feature support suggests that these GPUs will eventually be dropped from these driver packages soon.</p>
<p>It's common for Nvidia and AMD to drop support for another batch of architectures all at once every few years; Nvidia last dropped support for older cards <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-drops-kepler-windows-7-8-8.1-support/">in 2021</a>, and AMD dropped support for several prominent GPUs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-pulls-back-on-drivers-for-aging-but-popular-graphics-cards-and-igpus/">in 2023</a>. Both companies maintain a separate driver branch for some of their older cards, but releases usually only happen every few months, and they focus on security updates, not on providing new features or performance optimizations for new games.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-winding-down-support-for-older-gpus-including-the-legendary-750-ti-and-1060/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Anthropic announced <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-citations-api">Citations</a>, a new API feature that helps Claude models avoid confabulations (also called hallucinations) by linking their responses directly to source documents. The feature lets developers add documents to Claude's context window, enabling the model to automatically cite specific passages it uses to generate answers.</p>
<p>"When Citations is enabled, the API processes user-provided source documents (PDF documents and plaintext files) by chunking them into sentences," Anthropic says. "These chunked sentences, along with user-provided context, are then passed to the model with the user's query."</p>
<p>The company describes several potential uses for Citations, including summarizing case files with source-linked key points, answering questions across financial documents with traced references, and powering support systems that cite specific product documentation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-adds-citations-in-bid-to-avoid-confabulating-ai-models/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The founder of an AI startup in San Francisco was indicted this week for allegedly conspiring with his wife for six years to defraud investors out of $60 million.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/founder-and-former-ceo-san-francisco-technology-company-and-attorney-indicted-years">press release</a> from the US Attorney's Office in the Northern District of California, Alexander Beckman—founder of GameOn Technology (now known as ON Platform)—and Valerie Lau Beckman—an attorney hired by GameOn who later became his wife—were charged with 25 counts, including conspiracy, wire fraud, securities fraud, identity theft, and other offenses. Lau also faces one charge of obstruction of justice after allegedly deleting evidence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If convicted, the maximum penalties for Beckman, 41, could exceed 60 years and for Lau, 38, potentially 80 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/ai-startup-founder-allegedly-faked-profits-to-trick-investors-buy-fancy-houses/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The game of chess has long been central to computer science and AI-related research, most notably in IBM's Deep Blue in the 1990s and, more recently, AlphaZero. But the game is about more than algorithms, according to <a href="https://www.quanturb.com/about-me">Marc Barthelemy</a>, a physicist at the Paris-Saclay University in France, with layers of depth arising from the psychological complexity conferred by player strategies.</p>
<p>Now, Barthelmey has taken things one step further by publishing a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014314">new paper</a> in the journal Physical Review E that treats chess as a complex system, producing a handy metric that can help predict the proverbial "tipping points" in chess matches.</p>
<p>In his paper, Barthelemy cites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_R%C3%A9ti">Richard Reti</a>, an early 20th-century chess master who gave a series of lectures in the 1920s on developing a scientific understanding of chess. It was an ambitious program involving collecting empirical data, constructing typologies, and devising laws based on those typologies, but Reti's insights fell by the wayside as advances in computer science came to dominate the field. That's understandable. "With its simple rules yet vast strategic depth, chess provides an ideal platform for developing and testing algorithms in AI, machine learning, and decision theory," Barthelemy writes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/complexity-physics-finds-crucial-tipping-points-in-chess-games/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last year, a study highlighted that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/your-doctors-office-could-be-reading-your-blood-pressure-all-wrong/">your doctor's office might be taking your blood pressure wrong</a>. The current best practice is to take seated blood pressure readings with a detailed protocol: Patients must not eat, drink, or exercise for 30 minutes prior; they must have an empty bladder and sit calmly for five minutes prior to the first reading; they must sit with their feet uncrossed and flat on the floor; their back should be supported; and—a big one that's often overlooked—they must keep the arm to be measured resting on a flat surface at the height of their heart, not higher or lower.</p>
<p>While the setup is often different from what happens in a bustling medical office, a new study blows away quibbles over protocol and suggests that even when done perfectly, the method is second-rate. We shouldn't be sitting at all when we take our blood pressure—we should be lying down.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2828914">the study, published in JAMA Cardiology and led by researchers at Harvard</a>, blood pressure readings measured while lying down were significantly better at indicating risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and death than were seated blood pressure readings alone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/for-real-we-may-be-taking-blood-pressure-readings-all-wrong/">Read full article</a></p>
