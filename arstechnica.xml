                            <![CDATA[<p>Multiple whistleblowers alleged that DOGE uploaded a highly sensitive Social Security Administration (SSA) database to an unmonitored cloud environment, according to a <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/DOGE_REPORT_FINAL_7.pdf">report</a> by Senate Democratic staff. The staff report describes an investigation into DOGE activities at three agencies, including a site visit at the General Services Administration (GSA) in which DOGE officials appeared to be hiding certain areas from view.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/doge-accused-of-copying-entire-social-security-database-to-insecure-cloud-system/">reported last month,</a> then-SSA Chief Data Officer Chuck Borges alleged that DOGE officials created "a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight." At least one other whistleblower has apparently made the same allegation.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers, including Borges, alleged "that Edward Coristine, the 19-year-old DOGE staffer who was previously fired from a job for leaking company data to a competitor, and other DOGE personnel had been granted permission to move highly sensitive SSA data into an unmonitored cloud environment," the Senate Democratic report said. "The whistleblowers said that DOGE has uploaded a live copy of NUMIDENT, which contains highly sensitive personal data on anyone who has held a social security number, including every American. This includes social security numbers (SSNs), place and date of birth, work permit status, and parents' names, among other sensitive personal information, for all Americans, to a cloud environment."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/senate-staff-probes-doge-finds-locked-doors-and-windows-covered-with-trash-bags/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Dream Chaser spaceplane, which has been under development for two decades, now seems like it might be further than ever from taking flight.</p>
<p>On Thursday, NASA, confirming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/is-the-dream-chaser-space-plane-ever-going-to-launch-into-orbit/">an earlier</a><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/is-the-dream-chaser-space-plane-ever-going-to-launch-into-orbit/"> Ars Technica</a><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/is-the-dream-chaser-space-plane-ever-going-to-launch-into-orbit/"> report</a>, said the first flight of the winged spacecraft will no longer berth with the International Space Station. Rather, the space agency said, the Dream Chaser program would be "best served" by a free flight demonstration.</p>
<p>"Development of new space transportation systems is difficult and can take longer than what’s originally planned," said Dana Weigel, manager of NASA's International Space Station Program, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/nasa-sierra-space-modify-commercial-resupply-services-contract/">in a news release</a>. "As NASA and its partners look toward space station deorbit in 2030, this mutually agreed to decision enables testing and verification to continue on Dream Chaser, as well as demonstrating the capabilities of the spaceplane for future resupply missions in low Earth orbit."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/sierras-dream-chaser-is-starting-to-resemble-a-nightmare/">Read full article</a></p>

I thought it hilarious; my aging and extremely "proper" great aunt—God rest her soul—did not, and at one Thanksgiving dinner, she let me know. Chastened, I never used a whoopee cushion again. Nor, as the decades passed, did I think much more about the possible humor value of fake farts.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After the posting—and apparent editing—of a job opening spotted this week, it's expected that Amazon will bring its homegrown operating system to Fire TV devices this year.</p>
<p>Most of Amazon’s Fire-branded devices, which include tablets, currently run some version of Fire OS, which is an Android fork based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). For years, Fire OS’s reliance on AOSP has resulted in Amazon devices coming out with older software, such as 2024’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVDN4QS6">Amazon Fire HD 8</a> tablet, which came out with Fire OS 8, which is <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tablets/fire-os-8.html#:~:text=Fire%20OS%208%20incorporates%20updates%20from%20Android,(API%2029)%20and%20Android%2011%20(API%2030).">based on</a> 2020’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/android-11-the-ars-technica-review/">Android 11</a>.</p>
<p>Some devices already run Amazon’s proprietary software, reportedly codenamed Vega OS. The current <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/amazon-echo-hub-vega-os">Echo Hub</a> smart home control panel, <a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2023-11/amazon-vega-os/">Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen)</a> smart home display, and <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-charges-ahead-with-its-in-house-vega-os-on-yet-another-new-device/">Echo Spot</a> smart speaker all run an OS based on the Linux 5.16 kernel, per details in Amazon’s <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/amazon-echo-hub-vega-os">source code notice</a> for Alexa devices. However, Amazon has never publicly acknowledged that the OS exists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/amazon-fire-tv-devices-expected-to-ditch-android-for-linux-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Speaking at the German industry's Space Congress event in Berlin, Pistorius said the country must ramp up its investment in space security to counter threats from Russia and China, which he said have rapidly expanded their capacity for space warfare.</p>
<p>"They can jam, blind, manipulate, or kinetically destroy satellites," Pistorius said. "There are no borders or continents in space.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pulse">announced</a> ChatGPT Pulse, a new "push" feature that generates personalized daily updates for users without having to ask each time. The preview feature, available now for Pro subscribers on mobile, marks OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/chatgpt-becomes-more-siri-like-with-new-scheduled-tasks-feature/">latest attempt</a> to make ChatGPT proactive rather than reactive, with the AI model conducting overnight research to deliver morning updates based on user history and connected apps. OpenAI calls it "personalized research and timely updates that appear regularly to keep you informed."</p>
<p>ChatGPT Pulse works by analyzing a user's chat history, saved preferences, and optional connections to Gmail and Google Calendar each night. The next morning, users receive visual "cards" (small illustrated squares with topic summaries that can be expanded for detail) containing updates on topics the model determines are relevant, such as project follow-ups, dinner suggestions, or travel recommendations. Users can provide feedback through thumbs up or down ratings and request specific topics through a "curate" button.</p>
<p>OpenAI says that rather than waiting for users to initiate conversations, ChatGPT now attempts to deliver information preemptively using what OpenAI calls "asynchronous research," essentially having the model generate queries and responses overnight using traditional methods. Updates appear once daily and disappear after 24 hours unless users save them or ask follow-up questions, which converts them into standard chat conversations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/chatgpt-pulse-delivers-morning-updates-based-on-your-chat-history/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The proposed federal budget <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trumps-2026-budget-proposal-crippling-cuts-for-science-across-the-board/">would see drastic cuts</a> made to most of the agencies that fund science. The sheer magnitude of the cuts—including a 40 percent slashing of money going to the National Institutes of Health—would do severe harm to biomedical researchers and the industries that serve or rely on them. And, ultimately, that is likely to do harm to all of us.</p>
<p>In today's issue of Science, some researchers have attempted to put numbers on those indirect effects that fall within that "ultimately" category. They've identified which grants wouldn't have been funded had similar cuts been made earlier in this century and tracked the impact that likely had on drug patents. Their conclusion: Development of roughly half the newly approved drugs relied on work that was funded by a grant that would need to be cut.</p>
<h2>From grants to drugs</h2>
<p>It's uncertain whether the proposed budget cuts will go through. At the moment, Congress is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/analysis-funding-science-at-past-levels-is-only-half-the-battle/">looking to fund most science agencies</a> at levels similar to their current budgets. Should cuts eventually happen, then it's also difficult to predict how they'll be spread among the more than 20 institutes that make up the NIH (a number that the administration also wants to see reduced via consolidation). So, the researchers make a big simplifying assumption: Every institute within the NIH will take a 40 percent hit to its budget.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/study-planned-budget-cuts-would-hurt-drug-development-badly/">Read full article</a></p>

In fact, at least 1 in 10 retail investors now consult ChatGPT or other AI chatbots for stock-picking advice, according to a Reuters report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-what-stocks-should-i-buy-ai-fuels-boom-robo-advisory-market-2025-09-25/">published</a> Thursday.</p>
<p>Data from a survey by trading platform eToro of 11,000 retail investors worldwide suggests that 13 percent of individual investors already use AI tools like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini for stock selection, while about half say they would consider using these tools for portfolio decisions.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading">algorithmic trading</a>, where computers automatically execute thousands of trades per second, investors are using ChatGPT as an advisory tool in place of human experts. They type questions, read the AI model's analysis, and then manually decide whether to place trades through their brokers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/experts-urge-caution-about-using-chatgpt-to-pick-stocks/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In letters sent to Amazon, Meta, Apple, Google, and Microsoft—among some of the largest sponsors of H-1B visas—Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) requested "information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees."</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple seems determined to leave a persistent gap between the cameras of its Pro iPhones and the regular ones, but most other features—the edge-to-edge-screen design with FaceID, the Dynamic Island, OLED display panels, Apple Intelligence compatibility—eventually trickle down to the regular-old iPhone after a generation or two of timed exclusivity.</p>
<p>One feature that Apple has been particularly slow to move down the chain is ProMotion, the branding the company uses to refer to a screen that can refresh up to 120 times per second rather than the more typical 60 times per second. ProMotion isn't a necessary feature, but since Apple added it to the iPhone 13 Pro in 2021, the extra fluidity and smoothness, plus the always-on display feature, have been big selling points for the Pro phones.</p>
<p>This year, ProMotion finally comes to the regular-old iPhone 17, years after midrange and even lower-end Android phones made the swap to 90 or 120 Hz display panels. And it sounds like a small thing, but the screen upgrade—together with a doubling of base storage from 128GB to 256GB—makes the gap between this year's iPhone and iPhone Pro feel narrower than it's been in a long time. If you jumped on the Pro train a few years back and don't want to spend that much again, this might be a good year to switch back. If you've ever been tempted by the Pro but never made the upgrade, you can continue not doing that and miss out on relatively little.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/review-apples-injects-just-the-right-amount-of-pro-into-the-regular-iphone-17/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amazon has agreed to settle a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit accusing the e-commerce giants of tricking customers into signing up for Prime and then making it frustratingly hard to cancel.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-secures-historic-25-billion-settlement-against-amazon">press release</a> Thursday, the FTC confirmed that, pending court approval, Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty and provide $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million customers "harmed by their deceptive Prime enrollment practices." Former FTC chair Lina Khan initiated the lawsuit, accusing customers of trapping customers in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-sues-amazon-over-4-page-6-click-15-option-prime-cancellation-process/">“labyrinthine” Prime cancellation process</a> the company named after Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>.</p>
<p>The civil penalty, the FTC noted, is "the largest ever in a case involving an FTC rule violation," and the refunds to customers are "the second-highest restitution award ever obtained by FTC action."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-agrees-to-make-canceling-prime-easy-will-refund-customers-1-5b/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Generative AI systems that create text, images, audio, and even video are becoming commonplace. In the same way AI models output those data types, they can also be used to output robot actions. That's the foundation of Google DeepMind's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/googles-origami-folding-ai-brain-may-power-new-wave-of-humanoid-robots/">Gemini Robotics</a> project, which has announced a pair of new models that work together to create the first robots that "think" before acting. Traditional LLMs have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/researchers-find-llms-are-bad-at-logical-inference-good-at-fluent-nonsense/">their own set of problems</a>, but the introduction of simulated reasoning did significantly upgrade their capabilities, and now the same could be happening with AI robotics.</p>
<p>The team at DeepMind contends that generative AI is a uniquely important technology for robotics because it unlocks general functionality. Current robots have to be trained intensively on specific tasks, and they are typically bad at doing anything else. "Robots today are highly bespoke and difficult to deploy, often taking many months in order to install a single cell that can do a single task," said Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind.</p>
<p>The fundamentals of generative systems make AI-powered robots more general. They can be presented with entirely new situations and workspaces without needing to be reprogrammed. DeepMind's current approach to robotics relies on two models: one that thinks and one that does.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/google-deepmind-unveils-its-first-thinking-robotics-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>iOS 26 came out last week, bringing a new look and interface alongside some new capabilities and updates aimed squarely at iPhone power users.</p>
<p>We gave you our main <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/ios-26-review-a-practical-yet-playful-update/">iOS 26 review</a> last week. This time around, we're taking a look at some of the updates targeted at people who rely on their iPhones for much more than making phone calls and browsing the Internet. Many of these features rely on Apple Intelligence, meaning they're only as reliable and helpful as Apple's generative AI (and only available on newer iPhones, besides). Other adjustments are smaller but could make a big difference to people who use their phone to do work tasks.</p>
<h2>Reminders attempt to get smarter</h2>
<p>The Reminders app gets the Apple Intelligence treatment in iOS 26, with the AI primarily focused on making it easier to organize content within Reminders lists. Lines in Reminders lists are often short, quickly jotted-down blurbs rather than lengthy, detailed complex instructions. With this in mind, it’s easy to see how the AI can sometimes lack enough information in order to perform certain tasks, like logically grouping different errands into sensible sections.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/reviewing-ios-26-for-power-users-reminders-preview-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of rivalries in the US launch industry. People who build big and brawny machines tend to have egos to match. And if you chat up the senior executives of these rocket companies offline, they are often more than happy to say derogatory things about their competitors.</p>
<p>But rarely are such sentiments expressed in public, without filter.</p>
<p>Chris Kemp, the chief executive officer of Astra, apparently didn't get the memo about playing nice. Kemp made some spicy remarks at the Berkeley Space Symposium 2025 earlier this month, billed as the largest undergraduate aerospace event at the university (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLCf88Qw8wc">see video of the talk</a>). He provided an overview of Astra's successes and failures, and generally sought to make a good impression on prospective interns at the company, and future employees. The university is only a few miles away from the company's Bay Area headquarters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/astras-chris-kemp-woke-up-one-recent-morning-and-chose-violence/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As many as 2 million Cisco devices are susceptible to an actively exploited zero-day that can remotely crash or execute code on vulnerable systems.</p>
<p>Cisco <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snmp-x4LPhte">said Wednesday</a> that the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-20352, was present in all supported versions of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE, the operating system that powers a wide variety of the company’s networking devices. The vulnerability can be exploited by low-privileged users to create a denial-of-service attack or by higher-privileged users to execute code that runs with unfettered root privileges. It carries a severity rating of 7.7 out of a possible 10.</p>
<h2>Exposing SNMP to the Internet? Yep</h2>
<p>“The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) became aware of successful exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild after local Administrator credentials were compromised,” Wednesday’s advisory stated. “Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/as-many-as-2-million-cisco-devices-affected-by-actively-exploited-0-day/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/ford-will-return-to-f1-in-2026-as-an-engine-builder/">Formula 1</a> might be riding high these days on a wave of interest not seen since the 1960s, but the <em>Drive to Survive</em> effect has been felt elsewhere in the world of motorsport. Endurance racing like the 24 Hours of Le Mans or the Rolex 24 at Daytona has seen record crowds over the last few years, and a large part of that is down to the sports prototype class, exemplified by cars from the likes of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/the-499p-meet-ferraris-beautiful-new-le-mans-hybrid-prototype/">Ferrari</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/we-peek-inside-porsches-private-le-mans-race-car-test/">Porsche</a>. And soon, we can add Ford to the list.</p>
<p>Currently, eight different manufacturers are competing against each other in the World Endurance Championship's Hypercar class: Alpine, Aston Martin, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota. More are on the way—<a href="https://racer.com/2025/07/24/genesis-hypercar-readies-testing-program">Genesis</a> arrives next year, <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a63624159/ford-lmdh-race-car-le-mans/">and at the beginning of the year</a>, Ford announced that it, too, was joining the fray, in 2027. Today, the Blue Oval revealed some more details about the project.</p>
<h2>What’s a hypercar?</h2>
<p>Compared to the road car-derived machines that race in the GT3 category, the vehicles that contest for overall victory in the Hypercar class are purpose-built prototypes, just for racing. Because endurance racing often has to be needlessly complicated for the sake of being complicated, the Hypercar class is actually made up of a mix of vehicles designed to two different technical rule sets that are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/how-does-le-mans-ensure-a-fair-race-between-different-makes-of-car/">performance balanced to create a level playing field</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/ford-decides-to-run-its-le-mans-program-in-house-racing-in-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>A lot of the stuff we use today is largely made by robots—arms with multiple degrees of freedom positioned along conveyor belts that move in a spectacle of precisely synchronized motions. All this motion is usually programmed by hand, which can take hundreds to thousands of hours. Google’s DeepMind team has developed an AI system called RoboBallet that lets manufacturing robots figure out what to do on their own.</p>
<h2>Traveling salesmen</h2>
<p>Planning what manufacturing robots should do to get their jobs done efficiently is really hard to automate. You need to solve both task allocation and scheduling—deciding which task should be done by which robot in what order. It’s like the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling salesman problem</a> on steroids. On top of that, there is the question of motion planning; you need to make sure all these robotic arms won’t collide with each other or with all the gear standing around them.</p>
<p>At the end, you’re facing myriad possible combinations where you’ve got to solve not one but three computationally hard problems at the same time. “There are some tools that let you automate motion planning, but task allocation and scheduling are usually done manually,” says Matthew Lai, a research engineer at Google DeepMind. “Solving all three of these problems combined is what we tackled in our work.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/deepminds-robotic-ballet-an-ai-for-coordinating-manufacturing-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For decades now, the <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> franchise has been associated with Microsoft's own DOS/Windows operating systems and, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/ms-flight-simulator-on-consoles-finally-a-next-gen-game-for-xbox-series-x-s/">more recently</a>, Xbox consoles (weird exceptions like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/22409/microsoft-flight-simulator/">this 1986 Macintosh port</a> notwithstanding). However, that era seems set to end as Sony <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWyMpM0k4E">announced during this evening's State of Play livestream</a> that <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> will come to the PlayStation 5 on December 8.</p>

<p>The move isn't entirely shocking for modern Microsoft, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">publishing previous Xbox exclusives</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">competing consoles</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/do-xbox-owners-have-a-right-to-expect-console-exclusives/">increasing numbers</a> for a while now. And <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-has-animals-ai-terrain-careers-and-flydoos/">been available on Xbox Series S/X for almost a year now</a>, as the name suggests, giving Xbox owners a "timed exclusive" at least.</p>
<p>Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name <em>integrated into its title</em> moving to a major non-Microsoft platform like this. The impact is a little bit like <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Advance">seeing a Sonic game on a Nintendo console for the first time in 2001</a>, after years of Sega <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/learning-from-history-sega-nintendo-and-the-first-console-war/">selling itself as the anti-Nintendo</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/microsoft-flight-simulator-becomes-a-sony-flight-simulator-on-ps5-this-december/">Read full article</a></p>
