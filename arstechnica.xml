<p>When we talk about memories in biology, we tend to focus on the brain and the storage of information in neurons. But there are lots of other memories that persist within our cells. Cells remember their developmental history, whether they've been exposed to pathogens, and so on. And that raises a question that has been challenging to answer: How does something as fundamental as a cell hold on to information across multiple divisions?</p>
<p>There's no one answer, and the details are really difficult to work out in many cases. But scientists have now worked out one memory system in detail. Cells are able to remember when their parent had a difficult time dividing—a problem that's often associated with DNA damage and cancer. And, if the problems are substantial enough, the two cells that result from a division will stop dividing themselves.</p>
<h2>Setting a timer</h2>
<p>In multicellular organisms, cell division is very carefully regulated. Uncontrolled division is the hallmark of cancers. But problems with the individual segments of division—things like copying DNA, repairing any damage, making sure each daughter cell gets the right number of chromosomes—can lead to mutations. So, the cell division process includes lots of checkpoints where the cell makes sure everything has worked properly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013795#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013795&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Wednesday, the IEEE Computer Society announced to members that, after April 1, it would no longer accept papers that include a frequently used image of a 1972 Playboy model named Lena Forsén. The so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#/media/File:Lenna_(test_image).png">Lenna image</a>," (Forsén added an extra "n" to her name in her Playboy appearance to aid pronunciation) has been used in image processing research since 1973 and has <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/it-s-time-to-retire-lena-from-computer-science">attracted criticism</a> for making some women feel unwelcome in the field.</p>

<p>In an email from the IEEE Computer Society sent to members on Wednesday, Technical &amp; Conference Activities Vice President Terry Benzel <a href="https://x.com/MikePFrank/status/1773073214551306369?s=20">wrote</a>, "IEEE's diversity statement and supporting policies such as the IEEE Code of Ethics speak to IEEE's commitment to promoting an including and equitable culture that welcomes all. In alignment with this culture and with respect to the wishes of the subject of the image, Lena Forsén, IEEE will no longer accept submitted papers which include the 'Lena image.'"</p>
<p>An uncropped version of the 512×512-pixel test image originally appeared as the centerfold picture for the December 1972 issue of Playboy Magazine. Usage of the Lenna image in image processing <a href="http://www.lenna.org/pcs_mirror/may_june01.pdf">began in June or July 1973</a> when an assistant professor named Alexander Sawchuck and a graduate student at the University of Southern California Signal and Image Processing Institute scanned a square portion of the centerfold image with a primitive drum scanner, omitting nudity present in the original image. They scanned it for a colleague's conference paper, and after that, others began to use the image as well.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013640#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013640&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you follow generative AI news at all, you're probably familiar with LLM chatbots' tendency to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/thanks-to-ai-hallucinate-is-cambridge-dictionarys-word-of-the-year-for-2023/">"confabulate" incorrect information</a> while presenting that information as authoritatively true. That tendency seems poised to cause some serious problems now that a chatbot run by the New York City government is making up incorrect answers to some important questions of local law and municipal policy.</p>
<p>NYC's "MyCity" ChatBot launched as a "pilot" program <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/777-23/mayor-adams-releases-first-of-its-kind-plan-responsible-artificial-intelligence-use-nyc#/0">last October</a>. The announcement touted the ChatBot as a way for business owners to "save ... time and money by instantly providing them with actionable and trusted information from more than 2,000 NYC Business webpages and articles on topics such as compliance with codes and regulations, available business incentives, and best practices to avoid violations and fines."</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/03/29/ai-chat-false-information-small-business/">a new report</a> from The Markup and local nonprofit news site The City found the MyCity chatbot giving dangerously wrong information about some pretty basic city policies. To cite just one example, the bot said that NYC buildings "are not required to accept Section 8 vouchers," when <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/media/source-of-income.page">an NYC government info page</a> says clearly that <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nycha/section-8/about-section-8.page">Section 8 housing subsidies</a> are one of many lawful sources of income that landlords are required to accept without discrimination. The Markup also received incorrect information in response to chatbot queries regarding worker pay and work hour regulations, as well as industry-specific information like funeral home pricing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013719#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013719&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Researchers have found a malicious backdoor in a compression tool that made its way into widely used Linux distributions, including those from Red Hat and Debian.</p>
<p>The compression utility, known as <a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz">xz Utils</a>, introduced the malicious code in versions ​​5.6.0 and 5.6.1, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">according to</a> Andres Freund, the developer who discovered it. There are no known reports of those versions being incorporated into any production releases for major Linux distributions, but both <a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.redhat.com/en/blog/urgent-security-alert-fedora-41-and-rawhide-users">Red Hat</a> and <a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2024/msg00057.html">Debian</a> reported that recently published beta releases used at least one of the backdoored versions—specifically, in Fedora 40 and Fedora Rawhide and Debian testing, unstable and experimental distributions. A stable release of Arch Linux is also affected. That distribution, however, isn't used in production systems.</p>
<p>Because the backdoor was discovered before the malicious versions of xz Utils were added to production versions of Linux, “it's not really affecting anyone in the real world,” Will Dormann, a senior vulnerability analyst at security firm Analygence, said in an online interview. “BUT that's only because it was discovered early due to bad actor sloppiness. Had it not been discovered, it would have been catastrophic to the world.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013674#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013674&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two lawsuits filed by a civil rights group allege that county jails in Michigan banned in-person visits in order to maximize revenue from voice and video calls as part of a "quid pro quo kickback scheme" with prison phone companies.</p>
<p>Civil Rights Corps filed the lawsuits on March 15 against the county governments, two county sheriffs, and two prison phone companies. The suits filed in county courts seek class-action status on behalf of people unable to visit family members detained in the local jails, including children who have been unable to visit their parents.</p>
<p>Defendants in <a href="https://civilrightscorps.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/St.ClairCounty-Complaint.pdf">one lawsuit</a> include St. Clair County Sheriff Mat King, prison phone company Securus Technologies, and Securus owner Platinum Equity. In the <a href="https://civilrightscorps.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GeneseeCounty-Complaint.pdf">other lawsuit</a>, defendants include Genesee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson and prison phone company ViaPath Technologies. ViaPath was formerly called Global Tel*Link Corporation (GTL), and the lawsuit primarily refers to the company as GTL.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013642#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013642&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

The quadrupedal robot went back to school and has learned a lot.  </p></div>
<p>Meet <a href="https://rsl.ethz.ch/robots-media/anymal.html">ANYmal</a>, a four-legged dog-like robot designed by researchers at ETH Zürich in Switzerland, in hopes of using such robots for search-and-rescue on building sites or disaster areas, among other applications. Now ANYmal has been upgraded to perform rudimentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour">parkour</a> moves, aka "free running." Human parkour enthusiasts are known for their remarkably agile, acrobatic feats, and while ANYmal can't match those, the robot successfully jumped across gaps, climbed up and down large obstacles, and crouched low to maneuver under an obstacle, according to a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adi7566">recent paper</a> published in the journal Science Robotics.</p>
<p>The ETH Zürich team introduced ANYmal's original approach to reinforcement learning <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aau5872">back in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abk2822">enhanced</a> its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">proprioception</a> (the ability to sense movement, action, and location) <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2022/01/how-robots-learn-to-hike.html">three years later</a>. Just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/new-legged-robots-designed-to-explore-planets-as-a-team/">last year</a>, the team <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.ade9548">showcased a trio</a> of customized ANYmal robots, tested in environments as close to the harsh lunar and Martian terrain as possible. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/new-legged-robots-designed-to-explore-planets-as-a-team/">previously reported</a>, robots capable of walking could assist future rovers and mitigate the risk of damage from sharp edges or loss of traction in loose regolith. Every robot had a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/lidar/">lidar</a> sensor. but they were each specialized for particular functions and still flexible enough to cover for each other—if one glitches, the others can take over its tasks.</p>
<p>For instance, the Scout model’s main objective was to survey its surroundings using RGB cameras. This robot also used another imager to map regions and objects of interest using filters that let through different areas of the light spectrum. The Scientist model had the advantage of an arm featuring a MIRA (Metrohm Instant Raman Analyzer) and a MICRO (microscopic imager). The MIRA was able to identify chemicals in materials found on the surface of the demonstration area based on how they scattered light, while the MICRO on its wrist imaged them up close. The Hybrid was more of a generalist, helping out the Scout and the Scientist with measurements of scientific targets such as boulders and craters.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013031#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013031&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Commodore 64 introduced a generation of future computer geeks to personal computing. The 8-bit system first launched in 1982 and was discontinued in 1994. During that time, it made its mark as one of the first and most influential personal computers, and many still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/three-decades-of-the-commodore-64/">remember the computer fondly</a>.</p>

<p>Gaming peripherals maker 8BitDo wants to bring that nostalgia to people's fingertips and this week announced the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-mechanical-keyboard-c64/">Retro Mechanical Keyboard - C64 Edition</a>. 8BitDo is careful not to use the name "Commodore" outright. But with marketing images featuring retro Commodore gear in the background, press materials saying that the keyboard was "inspired by the classics," and certain design cues, the keyboard is clearly a tribute to the '80s keyboard-computer.</p>
<p>8BitDo starts with the sort of beige that you only see on new peripherals these days if the gadgets are trying to appear old. A rainbow stripe runs horizontally and north of the function row, like on Commodore's computer. There's a power button with a bulb popping out of the keyboard case, ready to illuminate when it receives the signal.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013448#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013448&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've been waiting for new iPads to come out, prepare to wait just a little longer: Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/when-is-the-new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-coming-out-apple-plans-early-may-launch">says</a> that redesigned iPad Pros with Apple's M3 chip, plus refreshed iPad Air models with the M2 and a larger-screened option, should now arrive sometime in "early May." Gurman <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/new-high-end-ipads-are-around-the-corner-please-let-me-run-macos-on-them/">had previously reported</a> that new iPads could arrive in March or April, not long after the updated M3 MacBook Airs.</p>

<p>Gurman suggests that "complex new manufacturing techniques" for the new iPad screens have "contributed to the delay," and that Apple is also "working to finish software for the devices."</p>
<p>The details of what the new iPads will look like hasn't changed. The new iPad Pro models will shift to using OLED display panels for the first time and will have their designs tweaked for the first time since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/2018-ipad-pro-review-whats-a-computer/">the 2018 iPad Pros</a> introduced the current rounded, slim-bezeled look. Those new iPad Pros will also come with redesigned Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories, though it's unclear whether those accessories will be totally rethought or if they'll just tweak existing designs to work with the new tablets.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013454#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013454&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In early March, Google made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-says-the-ai-focused-pixel-8-cant-run-its-latest-smartphone-ai-models/">the odd announcement</a> that only <em>one</em> of its two latest smartphones, the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, would be able to run its latest AI model, called "Google Gemini." Despite having very similar specs, the smaller Pixel 8 wouldn't get the new AI model, with the company citing mysterious "hardware limitations" as the reason. It was a strange statement considering the fact that Google designed and marketed the Pixel 8 to be AI-centric and then designed a smartphone-centric AI model called "Gemini Nano" yet still couldn't make the two work together.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Google is backtracking somewhat. The company announced on the <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/266349981/new-gen-ai-features-coming-to-your-pixel?hl=en&amp;sjid=17904893691283717066-NA">Pixel Phone Help</a> forum that the smaller Pixel 8 actually <em>will </em>get Gemini Nano in the next big quarterly Android release, which should happen in June. There's a catch, though—while the Pixel 8 Pro will get Gemini Nano as a user-facing feature, on the Pixel 8, it's only being released "as a developer option." That means you'll be able to turn it on only via the hidden Developer Options menu in the settings, and most people will miss out on it.</p>
<p>Google's Seang Chau, VP of devices and services software, explained the decision on the company's in-house "<a href="https://shows.acast.com/made-by-google-podcast/episodes/6602fa6073a3a40017353c91">Made by Google" podcast</a>. "The Pixel 8 Pro, having 12GB of RAM, was a perfect place for us to put [Gemini Nano] on the device and see what we could do," Chau said. "When we looked at the Pixel 8 as an example, the Pixel 8 has 4GB less memory, and it wasn't as easy of a call to just say, 'all right, we're going to enable it on Pixel 8 as well.'" According to Chau, Google's trepidation is because the company doesn't want to "degrade the experience" on the smaller Pixel 8, which only has 8GB of RAM.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013446#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013446&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Voice synthesis has come a long way since 1978's <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/528/vcg-interview-richard-wiggins-talks-speak-spell">Speak &amp; Spell</a> toy, which once wowed people with its state-of-the-art ability to read words aloud using an electronic voice. Now, using deep-learning AI models, software can create not only realistic-sounding voices, but also convincingly imitate existing voices using small samples of audio.</p>

<p>Along those lines, OpenAI just announced Voice Engine, a text-to-speech AI model for creating synthetic voices based on a 15-second segment of recorded audio. It has provided audio samples of the Voice Engine in action <a href="http://openai.com/blog/navigating-the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-synthetic-voices">on its website</a>.</p>
<p>Once a voice is cloned, a user can input text into the Voice Engine and get an AI-generated voice result. But OpenAI is not ready to widely release its technology yet. The company initially planned to launch a pilot program for developers to sign up for the Voice Engine API earlier this month. But after more consideration about ethical implications, the company decided to scale back its ambitions for now.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008632#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008632&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I like AirDrop just fine for sending files between devices, but I'm the only one of two humans in my household that regularly uses Apple devices. I cannot, to paraphrase <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/apples-green-bubbles-targeted-by-doj-in-lawsuit-over-iphone-monopoly/">the Apple CEO's litigation-influencing quip</a>, simply buy my spouse an iPhone. And a MacBook. And sell our household Chromebook. And give up entirely on Windows-based PC gaming.</p>
<p>Instead, I've come to use two apps to send files between operating systems on the same Wi-Fi, whether they're systems from Cupertino, Redmond, Mountain View, or elsewhere. One is <a href="https://localsend.org/#/download">LocalSend</a>, a cross-platform app with an <a href="https://github.com/localsend/localsend">open source client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/localsend/protocol">protocol</a> that I install wherever I can. The other lower-friction tool that's especially handy for guests and rarely used devices is <a href="https://snapdrop.net/">SnapDrop</a>, a website or web app you open on both devices and then send files through, entirely on your local network. It, too, has <a href="https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/">its code out there for anybody to view</a>.</p>
<p>Neither of these apps is new, which is good. They've been around long enough to garner good reviews and trust from their users. Beyond sharing files between two humans, I've also leaned on them when setting up headless systems or other quirky devices.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013441#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013441&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been over two years since major players in the international game industry <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/game-industry-unites-behind-call-to-cut-off-russian-market/">united</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/russias-console-game-market-no-longer-exists/">largely cut off the Russian market</a> in response to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/ukraine-asks-game-industry-to-block-russian-accounts-as-punishment-for-invasion/">a request from a beleaguered Ukraine</a>.

<p>There is a significant mismatch between the people who want to buy electric vehicles and the people who want to sell them. That's according to data from a new survey by Edmunds, which polled people shopping for new cars in January. These prospective buyers want affordable sedans and SUVs, segments of the market that are being ignored by automakers. Instead, they're being offered expensive EVs, including plenty of trucks, for which there is little demand.</p>
<p>Almost half (47 percent) of the 300 people surveyed said they want to spend less than $40,000 on a new EV. And just over 1 in 5 (22 percent) said that they don't want to pay more than $30,000. But currently, no new EV is on sale below this price, and only a handful of EVs (Mini Cooper SE, Fiat 500e, Hyundai Kona Electric, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model 3) are on sale for less than $40,000.</p>
<p>According to Edmunds' data, the average transaction price of a new EV was $61,702 in 2023, compared to $47,450 for other vehicles.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013451#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013451&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Electric vehicles have many advantages over cars that still use internal combustion engines. They're far more efficient, they're quieter, and they usually have much more torque than their gasoline-powered equivalents. But we're still far from achieving price parity between powertrains. In other words, EVs are expensive.</p>
<p>One place you can find some bargains, though, is the rental company Hertz, which currently has more than 2,100 EVs for sale, more than half of which are affordable enough to qualify for the IRS used clean vehicle tax credit.</p>
<p>Hertz has been adding a lot of EVs to its fleet as part of the company's decarbonization plan. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/hertz-to-purchase-100000-tesla-model-3s-for-its-rental-fleet/">In 2021</a>, it revealed plans to purchase 100,000 Teslas. However, the controversial car maker <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/hertz-falls-short-of-ambitious-tesla-2022-fleet-goal/">had delivered fewer than half</a> of those two years later, and long repair times for customer-inflicted damage have seen the rental agency divest itself of many of those Teslas and diversify its fleet, adding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/first-tesla-now-polestar-hertz-signs-a-new-electric-vehicle-partner/">plenty of Polestars</a>, Kias, and Chevrolets.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013428#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013428&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Orbex patents reusable rocket tech</strong>. The British launch company <a href="https://orbex.space/news/patent-secured-for-petal-fold-reusable-rocket-technology">said this week</a> it has patented a "REFLIGHT" technology that enables the recovery of the first stage of its small Prime rocket. Essentially, Orbex designed an interstage that will function somewhat like grid fins on the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. "After Stage 1 detaches from Stage 2, the interstage on top of Stage 1 reconfigures into four ‘petals’ which fold out and create drag forces that passively reorients and slows the spent rocket stage’s descent to Earth," the company stated.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013108#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013108&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Chuck Yeager reached Mach 1 on October 14, 1947, the entire frame of his Bell X-1 aircraft suddenly started to shake, and the controls went. A crew observing the flight in a van on the ground reported hearing something like a distant, rolling thunder. They were probably the first people on Earth to hear a boom made by a supersonic aircraft.</p>
<p>The boom felt like an innocent curiosity at first but soon turned into a nightmare. In no time, supersonic jets—F-100 Super Sabers, F-101 Voodoos, and B-58 Hustlers—came to Air Force bases across the US, and with them came the booms. Proper, panes-flying-off-the windows supersonic booms. People filed over 40,000 complaints about nuisance and property damage caused by booming jets, which eventually ended up with the Federal Aviation Administration imposing a Mach 1 speed limit for flights over land in 1973.</p>
<p>Now, NASA wants this ban to go. It has started the Quesst mission to go fast over American cities once more. But this time, it wants to do it quietly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012990#p3">Read 56 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012990&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tonight, Apple will debut some new Immersive Video content for the Vision Pro headset—the first sports content for the device. It doesn't seem like much after two months of no new content, though.</p>
<p>Starting at 6 pm PT/9 pm ET, Vision Pro users will be able to watch a sports film captured for the platform's Immersive Video format. The video will be a series of highlights from last year's Major League Soccer (MLS) playoffs, and according to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/apples-immersive-mls-highlight-reel-debuts-later-today/">Six Colors</a>, it will run just five minutes. It will be free for all Vision Pro users.</p>
<p>On February 2, Apple released what appeared to be the first episodes of three Immersive Video series: <em>Adventure</em>, <em>Prehistoric Planet</em>, and <em>Wildlife</em>. Each debuted alongside the Vision Pro's launch with one episode labeled "Episode 1" of "Season 1."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013280#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013280&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I enjoy getting my exercise but hate doing it indoors. I'd much rather get some fresh air and watch the world drift past me as I cycle or hike somewhere than watch a screen while sweating away on something stationary.</p>
<p>To get a bit more of what I like, I've invested in a variety of gear that has extended my cycling season deeper into the winter. But even with that, there are various conditions—near-freezing temperatures, heavy rains, Canada catching fire—that have kept me off the roads. So, a backup exercise plan has always been on my to-do list.</p>
<p>The company LifeSpan offers exercise equipment that fits well into a home office and gave me the chance to try its <a href="https://www.lifespanfitness.com/products/ampera-under-desk-bike">Ampera model</a>. It's a stationary bike that tucks nicely under a standing desk and has a distinct twist: You can pedal to power the laptop you're working on. Overall, the hardware is well-designed, but some glitches, software issues, and design decisions keep it from living up to its potential.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005793#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005793&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
