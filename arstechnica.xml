<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Aston Martin provided flights from London to Seville and accommodation so Ars could drive the Vantage. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>It's high time Aston Martin had a winner on its hands. Last year it updated the DB12 with smart new face, plenty of power, and the sort of infotainment you'd hope for from a luxury GT. The Vantage, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/aston-martin-reveals-its-all-new-vantage-a-503hp-v8-sports-car/">the firm's 'entry-level' car</a>, has been given similar treatment in the hopes that it can peel a few more people away from Porsche dealerships.</p>
<p>Aston's looking not only to make better cars, but to shift its image—it's aiming to be seen as more luxurious than before, as well as throwing as much power at the cars as possible. At first glance, it looks like Aston's cooked up something truly delightful.</p>
<p>The new car is more than 150 hp (112 kW) more powerful than the one it replaces, with 656 hp (490 kW) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) from a wonderfully appointed turbocharged 4.0 L V8. 0-60 mph is quoted at 3.4 seconds, and Aston reckons that if you have enough space (and no speed limits) you'll see the far side of 200 mph (321 km/h). It is not slow.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023712#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023712&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In April 2023, a satellite the size of a microwave launched to space. Its goal: to get ready to mine asteroids. While the mission, courtesy of a company called AstroForge, ran into problems, it’s part of a new wave of would-be asteroid miners hoping to cash in on cosmic resources.</p>
<p>Potential applications of space-mined material abound: Asteroids contain metals like platinum and cobalt, which are used in electronics and electric vehicle batteries, respectively. Although there are plenty of these materials on Earth, they can be more concentrated on asteroids than mountainsides, making them easier to scrape out. And scraping in space, advocates say, could cut down on the damaging impacts that <a href="https://undark.org/2023/10/20/book-excerpt-pitfall/">mining</a> has on this planet. Space-resource advocates also want to explore the potential of other substances. What if space ice could be used for spacecraft and rocket propellant? Space dirt for housing structures for astronauts and radiation shielding?</p>
<p>Previous companies have rocketed toward similar goals before but went bust about a half-decade ago. In the years since that first cohort left the stage, though, “the field has exploded in interest,” said Angel Abbud-Madrid, director of the Center for Space Resources at the Colorado School of Mines.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023670#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023670&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My brain registered that I was clearly cycling. My feet were clipped in to pedals, my legs were turning crank arms, and the arms were linked via a chain to one of the wheels. But pretty much everything else about the experience felt wrong on a fundamental, almost disturbing level.</p>
<p>I could produce a long list of everything my mind was struggling to deal with, but two things stand out as I think back on the experience. The first is that, with the exception of my face, I didn't feel the air flow over me as the machine surged forward down a slight slope. The second, related to the first, is that there was no indication that the surge would ever tail off if I didn't hit the brakes.</p>
<h2>Living the dream</h2>
<p>My visit with a velomobile was, in some ways, a chance to reconnect with a childhood dream. I've always had a fascination with vehicles that don't require fuel, like bicycles and sailboats. And during my childhood, the popular press was filled with stories about people setting human-powered speed records by putting aerodynamic fiberglass shells on recumbent bicycles. In the wake of the 1970s oil crises, I imagined a time when the roads might be filled with people cycling these pods for their commutes or covering long distances thanks to a cooler filled with drinks and snacks tucked in the back of the shell.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021581#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021581&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Galaxies pass gas—in the case of galaxy NGC 4383, so much so that its gas outflow is 20,000 light-years across and more massive than 50 million Suns.</p>
<p>Yet even an outflow of this immensity was difficult to detect until now. Observing what these outflows are made of and how they are structured demands high-resolution instruments that can only see gas from galaxies that are relatively close, so information on them has been limited. Which is unfortunate, since gaseous outflows ejected from galaxies can tell us more about their star formation cycles.</p>
<p>The MAUVE (MUSE and ALMA Unveiling the Virgo Environment) program is now changing things. MAUVE’s mission is to understand how the outflows of galaxies in the Virgo cluster affect star formation. NGC 4383 stood out to astronomer Adam Watts, of the University of Australia and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), and his team because its outflow is so enormous.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023554#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023554&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of the biggest mysteries in astrophysics today is that the forces in galaxies do not seem to add up. Galaxies rotate much faster than predicted by applying Newton’s law of gravity to their visible matter, despite those laws working well everywhere in the Solar System.</p>
<p>To prevent galaxies from flying apart, some additional gravity is needed. This is why the idea of an invisible substance called <a href="https://theconversation.com/from-machos-to-wimps-meet-the-top-five-candidates-for-dark-matter-51516">dark matter</a> was first proposed. But nobody has ever seen the stuff. And there are no particles in the hugely successful Standard Model of particle physics that could be the dark matter—it must be something quite exotic.</p>
<p>This has led to the rival idea that the galactic discrepancies are caused instead by a breakdown of Newton’s laws. The most successful such idea is known as Milgromian dynamics or <a href="https://theconversation.com/dark-matter-may-not-actually-exist-and-our-alternative-theory-can-be-put-to-the-test-110238">Mond</a>, proposed by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom in 1982. But our recent research shows this theory is in trouble.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023652#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023652&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are people who relish the feeling of finally nailing down a cryptic clue in a crossword. There are also people unduly aggravated by a puzzlemaster's puns and clever deceptions. I'm more the latter kind. I don't even play the crossword—or <em>Wordle</em> or <em>Connections</em> or <em>Strands</em>—but my wife does, and she'll feed me clues. Without fail, they leave me in some strange state of being relieved to finally get it, yet also keyed up and irritated.</p>
<p><em>Cryptmaster</em>, out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885110/Cryptmaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/cryptmaster">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://akuparagames.itch.io/cryptmaster">Itch.io</a> for Windows, seems like the worst possible game for people like me, and yet I dig it. It is many things at once: a word-guessing game, a battle typing (or shouting) challenge, a party-of-four first-person grid-based dungeon crawler, and a text-prompt adventure, complete with an extremely goofy sense of humor. It's also in stark black and white. You cannot fault this game for a lack of originality, even while it evokes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/wizardry-remaster-keeps-apple-ii-vibes-but-adds-graphics-and-modern-graces/"><em>Wizardry</em></a>, <em>Ultima Underground</em>, and lots of other arrow-key-moving classics, albeit with an active tongue-in-cheek filter.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxyhNkTjyac?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>Cryptmaster</em> announcement trailer. </p></div>
<p>The Cryptmaster in question has woken up four role-playing figures—fighter, rogue, bard, and wizard—to help him escape from his underground lair to the surface, for reasons that must be really keen and good. As corpses, you don't remember any of your old skills, but you can guess them. What's a four-letter action that a fighter might perform, or a three-letter wizard move? Every time you find a box or treasure, the Cryptmaster opens it, gives you a letter count, then lets you ask for clues. "SMELL," you type, and he says it has that wonderful old-paper smell. "LOOK," and he notes that there are writings and drawings on one side. Guess "SCROLL," and he adds those letters to your characters' next ability clues. Guess wrong, well, better luck next time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023560#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023560&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/a-little-us-company-makes-history-by-landing-on-the-moon-but-questions-remain/">Moon</a> may appear to shine peacefully in the night sky, but billions of years ago, it was given a facial by volcanic turmoil.</p>
<p>One question that has gone unanswered for decades is why there are more titanium-rich volcanic rocks, such as ilmenite, on the near side as opposed to the far side. Now a team of researchers at Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory are proposing a possible explanation for that.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/11/daily-telescope-imaging-a-nearly-4-billion-year-old-region-on-the-moon/">lunar surface</a> was once flooded by a bubbling magma ocean, and after the magma ocean had hardened, there was an enormous impact on the far side. Heat from this impact spread to the near side and made the crust unstable, causing sheets of heavier and denser minerals on the surface to gradually sink deep into the mantle. These melted again and were belched out by volcanoes. Lava from these eruptions (more of which happened on the near side) ended up in what are now titanium-rich flows of volcanic rock. In other words, the Moon’s old face vanished, only to resurface.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023553#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023553&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA is looking for ways to get rock samples back from Mars for less than the $11 billion the agency would need under its own plan, so last month, officials put out a call to industry to propose ideas.</p>
<p>Boeing is the first company to release details about how it would attempt a Mars Sample Return mission. Its study involves a single flight of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the super heavy-lift launcher designed to send astronauts to the Moon on NASA's Artemis missions.</p>
<p>Jim Green, NASA's former chief scientist and longtime head of the agency's planetary science division, presented Boeing's concept Wednesday at the Humans to Mars summit, an annual event sponsored primarily by traditional space companies. Boeing is the lead contractor for the SLS core stage and upper stage and has pitched the SLS, primarily a crew launch vehicle, as a rocket for military satellites and deep space probes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023687#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023687&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are few things more heartwarming than videos of children with deafness gaining the ability to hear, showing them happily turning their heads at the sound of their parents' voices and joyfully bobbing to newly discovered music. Thanks to recent advances in gene therapy, more kids are getting those sweet and triumphant moments—with no hearing aids or cochlear implants needed.</p>
<p>At the annual conference of the American Society for Gene &amp; Cell Therapy held in Baltimore this week, researchers showed many of those videos to their audiences of experts. On Wednesday, Larry Lustig, an otolaryngologist at Columbia University, presented clinical trial data of two children with profound deafness—the most severe type of deafness—who are now able to hear at normal levels after receiving an experimental gene therapy. One of the children was 11 months old at the time of the treatment, marking her as the youngest child in the world to date to receive gene therapy for genetic deafness.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Yilai Shu, an otolaryngologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, provided a one-year progress report on six children who were treated in the first in-human trial of gene therapy for genetic deafness. Five of the six had their hearing restored.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023657#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023657&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

(credit: University of New South Wales, Sydney)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Diehard fans of cold-brew coffee put in a lot of time and effort for their preferred caffeinated beverage. But engineers at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, figured out <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2024/05/Ultrasonic_cold_brew_coffee_ready_under_three_minutes">a nifty hack</a>. They rejiggered an existing espresso machine to accommodate an ultrasonic transducer to administer ultrasonic pulses, thereby reducing the brewing time from 12 to 24 hours to just under three minutes, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350417724001330">new paper</a> published in the journal Ultrasonics Sonochemistry.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/the-chemistry-of-cold-brew-coffee-is-so-hot-right-now/">previously reported</a>, rather than pouring boiling or near-boiling water over coffee grounds and steeping for a few minutes, <a href="https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/">the cold-brew method</a> involves mixing coffee grounds with room-temperature water and letting the mixture steep for anywhere from several hours to two days. Then it is strained through a sieve to filter out all the sludge-like solids, followed by filtering. This can be done at home in a Mason jar, or you can get fancy and use a French press or a more elaborate Toddy system. It's not necessarily served cold (although it can be)—just brewed cold.</p>
<p>The result is coffee that tastes less bitter than traditionally brewed coffee. “There’s nothing like it,” co-author Francisco Trujillo of UNSW Sydney <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2430111-ultrasonic-coffee-maker-produces-the-perfect-cold-brew-in-minutes/">told New Scientist.</a> “The flavor is nice, the aroma is nice and the mouthfeel is more viscous and there’s less bitterness than a regular espresso shot. And it has a level of acidity that people seem to like. It’s now my favorite way to drink coffee.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023421#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reinforcement-learning algorithms in systems like ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini can work wonders, but they usually need hundreds of thousands of shots at a task before they get good at it. That’s why it’s always been hard to transfer this performance to robots. You can’t let a self-driving car crash 3,000 times just so it can learn crashing is bad.</p>
<p>But now a team of researchers at Northwestern University may have found a way around it. “That is what we think is going to be transformative in the development of the embodied AI in the real world,” says Thomas Berrueta who led the development of the Maximum Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (MaxDiff RL), an algorithm tailored specifically for robots.</p>
<h2>Introducing chaos</h2>
<p>The problem with deploying most reinforcement-learning algorithms in robots starts with the built-in assumption that the data they learn from is independent and identically distributed. The independence, in this context, means the value of one variable does not depend on the value of another variable in the dataset—when you flip a coin two times, getting tails on the second attempt does not depend on the result of your first flip. Identical distribution means that the probability of seeing any specific outcome is the same. In the coin-flipping example, the probability of getting heads is the same as getting tails: 50 percent for each.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023543#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023543&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI is eventually coming for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites">most popular website</a> on the Internet: Google Search. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-announce-google-search-competitor-monday-sources-say-2024-05-09/">Reuters</a> report claimed that the company behind ChatGPT is planning to launch a search engine as early as <em>this Monday, </em>but OpenAI denied that Monday would be the day.</p>
<p>The company recently confirmed it's holding a <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1788987793613725786">livestream event</a> on Monday, though, but an OpenAI rep told Ars that "Despite reports, we’re not launching a search product or GPT-5 on Monday." Either way, Monday is an interesting time for an OpenAI livestream. That's the day before Google's biggest show of the year, Google I/O, where Google will primarily want to show off its AI prowess and convince people that it is not being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/fearing-chatgpt-google-enlists-founders-brin-and-page-in-ai-fight/">left in the dust</a> by OpenAI. Google seeing its biggest search competition in years and suddenly having to face down "OpenAI's Google Killer" would have definitely cast a shadow over the show.</p>
<p>OpenAI has been inching toward a search engine for a while now. It has been working with Microsoft with a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/ai-powered-chat-helps-bing-make-a-small-dent-in-googles-search-hegemony/">Bing Chat</a>" generative-AI search engine in Microsoft's search engine. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151616/openai-is-entering-the-search-game">The Verge</a> reported that "OpenAI has been aggressively trying to poach Google employees" for an upstart search team. "Search.chatgpt.com" is already <a href="https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1786296216176689254">being set up</a> on OpenAI's server, so it's all falling into place.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023495#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023495&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A day after announcing that the tentatively titled <em>Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum </em>was scheduled for a 2026 release, Warner Bros. immediately moved to block a beloved 2009 unauthorized fan film with the exact same name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H09xnhlCQU&amp;t=38s">on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Less than 12 hours later, though, the studio appeared to back down from this copyright fight, reinstating the fan film on YouTube amid fan backlash protesting the copyright strike <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1coloxc/the_hunt_for_gollum_a_high_quality_fanmade_short/">on Reddit</a> as a "dick move."</p>
<p>In 2009, director Chris Bouchard—who most recently directed Netflix's <em>The Little Mermaid</em>—released <em>The Hunt for Gollum</em> through Independent Online Cinema after he claimed to have "reached an understanding" with the rightsholder of The Lord of the Rings books, then called Tolkien Enterprises (now called Middle-earth Enterprises).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023504#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023504&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google has updated its Chrome browser to patch a high-severity zero-day vulnerability that allows attackers to execute malicious code on end user devices. The fix marks the fifth time this year the company has updated the browser to protect users from an existing malicious exploit.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as <a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4671">CVE-2024-4671</a>, is a “use after free,” a class of bug that occurs in C-based programming languages. In these languages, developers must allocate memory space needed to run certain applications or operations. They do this by using “pointers” that store the memory addresses where the required data will reside. Because this space is finite, memory locations should be deallocated once the application or operation no longer needs it.</p>
<p>Use-after-free bugs occur when the app or process fails to clear the pointer after freeing the memory location. In some cases, the pointer to the freed memory is used again and points to a new memory location storing malicious shellcode planted by an attacker’s exploit, a condition that will result in the execution of this code.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023505#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023505&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Do you ever look around at modern civilization and boggle at the sheer complexity of it all? Do you ever think about the generations of backbreaking labor needed to turn acres and acres of untamed wilderness into the layers of interconnected systems needed to provide basic necessities—much less luxuries—to both early settlers and their generations of descendants?</p>
<p>All that infrastructure work is much harder to take for granted after playing <em>Manor Lords</em>. The Early Access version of the game—which netted a million Steam sales in its first 24 hours last month—forces you to do a lot of the heavy lifting that many other city builders tend to gloss over. And while there are still a lot of Early Access rough spots, what's already there can make you appreciate just how hard it is to build a functioning society from nothing but raw materials and hard labor.</p>
<h2>Let go of my hand</h2>
<p>In many other city builders, you act as something of a detached, bureaucratic god. Lay down some roads, set aside some zoning, and watch as the microscopic masses automatically fill in the details of the housing, commerce, and industry needed to create a functional society.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023437#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023437&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is becoming increasingly accepted that classic psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, and mescaline can act as antidepressants and anti-anxiety treatments in addition to causing hallucinations. They act by binding to a serotonin receptor. But there are 14 known types of serotonin receptors, and most of the research into these compounds has focused on only one of them—the one these molecules like, called 5-HT2A. (5-HT, short for 5-hydroxytryptamine, is the chemical name for serotonin.)</p>
<p>The Colorado River toad (<i>Incilius alvarius</i>), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad, secretes a psychedelic compound that likes to bind to a different serotonin receptor subtype called 5-HT1A. And that difference may be the key to developing an entirely distinct class of antidepressants.</p>
<h2>Uncovering novel biology</h2>
<p>Like other psychedelics, the one the toad produces decreases depression and anxiety and induces meaningful and spiritually significant experiences. It has been used clinically to treat vets with post-traumatic stress disorder and is being developed as a treatment for other neurological disorders and drug abuse. 5-HT1A is a validated therapeutic target, as approved drugs, including the antidepressant Viibryd and the anti-anxiety med Buspar, bind to it. But little is known about how psychedelics engage with this receptor and which effects it mediates, so <a href="https://wackerlab.com/">Daniel Wacker’s lab</a> decided to look into it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023435#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023435&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Global carmakers are stepping up their investment in hybrid technologies as consumers’ growing wariness over fully electric vehicles forces the industry to rapidly shift gear, according to top executives.</p>
<p>A combination of still high interest rates and concern over inadequate charging infrastructure has chilled buyers’ enthusiasm for fully electric cars, prompting a rebound in sales of hybrid vehicles that most of the industry had long regarded as nothing more than a stop-gap.</p>
<p>Tapping the resurgent demand for hybrids was a priority, executives from General Motors, Nissan, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Ford told the Financial Times’ Future of the Car Summit this week.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023477#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023477&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
