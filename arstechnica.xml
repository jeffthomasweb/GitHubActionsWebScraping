                            <![CDATA[<p>Dmitri Mendeleev famously saw the complete arrangement of the periodic table after falling asleep on his desk. He claimed in his dream he saw a table where all the elements fell into place, and he wrote it all down when he woke up. By having a eureka moment right after a nap, he joined a club full of rather talented people: Mary Shelley, Thomas Edison, and Salvador Dali.</p>
<p>To figure out if there’s a grain of truth to all these anecdotes, a team of German scientists at the Hamburg University, led by cognitive science researcher Anika T. Löwe, conducted an experiment designed to trigger such nap-following strokes of genius—and catch them in the act with EEG brain monitoring gear. And they kind of succeeded.</p>
<h2>Catching Edison’s cup</h2>
<p>“Thomas Edison had this technique where he held a cup or something like that when he was napping in his chair,” says Nicolas Schuck, a professor of cognitive science at the Hamburg University and senior author of the study. “When he fell asleep too deeply, the cup falling from his hand would wake him up—he was convinced that was the way to trigger these eureka moments.” While dozing off in a chair with a book or a cup doesn’t seem particularly radical, a number of cognitive scientists got serious about re-creating Edison’s approach to insights and testing it in their experiments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/figuring-out-why-a-nap-might-help-people-see-things-in-new-ways/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In 2022, the company launched the <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/lifestyle-products/lg-27art10akpl-lifestyle-screen">StanbyME</a>, which is essentially a $1,000 27-inch tablet running LG's smart TV operating system (OS), webOS, but lacking a tuner. LG's press release announcing the device described it as a “wireless private TV screen with a built-in battery” that is easily portable and ideal for watching shows and movies, in addition to  “video conferencing with family and coworkers and viewing online lectures.”</p>
<p>Today, the StanbyME competes against a slew of similar devices, including some <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10489126">from Samsung</a>, but mostly from smaller brands and running Android.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/the-curious-rise-of-giant-tablets-on-wheels/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><strong>Will Orbex ever launch an orbital rocket</strong>? Orbex, a launch services company based in the United Kingdom, has announced the postponement of its first orbital launch to 2026 due to infrastructure limitations and other issues, <a href="https://orbitaltoday.com/2025/06/24/uks-orbex-delays-first-launch-to-2026-cites-infrastructure-and-funding-challenges/">Orbital Today reports</a>. At the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, Orbex chief executive Miguel Bello Mora announced that the company is now targeting next year for the liftoff of its Prime rocket from SaxaVord in Scotland. He said the delay is partly due to the limited launch infrastructure at SaxaVord and a "bottleneck" in site operations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/rocket-report-japans-workhorse-booster-takes-a-bow-you-can-invest-in-spacex-now/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The maker of a phone app that is advertised as providing a stealthy means for monitoring all activities on an Android device spilled email addresses, plain-text passwords, and other sensitive data belonging to 62,000 users, a researcher discovered recently.</p>
<p>A security flaw in the app, branded Catwatchful, allowed researcher Eric Daigle to download a <a href="https://ericdaigle.ca/posts/taking-over-60k-spyware-user-accounts/">trove of sensitive data</a>, which belonged to account holders who used the covert app to monitor phones. The leak, made possible by a SQL injection vulnerability, allowed anyone who exploited it to access the accounts and all data stored in them.</p>
<h2>Unstoppable</h2>
<p>Catwatchful creators emphasize the app's stealth and security. While the promoters claim the app is legal and intended for parents monitoring their children's online activities, the emphasis on stealth has raised concerns that it's being aimed at people with other agendas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/provider-of-covert-surveillance-app-spills-passwords-for-62000-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In mid-June, a federal judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-slams-nih-grant-cuts-as-racist-appalling-white-house-attacks-judge/">issued a stinging rebuke</a> to the Trump administration, declaring that its decision to cancel the funding for many grants issued by the National Institutes of Health was illegal, and suggesting that the policy was likely animated by racism. But the detailed reasoning behind his decision wasn't released at the time. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.282917/gov.uscourts.mad.282917.163.0.pdf">written portion</a> of the decision was finally issued on Wednesday, and it has a number of notable features.</p>
<p>For starters, it's more limited in scope due to a pair of Supreme Court decisions that were issued in the intervening weeks. As a consequence, far fewer grants will see their funding restored. Regardless, the court continues to find that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, in part because the government never bothered to define the problems that would get a grant canceled. As a result, officials within the NIH simply canceled lists of grants they received from DOGE without bothering to examine their scientific merit, and then struggled to retroactively describe a policy that justified the actions afterward—a process that led several of them to resign.</p>
<h2>A more limited verdict</h2>
<p>The issue before Judge William Young of the District of Massachusetts was whether the government had followed the law in terminating grants funded by the National Institutes of Health. After a short trial, Young issued a verbal ruling that the government hadn't, and that he had concluded that its actions were the product of "racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ. community." But the details of his decisions and the evidence that motivated them had to wait for a written ruling, which is now available.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/doge-told-the-nih-which-grants-to-cancel-with-no-scientific-review/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://x.com/MikeIsaac/status/1939758599653532121">a memo to employees earlier this week</a>, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a vision for a near-future in which "personal [AI] superintelligence for everyone" forms "the beginning of a new era for humanity." The newly formed Meta Superintelligence Labs—freshly staffed with multiple high-level acquisitions from OpenAI and other AI companies—will spearhead the development of "our next generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so," Zuckerberg wrote.</p>
<p>Reading that memo, I couldn't help but think of another "vision for the future" Zuckerberg shared not that long ago. At his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0294iXEPO4Y">2021 Facebook Connect keynote</a>, Zuckerberg laid out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/everyone-pitching-the-metaverse-has-a-different-idea-of-what-it-is/">his plan for the metaverse</a>, a virtual place where “you're gonna be able to do almost anything you can imagine" and which would form the basis of "the next version of the Internet."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg believed in that vision so much at the time that he abandoned the well-known Facebook corporate brand <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/facebooks-rebrands-as-meta-amid-a-new-metaverse-first-outlook/">in favor of the new name "Meta."</a> "I'm going to keep pushing and giving everything I've got to make this happen now," Zuckerberg said at the time. Less than four years later, Zuckerberg seems to now be “giving everything [he's] got" for a vision of AI “superintelligence," reportedly <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-meta-offer-top-ai-talent-300-million/">offering pay packages of up to $300 million over four years</a> to attract top talent from other AI companies (Meta has since <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/business/meta-denies-report-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-offered-ai-talent-up-to-300m/">denied those reports</a>, saying, “The size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented all over the place").</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/metas-ai-superintelligence-effort-sounds-just-like-its-failed-metaverse/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>If you had asked me a few years ago, I would have told you that the review you're about to read would be one of the most-read car reviews of the year. For a while—quite a long while, in fact—the Volkswagen ID Buzz was the hottest electric vehicle you couldn't buy. Starting in 2001, VW began teasing concept after concept that called back to its various Transporters and Kombis, classic microbuses reimagined as modern minivans. When the electric Buzz was greenlit for production after wowing crowds in 2017, it caught the attention of the kind of people who don't normally care about such things. Early coverage of the Buzz showed plenty of interest, and it looked like VW might have a real hit on its hands.</p>
<p>At least, that's how things looked for the first couple of years. It actually took seven years for a version of the ID Buzz to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/driving-the-2025-vw-id-buzz-was-worth-the-seven-year-wait/">go on sale in North America</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/weve-driven-volkswagens-retro-cool-id-buzz-electric-minivan/">two years after Europe</a>. Much of the optimism about EV adoption has now gone. Rather than reaching price parity with regular cars as battery prices dropped, everything just got more expensive during the pandemic. Add in recent worries about import tariffs and clean vehicle tax credits (available if you lease), and you start to understand why they remain a rare sight on the roads. Expect stares, glances, and even people taking out their phones as you drive past.</p>
<p>Some of the wait was for VW's more powerful rear drive unit, which provides this 2025 ID Buzz Pro S Plus with 282 hp (210 kW) and 413 lb-ft (560 Nm), paired with a 91 kWh battery pack. The official EPA range is 234 miles, which sounds disappointingly low, but it's <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=noform&amp;path=1&amp;year1=2025&amp;year2=2025&amp;make=Volkswagen&amp;baseModel=ID.%20Buzz&amp;srchtyp=ymm&amp;pageno=1&amp;rowLimit=50">correct</a>. It does seem like a very conservative estimate based on a week with the Buzz. 3.1 miles/kWh (20 kWh 100/km) was possible if I drove carefully, with high-twos possible when I didn't, and with 89 percent state of charge in the battery, the Buzz's onboard brain figured we had 255 miles (410 km) of range.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-vw-id-buzz-acres-of-space-but-being-electric-comes-at-a-premium/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you were looking for some motivation to follow your doctor's advice or remember to take your medicine, look no further than this grisly tale.</p>
<p>A 64-year-old man went to the emergency department of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston with a painful festering ulcer spreading on his left, very swollen ankle. It was a gruesome sight; the open sore was about 8 by 5 centimeters (about 3 by 2 inches) and was rimmed by black, ashen, and dark purple tissue. Inside, it oozed with streaks and fringes of yellow pus around pink and red inflamed flesh. It was 2 cm deep (nearly an inch). And it smelled.</p>
<p>The man told doctors it had all started two years prior, when dark, itchy lesions appeared in the area on his ankle—the doctors noted that there were multiple patches of these lesions on both his legs. But about five months before his visit to the emergency department, one of the lesions on his left ankle had progressed to an ulcer. It was circular, red, tender, and deep. He sought treatment and was prescribed antibiotics, which he took. But they didn't help.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/man-fails-to-take-his-medicine-the-flesh-starts-rotting-off-his-leg/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The release of Google's Veo 3 video generator in May represented a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">disconcerting leap in AI video quality</a>. While many of the viral AI videos we've seen are harmless fun, the model's pixel-perfect output can also be used for nefarious purposes. On TikTok, which may or may not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/supreme-court-rules-tiktok-can-be-banned/">be banned</a> in the coming months, users have noticed a surplus of racist AI videos, courtesy of Google's Veo 3.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/tiktok/racist-ai-generated-videos-are-newest-slop-garnering-millions-views-tiktok">MediaMatters</a>, numerous TikTok accounts have started posting AI-generated videos that use racist and antisemitic tropes in recent weeks. Most of the AI vitriol is aimed at Black people, depicting them as "the usual suspects" in crimes, absent parents, and monkeys with an affinity for watermelon. The content also targets immigrants and Jewish people. The videos top out at eight seconds and bear the "Veo" watermark, confirming they came from Google's leading AI model.</p>
<p>The compilation video below has examples pulled from TikTok since the release of Veo 3, but be warned, it contains racist and antisemitic content. Some of the videos are shocking, which is likely the point—nothing drives engagement on social media like anger and drama. MediaMatters reports that the original posts have numerous comments echoing the stereotypes used in the video.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/racist-ai-videos-created-with-google-veo-3-are-proliferating-on-tiktok/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Type Ia supernovae are critical tools in astronomy, since they all appear to explode with the same intensity, allowing us to use their brightness as a measure of distance. The distance measures they've given us have been critical to tracking the expansion of the Universe, which led to the recognition that there's some sort of dark energy hastening the Universe's expansion. Yet there are ongoing arguments over exactly how these events are triggered.</p>
<p>There's widespread agreement that type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarf stars. Normally, these stars are composed primarily of moderately heavy elements like carbon and oxygen, and lack the mass to trigger additional fusion. But if some additional material is added, the white dwarf can reach a critical mass and reignite a runaway fusion reaction, blowing the star apart. But the source of the additional mass has been somewhat controversial.</p>
<p>But there's an additional hypothesis that doesn't require as much mass: a relatively small explosion on a white dwarf's surface can compress the interior enough to restart fusion in stars that haven't yet reached a critical mass. Now, observations of the remains of a supernova provide some evidence of the existence of these so-called "double detonation" supernovae.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/new-evidence-that-some-supernovae-may-be-a-double-detonation/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There is increasing consumer demand for low- or non-alcoholic beers, and science is helping improve both the brewing process and the flavor profiles of the final product. One promising approach to better non-alcoholic beer involves substituting barley malt with milled rice, according to two recent papers—<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10942912.2025.2520907">one published</a> in the International Journal of Food Properties and the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03610470.2025.2499768">other published</a> in the Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists.</p>
<p>The chemistry of brewing beer is a very active area of research. For instance, earlier this year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/pea-sugars-can-speed-up-sour-beer-brewing/">we reported</a> on Norwegian scientists who <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.4c06748">discovered that</a> sour beers made with the sugars found in peas, beans, and lentils had similar flavor profiles to your average Belgian-style sour beer, yet the brewing process was shorter, with simpler steps. The pea-sugar beers had more lactic acid, ethanol, and flavor compounds than those brewed without them, and they were rated as having fruitier flavors and higher acidity. And sensory panelists detected no trace of undesirable "bean-y" flavors that have limited the use of pea-based ingredients in the past.</p>
<p>But replacing barley malt with rice still might strike some beer aficionados as sacrilege. In Germany, "purity laws" dictate that any beverage classified as a beer—including non-alcoholic beers—must only be made from malted barley, hops, water, and yeast. This produces non-alcoholic beers that have more "worty" flavors (due to higher levels of aldehyde) than might ideally be desired. But not every country is as stringent as Germany. The US is much more flexible when it comes to selecting raw materials, including rice, for brewing beers. In fact, Arkansas <a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=hb1491&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R">just passed a bill</a> this spring creating incentives for using rice (grown in Arkansas, of course) in the production of sake and beer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/rice-could-be-key-to-brewing-better-non-alcoholic-beer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T is rolling out a protection that prevents unauthorized changes to mobile accounts as the carrier attempts to fight a costly form of account hijacking that occurs when a scammer swaps out the SIM card belonging to the account holder.</p>
<p>The technique, known as SIM swapping or port-out fraud, has been a scourge that has vexed wireless carriers and their millions of subscribers for years. An indictment filed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/sim-swapping-ring-stole-400m-in-crypto-from-a-us-company-officials-allege/">last year</a> by federal prosecutors alleged that a single SIM swap scheme netted $400 million in cryptocurrency. The stolen funds belonged to dozens of victims who had used their phones for two-factor authentication to cryptocurrency wallets.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/t-mobile-pays-16-million-fine-for-three-years-worth-of-data-breaches/">separate scam</a> from 2022 gave unauthorized access to a T-Mobile management platform that subscription resellers, known as mobile virtual network operators, use to provision services to their customers. The threat actor gained access using a SIM swap of a T-Mobile employee, a phishing attack on another T-Mobile employee, and at least one compromise of an unknown origin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/att-rolls-out-wireless-account-lock-protection-to-curb-the-sim-swap-scourge/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It may not have escaped your attention that there's a new film about motorsport called <em>F1: The Movie</em>. It's a return-to-racing story with elements you'll have seen before, just maybe with other sports. A driver has been looking to slay his personal demons. There's a wise veteran, an impatient rookie, and an underdog team with its back to the wall. Except this time, the backdrop is the multicolored circus of Formula 1, seen close up at 200 mph.</p>
<p>Backed by Apple and made by people responsible for high-energy productions like the recent <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/top-gun-maverick-spoiler-free-review-a-worthy-return-to-the-danger-zone/">Top Gun: Maverick</a></em>, the film takes advantage of some of those same ingredients. For one, the filmmakers got an all-access pass from the powers that be, filming on the actual Formula 1 grid during 2023 and some of 2024. Having seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton as a producer helped with that. And the filmmakers were able to capture remarkable footage in the process thanks to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/inside-f1-movie-prototype-camera-tech-director-kosinski-on-capturing-brad-pitt-damson-idris/10734623/">powerful cameras</a> that are now much smaller than the versions they strapped to some US Navy fighter jets.</p>
<p>The movie comes with a prebuilt audience, one that's grown enormously in recent years. The <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/netflixs-formula-1-drive-to-survive-finds-pressure-at-the-core-of-f1/">Drive to Survive</a></em> effect is real: Motorsport, particularly F1, hasn't been this popular in decades. More and more young people follow the sport, and it's not just among the guys, either.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/f1-the-movie-takes-motorsport-into-the-imax-age/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, OpenAI raised objections in court, hoping to overturn a court order requiring the AI company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-confronts-user-panic-over-court-ordered-retention-of-chatgpt-logs/">to retain all ChatGPT logs "indefinitely,"</a> including deleted and temporary chats.</p>
<p>But Sidney Stein, the US district judge reviewing OpenAI's request, immediately denied OpenAI's objections. He was seemingly unmoved by the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-confronts-user-panic-over-court-ordered-retention-of-chatgpt-logs/">company's claims</a> that the order forced OpenAI to abandon "long-standing privacy norms" and weaken privacy protections that users expect based on ChatGPT's terms of service. Rather, Stein suggested that OpenAI's user agreement specified that their data could be retained as part of a legal process, which Stein said is exactly what is happening now.</p>
<p>The order was issued by magistrate judge Ona Wang just days after news organizations, led by The New York Times, requested it. The news plaintiffs claimed the order was urgently needed to preserve potential evidence in their copyright case, alleging that ChatGPT users are likely to delete chats where they attempted to use the chatbot to skirt paywalls to access news content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/nyt-to-start-searching-deleted-chatgpt-logs-after-beating-openai-in-court/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CBS owner Paramount has reached a $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump over his claim that <em>60 Minutes</em> deceptively manipulated a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris. Trump's lawsuit has been widely described as frivolous, but Paramount <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/cbs-owner-ready-to-settle-trump-lawsuit-in-apparent-bid-to-get-merger-approved/">seemed motivated to settle</a> because its pending $8.4 billion merger with Skydance needed regulatory approval from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Ars today, Paramount said it "has reached an agreement in principle to resolve the lawsuit filed by President Trump and Representative [Ronny] Jackson in the Northern District of Texas and a threatened defamation action concerning a separate <em>60 Minutes</em> report."</p>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for a bribery investigation into Paramount. "With Paramount folding to Donald Trump at the same time the company needs his administration's approval for its billion-dollar merger, this could be bribery in plain sight," she said in a statement today. "Paramount has refused to provide answers to a congressional inquiry, so I'm calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/paramount-accused-of-bribery-as-it-settles-trump-lawsuit-for-16-million/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Medical organizations are blasting the Senate's budget bill in the wake of its narrow passage Tuesday, warning of the dystopian health care system that will arise from the $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other federal health programs if it is passed into law. The bill has moved back to the House for a vote on the Senate's changes.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/nearly-12-million-people-would-lose-health-insurance-under-senate-gop-bill/">11.8 million people would lose their health insurance</a> over the next decade due to the cuts to Medicaid and other programs. Those cuts, which are deeper than the House's version of the bill, were maintained in the Senate's final version of the bill after amendments, with few concessions.</p>
<p>Organizations representing physicians, pediatricians, medical schools, and hospitals were quick to highlight the damage the proposal could cause.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/doctors-blast-senate-bill-point-out-that-11-8m-losing-health-insurance-is-bad/">Read full article</a></p>
