                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.13 of the Rocket Report! It's difficult for me to believe, but we have now entered the fourth quarter of the year. Accordingly, there are three months left in 2025, with a lot of launch action still to come. The remainder of the year will be headlined by Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket making its second flight (and landing attempt), and SpaceX's Starship making its final test flight of the year. There is also the slim possibility that Rocket Lab's Neutron vehicle will make its debut this year, but it will almost certainly slip into 2026.</p>

<p><strong>An Alpha rocket blows up on the pad</strong>. The booster stage for Firefly Aerospace's next Alpha rocket was destroyed Monday in a fiery accident on the company's vertical test stand in Central Texas, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/after-another-fiery-setback-it-seems-fireflys-alpha-rocket-is-still-in-beta/">Ars reports</a>. Firefly released a statement confirming the rocket "experienced an event that resulted in a loss of the stage." The company confirmed all personnel were safe and said ground teams followed "proper safety protocols." Imagery posted on social media platforms showed a fireball engulfing the test stand and a column of black smoke rising into the sky over Firefly's facility roughly 40 miles north of Austin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/rocket-report-alpha-explodes-on-test-stand-europe-wants-a-mini-starship/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At this point, you sort of expect Donald Trump's big-picture assaults on free speech, foreigners, and the rule of law. (Sometimes, as in the case of the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">outright attack on US higher ed</a>, all three are packaged in one convenient wrapper.) Although troubling and dangerous, these kinds of attacks are all at least <em>predictably</em> unhinged; most are drawn from the standard authoritarian playbook or its more recent "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy">illiberal democracies</a>" update.</p>
<p>It's when you look into the details, though, that one is constantly reminded: Nothing is too petty to be corrupted in Trumpworld.</p>

<p>Most directly, the fate of a NASA science mission to study Mars's upper atmosphere hinges on a successful launch. The second flight of Blue Origin's heavy-lifter will send two NASA-funded satellites toward the red planet to study the processes that drove Mars's evolution from a warmer, wetter world to the cold, dry planet of today.</p>
<p>A successful launch would also nudge Blue Origin closer to winning certification from the Space Force to begin launching national security satellites.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/blue-origin-aims-to-land-next-new-glenn-booster-then-reuse-it-for-moon-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When a robotics pioneer who has spent decades building humanoid machines recommends that you stand at least nine feet away from any full-size walking robot, you should probably listen.</p>
<p>"My advice to people is to not come closer than 3 meters to a full-size walking robot," Rodney Brooks <a href="https://rodneybrooks.com/why-todays-humanoids-wont-learn-dexterity/">writes</a> in a technical essay titled "Why Today’s Humanoids Won’t Learn Dexterity" published on his blog last week. "Until someone comes up with a better version of a two-legged walking robot that is much safer to be near, and even in contact with, we will not see humanoid robots get certified to be deployed in zones that also have people in them."</p>
<p>Brooks, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks">MIT professor emeritus</a> who co-founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRobot">iRobot</a> (of Roomba fame) and Rethink Robotics, believes companies pouring billions into humanoid development are chasing an expensive fantasy. Among other problems yet to be addressed, he warns that today's bipedal humanoids are fundamentally unsafe for humans to be near when they walk due to the massive kinetic energy they generate while maintaining balance. That stored-up energy can cause severe injury if the robot falls or its limbs strike someone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/why-irobots-founder-wont-go-within-10-feet-of-todays-walking-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As respiratory virus season draws near, no federal health official has signed off on recommendations for this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines, leaving the federal vaccination schedule without an update and access to the shots in limbo for some low-income children.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/30/covid-shot-delay-stymies-vaccines-for-children-program/">reporting by Stat</a> news earlier this week, two immunization program experts—who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal from the Trump administration—said that because there is no sign-off, states are not yet able to order COVID-19 shots for children who receive vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The federal program provides vaccines to children who are Medicaid-eligible and under- or uninsured, which includes around half of all children in the US.</p>
<p>Typically, federal vaccination recommendations come about after a panel of expert advisors for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)—publicly reviews vaccine data and votes on recommendations for use. Then, the CDC director decides whether to adopt those recommendations. While directors don't always adopt ACIP's recommendations, they usually do—and often on the same day as the ACIP vote. After that, the recommendation becomes part of federal vaccine guidance, and insurance companies and federal programs are required to cover the recommended shots.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/rfk-jr-drags-feet-on-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations-delaying-shots-for-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration had <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-universities-compact-federal-funds-agreement-df158493?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgqusOM65R0yAEf1pPKrFTL_lsq15BH9c-Uq0R7wNPYv8y5BuTkPS7JJAimHrc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68de6932&amp;gaa_sig=Q8i3d0gupSNY3yTIQ6DgsmVOzincu2488WO3tiM5cKUpzq-_-7lbPZTlhxU_hEC5oV0-wTPpzgHaU_M1MQvKVQ%3D%3D">offered nine schools a deal</a>: manage your universities in a way that aligns with administration priorities and get “substantial and meaningful federal grants," along with other benefits. Failure to accept the bargain would result in a withdrawal of federal programs that would likely cripple most universities. The offer, sent to a mixture of state and private universities, would see the government dictate everything from hiring and admissions standards to grading and has provisions that appear intended to make conservative ideas more welcome on campus.</p>
<p>The document was sent to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Virginia. However, independent reporting indicates that the administration will ultimately extend the deal to all colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Ars has obtained a copy of the proposed "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education," which makes the scope of the bargain clear in its introduction. "Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits," it suggests, while mentioning that those benefits include access to fundamental needs, like student loans, federal contracts, research funding, tax benefits, and immigration visas for students and faculty.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Legendary primatologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Goodall">Jane Goodall</a>, whose immersive field research living among chimpanzees in the 1960s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/science/earth/jane-goodall-dead.html">essentially redefined</a> the relationship between humans and animals, has died at the age of 91. <a href="https://janegoodall.org/jane-goodall-renowned-ethologist-conservationist-and-animal-behavior-expert-passes-away-at-age-91/">According to the Jane Goodall Institute</a> (JGI), Goodall died of natural causes while in California as part of a US speaking tour.</p>
<p>"Jane was passionate about empowering young people to become involved in conservation and humanitarian projects and she led many educational initiatives focused on both wild and captive chimpanzees," the institute <a href="https://janegoodall.org">wrote in a statement</a>. "[Her] discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science. She was always guided by her fascination with the mysteries of evolution, and her staunch belief in the fundamental need to respect all forms of life on Earth."</p>
<p>Born in April 1934, Goodall loved nature and wildlife from a very young age, so much so that her father once gave her a stuffed monkey doll that young Jane named Jubilee and kept for the rest of her life. Goodall found an early mentor in paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey, who employed her as a secretary at the National Museum in Nairobi. She accompanied Leakey and his wife, Mary Leakey, on a hunt for fossils at the Olduvai Gorge. Impressed with the young woman's potential, Leakey sent her to Tanzania to study chimpanzees in the Gombe forest. He also arranged for her to enter the PhD program in ethology at Cambridge University; Goodall completed her PhD in 1965 with a thesis based on that initial Gombe study. The research program she founded is still active today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/world-famous-primatologist-jane-goodall-dead-at-91/">Read full article</a></p>

But Q3 2025 tells a different tale. It's been a good three months for the beleaguered automaker, one that appears to have cleared out a lot of old inventory.</p>
<p>Tesla built a total of 447,450 electric vehicles between July and September this year. That's actually a 4.8 percent decrease compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/tesla-reverses-sales-slump-sees-modest-growth-in-q3/">the same three months last year</a>.</p>
<p>The Models 3 and Y production lines saw less of a slowdown—Tesla built 435,826 of these EVs, a 1.8 percent decline on last year. But the Models S and X, grouped together with the US-only Cybertruck, saw the greatest cutbacks. Just 11,624 of these collected models were produced, a 55.1 percent decrease compared to Q3 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-reverses-sales-decline-in-q3-sells-50k-more-cars-than-it-built/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the last month, NASA's interim administrator, Sean Duffy, has been giving interviews and speeches around the world, offering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/nasas-acting-chief-angry-about-talk-that-china-will-beat-us-back-to-the-moon/">a singular message</a>: "We are going to beat the Chinese to the Moon."</p>
<p>This is certainly what the president who appointed Duffy to the NASA post wants to hear. Unfortunately, there is a very good chance that Duffy's sentiment is false. Privately, many people within the space industry, and even at NASA, acknowledge that the US space agency appears to be holding a losing hand. Recently, some influential voices, such as former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, have spoken out.</p>
<p>"Unless something changes, it is highly unlikely the United States will beat China’s projected timeline to the Moon’s surface," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/ted-cruz-criticizes-trump-plan-to-cancel-sls-and-lunar-gateway-as-folly/#gsc.tab=0">Bridenstine said</a> in early September.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/how-america-fell-behind-china-in-the-lunar-space-race-and-how-it-can-catch-back-up/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Scammers have been abusing unsecured cellular routers used in industrial settings to blast SMS-based phishing messages in campaigns that have been ongoing since 2023, researchers said.</p>
<p>The routers, manufactured by China-based Milesight IoT Co., Ltd., are rugged Internet of Things devices that use cellular networks to connect traffic lights, electric power meters, and other sorts of remote industrial devices to central hubs. They come equipped with SIM cards that work with 3G/4G/5G cellular networks and can be controlled by text message, Python scripts, and web interfaces.</p>
<h2>An unsophisticated, yet effective, delivery vector</h2>
<p>Security company Sekoia on Tuesday <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/silent-smishing-the-hidden-abuse-of-cellular-router-apis/">said</a> that an analysis of “suspicious network traces” detected in its honeypots led to the discovery of a cellular router being abused to send SMS messages with phishing URLs. As company researchers investigated further, they identified more than 18,000 such routers accessible on the Internet, with at least 572 of them allowing free access to programming interfaces to anyone who took the time to look for them. The vast majority of the routers were running firmware versions that were more than three years out of date and had known vulnerabilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/that-annoying-sms-phish-you-just-got-may-have-come-from-a-box-like-this/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna may be people’s fault after all, according to a recent study.</p>
<p>A team of archaeologists recently examined animal bones at sites dating to the waning years of the last Ice Age. Their results suggest that extinct megafauna like giant sloths, giant armadillos, and elephant-like creatures were on the menu for Pleistocene hunters in South America. And that means human hunters may have played a nontrivial role in killing off the continent’s last great Ice Age megafauna.</p>
<h2>Giant ground sloth: It’s what’s for dinner</h2>
<p>Archaeologist Luciano Prates of Argentina's National University of La Plata and his colleagues counted the animal bones left behind by ancient people at 20 archaeological sites in modern-day Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. They compared the number of bones from extinct megafauna (technically, “megafauna” describes any animal over 44 kilograms) to the number of bones from smaller prey. They also tallied the remains of still-living species of megafauna like vicuñas. The archaeologists hoped to learn whether giant sloths, giant armadillos, and now-extinct species of horses were staples in the diets of Ice Age South Americans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/ice-age-hunters-in-south-america-preferred-now-extinct-megafauna/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The lawsuit was filed in August after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/apple-gets-yanked-into-elon-musks-chatbot-war-with-openai/">Musk raged on X</a> about Apple never listing Grok on its editorially curated "Must Have" apps list, which ChatGPT frequently appeared on.</p>
<p>According to Musk, Apple linking ChatGPT to Siri and other native iPhone features gave OpenAI exclusive access to billions of prompts that only OpenAI can use as valuable training data to maintain its dominance in the chatbot market. However, OpenAI and Apple are now mocking Musk's math in court filings, urging the court to agree that xAI's lawsuit is doomed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/openai-mocks-musks-math-in-suit-over-iphone-chatgpt-integration/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/its-october-1-so-the-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-is-dead-now/">we wrote about</a> how Ford, General Motors, and Tesla have reacted to the end of the clean vehicle tax credits. Now we know what Hyundai is doing, and the answer is "giving the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better/">Ioniq 5</a> a huge price cut."</p>
<p>The cheapest Ioniq 5 is still the SE RWD. A model-year 2025 SE RWD cost $42,600; for model-year 2026 it's now $35,000. The price cuts for other versions are even greater—between $9,150 and $9,800. For example, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/our-favorite-ev-goes-mad-max-the-2025-ioniq-5-xrt/">Ioniq 5 XRT</a> that you see in the photo above had a starting price of $55,500 for MY25; now it starts at a very reasonable $46,275.</p>
<p>"Hyundai is taking bold steps to ensure our award-winning Ioniq 5 remains a top choice for EV buyers," said Randy Parker, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor North America. "This pricing realignment reflects our commitment to delivering exceptional technology and innovation without compromise."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/hyundai-gives-the-ioniq-5-a-huge-price-cut-for-model-year-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Streaming is overtaking broadcast, cable, and satellite. But amid all the cord cutting lies a much smaller, yet intriguing, practice: going <em>back to cable</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2120271&amp;action=edit">Cord reviving</a> is when cord cutters, or people who previously abandoned traditional TV services in favor of streaming, decide to go back to traditional pay-TV services, like cable.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that this happens far less frequently than cord cutting. But TiVo's Q2 2025 Video Trends Report: North America <a href="https://go2.tivo.com/Video_Trends_Report_Q2_2025_NAM">released today</a> points to growth in cord reviving.

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">announced</a> Sora 2, its second-generation video-synthesis AI model that can now generate videos in various styles with synchronized dialogue and sound effects, which is a first for the company. OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls "cameos."</p>
<p>OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.</p>
<p>Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls "sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism." In May, Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">Veo 3</a> became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released <a href="https://wan25.net/">Wan 2.5</a>, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openais-sora-2-lets-users-insert-themselves-into-ai-videos-with-sound/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission yesterday voted to end funding for two programs designed to help schoolchildren and library patrons access the Internet.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr claims that Biden-era orders to establish the programs exceeded the FCC's authority. The FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reverses-unlawful-expansion-covid-era-wi-fi-hotspots-program-0">voted</a> 2-1 to <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-end-unlawful-inclusion-school-bus-wi-fi-through-e-rate-0">kill the programs</a>, with Republican Olivia Trusty voting with Carr and Democrat Anna Gomez dissenting.</p>
<p>In the previous administration, the FCC expanded the Universal Service Fund's E-Rate program in 2024 to let schools and libraries lend out Wi-Fi hotspots and services that could be used off-premises. The FCC separately decided in 2023 to let the E-Rate program pay for Wi-Fi service on school buses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/fcc-chairman-leads-cruel-vote-to-take-wi-fi-access-away-from-school-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months, many AI boosters have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/new-ai-model-turns-photos-into-explorable-3d-worlds-with-caveats/">increasingly interested</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/microsofts-new-interactive-ai-world-model-still-has-a-long-way-to-go/">generative video models</a> and their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-model-can-hallucinate-a-game-of-1993s-doom-in-real-time/">seeming ability</a> to show at least <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">limited emergent knowledge</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/new-physics-sim-trains-robots-430000-times-faster-than-reality/">the physical properties of the real world</a>. That kind of learning could underpin a robust version of a so-called "world model" that would represent a major breakthrough in generative AI's actual operant real-world capabilities.</p>
<p>Recently, Google's DeepMind Research tried to add some scientific rigor to how well video models can actually learn about the real world from their training data. In the bluntly titled paper <a href="https://video-zero-shot.github.io/">"Video Models are Zero-shot Learners and Reasoners,"</a> the researchers used <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">Google's Veo 3 model</a> to generate thousands of videos designed to test its abilities across dozens of tasks related to perceiving, modeling, manipulating, and reasoning about the real world.</p>
<figure class="video ars-wp-video">
  <div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative" style="aspect-ratio: 1.7777777777778;">
    <video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" id="video-2120175-3" width="1280" height="720" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/robot_throw_and_catch.mp4?_=3"></source></video>
  </div>

    <span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"></span>
      </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the paper, the researchers boldly claim that Veo 3 "can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for" (that's the "zero-shot" part of the title) and that video models "are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models." But digging into the actual results of those experiments, the researchers seem to be grading today's video models on a bit of a curve and assuming future progress will smooth out many of today's highly inconsistent results.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/can-todays-ai-video-models-accurately-model-how-the-real-world-works/">Read full article</a></p>
