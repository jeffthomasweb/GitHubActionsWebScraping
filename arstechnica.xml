              <![CDATA[<p>An ongoing attack is uploading hundreds of malicious packages to the open source node package manager (NPM) repository in an attempt to infect the devices of developers who rely on code libraries there, researchers said.</p>
<p>The malicious packages have names that are similar to legitimate ones for the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bignum.js">Bignum.js</a> code libraries and for various libraries for working with cryptocurrency. The campaign, which was active at the time this post was going live on Ars, was <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/supply-chain-security-typosquat-campaign-targeting-puppeteer-users/">reported</a> by researchers from the security firm Phylum. The discovery comes on the heels of a <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/trojanized-ethers-forks-on-npm-attempting-to-steal-ethereum-private-keys/">similar campaign</a> a few weeks ago targeting developers using forks of the Ethers.js library.</p>
<h2>Beware of the supply chain attack</h2>
<p>“Out of necessity, malware authors have had to endeavor to find more novel ways to hide intent and to obfuscate remote servers under their control,” Phylum researchers wrote. “This is, once again, a persistent reminder that supply chain attacks are alive and well.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/javascript-developers-targeted-by-hundreds-of-malicious-code-libraries/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The products made by the pharmacy, Fullerton Wellness LLC, in Ontario, California, include semaglutide, which is intended to mimic brand-name weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Fullerton also made tirzepatide, which is intended to mimic weight-loss and diabetes drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro.</p>
<p>The FDA became aware of the problem after a patient submitted a complaint to the regulator that a vial of semaglutide from Fullerton Wellness had an unidentified "black particulate" floating in it. Semaglutide, like tirzepatide, is injected under the skin and is intended to be sterile.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/drugmaker-shut-down-after-black-schmutz-found-in-injectable-weight-loss-drug/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court will soon weigh two cases that could potentially make it harder for misled investors to sue Big Tech companies after major scandals.</p>
<p>One case involves one of the largest tech scandals of all time, the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data breach. In 2019, Facebook agreed to pay "more than $5 billion in civil penalties to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had misled its users and investors over the privacy and security of user data on its platform," a Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-980/326742/20240924123045815_23-980%20Resp%20Brief.pdf">filing</a> said.</p>
<p>The other case involves an allegation that Nvidia intentionally hid how much of its 2017–2018 GPU demand was due to a volatile cryptocurrency boom and not Nvidia's core gaming business—allegedly misleading investors ahead of a crypto crash. After the bust, Nvidia suddenly had to slash half a billion dollars from its earnings projection, and market experts later estimated that the firm had understated its crypto-related revenue by more than a billion. In 2022, Nvidia paid a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022-79">$5.5 million SEC penalty</a> over the inadequate disclosures that one SEC chief said "deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/facebook-nvidia-push-scotus-to-limit-nuisance-investor-suits-after-scandals/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, TriStar Pictures released <a href="https://here-movie.com/"><em>Here</em></a>, a $50 million Robert Zemeckis-directed film that used real time generative AI face transformation techniques to portray actors Tom Hanks and Robin Wright across a 60-year span, marking one of Hollywood's first full-length features built around AI-powered visual effects.</p>
<p>The film adapts a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_(comics)">2014 graphic novel</a> set primarily in a New Jersey living room across multiple time periods. Rather than cast different actors for various ages, the production used AI to modify Hanks' and Wright's appearances throughout.</p>
<p>The de-aging technology comes from <a href="https://metaphysic.ai/">Metaphysic</a>, a visual effects company that creates real time face swapping and aging effects. During filming, the crew watched two monitors simultaneously: one showing the actors' actual appearances and another displaying them at whatever age the scene required.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/new-zemeckis-film-used-ai-to-de-age-tom-hanks-and-robin-wright/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>How did supermassive black holes end up at the center of every galaxy? A while back, it wasn't that hard to explain: That's where the highest concentration of matter is, and the black holes had billions of years to feed on it. But as we've looked ever deeper into the Universe's history, we keep finding supermassive black holes, which shortens the timeline for their formation. Rather than making a leisurely meal of nearby matter, these black holes have gorged themselves in a feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>With the advent of the Webb Space Telescope, the problem has pushed up against theoretical limits. The matter falling into a black hole generates radiation, with faster feeding meaning more radiation. And that radiation can drive off nearby matter, choking off the black hole's food supply. That sets a limit on how fast black holes can grow unless matter is somehow fed directly into them. The Webb was used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/half-of-the-mass-of-an-early-galaxy-is-in-its-central-black-hole/">identify early supermassive black holes</a> that needed to have been pushing against the limit for their entire existence.</p>
<p>But the Webb may have just identified a solution to the dilemma as well. It has spotted a black hole that appears to have been feeding at 40 times the theoretical limit for millions of years, allowing growth at a pace sufficient to build a supermassive black hole.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/researchers-spot-black-hole-feeding-at-40x-its-theoretical-limit/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>As I followed a friend down a flow-y, undulating single-track trail, I started laughing. Unlike my mountain bike-riding companion, I was on a gravel bike, the new Trek <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-sl/checkpoint-sl-7-axs-gen-3/p/47073/">Checkpoint SL 7 AXS Gen 3</a>. You might be wondering why a review of a gravel bike is starting with such a ride. The answer is simple—the Checkpoint had excelled everywhere else I rode it, so I was curious to see how it would fare on a non-technical MTB track. Amazingly well, as it turns out.</p>
<p>Unlike every other bike Ars has reviewed to this point, the Checkpoint SL 7 Gen 3 has no battery and no motor—there's no e- in this bike. As is the case with our other bike reviews, sometimes we ask for a specific model, but manufacturers tend to contact us when we’ve already got a garage full of bikes we’ve not finished the reviews for (there are currently 12 bikes in my garage, some of which belong to other family members).</p>
<p>Launched in 2018, the Checkpoint is Trek's gravel-centric bike. For 2025, Trek has split its gravel lineup into the third-generation Checkpoint Trek and the <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/drop-bar-gravel-bikes/checkmate/checkmate-slr-9-axs/p/46152/">Checkmate SLR 9 AXS</a>. The latter features a lighter-weight frame, a power meter, and SRAM's new <a href="https://www.sram.com/en/sram/road/series/red-xplr">Red XPLR groupset</a>. Selling for $11,999, the Checkmate is a gravel racer. Priced several thousand less at $5,699, the Checkpoint SL 7 AXS is now Trek's top gravel bike for those looking for a fun day out on the trails.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/the-trek-checkpoint-sl-7-axs-gen-3-may-be-the-perfect-gravel-bike/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Most one-use vape batteries are actually rechargeable, and this guy has proof.]]>

              <![CDATA[<p>Disposable vapes are indefensible. Many, or maybe most, of them contain rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, but manufacturers prefer to sell new ones. More than 260 million vape batteries are estimated to enter the trash stream every year in the UK alone. Vapers and vape makers are simply leaving an e-waste epidemic to the planet's future residents to sort out.</p>
<p>To make a point about how wasteful this practice is—and to also make a pretty rad project and video—Chris Doel took 130 disposable vape batteries (the bigger "3,500 puff" types with model 20400 cells) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/18650masterrace/comments/1gjbxf7/comment/lvcj5hk/">found littered at a music festival</a> and converted them into a 48-volt, 1,500-watt e-bike battery, one that powered an e-bike with almost no pedaling more than 20 miles. You can see the whole build and watch Doel zoom along trails <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVp9T8f_W4">on his YouTube video</a>.</p>

<p>To be clear: Do not do this. Do not put disposable vape cartridges in a vise clamp to "pop out" their components. Do not desolder them from vape cartridges that have a surprising amount of concentration still in them. Do not wire them together using a balance board, group them using 3D-printed cell holders, and then wire them in series. Heck, do not put that much power into a rear hub on a standard bike frame, at least more than once. Doel has a fire extinguisher present and visible on his workbench, and he shows you what happens when two of the wrong batteries happen to make momentary contact—smoke, coughing, and strong warnings.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/disposable-vapes-from-a-music-festival-can-power-a-beefy-e-bike-20-miles/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Henry VIII's favorite warship, the <em>Mary Rose</em>, sank in battle in 1545. Archaeologists successfully raised the ship in 1982, along with thousands of articles and the remains of 179 crew members—all remarkably well preserved thanks to the anaerobic conditions of the shipwreck created by the layers of soft sediment that accumulated over the wreckage.</p>
<p>A new analysis of some of the recovered bones reveals that whether someone is right- or left-handed could affect how their collarbone chemistry changes as they age, according to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0311717">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE. This has implications for our understanding not just of aging, but of bone conditions like fracture risk and osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/x-rayed-artifacts-from-famed-shipwreck-shed-light-on-secrets-of-tudor-armor">previously reported</a>, the earliest-known reference to the <em>Mary Rose</em> appears in a January 29, 1510, letter ordering the construction of two new ships for the young king: the <em>Mary Rose</em> and her sister ship, dubbed the <em>Peter Pomegranate</em>. Once the newly built ship had launched, Henry VIII wasted no time defying his advisers and declaring war on France in 1512. The <em>Mary Rose</em> served the monarch well through that conflict, as well as during a second war with the French that ran roughly from 1522 through 1525, after which it underwent a substantial overhaul.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/scientists-glean-clues-about-how-we-age-from-mary-rose-crew-bones/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If conventional wisdom were to be believed, the car we're reviewing today should not exist. Automakers are only interested in making very big, very expensive electric vehicles, leaving <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/think-evs-are-too-expensive-here-are-11-for-under-40k/">nothing for people with normal-sized budgets</a> and normal-sized needs. While it's true that those oversized EVs are overrepresented among new car launches, they aren't the only game in town. As an alternative, consider the Hyundai Kona Electric, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/10/the-new-2019-hyundai-kona-ev-is-a-clever-little-electric-crossover/">which we last sampled</a> in pre-pandemic times.</p>
<p>In fact, Kona Electric has changed quite a bit since we last drove one. Last year, an all-new model went on sale in North America, and it has carried over unchanged to its model year 2025 version. The range starts at $32,875 for the Kona Electric SE, which makes do with a 133 hp (99 kW) motor driving the front wheels, but the other trims offered—the $36,875 SEL, the $38,275 N Line (tested here), and the $41,050 Limited use a more powerful 201 hp (150 kW) motor. (All four have an identical 188 lb-ft (255 Nm) torque output.)</p>
<p>In terms of size and weight, the Kona Electric really is a refreshing change from EVs that are often approaching three tons. With its rear wing and slightly tweaked front, the N Line is 1.1 inches longer than the other Kona Electrics at 172.6 inches (4,384 mm) long. All Kona Electrics are 71.9 inches (1,826 mm) wide and 62 inches (1,575 mm) tall, with a 104.7-inch (2,659 mm) wheelbase. Curb weight is what counts as featherweight for an EV—3,880 lbs (1,760 kg).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/sick-of-supersized-evs-the-2025-hyundai-kona-electric-hits-the-spot/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Chinese space officials unveiled the design for the country's first super heavy lift rocket nearly a decade ago, it looked like a fairly conventional booster. The rocket was fully expendable, with three stages and solid motors strapped onto its sides.</p>
<p>Since then, the Asian country has been revising the design of this rocket, named Long March 9, in response to the development of reusable rockets by SpaceX. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/china-is-scrapping-plans-for-an-sls-like-rocket-in-favor-of-reusable-booster/#gsc.tab=0">As of two years ago</a>, China had recalibrated the design to have a reusable first stage.</p>
<p>Now, based on information released at a major airshow in Zhuhai, China, the design has morphed again. And this time, the plan for the Long March 9 rocket looks almost exactly like a clone of SpaceX's Starship rocket.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/chinas-long-term-lunar-plans-now-depend-on-developing-its-own-starship/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Tech companies are bracing ahead of the US presidential election, dreading the looming threat of more tariffs that could further restrict the flow of imports from China, no matter which candidate is elected.</p>
<p>Tariffs are a tax placed on imports and are intended to disrupt trade with foreign adversaries. While former President Donald Trump has frequently claimed that China pays for tariffs, in actuality, that tax is paid by US businesses and citizens any time they want to purchase a restricted good from China.</p>
<p>Used as a trade barrier, tariffs can place an economic burden on countries like China, but that burden is really only felt if businesses and consumers avoid importing goods. If companies cannot cost-effectively or practically switch suppliers—as is the case with China, which is a dominant global manufacturing hub in the tech industry—shrinking profit margins can trigger US businesses to spike prices for consumers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/laptop-smartphone-and-game-console-prices-could-soar-after-the-election/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Some of my favorite games deny me the thing I think I want most. <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty.1482655/">Elden Ring</a> </em>refuses to provide manageable save files (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-ground-me-into-dust-which-is-why-i-recommend-it/#gsc.tab=0">I paid for it</a>). <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/balatro-arrives-on-phones-sept-26-so-plan-your-sick-days-accordingly/#gsc.tab=0"><em>Balatro</em></a> withholds the final math on each hand played (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-the-long-dark">its developer suggests avoiding calculators</a>). And the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review-a-world-worth-saving/">modern X-COM games</a> force me to realize just how much a 98 percent chance to hit is not the same as 100 percent.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379910/Dystopika/"><em>Dystopika</em></a> (Steam, Windows, but also Proton/Whisky for Linux/Mac, per comments) is a city builder in maybe the strictest definition of that two-word descriptor, because it steadfastly refuses to distract you with non-building details. The game is described by its single developer, Matt Marshall, as having "no goals, no management, just creativity and dark cozy vibes."<em> Dystopika</em> does very little to explain how you should play it, because there's no optimal path for doing so. Your only job is to enjoy yourself, poking and prodding at a dark cyberpunk cityscape, making things that look interesting, pretty, grim, or however you like. It might seem restrictive, but it feels very freeing.</p>

<p>The game's interface is a small rail on the left side of the screen. Select "Building" and a random shape attaches to your cursor. You can right-click to change it, but you can't pick one. Place it, and then optionally place the cursor near its top to change its height. Making one building taller will raise smaller buildings nearby. Reaching certain heights, or densities, or something (it's not explained) will "unlock" certain new buildings, landmarks, and decorations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/dystopika-takes-all-the-management-out-of-a-cyberpunk-city-simulator/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“The number of different categories of space weapons that [China has] created and ... the speed with which they’re doing it is very threatening,” said General Chance Saltzman, head of space operations at the US military’s recently created force tasked with protecting American interests in space.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fungi can be enigmatic organisms. Mushrooms or other structures may be visible above the soil, but beneath lurks a complex network of filaments, or hyphae, known as the mycelium. It is even possible for fungi to communicate through the mycelium—despite having no brain.</p>
<p>Other brainless life-forms (such as slime molds) have surprising ways of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/organism-without-a-brain-creates-external-memories-for-navigation/">navigating their surroundings</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/01/slime-mold-macdonald-farms-its-bacterial-meals/">surviving through communication</a>. Wanting to see whether fungi could recognize food in different arrangements, researchers from Tohoku University and Nagaoka College in Japan observed how the mycelial network of <i>Phanerochaete velutina,</i> a fungus that feeds off dead wood, grew on and around wood blocks arranged in different shapes.</p>
<p>The way the mycelial network spread out, along with its wood decay activity, differed based on the wood block arrangements. This suggests communication because the fungi appeared to find where the most nutrients were and grow in those areas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/fungi-may-not-think-but-they-can-communicate/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Old-school Apple fans probably remember a time, just before the iPhone became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/07/iphone-users-spend-147-hours-a-month-playing-games/">a massive gaming platform in its own right</a>, when Apple released a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/05/wicked-cool-apple-gaming-wednesday/">wide</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/09/5439/">range</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/12/peggle-and-bomberman-keep-the-good-ipod-gaming-times-flowin/">games</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/games-games-games-one-for-your-ipod-and-one-for-your-iphone/">designed</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/11/new-ipod-game-phase-rhythm-games-on-a-clickwheel-yippee/">late-model</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/09/tetris-ms-pac-man-sudoku-for-new-ipods-released/">clickwheel</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/07/game-review-song-summoner-the-unsing-heroes-ipod/">iPods</a>. While those clickwheel-controlled titles <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/looking-back-at-the-history-of-ipod-click-wheel-games/">didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire</a>, they represent an important historical stepping stone in Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/the-mac-gaming-console-time-has-forgot/">long journey</a> through the game industry.</p>
<p>Today, though, these clickwheel iPod games are on the verge of becoming lost media—impossible to buy or redownload from iTunes and protected on existing devices by incredibly strong Apple DRM. Now, the classic iPod community is engaged in <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject">a quest to preserve these games</a> in a way that will let enthusiasts enjoy these titles on real hardware for years to come.</p>
<h2>Perhaps too well-protected</h2>
<p>The short heyday of iPod clickwheel gaming ran from late 2006 to early 2009, when Apple partnered with major studios like Sega, Square Enix, and Electronic Arts to release 54 distinct titles for $7.49 each. By 2011, though, the rise of iOS gaming made these clickwheel iPod titles such an afterthought that Apple <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-removes-ipod-click-wheel-games-from-itunes-store/">completely removed them from the iTunes store</a>, years before the classic iPod line was discontinued for good in 2014.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">Read full article</a></p>
