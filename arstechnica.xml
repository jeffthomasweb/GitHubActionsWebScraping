<p>To drink raw milk at any time is to flirt with dangerous germs. But, amid an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in US dairy cows, the risks have ratcheted up considerably. Health experts have stepped up warnings against drinking raw milk during the outbreak, the scope of which is still unknown.</p>
<p>Yet, raw milk enthusiasts are undaunted by the heightened risk. The California-based Raw Milk Institute called the warnings "<a href="https://www.rawmilkinstitute.org/updates/avian-flu-and-raw-milk-a-common-sense-approach">clearly fearmongering</a>." The institute's founder, Mark McAfee, told the Los Angeles Times this weekend that his customers are, in fact, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-05-12/raw-milk-enthusiasts-uncowed-by-bird-flu-risk-in-dairy">specifically requesting raw milk from H5N1-infected cows</a>. According to McAfee, his customers believe, without evidence, that directly drinking high levels of the avian influenza virus will give them immunity to the deadly pathogen.</p>
<p>Expert Michael Payne told the LA Times that the idea amounts to "playing Russian roulette with your health." Payne, a researcher and dairy outreach coordinator at the Western Institute for Food Safety and Security at UC Davis, added that "Deliberately trying to infect yourself with a known pathogen flies in the face of all medical knowledge and common sense."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024168#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024168&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been nearly four years since the US Air Force made its selections for companies to launch military payloads during the mid-2020s. The military chose United Launch Alliance, and its Vulcan rocket, to launch 60 percent of these missions; and it chose SpaceX, with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, to launch 40 percent.</p>
<p>Although the large Vulcan rocket was still in development at the time, it was expected to take flight within the next year or so. Upon making the award, an Air Force official said the military believed Vulcan would soon be ready to take flight. United Launch Alliance was developing the Vulcan rocket in order to no longer be reliant on RD-180 engines that are built in Russia and used by its Atlas V rocket.</p>
<p>"I am very confident with the selection that we have made today," William Roper, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology, and logistics, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/the-air-force-selects-ula-and-spacex-for-mid-2020s-launches/">said at the time</a>. "We have a very low-risk path to get off the RD-180 engines."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024049#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024049&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At this point, anyone with even a passing interest in AI is very familiar with the process of typing out messages to a chatbot and getting back long streams of text in response. Today's announcement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">ChatGPT-4o</a>—which lets users converse with a chatbot using real-time audio and video—might seem like a mere lateral evolution of that basic interaction model.</p>
<p>After looking through <a href="https://vimeo.com/openai">over a dozen video demos</a> OpenAI posted alongside today's announcement, though, I think we're on the verge of something more like a sea change in how we think of and work with large language models. While we don't yet have access to ChatGPT-4o's audio-visual features ourselves, the important non-verbal cues on display here—both from GPT-4o and from the users—make the chatbot instantly feel much more human. And I'm not sure the average user is fully ready for how they might feel about that.</p>
<h2>It thinks it's people</h2>
<p>Take <a href="https://vimeo.com/945587876">this video</a>, where a newly expectant father looks to ChatGPT-4o for an opinion on a dad joke ("What do you call a giant pile of kittens? A meow-ntain!"). The old ChatGPT4 could easily type out the same responses of "Congrats on the upcoming addition to your family!" and "That's perfectly hilarious. Definitely a top-tier dad joke." But there's definitely much more impact to <em>hearing</em> GPT-4o give that same information in the video, complete with the gentle laughter and rising and falling vocal intonations of a lifelong friend.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024129#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024129&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has released the latest updates for virtually all of its actively supported devices today. Most include <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">a couple handfuls of security updates</a>, some new features for Apple News+ subscribers, and something called Cross-Platform Tracking Protection for Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>The iOS 17.5, iPadOS 17.5, macOS 4.5, watchOS 10.5, tvOS 17.5, and HomePod Software 17.5 updates are all available to download now.</p>

<p>Cross-Platform Tracking Protection notifications alert users "if a compatible Bluetooth tracker they do not own is moving with them, regardless of what operating system the devices is paired with." Apple has already implemented protections to prevent AirTag stalking, and Cross-Platform Tracking Protection implements some of those same safeguards for devices paired to non-Apple phones.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024075#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024075&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, OpenAI employee William Fedus <a href="https://x.com/LiamFedus/status/1790064963966370209">confirmed</a> on X that a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/rumors-swirl-about-mystery-gpt2-chatbot-that-some-think-is-gpt-5-in-disguise/">mysterious chat-topping AI chatbot</a> known as "gpt-chatbot" that had been undergoing testing on LMSYS's Chatbot Arena and frustrating experts was, in fact, OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">newly announced GPT-4o</a> AI model. He also revealed that GPT-4o had topped the Chatbot Arena leaderboard, achieving the highest documented score ever.</p>

<p>"GPT-4o is our new state-of-the-art frontier model. We’ve been testing a version on the LMSys arena as im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot," Fedus tweeted.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The new iPad Pro is a technical marvel, with one of the best screens I’ve ever seen, performance that few other machines can touch, and a new, thinner design that no one expected.</p>
<p>It’s a prime example of Apple flexing its engineering and design muscles for all to see. Since it marks the company’s first foray into OLED beyond the iPhone and the first time a new M-series chip has debuted on something other than a Mac, it comes across as a tech demo for where the company is headed beyond just tablets.</p>
<p>Still, it remains unclear why most people would spend one, two, or even three thousand dollars on a tablet that, despite its amazing hardware, does less than a comparably priced laptop—or at least does it a little more awkwardly, even if it's impressively quick and has a gorgeous screen.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023366#p3">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023366&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The iPad Air has been a lot of things in the last decade-plus. In 2013 and 2014, the first iPad Airs were just <em>The iPad</em>, and the “Air” label simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/review-apples-ipad-air-is-a-big-tablet-without-all-the-baggage/">denoted</a> how much lighter and more streamlined they were than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/04/ipad-review/">the initial 2010 iPad</a> and 2011’s long-lived <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/03/ipad-2-the-ars-review/">iPad 2</a>. After that, the iPad Air 2 survived for years as an entry-level model, as Apple focused on introducing and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/11/ipad-pro-review-mac-like-speed-with-all-the-virtues-and-limitations-of-ios/">building out the iPad Pro</a>.</p>
<p>The Air disappeared for a while after that, but it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/ipad-air-and-ipad-mini-2019-review-apples-tablets-strike-an-ideal-balance/">returned in 2019</a> as an in-betweener model to bridge the gap between <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/04/review-apples-329-ipad-is-for-people-who-have-never-upgraded-their-tablet/">the $329 iPad</a> (no longer called “Air,” despite reusing the first-gen Air design) and more-expensive and increasingly powerful iPad Pros. It definitely made sense to have a hardware offering to span the gap between the basic no-frills iPad and the iPad Pro, but pricing and specs could make things complicated. The main issue for the last couple of years has been the base Air's 64GB of storage—scanty enough that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/14/ipad-air-5-lacks-memory-swap-stage-manager/">memory swapping doesn't even work on it</a>— and the fact that stepping up to 256GB brought the Air too close to the price of the 11-inch iPad Pro.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/">2024 M2 iPad Air</a>, now available in <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air/11-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi">11-inch</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air/13-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi">13-inch</a> models for $599 and $799, respectively. Apple solved the overlap problem this year partly by bumping the Air's base storage to a more usable 128GB and partly by making the 11-inch iPad Pro so much more expensive that it almost entirely eliminates any pricing overlap (only the 1TB 11-inch Air, at $1,099, is more expensive than the cheapest 11-inch iPad Pro).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023520#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023520&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Federal agencies, health care associations, and security researchers are warning that a ransomware group tracked under the name Black Basta is ravaging critical infrastructure sectors in attacks that have targeted more than 500 organizations in the past two years.</p>
<p>One of the latest casualties of the native Russian-speaking group, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/tech/cyberattack-ascension-ambulances-hospitals/index.html">according to CNN</a>, is Ascension, a St. Louis-based health care system that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states. A network intrusion that struck the nonprofit last week <a href="https://about.ascension.org/cybersecurity-event">​​took down</a> many of its automated processes for handling patient care, including its systems for managing electronic health records and ordering tests, procedures, and medications. In the aftermath, Ascension has diverted ambulances from some of its hospitals and relied on manual processes.</p>
<h2>“Severe operational disruptions”</h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-131a">Advisory</a> published Friday, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Black Basta has victimized 12 of the country’s 16 critical infrastructure sectors in attacks that it has mounted on 500 organizations spanning the globe. The nonprofit health care association Health-ISAC issued its own <a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://h-isac.org/black-basta-threat-actor-emerges-as-a-major-threat-to-the-healthcare-industry/">advisory</a> on the same day that warned that organizations it represents are especially desirable targets of the group.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024051#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024051&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two weeks ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk enacted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-to-lay-off-everyone-working-on-superchargers-new-vehicles/">widespread layoffs throughout the company</a>, including the 500-strong team responsible for the brand's Supercharger. Now, Tesla is looking to hire some of them back, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/tesla-rehires-some-supercharger-workers-weeks-after-musk-s-culling?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTYyMjU0MiwiZXhwIjoxNzE2MjI3MzQyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTREVRQjJUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIzNDVFQTA0MjNBMUQ0NTI2QjY1QkNBNUZDRUJGQThGNiJ9.2RNvF37kKk0-xvIIdZ-YnoQY2ND7fdX3l67QJ5XqjBk">Bloomberg reports</a>, as Musk promises to spend $500 million expanding the network.</p>
<p>The Supercharger network is inarguably Tesla's crown jewel. The company recognized early on that, even though its owners slow-charged at home each night, knowing they had the ability to rapidly recharge on the road was critical in making an electric vehicle an acceptable alternative to existing vehicles.</p>
<p>Since then, it has built out more than 2,000 charging stations in the US alone, with more than 25,000 plugs. More than that, the chargers invariably work, something that is often not true for other charging networks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024018#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024018&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T's application to end its landline phone obligations in California is likely to be rejected by state officials following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/dont-let-them-drop-us-landline-users-protest-att-copper-retirement-plan/">protest from residents</a> worried about losing access to phone lines.</p>
<p>An administrative law judge at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recommended rejection of the application in a <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M531/K085/531085885.PDF">proposed decision</a> released Friday. The CPUC is set to vote on finalizing the proposed decision at its June 20 meeting.</p>
<p>Administrative Law Judge Thomas Glegola found that AT&amp;T's <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M502/K977/502977267.PDF">application</a> to end its Carrier of Last Resort (COLR) obligation should be dismissed with prejudice. State rules require a replacement COLR in order to relieve AT&amp;T of its duties, but there is no other COLR in AT&amp;T's wireline territory "and no potential COLR volunteered to replace AT&amp;T," he wrote.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023973#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023973&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fans of the dystopian sci-fi thriller series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_Black"><em>Orphan Black</em></a> have been waiting to see more of the new TV show set in the same fictional world: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_Black:_Echoes">Orphan Black: Echoes</a>,</em> starring Krysten Ritter (of <em>Jessica Jones</em> fame). That time has arrived with AMC's release of the official trailer.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the original <em>Orphan Black</em> series below.)</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_Black">original series</a> was co-created by Graeme Manson and John Fawcett. Tatiana Maslany (<em>She-Hulk</em>) starred as Sarah Manning, a British con artist in Toronto who witnessed a woman who seemed like her doppelgänger commit suicide and assumed her identity as a police detective. Sarah soon discovered that both she and the dead woman were clones. And there were many more clones out there—all expertly played by Maslany, who finally won that richly deserved Emmy in 2016—thanks to the eugenics research of the Dyad Institute, the base of operations for the so-called "Neolution."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023846#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023846&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, OpenAI debuted <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">GPT-4o</a> (o for "omni"), a major new AI model that can ostensibly converse using speech in real time, reading emotional cues and responding to visual input. It operates faster than OpenAI's previous best model, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">GPT-4 Turbo</a>, and will be free for ChatGPT users and available as a service through API, rolling out over the next few weeks, OpenAI says.</p>

<p>OpenAI revealed the new audio conversation and vision comprehension capabilities in a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQacCB9tDaw&amp;t=2s">livestream</a> titled "OpenAI Spring Update," presented by OpenAI CTO Mira Murati and employees Mark Chen and Barret Zoph that included live demos of GPT-4o in action.</p>
<p>OpenAI claims that GPT-4o responds to audio inputs in about 320 milliseconds on average, which is similar to human response times in conversation, according to a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0903616106">2009 study</a>, and much shorter than the typical 2–3 second lag experienced with previous models. With GPT-4o, OpenAI says it trained a brand-new AI model end-to-end using text, vision, and audio in a way that all inputs and outputs "are processed by the same neural network."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023751#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023751&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has spent at least two months threatening more than a dozen indie games developers with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/devs-left-with-tough-choices-as-warner-bros-ends-all-adult-swim-games-downloads/">the "retirement" of their games</a>, with little to no response as to why they couldn't do something simple and much better for the games' players and creators.</p>
<p>Late last week, one of the Adult Swim Games creators impacted by Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) seeming shutdown <a href="https://twitter.com/superjoebob/status/1788727928143872455">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that he received an email from Warner Bros. indicating that his <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/312530/Duck_Game/">Duck Game</a></em> was "safe." "[T]he game is being returned to corptron along with [its] store pages on all platforms," Landon wrote. The same went for Owen Deery, whose notice from WBD about his game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/390040/Small_Radios_Big_Televisions/"><em>Small Radios Big Televisions</em></a> brought attention to the media conglomerate's actions and who <a href="https://twitter.com/owendeery/status/1788570770232300021">posted</a> that his game, too, will have its ownership and store listings returned to him.</p>

<p>An Australian federal court sided with Elon Musk on Monday, <a href="https://www.comcourts.gov.au/file/Federal/P/NSD474/2024/3979442/event/31790155/document/2277925">rejecting</a> an Australian safety regulator's request to extend a temporary order blocking a terrorist attack video from spreading on Musk's platform X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>The video showed a teen stabbing an Assyrian bishop, Mar Mari Emmanuel—whose popular, sometimes controversial TikTok sermons often garner millions of views—during a church livestream that rapidly spread online.</p>
<p>Police later determined it was a religiously motivated terrorist act after linking the 16-year-old charged in the stabbing to a group of seven teens "accused of following a violent extremist ideology in raids across Sydney," AP News <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sydney-church-stabbing-search-warrants-bishop-stabbed-australia-29bca1f98cea72947a05435ba6202bdb">reported</a>. Bishop Emmanuel has since reassured his followers that he recovered quickly and forgave the teen, Al Jazeera <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/19/teenager-charged-with-terrorism-over-australia-church-stabbing-attack">reported</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023878#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023878&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last year, researchers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/beethovens-genome-sequenced-for-first-time-yields-clues-on-cause-of-death/">sequenced the genome</a> of famed composer Ludwig van Beethoven for the first time, based on authenticated locks of hair. The same team has now analyzed two of the locks for toxic substances and found extremely high levels of lead, as well as arsenic and mercury, according to a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/advance-article/doi/10.1093/clinchem/hvae054/7651113">recent letter</a> published in the journal Clinical Chemistry.</p>
<p>“It definitely shows Beethoven was exposed to high concentrations of lead,” Paul Janetto, co-author and director of the Mayo Clinic's Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/health/beethoven-deaf-lead-hair.html">told The New York Times</a>. “These are the highest values in hair I’ve ever seen. We get samples from around the world, and these values are an order of magnitude higher.” That said, the authors concluded that the lead exposure was not sufficient to actually kill the composer, although Beethoven very likely did suffer adverse health effects because of it.</p>
<p>As<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/beethovens-genome-sequenced-for-first-time-yields-clues-on-cause-of-death/"> previously reported</a>, Beethoven was plagued throughout his life by myriad health problems. The composer began losing his hearing in his mid- to late 20s, experiencing tinnitus and the loss of high-tone frequencies in particular. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven#Deafness">He claimed</a> the onset began with a fit in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer. By his mid-40s, he was functionally deaf and unable to perform public concerts, although he could still compose music.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023745#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023745&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developers of team-based shooter <em>Marvel Rivals</em> have apologized for a contract clause that made creators promise not to provide "subjective negative reviews of the game" in exchange for early access to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/">a closed alpha test</a>.</p>
<p>The controversial early access contract gained widespread attention over the weekend when streamer Brandon Larned <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792">shared a portion on social media</a>. In the "non-disparagement" clause shared by Larned, creators who are provided with an early download code are asked not to "make any public statements or engage in discussions that are detrimental to the reputation of the game." In addition to the "subjective negative review" example above, the clause also specifically prohibits "making disparaging or satirical comments about any game-related material" and "engaging in malicious comparisons with competitors or belittling the gameplay or differences of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>."</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Extremely disappointed in <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MarvelRivals</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple creators asked for key codes to gain access to the playtest and are asked to sign a contract.</p>
<p>The contract signs away your right to negatively review the game.</p>
<p>Many streamers have signed without reading just to play</p>

<p>In a Discord post <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/marvel-rivals/contract">noticed by PCGamesN</a> over the weekend, Chinese developer NetEase apologized for what it called "inappropriate and misleading terms" in the contract. "Our stand is absolutely open for both suggestions and criticisms to improve our games, and... our mission is to make Marvel Rivals better [and] satisfy players by those constructive suggestions."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023800#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023800&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>President Joe Biden is expected to levy new 100 percent tariffs targeted at specific Chinese industries, including electric vehicles, on Tuesday. The announcement follows growing calls from automakers, unions, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/ban-chinese-electric-vehicles-now-demands-us-senator/">bipartisan efforts in Congress</a> to address the problem of China unfairly subsidizing its own industries to undermine foreign competitors.</p>
<h2>Why are Chinese EVs so cheap?</h2>
<p>The Chinese government has been giving its green industries heavy direct subsidies for some time now, <a href="https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/news/chinas-massive-subsidies-for-green-technologies/">far in excess of those handed out by US or European governments</a>. For EV makers like BYD, this has meant billions of dollars a year, in addition to the consumer-facing tax benefit for car buyers, similar to how EV sales are incentivized in the US.</p>
<p>Brands like BYD have concentrated on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/small-built-chinese-ev-called-seagull-poses-big-110158506">making their cars cheaper to build</a>—only using one windshield wiper instead of two, for example—but also through vertical integration. Other than Tesla, automakers in the US, Europe, Japan, and Korea instead rely heavily on multiple tiers of suppliers, most of whom supply parts to more than one automaker.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023796#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023796&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Somehow, Google's midrange phone just keeps getting better. The Pixel 8a improves on many things over the Pixel 7a—it has a better display, a longer support cycle, and the usual yearly CPU upgrades, all at the same $499 price as last year. Who could complain? The Pixel A series was already the best bargain in smartphones, and there's now very little difference between it and a flagship-class device.</p>
<p>Year over year, the 6.1-inch, 2400×1080 display is being upgraded from 90 Hz to 120 Hz, giving you essentially the same experience you'd get on the "flagship" Pixels. The SoC is the same processor you'd get in the Pixel 9, a Google Tensor G3. That's a 4 nm chip with one Arm Cortex X3, four Cortex A715 cores, four Cortex A510 cores, and a Mali G715 GPU.</p>
<p>Previously, the 120 Hz display was the primary thing A-series owners were missing out on compared to the more expensive Pixels, so its addition is a huge deal. Any comparison between the "midrange" Pixel 8a and the "flagship" 6.2-inch Pixel 8 will now just be splitting hairs. The flagship gets an extra 0.1 inches of display, 2 percent more battery, and Wi-Fi 6E instead of Wi-Fi 7. The cameras are technically newer, but since they all run the same image-stacking software, the images look very similar. Are those things worth an extra $200? No, they are not.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023032#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023032&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brussels is set to issue new antitrust charges against Microsoft over concerns that the software giant is undermining rivals to its videoconferencing app Teams.</p>
<p>According to three people with knowledge of the move, the European Commission is pressing ahead with a formal charge sheet against the world’s most valuable listed tech company over concerns it is restricting competition in the sector.</p>
<p>Microsoft last month offered concessions as it sought to avoid regulatory action, including extending a plan to unbundle Teams from other software such as Office, not just in Europe but across the world.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023756#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023756&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Aston Martin provided flights from London to Seville and accommodation so Ars could drive the Vantage. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>It's high time Aston Martin had a winner on its hands. Last year it updated the DB12 with a smart new face, plenty of power, and the sort of infotainment you'd hope for from a luxury GT. The Vantage, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/aston-martin-reveals-its-all-new-vantage-a-503hp-v8-sports-car/">the firm's 'entry-level' car</a>, has been given similar treatment in the hopes that it can peel a few more people away from Porsche dealerships.</p>
<p>Aston is looking not only to make better cars, but also to shift its image—it's aiming to be seen as more luxurious than before, and is throwing as much power at the cars as possible. At first glance, it looks like Aston has cooked up something truly delightful.</p>
<p>The new car is more than 150 hp (112 kW) more powerful than the one it replaces, with 656 hp (490 kW) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) from a wonderfully appointed turbocharged 4.0 L V8. Its 0 to 60 time is quoted at 3.4 seconds, and Aston reckons that if you have enough space (and no speed limits) you'll see the far side of 200 mph (321 km/h).
