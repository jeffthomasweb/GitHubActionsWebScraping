                            <![CDATA[<p>Russian-state hackers wasted no time exploiting a critical Microsoft Office vulnerability that allowed them to compromise the devices inside diplomatic, maritime, and transport organizations in more than half a dozen countries, researchers said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The threat group, tracked under names including APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Forest Blizzard, and Sofacy, pounced on the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-21509, less than 48 hours after Microsoft released an urgent, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2026-21509">unscheduled security update</a> late last month, the researchers said. After reverse-engineering the patch, group members wrote an advanced exploit that installed one of two never-before-seen backdoor implants.</p>
<h2>Stealth, speed, and precision</h2>
<p>The entire campaign was designed to make the compromise undetectable to endpoint protection. Besides being novel, the exploits and payloads were encrypted and ran in memory, making their malice hard to spot. The initial infection vector came from previously compromised government accounts from multiple countries and were likely familiar to the targeted email holders. Command and control channels were hosted in legitimate cloud services that are typically allow-listed inside sensitive networks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/russian-state-hackers-exploit-office-vulnerability-to-infect-computers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has so far been unable to access data from a Washington Post reporter's iPhone because it was protected by Apple's Lockdown Mode when agents seized the device from the reporter's home, the US government said in a court filing.</p>
<p>FBI agents were able to access the reporter's work laptop by telling her to place her index finger on the MacBook Pro's fingerprint reader, however. This occurred during the January 14 search at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fbi-fights-leaks-by-seizing-washington-post-reporters-phone-laptops-and-watch/">previously reported</a>, the FBI executed a search warrant at Natanson's home as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally leaking classified data. FBI agents seized an iPhone 13 owned by the Post, one MacBook Pro owned by the Post and another MacBook Pro owned by Natanson, a 1TB portable hard drive, a voice recorder, and a Garmin watch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/fbi-stymied-by-apples-lockdown-mode-after-seizing-journalists-iphone/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think">announced</a> that its AI chatbot, Claude, will remain free of advertisements, drawing a sharp line between itself and rival OpenAI, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/openai-to-test-ads-in-chatgpt-as-it-burns-through-billions/">began</a> testing ads in a low-cost tier of ChatGPT last month. The announcement comes alongside a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/04/anthropic-no-ads-claude-chatbot-openai-chatgpt.html">Super Bowl ad campaign</a> that mocks AI assistants that interrupt personal conversations with product pitches.</p>
<p>"There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them," Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-is-a-space-to-think">wrote</a> in a blog post. The company argued that including ads in AI conversations would be "incompatible" with what it wants Claude to be: "a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking."</p>
<p>The stance contrasts with OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">January announcement</a> that it would begin testing banner ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the US. OpenAI said those ads would appear at the bottom of responses and would not influence the chatbot's actual answers. Paid subscribers on Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see ads on ChatGPT.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/should-ai-chatbots-have-ads-anthropic-says-no/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A US House committee with oversight of NASA unanimously passed a "reauthorization" act for the space agency on Wednesday. The legislation must still be approved by the full House before being sent to the Senate, which may take up consideration later this month.</p>
<p>Congress passes such reauthorization bills every couple of years, providing the space agency with a general sense of the direction legislators want to see NASA go. They are distinct from appropriations bills, which provide actual funding for specific programs, but nonetheless play an important role in establishing space policy.</p>
<p>There weren't any huge surprises in the legislation, but there were some interesting amendments. Most notably among these was the <a href="https://republicans-science.house.gov/_cache/files/4/0/40988463-9ed0-40a5-b6a3-0a39c44afd60/1ECF5B4783B63BD8DA58C5C75705110FB14C764050338F3A915D8D3CACF1B373.babin-amendment---nasa-reauth-amdt1-xml.pdf">Amendment No. 01</a>, offered by the chair of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Rep.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is so far not stepping in to help Elon Musk end a lawsuit raised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his 2022 Twitter takeover, a US district judge said this week.</p>
<p>Filed by the SEC in the final days of Joe Biden's administration, the lawsuit seeks $150 million in disgorgement, plus interest, as well as civil penalties and an injunction blocking Musk from future wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/sec-sues-elon-musk-says-he-cheated-twitter-investors-out-of-150-million/">complaint alleged</a> that Musk quietly acquired a 9 percent stake in Twitter without filing necessary timely disclosures to alert other investors of a potential change in company control. This allowed Musk to acquire over 70 million shares at an artificially lower price, the SEC alleged, causing substantial economic harm to investors selling Twitter common stock, some of whom have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/two-tweets-muddy-elon-musks-path-to-squashing-sec-probe/">separately sued</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-ghosts-musk-wont-back-claims-sec-lawsuit-was-political-harassment/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health under the Trump administration, appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Tuesday. In the wide-ranging hearing, Bhattacharya defended the chaotic and disruptive cuts at the institutes he helms while carefully wording responses related to vaccines—seemingly to avoid contradicting his boss, anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>As Bhattacharya testified, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the HELP committee's ranking member, released a <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/02.02.2026_Putting-Cures-Out-of-Reach_final.pdf">report</a> outlining <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-report-details-how-trump-broke-promises-to-patients-cut-561-million-from-lifesaving-research-while-failing-to-lower-prescription-drug-prices/">the state of the NIH</a>. The report concluded that the Trump administration is "failing American patients," and "destroying medical research through cuts to research grants, terminations of clinical trials, and the chaos it has created."</p>
<p>Since Trump took office, the NIH has terminated or frozen hundreds of millions of dollars for research grants, including $561 million in grants to research the four leading causes of death in America, the report found.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/trump-admin-is-destroying-medical-research-senate-report-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) demanded that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirm or deny the existence of a "domestic terrorists” database that lists US citizens who protest ICE's immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>ICE "officers and senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly suggested that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is building a 'domestic terrorists' database comprising information on US citizens protesting ICE’s actions in recent weeks," Markey wrote in a <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_dhs_on_domestic_terrorist_database.pdf">letter</a> yesterday to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons. "If such a database exists, it would constitute a grave and unacceptable constitutional violation. I urge you to immediately confirm or deny the existence of such a database, and if it exists, immediately shut it down and delete it."</p>
<p>Creating a database of peaceful protesters "would constitute a shocking violation of the First Amendment and abuse of power," and amount to "the kinds of tactics the United States rightly condemns in authoritarian governments such as China and Russia," Markey said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/capture-it-all-ice-urged-to-explain-memo-about-collecting-info-on-protesters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Adobe has canceled plans to discontinue its 2D animation software Animate.</p>
<p>On Monday, Adobe <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3050939/end-of-an-era-adobe-animate-is-being-put-to-rest-after-30-years.html">announced</a> that it would stop allowing people to sell subscriptions to Animate on March 1, saying the software had “served its purpose." People who already had a software license would be able to keep using Animate with technical support until March 1, 2027; businesses had until March 1, 2029. Per an email sent to customers, Adobe also said users would lose access to Animate files and project data on March 1, 2027. Animate costs $23 per month.</p>
<p>After receiving backlash from animators and other users, Adobe reversed its decision on <a href="https://community.adobe.com/announcements-539/adobe-animate-end-of-life-and-support-timeline-1548220">Tuesday night</a>.

<p>The massive rocket and its convoluted ground systems, so necessary to baby and cajole the booster's prickly hydrogen propellant on board, have cost US taxpayers in excess of $30 billion to date. And even as it reaches maturity, the rocket is going nowhere fast.</p>
<p>You remember the last time NASA tried to launch the world's largest orange rocket, right? The space agency rolled the Space Launch System out of its hangar in March 2022. The first, second, and third attempts at a wet dress rehearsal—elaborate fueling tests—were scrubbed. The SLS rocket was slowly rolled back to its hangar for work in April before returning to the pad in June.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-finally-acknowledges-the-elephant-in-the-room-with-the-sls-rocket/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>I know, I know—these days, that sounds like an excuse. <em>Anyone</em> can code, right?! Grab some tutorials, maybe an O'Reilly book, download an example project, and jump in. It's just a matter of learning how to break your project into small steps that you can make the computer do, then memorizing a bit of syntax. Nothing about that is hard!</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A potential deal between Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD) streaming and movie studio businesses has raised fresh concerns about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/streaming-stops-feeling-infinite-what-subscribers-can-expect-in-2026/">consolidation in the streaming industry</a>. Attempting to quell fears that an acquisition of WBD’s streaming and movie studio businesses might lead to higher prices, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarados suggested in a <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/examining-the-competitive-impact-of-the-proposed-netflix-warner-brothers-transaction">Senate hearing</a> today that any merger would have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>During the hearing, which was held by the US Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, Sarandos sought to convince the senators that Netflix wouldn’t hold a streaming monopoly if regulators allow <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/netflixs-72b-wb-acquisition-confounds-the-future-of-movie-theaters-streaming/">the acquisition</a> to close.</p>
<p>Netflix is the largest subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider by subscribers (301.63 million as of January 2025), and WBD is the third (128 million streaming subscribers, including users of HBO Max and, to a lesser degree, Discovery+).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/netflix-claims-subscribers-will-get-more-content-for-less-if-it-buys-hbo-max/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Last month, Apple TV released a teaser for the second season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch:_Legacy_of_Monsters"><em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em></a>, part of Legendary Entertainment’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MonsterVerse">MonsterVerse</a>, which brought Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters (<em>kaiju</em>) created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toho">Toho Co., Ltd</a> into a shared narrative. But we only got the most fleeting glimpse of the promised new mythical Titan threatening the human race. The full trailer just dropped and rectifies that: It's a gigantic tentacled undersea being dubbed Titan X—and only Kong and Godzilla can stop it.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for Season 1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/a-new-titan-emerges-in-monarch-legacy-of-monsters-s2-teaser/">previously reported</a>, the first season picked up where 2014’s <em>Godzilla</em> left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other <em>kaiju</em>—after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues. Per the official Season 2 premise:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/meet-the-new-tentacled-titan-x-in-monarch-legacy-of-monsters-s2-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In September 2025, Nvidia and OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-and-nvidias-100b-ai-plan-will-require-power-equal-to-10-nuclear-reactors/">announced</a> a letter of intent for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI's AI infrastructure. At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details "in the coming weeks." Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia's CEO now says the $100 billion figure was "never a commitment," and Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-is-unsatisfied-with-some-nvidia-chips-looking-alternatives-sources-say-2026-02-02/">reports</a> that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.</p>
<p>Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/how-openai-is-using-gpt-5-codex-to-improve-the-ai-tool-itself/">OpenAI's Codex</a>, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex's performance limitations to Nvidia's GPU-based hardware.</p>
<p>After the Reuters story published and Nvidia's stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/2018451015272694248">posted</a> on X: "We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don't get where all this insanity is coming from."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/five-months-later-nvidias-100-billion-openai-investment-plan-has-fizzled-out/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/awareness/2026/2/?view=2315">a news release Tuesday</a>, officials warned people not to consume any raw dairy, highlighting that it can be teeming with a variety of pathogens. Those germs are especially dangerous to pregnant women, as well as young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>"Raw milk can contain numerous disease-causing germs, including <em>Listeria</em>, which is bacteria that can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, or fatal infection in newborns, even if the mother is only mildly ill," the New Mexico Department of Health said in the press release.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/newborns-death-spurs-raw-milk-warning-in-new-mexico/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>French law enforcement authorities today raided X's Paris office and summoned Elon Musk for questioning as part of an investigation into illegal content. The Paris public prosecutor’s office <a href="https://www.tribunal-de-paris.justice.fr/sites/default/files/2026-02/20260203CPXFrance.pdf">said</a> the yearlong probe was recently expanded because the Grok chatbot was disseminating <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/france-will-investigate-musks-grok-after-ai-chatbot-posted-holocaust-denial-claims">Holocaust-denial claims</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/asking-grok-to-delete-fake-nudes-may-force-victims-to-sue-in-musks-chosen-court/">sexually explicit deepfakes</a>.</p>
<p>Europol, which is assisting French authorities, <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/europol-supports-french-investigation-alleged-criminal-activity-linked-to-platform-x">said</a> today the "investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offenses linked to the functioning and use of the platform, including the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity." Europol's cybercrime center provided "an analyst on the ground in Paris to assist national authorities." The French Gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit is also aiding the investigation.</p>
<p>French authorities want to question Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/linda-yaccarino-quits-x-without-saying-why-one-day-after-grok-praised-hitler/">quit last year</a> amid a controversy over Grok's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/grok-praises-hitler-gives-credit-to-musk-for-removing-woke-filters/">praise of Hitler</a>. Prosecutors summoned Musk and Yaccarino for interviews in April 2026, though the interviews are being described as voluntary.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/x-office-raided-in-frances-grok-probe-elon-musk-summoned-for-questioning/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn't done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for <em>Animal Crossing</em>) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can't pay $450 for a Switch 2.</p>
<p>The 9-year-old Switch's continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company's third-quarter financial results (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_2e.pdf">PDF</a>). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch "has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware" with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS's lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo's fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/citing-market-conditions-nintendo-hikes-prices-for-original-switch-consoles/">introduced in August of 2025</a>, citing "market conditions."</p>
<p>That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/nintendos-switch-becomes-the-third-bestselling-console-ever/">the third-bestselling game console of all time</a>. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony's PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold "over 160 million units" over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/original-nintendo-switch-passes-the-ds-to-become-nintendos-bestselling-console/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Chromebooks debuted 16 years ago with the limited release of Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/12/nothing-but-net-hands-on-test-of-the-cr-48-chrome-os-laptop/">Cr-48</a>, an unassuming compact laptop that was provided free to select users. From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google's shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034.</p>
<p>The documents were filed as part of Google's long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">verdict in 2024</a>. While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/869659/aluminium-why-googles-android-for-pc-launch-may-be-messy-and-controversial">The Verge</a>, the company's plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial.</p>
<p>As Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-rules/">which it did</a>). In Judge Amit Mehta's final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/google-court-filings-suggest-googles-chromeos-has-an-expiration-date/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/">announced</a> a new version of Xcode, the latest version of its integrated development environment (IDE) for building software for its own platforms, like the iPhone and Mac. The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI's Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes.</p>
<p>This is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode.</p>
<p>This approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic's model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode's settings, it's possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/xcode-26-3-adds-support-for-claude-codex-and-other-agentic-tools-via-mcp/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>It's Christmas of 1994, and I am 16 years old. Sitting on the table in our family room next to a pile of <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2087-gateway-2000/">cow-spotted boxes</a> is the most incredible thing in the world: a brand-new Gateway 66MHz Pentium tower, with a 540MB hard disk drive, 8MB of RAM, and, most importantly, a CD-ROM drive. I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change—at least where games were concerned.</p>
<p>I'd been working for several months at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/how-i-launched-3-consoles-and-found-true-love-at-babbages-store-no-9/">Babbage's store No. 9</a>, near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC's arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all. I'd already decided a few weeks earlier, when Chris Roberts' latest opus had been drop-shipped to our shelves, just in time for the holiday season. The choice made itself, really.</p>
