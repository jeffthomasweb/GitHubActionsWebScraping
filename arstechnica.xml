              <![CDATA[<p>Chinese government hackers penetrated the networks of several large US-based Internet service providers and may have gained access to systems used for court-authorized wiretaps of communications networks, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b">reported Saturday</a>. "People familiar with the matter" told the WSJ that hackers breached the networks of companies including Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Lumen (also known as CenturyLink).</p>
<p>"A cyberattack tied to the Chinese government penetrated the networks of a swath of US broadband providers, potentially accessing information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized network wiretapping requests," the WSJ wrote. "For months or longer, the hackers might have held access to network infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful US requests for communications data, according to people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>These "attackers also had access to other tranches of more generic Internet traffic," according to the WSJ's sources. The attack is being attributed to a Chinese hacking group called Salt Typhoon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/reports-china-hacked-verizon-and-att-may-have-accessed-us-wiretap-systems/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, a NASA spacecraft smashed into a small asteroid millions of miles from Earth to test a technique that could one day prove useful to deflect an object off a collision course with Earth. The European Space Agency launched a follow-up mission Monday to go back to the crash site and see the damage done.</p>
<p>The nearly $400 million (363 million euro) Hera mission, named for the Greek goddess of marriage, will investigate the aftermath of a cosmic collision between NASA's DART spacecraft and the skyscraper-size asteroid Dimorphos on September 26, 2022. NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission was the first planetary defense experiment, and it worked, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/dart-mission-successfully-shifted-its-targets-orbit/">successfully nudging Dimorphos off its regular orbit</a> around a larger companion asteroid named Didymos.</p>
<p>But NASA had to sacrifice the DART spacecraft in the deflection experiment. Its destruction meant there were no detailed images of the condition of the target asteroid after the impact. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/analyzing-images-from-a-close-flyby-of-darts-asteroid-impact/">small Italian CubeSat deployed by DART</a> as it approached Dimorphos captured fuzzy long-range views of the collision, but Hera will perform a comprehensive survey when it arrives in late 2026.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/european-mission-departs-earth-to-investigate-an-asteroid-wrecked-by-nasa/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The <em>Alien </em>franchise is about uncaring monsters, unfeeling corporations, and horrific, claustrophobic terror. Given this setting, it almost made sense, what happened to the original <em>Alien: Isolation</em>.</p>
<p>The game was released to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">positive reviews</a>, is now considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best#2014">one of the best games ever made</a>, and sold more than 2 million copies within its first few months. Despite this, <em>Isolation</em> only got "close to break-even or just about in the black," then-Creative Assembly studio director Tim Heaton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/web/20170427202334/http://go.skimresources.com/?id=87431X1540261&amp;site=eurogamer.net&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesindustry.biz%2Farticles%2F2015-09-30-sega-europe-were-definitely-on-the-right-track&amp;xguid=&amp;xuuid=638630bcdcb174d5fd1afe32be6f2553&amp;xsessid=&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20170427202705%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true&amp;xtz=0">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> a year after release. With the rapid evolution of AAA game development, that wasn't enough. And so, like a salvage team diverted to a bio-weapon recovery mission, <em>Isolation</em> and its momentum were seemingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true">abandoned</a>.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Reliable rumors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/report-big-batch-of-m4-macs-and-cheaper-ipads-on-tap-for-october-apple-event/">have suggested</a> that M4 Macs are right around the corner, and now Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q">forecasting</a> a specific launch date: November 1, following a late-October announcement that mirrors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/new-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-add-m3-chips-plus-a-1599-entry-level-model/">last year's Halloween-themed reveal</a> for the first M3 Macs.</p>
<p>This date could be subject to change, and not all the products announced in October would necessarily launch on November 1—lower-end Macs are more likely to launch early, and higher-end models would be more likely to ship a bit later in the month.</p>
<p>The list of what to expect is the same as it has been for a while: refreshed 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, a new M4 version of the 24-inch iMac, and an M4 update to the Mac mini that leapfrogs the M3 entirely. These will all be the first Macs to get the M4, following its unexpected introduction in the iPad Pro earlier this year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/report-first-wave-of-m4-macs-including-smaller-mac-mini-coming-november-1/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last year, special counsel Jack Smith <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-x-loses-fight-to-disclose-federal-surveillance-of-users/">asked X (formerly Twitter) to hand over Donald Trump's direct messages</a> from his presidency without telling Trump. Refusing to comply, X spent the past year <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1264/311993/20240530144316325_23-xxxx%20-%20X%20Corp.%20v.%20United%20States%20-%20cert.%20petition.pdf">arguing</a> that the gag order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on X's speech and an "end-run" around a record law shielding privileged presidential communications.</p>
<p>Under its so-called free speech absolutist owner Elon Musk, X took this fight all the way to the Supreme Court, only for the nation's highest court to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100724zor_4gdj.pdf">decline</a> to review X's appeal on Monday.</p>
<p>It's unclear exactly why SCOTUS rejected X's appeal, but in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1264/316328/20240703124920314_23-1264_X.Corp%20v.%20United%20States.pdf">court filing</a> opposing SCOTUS review, Smith told the court that X's "contentions lack merit and warrant no further review."

              <![CDATA[<p>The legal saga over Martin Shkreli's infamous 5,000 percent price hike of a life-saving anti-parasitic drug has ended with a flat denial from the highest court in the land.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected Shkreli's petition to appeal an order to return $64.6 million in profits from the pricing scheme of Daraprim, a decades-old drug used to treat toxoplasmosis. The condition is caused by a single-celled parasite that can be deadly for newborns and people with compromised immune systems, such as people who have HIV, cancer, or an organ transplant.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors successfully argued in courts that Shkreli orchestrated an illegal anticompetitive scheme that allowed him to dramatically raise the price of Daraprim overnight. When Shkreli and his pharmaceutical company, Vyera (formerly Turing), bought the rights to the drug in 2015, the price of a single pill jumped to $750 after being priced between $13.50 and $17.50 earlier that year. And Shkreli quickly came to epitomize callous greed in the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/scotus-denial-ends-saga-of-shkrelis-infamous-5000-drug-price-scheme/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"SpaceX and T-Mobile have been given emergency special temporary authority by the FCC to enable Starlink satellites with direct-to-cell capability to provide coverage for cell phones in the affected areas of Hurricane Helene," SpaceX <a href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1842988427777605683">said yesterday</a>. "The satellites have already been enabled and started broadcasting emergency alerts to cell phones on all networks in North Carolina. In addition, we may test basic texting (SMS) capabilities for most cell phones on the T-Mobile network in North Carolina."</p>
<p>SpaceX warned of limits since the service isn't ready for a commercial rollout. "SpaceX's direct-to-cell constellation has not been fully deployed, so all services will be delivered on a best-effort basis," the company said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-lets-starlink-provide-service-to-cell-phones-in-areas-hit-by-hurricane/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The companies behind the streaming industry, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/">smart TV</a> and streaming stick manufacturers and streaming service providers, have developed a "surveillance system" that has "long undermined privacy and consumer protection," according to a report from the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) published today and sent to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Unprecedented tracking techniques aimed at pleasing advertisers have resulted in connected TVs (CTVs) being a "privacy nightmare," according to Jeffrey Chester, report co-author and CDD executive director, resulting in calls for stronger regulation.</p>
<p>The 48-page report, <em>How TV Watches Us: Commercial Surveillance in the Streaming Era</em> [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CDD-CTV-Report-Oct24-1.1.pdf">PDF</a>], cites Ars Technica, other news publications, trade publications, blog posts, and statements from big players in streaming—from Amazon to NBCUniversal and Tubi, to LG, Samsung, and Vizio. It provides a detailed overview of the various ways that streaming services and streaming hardware target viewers in newfound ways that the CDD argues pose severe privacy risks. The nonprofit composed the report as part of efforts to encourage regulation. Today, the CDD sent letters to the FTC [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FTCCHairKhanletter10724Final.pdf">PDF</a>], Federal Communications Commission (FCC), California attorney general [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CAAGletter10724Final.pdf">PDF</a>], and California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CCPAletter10724Final.pdf">PDF</a>], regarding its concerns.</p>
<p>"Not only does CTV operate in ways that are unfair to consumers, it is also putting them and their families at risk as it gathers and uses sensitive data about health, children, race, and political interests,” Chester said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/streaming-industry-has-unprecedented-surveillance-manipulation-capabilities/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the Nobel Committee announced that two US researchers, Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun, will <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2024/summary/">receive the prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for their discovery of a previously unknown mechanism for controlling the activity of genes. They discovered the first of what is now known to be a large collection of MicroRNAs, short (21-23 bases long) RNAs that bind to and alter the behavior of protein-coding RNAs. While first discovered in a roundworm, they've since been discovered to play key roles in the development of most complex life.</p>
<p>The story behind the discovery is typical of a lot of the progress in the biological sciences: genetics helps identify a gene important for the development of one species, and then evolutionary conservation reveals its widespread significance.</p>
<h2>In the worm</h2>
<p>Ambros and Ruvkun started on the path to discovery while post-doctoral fellows in the lab of earlier Nobel winner Robert Horvitz, who won for his role in developing the roundworm <em>C. elegans</em> as an experimental genetic organism. As part of the early genetic screens, people had identified a variety of mutations that caused developmental problems for specific lineages of cells. These <em>lin</em> mutations included <em>lin-4</em>, which Ambros was characterizing. It lacked a number of specialized cell types, as well as the physical structures that depended on them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/medicine-nobel-goes-to-previously-unknown-way-of-controlling-genes/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The National Hurricane Center reported that Milton had reached sustained winds of 160 mph as of 11:44 pm ET on Monday, with a central pressure of 925 millibars. The storm is moving steadily eastward and is likely to reach the west coast of Florida on Wednesday evening as a major hurricane.</p>
<p>Based upon Atlantic basin records, Milton has tied Hurricane Maria (2017) for the second-fastest intensification from a Category 1 to Category 5 hurricane, taking just 18 hours.

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Months ago, 13-year-old Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/someone-has-finally-beaten-nes-tetris/">became the first person to "beat" NES <em>Tetris</em></a>, crashing the game after a 1,511-line, 157-level performance. Over the weekend, 16-year-old Michael "dogplayingtetris" Artiaga became the first to reach an even more impressive plateau in the game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXhbti5SneE%22">looping past Level 255</a> and instantly rolling the game all the way back to the ultra-slow Level 0.</p>
<p>It took Artiaga a bit over 80 minutes and a full 3,300 cleared lines to finally achieve the game's first near-mythical "rebirth" <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2268738212">live in front of hundreds of Twitch viewers</a>. And after a bit of celebration and recovery on the low levels, Artiaga managed to keep his rolled-over game going for another 40 minutes, finally topping out after a total of 4,216 lines and a record 29.4 million points.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXhbti5SneE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div><div class="caption mt-1 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-lg leading-tight text-gray-300">
    <div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"></div>
    <div class="caption-content">
      Artiaga's record-setting game starts a few minutes in, while the "rebirth" rollover happens at 1:21:24.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Artiaga's record does come with a small asterisk since he used a version of the game that was modified to avoid the crashes that stopped Blue Scuti's historic run. Still, NES <em>Tetris</em>' first-ever level rollover is a monumental achievement and a testament to just how far competitive classic <em>Tetris</em> has come in a short time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nes-tetris-first-ever-rebirth-loops-past-level-255-and-back-to-zero/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In Granbury, Texas, residents can hear the sound of money being made at all hours of the day, but it’s not making them rich. Instead, neighbors in the town southwest of Fort Worth say that the persistent low hum emanating from the Bitcoin mine operated by Marathon Digital has caused them stress, loss of sleep, and other unexplained ailments.</p>
<p>They filed a lawsuit in Texas state court Friday in Hood County alleging that the noise from the Bitcoin mine creates a nuisance that has ruined their quality of life. The environmental law group Earthjustice is representing a group of neighbors organized under the name Citizens Concerned About Wolf Hollow. The suit is seeking a permanent injunction to stop operation of the facility unless it can operate without producing disruptive noise.</p>
<p>The 300 megawatt Marathon Digital facility is located alongside a gas-fired power plant called Wolf Hollow II. Residents recently <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12092024/texas-bitcoin-mining-power-plant-expansion-backlash/">spoke out against a proposed expansion</a> to upgrade the natural gas facility currently providing electricity for Bitcoin mining and releasing up to 760,000 tons of additional carbon dioxide per year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/neighbors-sue-over-loud-bitcoin-mine/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When satellites first started peering down on the craggy, glaciated Antarctic Peninsula about 40 years ago, they saw only a few tiny patches of vegetation covering a total of about 8,000 square feet—less than a football field.</p>
<p>But since then, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed rapidly, and a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01564-5">study</a> shows that mosses, along with some lichen, liverworts and associated algae, have colonized more than 4.6 square miles, an area nearly four times the size of New York’s Central Park.</p>
<p>The findings, published Friday in Nature Geoscience, based on a meticulous analysis of Landsat images from 1986 to 2021, show that the greening trend is distinct from natural variability and that it has accelerated by 30 percent since 2016, fast enough to cover nearly 75 football fields per year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/greening-of-antartica-shows-how-climate-change-affects-the-frozen-continent/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Dozens of neo-Nazis are fleeing Telegram and moving to a relatively unknown secret chat app that has received funding from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>In a report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/neo-nazi-accelerationists-seek-new-digital-refuge-amid-looming-telegram-crackdown">published on Friday morning</a>, researchers found that in the wake of the arrest of Telegram founder <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pavel-durov-defends-telegram-privacy-changes/">Pavel Durov</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/terrorgram-collective-indictments/">charges against leaders of the so-called Terrorgram Collective</a>, dozens of extremist groups have moved to the app SimpleX Chat in recent weeks over fears that Telegram’s privacy policies expose them to being arrested. The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/terrorgram-collective-indictments/">Terrorgram Collective</a> is a neo-Nazi propaganda network that calls for acolytes to target government officials, attack power stations, and murder people of color.</p>

While ISD stopped short of naming SimpleX in its report, the researchers point out that the app promotes itself as “having a different burner email or phone for each contact, and no hassle to manage them.” This is exactly how SimpleX refers to itself <a href="https://simplex.chat/">on its website</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/neo-nazis-head-to-encrypted-simplex-chat-app-bail-on-telegram/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>London's Great Exhibition of 1851 attracted some 6 million people eager to experience more than 14,000 exhibitors showcasing 19th-century marvels of technology and engineering. The event took place in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace">Crystal Palace</a>, a 990,000-square-foot building of cast iron and plate glass originally located in Hyde Park. And it was built in an incredible 190 days. According to a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17581206.2024.2391984">recent paper</a> published in the International Journal for the History of Engineering and Technology, one of the secrets was the use of a standardized screw thread, first proposed 10 years before its construction, although the thread did not officially become the British standard until 1905.</p>
<p>“During the Victorian era there was incredible innovation from workshops right across Britain that was helping to change the world," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1058094">said co-author John Gardner</a> of Anglia Ruskin University (ARU). "In fact, progress was happening at such a rate that certain breakthroughs were perhaps never properly realized at the time, as was the case here with the Crystal Palace. Standardization in engineering is essential and commonplace in the 21st century, but its role in the construction of the Crystal Palace was a major development."</p>
<p>The design competition for what would become the Crystal Palace was launched in March 1850, with a deadline four weeks later, and the actual, fully constructed building opened on May 1, 1851. The winning design, by Joseph Paxton, wasn't chosen until quite late in the game after numerous designs had been rejected—most because they were simply too far above the 100,000-pound budget.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-londons-crystal-palace-was-built-so-quickly/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The old-school <em>Diablo</em> games endure for a lot of reasons. Some players like the deep lore and world-building. Some like partnering with friends and working through dungeons as a team. Some like hunting for incredibly rare loot and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">maybe selling it on a livestream</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you dive into high-level <em>Diablo</em> just for a chance to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsNx0DGrSW8">kill a screen full of monsters really quickly</a>.</p>
<p>If that kind of high-density enemy killing is what you're looking for, <em>Halls of Torment</em>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdQweTEsOUE">recent Version 1.0 release</a> is a near-perfect take on the concept. Despite the decidedly old-school presentation, the game takes very modern inspiration from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> and its quick-hit bursts of leveling up through overwhelming enemy hordes. In doing so, it has become my absolute favorite way to wipe out enemies at rates approaching and exceeding 50,000/hour, at some points.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/halls-of-torment-is-diablo-cranked-up-to-50000-kills-hour/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Apple released the first software updates for its devices since last month's rollout of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.</p>
<p>Those who've been following along know that several key features that didn't make it into the initial release of iOS 18 are expected in iOS 18.1, but that's not the update we got on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rather, Apple pushed out a series of smaller updates that fixed several bugs but did not add new features. The updates are labeled iOS 18.0.1, iPadOS 18.0.1, visionOS 2.0.1, macOS Sequoia 15.0.1, and watchOS 11.0.1.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/no-more-bricked-ipads-apple-fixes-several-bugs-in-ios-ipados-macos-updates/">Read full article</a></p>
