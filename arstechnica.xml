              <![CDATA[<p>Most drones on the market are rotary-wing quadcopters, which can conveniently land and take off almost anywhere. The problem is they are less energy-efficient than fixed-wing aircraft, which can fly greater distances and stay airborne for longer but need a runway, a dedicated launcher, or at least a good-fashioned throw to get to the skies.</p>
<p>To get past this limit, a team of Swiss researchers at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne built a fixed-wing flying robot called RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments) with a peculiar bio-inspired landing gear: a pair of robotic bird-like legs. “The RAVEN robot can walk, hop over obstacles, and do a jumping takeoff like real birds,” says Won Dong Shin, an engineer leading the project.</p>
<h2>Smart investments</h2>
<p>The key challenge in attaching legs to drones was that they significantly increased mass and complexity. State-of-the-art robotic legs were designed for robots walking on the ground and were too bulky and heavy to even think about using on a flying machine. So, Shin’s team started their work by taking a closer look at what the leg mass budget looked like in various species of birds.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/robotic-bird-like-legs-let-drones-hop-over-obstacles-launch-to-the-skies/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A US judge today rejected a Boeing plea agreement that was opposed by families of crash victims who say the deal would fail to hold Boeing accountable. The judge's ruling said the US "Government has monitored Boeing for three years now," and that, if US officials are correct that Boeing violated a previous agreement, "it is fair to say the Government's attempt to ensure compliance has failed."</p>
<p>In July 2024, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/boeing-to-plead-guilty-to-conspiracy-to-defraud-faa-aircraft-evaluation-group/">Boeing agreed</a> to plead guilty to a criminal charge and pay $243.6 million for violating a 2021 agreement that was spurred by two Boeing 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a combined 346 people. If a new deal is not reached, Boeing could have to face trial over the charge for conspiracy to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration's Aircraft Evaluation Group.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.342881/gov.uscourts.txnd.342881.282.0_4.pdf">ruling today</a>, Judge Reed O'Connor in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas objected to the process for selecting an independent monitor to oversee Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud compliance program.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/judge-rejects-boeing-plea-deal-that-was-opposed-by-families-of-crash-victims/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Broadcom will no longer take VMware's biggest 2,000 customers directly. Instead, it will work with VMware's 500 biggest customers, giving channel partners the opportunity to participate in deals and provide additional value for VMware customers. The reversal is being viewed as an effort from Broadcom to discourage migrations from VMware, but there's skepticism around how much impact it will truly have.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/price-hikes-of-over-2x-widely-expected-under-broadcoms-vmware-survey-finds/">Various customers</a> have lamented the changes that succeeded Broadcom buying VMware about a year ago. Controversial moves have included <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/amid-eu-antitrust-qs-broadcom-extends-support-for-some-vmware-perpetual-licenses/">ending perpetual license</a> sales, bundling VMware products into a smaller number of SKUs, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/">ending VMware's channel partner program</a>. These changes have led some firms to consider reducing their business with VMware.</p>
<p>This week, for example, UK-headquartered cloud operator Beeks Group said that a <a href="1.%09https:/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/">1,000 percent increase in VMware costs</a> led to it moving most of its 20,000-plus virtual machines to OpenNebula. And numerous customers that Ars Technica has spoken with in the last year are seriously researching or planning total or partial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">VMware migrations.</a></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/new-broadcom-sales-plan-may-be-insignificant-in-deterring-vmware-migrations/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>2023 was always going to be a hot year, given that warmer El Niño conditions were superimposed on the long-term trend of climate change driven by our greenhouse gas emissions. But it's not clear anybody was expecting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/climate-wise-it-was-a-full-year-of-exceptional-months/">the striking string of hot months</a> that allowed the year to easily eclipse any previous year on record. As the warmth has continued at record levels even after the El Niño faded, it's an event that seems to demand an explanation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a group of German scientists—Helge Goessling, Thomas Rackow, and Thomas Jung—released a paper that attempts to provide one. They present data that suggests the Earth is absorbing more incoming sunlight than it has in the past, largely due to reduced cloud cover.</p>
<h2>Balancing the numbers on radiation</h2>
<p>Years with strong El Niño conditions tend to break records. But the 2023 El Niño was relatively mild. The effects of the phenomenon are also directly felt in the tropical Pacific, yet ocean temperatures set records in the Atlantic and contributed to a massive retreat in ice near Antarctica. So, there are clearly limits to what can be attributed to El Niño. Other influences that have been considered include the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/hunga-tonga-eruption-put-over-50b-kilograms-of-water-into-the-stratosphere/">injection of water vapor into the stratosphere</a> by the Hunga Tonga eruption, and a reduction in sulfur emissions due to new rules governing international shipping. 2023 also corresponds to a peak in the most recent solar cycle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/new-study-blames-recent-spike-in-global-warming-on-lack-of-low-clouds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T this week detailed plans to eliminate copper phone and DSL lines from its network while leaving many customers in rural areas with only wireless or satellite as an alternative.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/2GMMvOKNSfY?t=8629">presentation</a> for analysts and investors on Tuesday, AT&amp;T said it has a "wireless first" plan for 50 percent of its 500,000-square-mile wireline territory and a "fiber first" plan for the rest. The more sparsely populated half accounts for 10 percent of the potential customer base, and AT&amp;T does not plan to build fiber home Internet for those users.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T said it expects to be able to ditch copper because of state-level deregulation and the impending shift in power at the Federal Communications Commission, where Trump pick Brendan Carr is set to become the chairman. California is the only state out of 21 in AT&amp;T's wireline territory that hasn't yet granted AT&amp;T's request for deregulation of old networks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/att-says-it-wont-build-fiber-home-internet-in-half-of-its-wireline-footprint/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/jared-isaacman-entrepreneur-and-private-astronaut-is-trumps-choice-to-lead-nasa/">announced Wednesday his intent</a> to nominate entrepreneur and commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of NASA.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Isaacman, who at just 16 years old founded a payment processing company in his parents' basement that ultimately became a major player in online payments, it may seem an odd choice. However, those inside the space community welcomed the news, with figures across the political spectrum hailing Isaacman's nomination variously as "terrific," "ideal," and "inspiring."</p>
<p>This statement from Isaac Arthur, president of the National Space Society, is characteristic of the response: "Jared is a remarkable individual and a perfect pick for NASA Administrator. He brings a wealth of experience in entrepreneurial enterprise as well as unique knowledge in working with both NASA and SpaceX, a perfect combination as we enter a new era of increased cooperation between NASA and commercial spaceflight."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/how-did-the-ceo-of-an-online-payments-firm-become-the-nominee-to-lead-nasa/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[OpenAI's full "o1" AI model is "smaller and faster," and ChatGPT Pro users get an even beefier version.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday during a <a href="https://openai.com/12-days/">live demo</a> as part of its "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 days of OpenAI</a>" event, OpenAI announced a new tier of ChatGPT with higher usage limits for $200 a month and the full version of "o1," the full version of a so-called reasoning model the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">debuted</a> in September.</p>
<p>Unlike o1-preview, o1 can now process images as well as text (similar to GPT-4o), and it is reportedly much faster than o1-preview. In a demo question about a Roman emperor, o1 took 14 seconds for an answer, and 1 preview took 33 seconds. According to OpenAI, o1 makes major mistakes 34 percent less often than o1-preview, while "thinking" 50 percent faster. The model will also reportedly become even faster once deployment is finished transitioning the GPUs to the new model.</p>
<p>Whether the new <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pro/">ChatGPT Pro</a> subscription will be worth the $200 a month fee isn't yet fully clear, but the company specified that users will have access to an even more capable version of o1 called "o1 Pro Mode" that will do even deeper reasoning searches and provide "more thinking power for more difficult problems" before answering.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-new-200-mo-chatgpt-subscription-will-buy-you-more-compute-time/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Apple appears to have acquired a third-party plugin that syncs passwords with Firefox.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, Apple has steadily been building password manager-style features into macOS and iOS, including automatic password generation, password breach detection, and more. Starting with this year's updates—iOS 18 and macOS 15 Sequoia—Apple broke all that functionality out into its own Passwords app, making it all even more visible as a competitor to traditional password managers like 1Password and Bitwarden.</p>
<p>One area where Apple has lagged behind its platform-agnostic competitors is in browser support. Users could easily autofill passwords in Safari on macOS, and Apple did support a basic extension for the Windows versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge via iCloud for Windows. But the company only added <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj?pli=1">a Chrome extension</a> for macOS users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/13/23793532/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-extension-mac-sonoma-beta">in the summer of 2023</a>, and it has never supported non-Chromium browsers at all.</p>
<p>That has finally changed, at least for Firefox users running macOS—Apple has <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/icloud-passwords/">an officially supported Passwords extension for Firefox</a> that supports syncing and autofilling passwords in macOS Sonoma and macOS Sequoia. Currently, the extension doesn't support older versions of macOS or any versions of Firefox for Windows or Linux. When you install the extension in Firefox on a Mac that's already synced with your iCloud account, all you should need to do to sign in is input a six-digit code that macOS automatically generates for you. As with the Chromium extension, there's no need to re-sign in to your iCloud account separately.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/firefox-users-on-macos-can-finally-autofill-apple-passwords-in-their-browser/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As the AI industry grows in size and influence, the companies involved have begun making stark choices about where they land on issues of life and death. For example, can their AI models be used to guide weapons or make targeting decisions? Different companies have answered this question in different ways, but for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> maker OpenAI, what started as a hard line against weapons development and military applications has slipped away over time.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, defense-tech company Anduril Industries—<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palmer-luckey-drones-autonomous-weapons-ukraine/">started</a> by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey in 2017—<a href="https://www.anduril.com/article/anduril-partners-with-openai-to-advance-u-s-artificial-intelligence-leadership-and-protect-u-s/">announced</a> a partnership with OpenAI to develop AI models (similar to the GPT-4o and o1 models that power ChatGPT) to help US and allied forces identify and defend against aerial attacks.</p>
<p>The companies say their AI models will process data to reduce the workload on humans. "As part of the new initiative, Anduril and OpenAI will explore how leading-edge AI models can be leveraged to rapidly synthesize time-sensitive data, reduce the burden on human operators, and improve situational awareness," Anduril said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-and-anduril-team-up-to-build-ai-powered-drone-defense-systems/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Longtime Valve watchers likely remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steam-machines/">Steam Machines</a>, the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">aborted</a>, pre-Steam Deck attempt at crafting a line of third-party gaming PC hardware based around <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/valve-first-version-of-steamos-to-be-released-to-the-masses-on-friday/">an early verison of its Linux-based SteamOS</a>. Now, there are strong signs that Valve is on the verge of launching a similar third-party hardware branding effort under the "Powered by SteamOS" label.</p>
<p>The newest sign of those plans come via <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf">newly updated branding guidelines</a> posted by Valve on Wednesday (as noticed by <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/compare/d54725a035de...41944930ea8a#diff-5daae83579359a756437d0a949cfce0a729a6857724a1740b2825f45fd0d9292">the trackers at SteamDB</a>). That update includes the first appearance of a new "Powered by SteamOS" logo intended "for hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve."</p>
<p>The document goes on to clarify that the new Powered by SteamOS logo "indicates that a hardware device will run the SteamOS and boot into SteamOS upon powering on the device." That's distinct from the licensed branding for merely "Steam Compatible" devices, which include "non-Valve input peripherals" that have been reviewed by Valve to work with Steam.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In recent years, commercial spyware has been deployed by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-cozy-bear-watering-hole-attacks/">more actors</a> against a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/europe-spyware-scandals-greece/">wider range of victims</a>, but the prevailing narrative has still been that the malware is used in targeted attacks against an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-ios-16-lockdown-mode/">extremely small number</a> of people. At the same time, though, it has been difficult to check devices for infection, leading individuals to navigate an ad hoc array of academic institutions and NGOs that have been on the front lines of developing forensic techniques to detect mobile spyware. On Tuesday, the mobile device security firm iVerify is <a href="http://iverify.io/blog/iverify-mobile-threat-investigation-uncovers-new-pegasus-samples">publishing findings</a> from a spyware detection feature it launched in May. Of 2,500 device scans that the company's customers elected to submit for inspection, seven revealed infections by the notorious NSO Group malware known as Pegasus.</p>
<p>The company’s Mobile Threat Hunting feature uses a combination of malware signature-based detection, heuristics, and machine learning to look for anomalies in iOS and Android device activity or telltale signs of spyware infection. For paying iVerify customers, the tool regularly checks devices for potential compromise. But the company also offers a free version of the feature for anyone who downloads the iVerify Basics app for $1. These users can walk through steps to generate and send a special diagnostic utility file to iVerify and receive analysis within hours. Free users can use the tool once a month. iVerify's infrastructure is built to be privacy-preserving, but to run the Mobile Threat Hunting feature, users must enter an email address so the company has a way to contact them if a scan turns up spyware—as it did in the seven recent Pegasus discoveries.</p>
<p>“The really fascinating thing is that the people who were targeted were not just journalists and activists, but business leaders, people running commercial enterprises, people in government positions,” says Rocky Cole, chief operating officer of iVerify and a former US National Security Agency analyst. “It looks a lot more like the targeting profile of your average piece of malware or your average APT group than it does the narrative that’s been out there that mercenary spyware is being abused to target activists. It is doing that, absolutely, but this cross section of society was surprising to find.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Today, Rivian announced that it is opening up the Rivian Adventure Network of fast chargers to drivers of all other makes of electric vehicles, beginning with its location in Joshua Tree, California. The Joshua Tree Charging Outpost, which has 12 DC fast chargers, is now accessible to any EV with a CCS1 charging port, as well as any Tesla or EV equipped with a native NACS (J3400) port using an adapter. A planned hardware upgrade in the future will add native NACS cables. (Rivian <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/rivian-is-the-next-automaker-to-adopt-teslas-charging-plugs/">is switching the plugs</a> on its own EVs from CCS1 to NACS in 2025.)</p>
<p>Rivian revealed its plans in early 2021 to build charging stations, a few months <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/rivians-67-500-314-mile-electric-adventure-truck-put-to-the-test/">before it let us loose in the R1T electric pickup</a>. The Rivian Adventure Network currently has deployed banks of fast chargers at 91 sites across the US, with another 12 in the works.

              <![CDATA[<p>Late Wednesday, bitcoin hit $100,000—a major milestone for the cryptocurrency, which has been experiencing a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/bitcoin-hits-record-high-as-trump-vows-to-end-crypto-crackdown/">massive upswing since Donald Trump won</a> the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump is a shiny new crypto supporter, launching his own cryptocurrency on the campaign trail and hoping to woo crypto enthusiast voters by promising to slacken the Biden administration's heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/04/tech/bitcoin-100k-trump-hnk-intl/index.html">to CNN</a>, bitcoin's latest record high came shortly after Trump announced his intentions to nominate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once Gary Gensler—a noted crypto critic—resigns on Inauguration Day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/bitcoin-hits-100000/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Epidermal electronics attached to the skin via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/08/temporary-tattoo-electronics-flexible-ultrathin-measurement-devices/">temporary tattoos</a> (e-tattoos) have been around for more than a decade, but they have their limitations, most notably that they don't function well on curved and/or hairy surfaces. Scientists have now developed special conductive inks that can be printed right onto a person's scalp to measure brain waves, even if they have hair. According to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-biomaterials/fulltext/S3050-5623(24)00004-7">new paper</a> published in the journal Cell Biomaterials, this could one day enable mobile EEG monitoring outside a clinical setting, among other potential applications.</p>
<p>EEGs are a well-established, non-invasive method for recording the electrical activity of the brain, a crucial diagnostic tool for monitoring such conditions as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and brain injuries. It's also an important tool in many aspects of neuroscience research, including the ongoing development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). But there are issues. Subjects must wear uncomfortable caps that aren't designed to handle the variation in people's' head shapes, so a clinician must painstakingly map out the electrode positions on a given patient's head—a time-consuming process. And the gel used to apply the electrodes dries out and loses conductivity within a couple of hours, limiting how long one can make recordings.</p>
<p>By contrast, e-tattoos connect to skin without adhesives, are practically unnoticeable, and are typically attached via temporary tattoo, allowing electrical measurements (and other measurements, such as temperature and strain) using ultra-thin polymers with embedded circuit elements. They can measure heartbeats on the chest (ECG), muscle contractions in the leg (EMG), stress levels, and alpha waves through the forehead (EEG), for example.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/e-tattoos-could-make-mobile-eegs-a-reality/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hackers pocketed as much as $155,000 by sneaking a backdoor into a code library used by developers of smart contract apps that work with the cryptocurrency known as Solana.</p>
<p>The supply-chain attack targeted <a href="http://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js">solana-web3.js</a>, a collection of JavaScript code used by developers of decentralized apps for interacting with the Solana blockchain. These “dapps” allow people to sign smart contracts that, in theory, operate autonomously in executing currency trades among two or more parties when certain agreed-upon conditions are met.</p>
<p>The backdoor came in the form of code that collected private keys and wallet addresses when apps that directly handled private keys incorporated solana-web3.js versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7. These backdoored versions were available for download during a five-hour window between 3:20 pm UTC and 8:25 pm UTC on Tuesday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/backdoor-slips-into-popular-code-library-drains-155k-from-digital-wallets/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 2013, researchers reported an eye-opening case of <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pd.4100">a healthy pregnant woman with a puzzling prenatal test result</a>. A routine genetic screen using cell-free DNA—a highly accurate blood test—suggested her fetus had an extra copy of chromosome 13 (Patau syndrome) and only one copy of chromosome 18. These results are devastating; both conditions can cause severe abnormalities. Those with Patau syndrome often only survive a few days or weeks after birth. But, when doctors looked at scans and did additional pregnancy testing, all they found was a healthy fetus developing normally. The woman carried on with her uncomplicated pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy baby.</p>
<p>The alarming genetic results may have been written off as a freak testing flub. But soon after giving birth, the otherwise healthy 37-year-old mother of two reported severe pelvic pain. Imaging revealed what looked like multiple bone tumors, and she was subsequently diagnosed with metastatic small cell carcinoma of vaginal origin. Tragically, she has since died.</p>
<p>Testing of one of her tumors found that the cancerous cells had an increased number of chromosome 13 relative to chromosome 18. Her prenatal test had picked up her deadly cancer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/prenatal-test-accidentally-picks-up-cancer-in-50-of-those-with-wonky-results/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Ray spiders deploy an unusual strategy to capture prey in their webs. They essentially pull it back into a cone shape and release it when prey approaches, trapping said prey in the sticky silken threads. A few years ago, scientists noticed that they could get the spiders to release their webs just by snapping their fingers nearby, suggesting that the spiders relied at least in part on sound vibrations to know when to strike. Evidence for that hypothesis has now been confirmed in a <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.249237">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.</p>
<p>Most spider orb webs are static: the spiders weave them and fix them in place and then wait for prey to fly into the webs. That causes the silk threads to vibrate, alerting the spider that dinner is served. There are some species that actively actuate their webs, however, per the authors.</p>
<p>For instance, the triangle weaver spring-loads its triangular web once an insect has made contact so that the threads wrap around the prey in fractions of a second. Bolas spiders seem to detect prey in their vicinity through auditory cues, throwing a line of silk with a sticky end at passing moths to catch them. Ogre-faced spiders also seem to be able to hear potential prey, striking backward with a small silk net held in their front legs. It's a more proactive hunting strategy than merely waiting for prey to fly into a web.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/these-spiders-listen-for-prey-before-hurling-webs-like-slingshots/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Between 8,000 and 12,000 years ago, people in Alaska kept reinventing dogs with mixed results.</p>
<p>The dogs that share our homes today are the descendants of a single group of wolves that lived in Siberia about 23,000 years ago. But for thousands of years after that split, the line between wolf and dog wasn’t quite clear-cut. A recent study shows that long after dogs had spread into Eurasia and the Americas, people living in what is now Alaska still spent time with—and fed—a bizarre mix of dogs, wolves, dog-wolf hybrids, and even some coyotes.</p>
<h2>We just can’t stop feeding the wildlife</h2>
<p>University of Arizona archaeologist François Lanoë and his colleagues studied 111 sets of bones from dogs and wolves from archaeological sites across the Alaskan interior. The oldest bones came from wolves that roamed what’s now Alaska long before people set foot there, and the most recent came from modern, wild Alaskan wolves. In between, the researchers worked with the remains of both wolves and dogs (and even a couple of coyotes) that span a swath of time from about 1,000 to around 14,000 years ago. And it turns out that even the wolves were tangled up in the lives of nearby humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/dog-domestication-happened-many-times-but-most-didnt-pan-out/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Altman did not specify the exact features or products OpenAI plans to unveil, but a report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas">The Verge</a> about this "12 days of shipmas" event suggests the products may include a public release of the company's text-to-video model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/openai-is-at-war-with-its-own-sora-video-testers-following-brief-public-leak/">Sora</a> and a new "reasoning" AI model similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">o1-preview</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>A US government security official urged Americans to use encrypted messaging as major telecom companies struggle to evict Chinese hackers from their networks. The attack has been attributed to a Chinese hacking group called Salt Typhoon.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/reports-china-hacked-verizon-and-att-may-have-accessed-us-wiretap-systems/">reports since early October</a> that Chinese government hackers penetrated the networks of telecoms and may have gained access to systems used for court-authorized wiretaps of communications networks. Impacted telcos reportedly include Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Lumen (also known as CenturyLink).</p>
<p>T-Mobile has said its own network wasn't hacked but that it severed a connection it had to a different provider whose network was hacked. Lumen has said it has no evidence that customer data on its network was accessed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/us-recommends-encrypted-messaging-as-chinese-hackers-linger-in-telecom-networks/">Read full article</a></p>
