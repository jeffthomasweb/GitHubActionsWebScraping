              <![CDATA[<p>Since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">launch of ChatGPT</a> in late 2022, experts have debated how widely AI language models would impact the world. A few years later, the picture is getting clear. According to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09747">new Stanford University-led research</a> examining over 300 million text samples across multiple sectors, AI language models now assist in writing up to a quarter of professional communications across sectors. It's having a large impact, especially in less-educated parts of the United States.</p>
<p>"Our study shows the emergence of a new reality in which firms, consumers and even international organizations substantially rely on generative AI for communications," wrote the researchers.</p>
<p>The researchers tracked large language model (LLM) adoption across industries from January 2022 to September 2024 using a dataset that included 687,241 consumer complaints submitted to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), 537,413 corporate press releases, 304.3 million job postings, and 15,919 United Nations press releases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-surprised-to-find-less-educated-areas-adopting-ai-writing-tools-faster/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Striking a four-year deal with President Donald Trump, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) plans to invest $100 billion in chip manufacturing plants in the US, sources <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-chip-maker-tsmc-expected-to-announce-100-billion-investment-in-u-s-02a44399">told The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to "people familiar with the matter," Trump will officially announce the deal later today. While still unconfirmed, TSMC's supposed investment comes after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/trump-announces-500b-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-with-agi-aims/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/apple-promises-500-billion-in-us-investment-in-wake-of-tariff-threats/">Apple</a> announced similarly vague plans to each invest $500 billion into the US in apparent efforts to get on Trump's good side. It's hard to tell if these plans are actually new or if companies had already planned to invest heavily without outside pressure, WSJ noted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It's undeniable that expanding TSMC's US presence has long been a goal for the US. TSMC announced its first fab in 2020, initially committing $12 billion over 10 years. Since then, TSMC's investments over time have expanded, reaching $40 billion by 2022. Last year, its investments notched up again when TSMC was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/tsmc-will-build-third-arizona-fab-after-winning-6-6b-in-chips-funding/">awarded $6.6 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act</a> to "support the company’s planned investment of more than $65 billion in three greenfield leading-edge fabs in Phoenix, Arizona," the Commerce Department <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-chips-incentives-award-tsmc-arizona">press release</a> said. At that time, Joe Biden had promised those fabs would "manufacture the most advanced chips in the world," putting the US "on track to produce 20 percent of the world’s leading-edge semiconductors by 2030."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/tsmc-will-reportedly-invest-100b-to-expand-us-chip-fab-buildouts/">Read full article</a></p>

      Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt star in the Netflix original film <em>The Electric State</em>.

<p>Anthony and Joe Russo have their hands full these days with the Marvel films <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> and <em>Avengers: Secret War</em>, slated for 2026 and 2027 releases, respectively. But we'll get a chance to see another, smaller film from the directors this month on Netflix: <em>The Electric State</em>, adapted from the graphic novel by Swedish artist/designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_St%C3%A5lenhag">Simon Stålenhag</a>.</p>
<p>Stålenhag's stunningly surreal neofuturistic art—featured in his narrative art books, 2014's <em>Tales from the Loop</em> and 2016's <em>Things From the Flood</em>—inspired the 2020 eight-episode series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/tech-takes-a-back-seat-to-interconnected-human-stories-in-tales-from-the-loop/"><em>Tales From the Loop</em></a>, in which residents of a rural town find themselves grappling with strange occurrences thanks to the presence of an underground particle accelerator. That adaptation captured the mood and tone of the art that inspired it and received Emmy nominations for cinematography and special visual effects.</p>
<p><em>The Electric State</em> was Stålenhag's third such book, published in 2018 and set in a similar dystopian, ravaged landscape. Paragraphs of text, accompanied by larger artworks, tell the story of a teen girl named Michelle who must travel across the country with her robot companion to find her long-lost brother, while being pursued by a federal agent. The Russo brothers acquired the rights early on and initially intended to make the film with Universal, but when the studio decided it would not be giving the film a theatrical release, Netflix bought the distribution rights.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/humans-and-bots-take-on-the-system-in-the-electric-state-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Zach Barth, the namesake of game studio Zachtronics, tends to make a certain kind of game.</p>
<p>Besides crafting the free browser game <em>Infiniminer</em>, which <a href="https://www.cascadepbs.org/2015/08/the-godfather-of-minecraft-a-conversation-with-indie-gamer-zachary-barth">inspired the entire global <em>Minecraft</em> industry</a>, Barth and his collaborators made <em>SpaceChem</em>, <em>Infinifactory</em>, <em>TIS-100</em>, <em>Shenzen I/O</em>,<em> Opus Magnum</em>, and <em>Exapunks</em>. Each one of them is some combination of puzzle game, light capitalism horror, and the most memorable introductory-level computer science, chemistry, or logistics class into which you unwittingly enrolled. Each game is its own thing, but they have a certain similar brain feel between them. It is summed up perhaps best by the Zachtronics team itself in a book: <em><a href="https://www.zachtronics.com/zach-like/">Zach-Like</a></em>.</p>
<p>Barth and his crew have made other kinds of games, including a forward-looking visual novel about AI, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/eliza-review-startup-culture-meets-sci-fi-in-a-touching-fascinating-tale/"><em>Eliza</em></a>, and multiplayer card battler <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/nerts-is-the-free-pleasant-six-player-card-game-we-could-all-use-right-now/"><em>Nerts!</em></a>. And Barth himself told PC Gamer that he hates "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/one-of-the-best-puzzle-game-designers-is-back-with-kaizen-a-factory-story-a-game-about-manufacturing-japanese-consumer-goods-during-the-largest-economic-bubble-in-history/">saying Zach-like</a>." But fans of refining inputs, ordering operations, and working their way past constraints will thrill to learn that Zach is, in fact, back.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/kaizen-a-factory-story-makes-a-game-of-perfecting-1980s-japanese-manufacturing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Watching Genesis' cars evolve and mature over the years has been interesting. Originally part of Hyundai's lineup, Genesis stood up as a brand in its own right at the end of 2015. Those early Hyundai-badged Genesises (Geneses?) were impressive considering the H on the nose, the dealerships they were found in, and the price out the door. The soft bigotry of low expectations, perhaps.</p>
<p>As Genesis has become its own thing, its vehicles no longer get that kind of benefit of the doubt. They have to stand against competitors from established luxury brands, the old-timers from Europe and now-middle-aged Japanese competitors. Recruiting the people associated with many of Bentley and Audi's more memorable designs was a good move in that regard.</p>
<p>This GV80 Coupe's design proved to be a hit with neighbors and the general public—few cars we've tested in the past couple of years have garnered as many compliments. The coupe was a relatively recent addition to the normal GV80 SUV, sacrificing a little volume at the back for a rakish ducktail rear end. All four corners are wrapped in what's now Genesis' light signature, a pair of thin horizontal stripes with microlens arrays supplying the brightness at the front.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-genesis-gv80-coupe-proves-to-be-a-real-crowd-pleaser/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At Mobile World Congress, Google confirmed that a long-awaited Gemini AI feature it first teased nearly a year ago is ready for launch. The company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/google-rolls-out-voice-powered-ai-chat-to-the-masses/">conversational Gemini Live</a> will soon be able to view live video and screen sharing, a feature Google previously demoed as Project Astra. When Gemini's video capabilities arrive, you'll be able to simply show the robot something instead of telling it.</p>
<p>Right now, Google's multimodal AI can process text, images, and various kinds of documents. However, its ability to accept video as an input is spotty at best—sometimes it can summarize a YouTube video, and sometimes it can't, for unknown reasons. Later in March, the Gemini app on Android will get a major update to its video functionality. You'll be able to open your camera to provide Gemini Live a video stream or share your screen as a live video, thus allowing you to pepper Gemini with questions about what it sees.</p>

<p>It can be hard to keep track of which Google AI project is which—the 2024 Google I/O was largely a celebration of all things Gemini AI. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/google-strikes-back-at-openai-with-project-astra-ai-agent-prototype/">The Astra demo</a> made waves as it demonstrated a more natural way to interact with the AI. In the original video, which you can see below, Google showed how Gemini Live could answer questions in real time as the user swept a phone around a room. It had things to say about code on a computer screen, how speakers work, and a network diagram on a whiteboard. It even remembered where the user left their glasses from an earlier part of the video.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/gemini-live-will-learn-to-peer-through-your-camera-lens-in-a-few-weeks/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Droplets bouncing off surfaces are an everyday phenomenon, like raindrops bouncing off lotus leaves or water drops sizzling in a hot pan, levitating and sliding around—aka the Leidenfrost effect. There is also an inverse Leidenfrost effect, first described in 1969, that involves a hot object such as a droplet levitating above a cold surface. Understanding the mechanisms behind these phenomena is crucial to a broad range of practical applications, such as self-cleaning, anti-icing, anti-fogging, surface charge printing, or droplet-based logic systems.</p>
<p>Droplets usually only bounce if the surface is superheated or engineered in some way to reduce stickiness. Physicists from the City University of Hong Kong have figured out how to achieve this bouncing behavior of hot oil droplets off almost any surface, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/newton/fulltext/S2950-6360(25)00006-4">new paper</a> published in the journal Newton.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/study-finds-ultimate-fate-of-leidenfrost-droplets-depends-on-their-size/">reported previously</a>, in 1756, a German scientist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlob_Leidenfrost">Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost</a> reported <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276354792_A_Tract_About_Some_Qualities_of_Common_Water_English_translation_of_Johann_Gottlob_Leidenfrost_De_Aquae_Communis_Nonnullis_Qualitatibus_Tractatus_Duisburg_on_Rhine_1756_Carolyn_S_E_Wares_translator">his observation</a> of the unusual phenomenon. Normally, he noted, water splashed onto a very hot pan sizzles and evaporates very quickly. But if the pan's temperature is well above water's boiling point, "gleaming drops resembling quicksilver" will form and skitter across the surface. It's called the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect">Leidenfrost effect"</a> in his honor.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/these-hot-oil-droplets-can-bounce-off-any-surface/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The idea of flying satellites in "very" low-Earth orbit is not new. Dating back to the dawn of the space age in the late 1950s, the first US spy satellites, as part of the Corona program, orbited the planet as low as 120 to 160 km (75 to 100 miles) above the Earth.</p>
<p>This low vantage point allowed the Kodak cameras on board the Corona satellites to capture the highest-resolution images of Earth during the height of the Cold War. However, flying so close to the planet brought a number of challenges, most notably that of atmospheric drag.</p>
<p>For much of the space age, therefore, satellites have flown much higher orbits. Most satellites today fly at an altitude of between 400 and 800 km (250 and 500 miles), which is high enough to avoid the vast majority of atmospheric drag while still being close enough to offer good communications and a clear view of the planet.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/how-low-can-you-go-firm-near-launch-of-atmosphere-skimming-satellite/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple's slow trickle of early 2025 product announcements is apparently set to continue this week, following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/apple-announces-iphone-16e-to-replace-iphone-se-starts-at-599-for-128gb/">the introduction of the iPhone 16e</a> a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-02/apple-siri-compared-with-alexa-m4-macbook-air-and-ipad-air-2025-coming-soon-m7rn2k2y">According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a>, the company plans to refresh its 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air laptops "as early as this coming week," adding the M4 processor that Apple put in the iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro lineups <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/review-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-are-probably-apples-best-mac-minis-ever/">last fall</a>.</p>
<p>An M4 refresh for the MacBook Air was always likely, but Apple has kept us guessing about the timing. Usually, the MacBook Airs are among the first devices to get new M-series processors from Apple, but Apple surprised us by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/m4-ipad-pro-review-well-now-youre-just-showing-off/">bringing the M4 to the iPad Pro</a> just a few months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/review-apples-efficient-m3-macbook-airs-are-just-about-as-good-as-laptops-get/">introducing the M3</a>. In mid-December, concrete references to the M4 MacBook Air <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/errant-reference-in-macos-15-2-seems-to-confirm-m4-macbook-airs-for-2025/">appeared in the macOS 15.2 update</a>, suggesting that the laptops were in testing, even if they weren't ready for a public launch yet.</p>
<p>The laptops are unlikely to look too different from the current M2 or M3 MacBook Airs, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/theres-no-m4-macbook-air-this-week-but-the-8gb-m2-and-m3-models-are-going-away/">got an "update" of sorts last fall</a> when Apple discontinued the versions with 8GB of RAM in favor of 16GB versions that kept the same prices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/report-m4-macbook-air-as-early-as-this-week-new-ipads-shortly-after/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Leading artificial intelligence firms including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta are turning to a process called “distillation” in the global race to create AI models that are cheaper for consumers and businesses to adopt.</p>
<p>The technique caught widespread attention after China’s DeepSeek used it to build powerful and efficient AI models based on open source systems released by competitors Meta and Alibaba. The breakthrough rocked confidence in Silicon Valley’s AI leadership, leading Wall Street investors to wipe billions of dollars of value from US Big Tech stocks.</p>
<p>Through distillation, companies take a large language model—dubbed a “teacher” model—which generates the next likely word in a sentence. The teacher model generates data which then trains a smaller “student” model, helping to quickly transfer knowledge and predictions of the bigger model to the smaller one.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-firms-follow-deepseeks-lead-create-cheaper-models-with-distillation/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Teens increasingly traumatized by deepfake nudes clearly understand that the AI-generated images are harmful.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And apparently so do many of their tormentors, who typically use free or cheap <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/popular-ai-nudify-sites-sued-amid-shocking-rise-in-victims-globally/">"nudify" apps</a> or web tools to "undress" innocuous pics of victims, then pass the fake nudes around school or to people they know online. A surprising recent <a href="https://www.thorn.org/research/library/deepfake-nudes-and-young-people/">Thorn survey</a> suggests there's growing consensus among young people under 20 that making and sharing fake nudes is obviously abusive.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's no question that AI systems have accomplished some impressive feats, mastering games, writing text, and generating convincing images and video. That's gotten some people talking about the possibility that we're on the cusp of AGI, or artificial general intelligence. While some of this is marketing fanfare, enough people in the field are taking the idea seriously that it warrants a closer look.</p>
<p>Many arguments come down to the question of how AGI is defined, which people in the field can't seem to agree upon. This contributes to estimates of its advent that range from "it's practically here" to "we'll never achieve it." Given that range, it's impossible to provide any sort of informed perspective on how close we are.</p>
<p>But we do have an existing example of AGI without the "A"—the intelligence provided by the animal brain, particularly the human one. And one thing is clear: The systems being touted as evidence that AGI is just around the corner do not work at all like the brain does. That may not be a fatal flaw, or even a flaw at all. It's entirely possible that there's more than one way to reach intelligence, depending on how it's defined. But at least some of the differences are likely to be functionally significant, and the fact that AI is taking a very different route from the one working example we have is likely to be meaningful.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-general-intelligence/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz's EV efforts aren't exactly burning up the sales charts. Models like the EQS and EQE haven't convinced the brand's demanding clientele that batteries are the future, forcing the company to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/mercedes-benz-scales-back-electric-ambitions-as-ev-pessimism-grows/">scale back</a> its electric ambitions.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Astronauts on the International Space Station often suffer from various immune system dysfunctions, including allergies and skin rashes, even though they go through rigorous screening and are probably among the healthiest people on (or at least near) Earth. “It’s hard to pinpoint the exact causes for a lot of these symptoms, but we believe microbiome disruptions that happen in their bodies and in their environment up there could be playing an important part”, says Rodolfo Salido Benitez, a bioengineering researcher at the University of California, San Diego who co-authored the largest study on the ISS microbiome to date.</p>
<p>After analyzing over 800 samples collected by astronauts in multiple modules of the United States Orbital Segment in the ISS, Benitez and his team concluded the microbial and chemical environment on the station closely resembled the one found at COVID-19 isolation wards during the height of the pandemic. And that may be less than ideal for keeping people healthy.</p>
<h2>Swabbing the space decks</h2>
<p>Monitoring microbial life on the ISS is an ongoing effort, and studies of this sort have been done before, although at a much smaller scale. “Previous studies used a low number of samples that could not identify all microbial and chemical factors present up there,” said Nina Zhao, a researcher at the UCSD and co-author of the study.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-space-station-is-nearly-as-microbe-free-as-an-isolation-ward/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Chieftain Range Rover is a fascinating thing—a refitted, reskinned, restored classic Range Rover is no new thing, nor is one with a ludicrous American V8 stuffed under the hood. But one that can be had as a gas car, plug-in hybrid, or as an EV? It can be all of those things depending on which boxes you tick. Ars Technica went for a spin in the EV to see how it stacks up.</p>
<p>The UK is something of an EV restomod hub. It's been throwing electricity in things that didn't come off the line electrified in the first place for years. Businesses like Electrogenic, Lunaz, and Everrati will, for a price, make an old car feel a little more peppy—depending on who you go to, it'll come back restored as well. The Chieftain isn't quite like them. Developed by Oxfordshire, UK, based Jensen International Automotive (the company's bread 'n butter is Jensen Interceptors), the Chieftain is an old Range Rover turned up to VERY LOUD. Or, actually, not loud at all.</p>
<p>Of course, these things come at a cost. A Chieftain EV Range Rover conversion, today, will set you back at least $568,000 should you choose to order one. This one was a private commission, and at that price there won't be any built on spec on the off chance someone wants to buy one "off the peg." By any stretch of the imagination it is a huge amount for an old car, but they're custom-built from start to finish.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/driving-an-ev-restomod-that-costs-as-much-as-a-house-the-jia-chieftain/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The T-1000 in <em>Terminator 2</em> could change shape at will, morph its hands into blades or turn parts of its body into a fluid to move through metal bars. “I saw this movie when I was a child—it was like, 'Wow, can you imagine,' I thought, 'being able to do this?'” says Otger Campàs, a professor at Max Planck Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany. “Now I work on embryos. And what we saw in <em>The Terminator</em> actually happens in an embryo. This kind of shape shifting is what an embryo does.”</p>
<p>Campàs and his team drew inspiration from processes called fluidization and convergent extension—mechanisms that cells in embryos use to coordinate their behavior when forming tissues and organs in a developing organism. The team built a robotic collective where each robotic unit behaved like an embryonic cell. As a collective, the robots behaved like a material that could change shape and switch between solid and liquid states, just like the T-1000.</p>
<h2>Real-world and sci-fi alloys</h2>
<p>The T-1000 was a marvel to behold, but the movie gave no clues as to how it worked. This is why Campàs and his colleagues looked for clues elsewhere. Similar shape-shifting properties have been observed in embryos when you watch their development sped up using time-lapse imaging. “Tissues in embryos can switch between solid and fluid states to shape the organs. We were thinking how we could engineer robots that would do the same,” Campàs says.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/weve-figured-out-the-basics-of-a-shape-shifting-t-1000-style-material/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A little over 20 years ago, Valve was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-valve-made-half-life-2-and-set-a-new-standard-for-future-games/">getting ready to release a new <em>Half-Life</em> game</a>. At the same time, the company <a href="https://www.bluesnews.com/a/337/valve-unveils-steam-at-2002-game-developer-s-conference">was trying to push Steam</a> as a new option for players to download and update games over the Internet.</p>
<p>Requiring Steam in order to play <em>Half-Life 2</em> led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">plenty of grumbling from players</a> in 2004. But the high-profile Steam exclusive helped build an instant user base for Valve's fresh distribution system, setting it on a path to eventually become the unquestioned leader in the space. The link between the new game and the new platform helped promote a bold alternative to the retail game sales and distribution systems that had dominated PC gaming for decades.</p>

<p>Among hundreds of US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) employees terminated this month were 12 members of the Great Lakes sea lamprey control program, based at field stations in Marquette and Ludington, Michigan.</p>
<p>These staffing cuts could have grave consequences for the lakes’ native fish population and the $5 billion fishery they comprise.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/federal-firings-could-wreak-havoc-on-great-lakes-fishery/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX plans to launch the eighth full-scale test flight of its enormous Starship rocket as soon as Monday after receiving regulatory approval from the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>The test flight will be a repeat of what SpaceX hoped to achieve on the previous Starship launch in January, when the rocket broke apart and showered debris over the Atlantic Ocean and Turks and Caicos Islands. The accident prevented SpaceX from completing many of the flight's goals, such as testing Starship's satellite deployment mechanism and new types of heat shield material.</p>
<p>Those things are high on the to-do list for Flight 8, set to lift off at 5:30 pm CST (6:30 pm EST; 23:30 UTC) Monday from SpaceX's Starbase launch facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. Over the weekend, SpaceX plans to mount the rocket's Starship upper stage atop the Super Heavy booster already in position on the launch pad.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/spacex-readies-a-redo-of-last-months-ill-fated-starship-test-flight/">Read full article</a></p>
