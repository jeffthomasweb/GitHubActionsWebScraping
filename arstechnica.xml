                            <![CDATA[<p>Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their collective work in the discovery of specialized immune cells that roam the body and keep potentially harmful immune responses in check—preventing them from attacking the body directly (autoimmune responses) or causing harm with overzealous responses to invaders.</p>
<p>Those specialized cells—regulatory T cells—are now well established as playing a key role in peripheral immune tolerance. That is, a non-central process that allows the immune system to strike a delicate balance between being appropriately responsive and aggressive toward intruding germs or foreign dangers while also not running amok.</p>
<p>Before the trio of prize winners came along, researchers thought that such immune tolerance occurred centrally, in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that sits in the center of the chest. There, T cells mature, including into two key types: T helper cells, which go on to trigger immune responses when they recognize foreign dangers; and the aptly named T killer cells, which kill cells, including foreign cells, cancer cells, and cells infected by a virus.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/discovery-of-cells-that-keep-immune-responses-in-check-wins-medicine-nobel-prize/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent a letter to the nonprofit operator of Wikipedia alleging a pattern of liberal bias in articles on the collaborative encyclopedia.</p>
<p>"I write to request information about ideological bias on the Wikipedia platform and at the Wikimedia Foundation," Cruz wrote to Wikimedia Foundation CEO Maryana Iskander in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025.10.03-Letter-to-Wikimedia-Foundation.pdf">letter</a> dated October 3. "Wikipedia began with a noble concept: crowdsource human knowledge using verifiable sources and make it free to the public. That's what makes reports of Wikipedia's systemic bias especially troubling."</p>
<p>Citing research from the conservative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Institute_for_Policy_Research">Manhattan Institute</a>, Cruz wrote that "researchers have found that articles on the site often reflect a left-wing bias." Cruz alleged that "bias is particularly evident in Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources">reliable sources/perennial sources</a> list" because it describes "MSNBC and CNN as 'generally reliable' sources, while listing Fox News as a 'generally unreliable' source for politics and science. The left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center gets a top rating, but the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank, is a 'blacklisted' and 'deprecated' source that Wikipedia's editors have determined 'promotes disinformation.'"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/ted-cruz-picks-a-fight-with-wikipedia-accusing-platform-of-left-wing-bias/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS1YqcewH0c">an OpenAI Dev Days keynote today</a>, CEO Sam Altman announced that the company is launching an SDK preview that will allow developers the ability "to build real apps inside of ChatGPT." Altman said that, starting today, the new SDK will give developers "full stack" control over app data, action triggers, and even interactive user interfaces for apps that can appear inline as part of an existing ChatGPT conversation window.</p>
<p>The SDK is built on <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro">the open source Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP), Altman said. That means developers that already use MCP only need to add an HTML resource to enable ChatGPT integration, he added.</p>
<p>The new integration means a ChatGPT user can directly ask Figma to turn a sketch into a diagram, for instance, and get results integrated into their ChatGPT conversation. It also means that ChatGPT can suggest apps that might be suited to a more general query, like recommending and creating a Spotify playlist when someone asks for song suggestions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-wants-to-make-chatgpt-into-a-universal-app-frontend/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>“Illusions are fun, but they are also a gateway to perception,” says Hyeyoung Shin, assistant professor of neuroscience at Seoul National University. Shin is the first author of a new study in Nature Neuroscience that has identified a specific population of neurons in the visual cortex—dubbed IC-encoders—and shows their direct role in representing a visual illusion. The work is the result of a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Allen Institute in Seattle, and Seoul National University.</p>
<h2>What the brain “knows”</h2>
<p>Illusory contours are edges we see even though they aren’t physically there. A classic example is the <a href="https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/kanizsa-triangle">Kanizsa triangle</a>: three “Pac-Man” shapes make us perceive a bright white triangle floating on top. Hide the Pac-Men with your fingers and the trick is revealed: There is no border, just a uniform background. Neurophysiology agrees with perception here: For over 20 years, studies in primates and later imaging in humans and mice have described neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond to real and illusory contours.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Environmental Protection Agency was sued Wednesday over an allegedly politically motivated decision to end a program that Congress intended to help low-income and disadvantaged communities across the US save money on electricity bills through rooftop and community solar programs.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rhode-Island-AFL-CIO-v-EPA-Complaint-10-6-25.pdf">complaint</a>, a group of plaintiffs who would have benefited from the EPA's "Solar for All" program—including a labor union, several businesses, and a homeowner who cannot afford her electricity bills without it—accused the EPA of violating federal law and the Constitution by unlawfully terminating the program.</p>
<p>Solar for All was "expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills during and after the five-year program, providing energy bill relief for more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households," plaintiffs noted. Additionally, it was "expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years and generate 200,000 new jobs."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trumps-epa-sued-for-clawing-back-7b-in-solar-energy-funds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/deloitte-to-refund-government-after-admitting-ai-errors-in-440k-report-20251005-p5n05p">Australian Financial Review reports</a> that Deloitte Australia will offer the Australian government a partial refund for a report that was littered with AI-hallucinated quotes and references to nonexistent research.</p>
<p>Deloitte's "Targeted Compliance Framework Assurance Review" was finalized in July and published by Australia's Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) in August (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250905115547/https://www.dewr.gov.au/download/17099/targeted-compliance-framework-assurance-review-final-report/40749/targeted-compliance-framework-independent-review-final-report/pdf">Internet Archive version of the original</a>). The report, which <a href="https://www.tenders.gov.au/Cn/Show/05c19be8-a95f-4379-bd35-630cc2f472c6">cost Australian taxpayers nearly $440,000 AUD</a> (about $290,000 USD), focuses on the technical framework the government uses to automate penalties under the country's welfare system.</p>
<p>Shortly after the report was published, though, Sydney University Deputy Director of Health Law Chris Rudge noticed citations to multiple papers and publications that did not exist. That included multiple references to nonexistent reports by Lisa Burton Crawford, <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/law/about/our-people/academic-staff/l-crawford.html">a real professor</a> at the University of Sydney law school.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/deloitte-will-refund-australian-government-for-ai-hallucination-filled-report/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Few modern F1 venues are as dazzling as the Marina Bay circuit in Singapore. If you watch the early practice or the young women of F1 Academy in their races, you'll get an idea of the street circuit's relationship to the city in daylight as it takes in landmarks and crosses the water. At night, the brilliant white ribbon of racetrack throws the rest of the surroundings into darkness. Unlike a Le Mans car, there are no headlights in F1.</p>
<p>Just over 1,600 lights are needed for the job, which got underway in mid-June. They're LED now, a switch made in 2023 that cut energy consumption by a noticeable 30 percent. The light itself is even carefully tuned—a color of 5,700 K and a color rendering index of 90 best replicate daylight for the drivers. Oh, and there can't be any flickering that could affect the TV broadcast. The results look spectacular, especially in 4K.</p>
<p>As for the racing this year? Perhaps not so much. Past Singaporean Grands Prix have tended to be action-packed—or even chaotic. In the inaugural 2008 race, Red Bull came away convinced that <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/red-bull-still-puzzled-by-singapore-failure-4423929/4423929/">electromagnetic interference from an underground train line</a> caused the failure of one of its race cars, as well as a sister car belonging to the team we now call Racing Bulls. Other teams <a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2015/09/19/magnetic-field-affects-hybrid-f1-cars-in-singapore/">remained worried</a> about this phenomenon as late as 2015, although no similar failures had been recorded. <a href="https://blog.sgtrains.com/2022/10/mrt-gearbox-interference-singapore-gp/">For the record</a>, Singapore's Land Transit Authority says there was no train track below the relevant corner of the circuit—the nearest train tunnel is more than 600 feet away (200 m) and 32 feet (10 m) below ground level.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/f1-in-singapore-trophy-for-the-hero-of-race/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, AMD <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1260/amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus">announced</a> it will supply AI chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal worth tens of billions of dollars annually that gives the ChatGPT creator an option to acquire up to 10 percent of the chipmaker's stock for 1 cent per share, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-signs-ai-chip-supply-deal-with-openai-gives-it-option-take-10-stake-2025-10-06/">reports</a>. The agreement covers hundreds of thousands of AMD's AI graphics processing units over several years starting in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>The deal marks a major endorsement of AMD's AI hardware and software capabilities as the company competes with Nvidia for dominance in the AI chip market. AMD executives project the agreement will generate more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers who follow OpenAI's lead.</p>
<p>"We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD Executive Vice President Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday. The chipmaker will start booking income from the deal next year when OpenAI starts building a 1 gigawatt facility based on AMD's forthcoming MI450 series chips.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/amd-wins-massive-ai-chip-deal-from-openai-with-stock-sweetener/">Read full article</a></p>

Apple, which was reportedly already facing internal dissent over its deal with Globalstar, now has another reason to wonder if it made the right choice in rejecting an offer from Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Pending regulatory approval, SpaceX will acquire EchoStar's AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses, giving Musk's space company the rights to 50 MHz of spectrum in the 1.9 and lower 2 GHz spectrum bands. SpaceX plans to acquire EchoStar's rights to the spectrum in the US and globally.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/starlinks-ambitious-mobile-plan-could-be-trouble-for-apple-att-and-verizon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In 1915, intrepid British explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton#Loss_of_Endurance">Sir Ernest Shackleton</a> and his crew were stranded for months in the Antarctic after their ship, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_(1912_ship)"><em>Endurance</em></a>, was trapped by pack ice, eventually sinking into the freezing depths of the Weddell Sea. Miraculously, the entire crew survived. The prevailing popular narrative surrounding the famous voyage features two key assumptions: that <em>Endurance</em> was the strongest polar ship of its time, and that the ship ultimately sank after ice tore away the rudder.</p>
<p>However, a fresh analysis reveals that <em>Endurance</em> would have sunk even with an intact rudder; it was crushed by the cumulative compressive forces of the Antarctic ice with no single cause for the sinking. Furthermore, the ship wasn't designed to withstand those forces, and Shackleton was likely well aware of that fact, according to a new paper published in the journal Polar Record. Yet he chose to embark on the risky voyage anyway.</p>
<p>Author Jukka Tuhkuri of Aalto University is a polar explorer and one of the leading researchers on ice worldwide. He was among the scientists on the Endurance22 mission <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/long-lost-endurance-shipwreck-found-off-coast-of-antarctica/">that discovered</a> the <em>Endurance</em> shipwreck in 2022, documented in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/endurance-documents-hunt-for-shackletons-shipwreck/">2024 National Geographic documentary</a>. The ship was in pristine condition partly because of the lack of wood-eating microbes in those waters. In fact, the <a href="https://endurance22.org/endurance-is-found">Endurance22</a> expedition's exploration director, Mensun Bound, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/climate/endurance-wreck-found-shackleton.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm4TiO8RAo2J50qKaKxvesE62T-WAcBbPbQsAfJ10-lTeldtQgKrppaYn5JDIzkwrcj7eFIK6K_3fOJy9y72PC7-If1jxba7slXZbTPvUKHa02kjJl1ivZdndgm10CEIlrPEF-Ei3dZ72q9yBspqVHxXMnnxyvrsAx5-Ot6EbQiNqVVlHrEEBkyA2IKU-LkCcw5NCFjZTXMZ4Wo06NhUONJ_L7-oZld7O5K42eNNfzQueIS5BJQxRJzWkqFouNPOrR-Py8m1zpYmBVg--mmU6nTm_2LWKGN0Crc&amp;smid=fb-share&amp;fbclid=IwAR0CNFsGD1ve4gX45N7yyyGCYyI17hQ7DjWmMNn8oW9hoM-DvYGZeTcubA8">told The New York Times</a> at the time that the shipwreck was the finest example he's ever seen; <em>Endurance</em> was "in a brilliant state of preservation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/heres-the-real-reason-endurance-sank/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Around this time each year, the US Space Force convenes a Mission Assignment Board to dole out contracts to launch the nation's most critical national security satellites. The military announced this year's launch orders Friday, and SpaceX was the big winner.</p>
<p>Space Systems Command, the unit responsible for awarding military launch contracts, selected SpaceX to launch five of the seven missions up for assignment this year. United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, won contracts for the other two. These missions for the Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office are still at least a couple of years away from flying.</p>
<p>SpaceX and ULA are the only companies with rockets certified by the Space Force to launch the Pentagon's big-ticket satellites. ULA's Vulcan rocket, which replaces the company's Atlas V, debuted nearly two years ago and successfully launched its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/after-first-operational-launch-heres-the-next-big-test-for-ulas-vulcan-rocket/">first national security mission in August</a>.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Magic mushrooms have been used in traditional ceremonies and for recreational purposes for thousands of years. However, a new study has found that mushrooms evolved the ability to make the same psychoactive substance twice. The discovery has important implications for both our understanding of these mushrooms’ role in nature and their medical potential.</p>
<p>Magic mushrooms produce psilocybin, which your body converts into its active form, psilocin, when you ingest it. Psilocybin <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00186">rose in popularity</a> in the 1960s and was eventually classed as a <a href="https://www.drugs.com/article/csa-schedule-1.html">Schedule 1 drug</a> in the US in 1970, and as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/penalties-drug-possession-dealing">Class A drug</a> in 1971 in the UK, the designations given to drugs that have high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This put a stop to research on the medical use of psilocybin for decades.</p>
<p>But recent clinical trials have shown that psilocybin <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.3c00390">can reduce depression</a> severity, suicidal thoughts, and chronic anxiety. Given <a href="https://theconversation.com/brain-altering-fungi-could-lead-the-next-frontier-in-mental-health-care-203371">its potential</a> for medical treatments, there is <a href="https://theconversation.com/lasting-relief-from-depression-after-magic-mushroom-treatment-new-study-265219">renewed interest</a> in understanding how psilocybin is made in nature and how we can produce it sustainably.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/how-different-mushrooms-learned-the-same-psychedelic-trick/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/kff-health-tracking-poll-public-weighs-political-consequences-of-health-policy-legislation/">new polling data</a>, nearly 80 percent of Americans support extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of this year—and are at the center of a funding dispute that led to a shutdown of the federal government this week.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by KFF and released Friday, found that 78 percent of Americans want the tax credits extended, including 92 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of Republicans—and even a majority (57 percent) of Republicans who identify as Donald Trump-aligned MAGA (Make America Great Again) supporters.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/">separate analysis</a> published by KFF earlier this week found that if the credits are not extended, monthly premiums for ACA Marketplace plans would more than double on average. Specifically, the current average premium of $888 would jump to $1,904 in 2026, a 114 percent increase.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/most-americans-want-aca-tax-credits-extended-even-57-of-maga-supporters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A new listing of the 50 most concerning pieces of space debris in low-Earth orbit is dominated by relics more than a quarter-century old, primarily dead rockets left to hurtle through space at the end of their missions.</p>
<p>"The things left before 2000 are still the majority of the problem," said Darren McKnight, lead author of a paper presented Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Sydney. "Seventy-six percent of the objects in the top 50 were deposited last century, and 88 percent of the objects are rocket bodies. That's important to note, especially with some disturbing trends right now."</p>
<p>The 50 objects identified by McKnight and his coauthors are the ones most likely to drive the creation of more space junk in low-Earth orbit (LEO) through collisions with other debris fragments. The objects are whizzing around the Earth at nearly 5 miles per second, flying in a heavily trafficked part of LEO between 700 and 1,000 kilometers (435 to 621 miles) above the Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/everyone-but-china-has-pretty-much-stopped-littering-in-low-earth-orbit/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, a team of researchers led by Microsoft announced that they had discovered, and possibly patched, what they're terming a biological zero-day—an unrecognized security hole in a system that protects us from biological threats. The system at risk screens purchases of DNA sequences to determine when someone's ordering DNA that encodes a toxin or dangerous virus. But, the researchers argue, it has become increasingly vulnerable to missing a new threat: AI-designed toxins.</p>
<p>How big of a threat is this? To understand, you have to know a bit more about both existing biosurveillance programs and the capabilities of AI-designed proteins.</p>
<h2>Catching the bad ones</h2>
<p>Biological threats come in a variety of forms. Some are pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Others are protein-based toxins, like the ricin that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_ricin_letters">sent to the White House</a> in 2003. Still others are chemical toxins that are produced through enzymatic reactions, like the molecules <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycotoxin">associated with red tide</a>. All of them get their start through the same fundamental biological process: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then used to make proteins.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/do-ai-designed-proteins-create-a-biosecurity-vulnerability/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>As we careen toward a future in which Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-will-block-sideloading-of-unverified-android-apps-starting-next-year/">has final say over what apps you can run</a>, the company has sought to assuage the community's fears with a blog post and a casual "backstage" video. Google has said again and again since announcing the change that sideloading isn't going anywhere, but it's definitely not going to be as easy. The <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/09/lets-talk-security-answering-your-top.html">new information</a> confirms app installs will be more reliant on the cloud, and devs can expect new fees, but there will be an escape hatch for hobbyists.</p>
<p>Confirming app verification status will be the job of a new system component called the Android Developer Verifier, which will be rolled out to devices in the next major release of Android 16. Google explains that phones must ensure each app has a package name and signing keys that have been registered with Google at the time of installation. This process may <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/f-droid-calls-for-regulators-to-stop-googles-crackdown-on-sideloading/">break the popular FOSS storefront F-Droid</a>.</p>
<p>It would be impossible for your phone to carry a database of all verified apps, so this process may require Internet access. Google plans to have a local cache of the most common sideloaded apps on devices, but for anything else, an Internet connection is required. Google suggests alternative app stores will be able to use a pre-auth token to bypass network calls, but it's still deciding how that will work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-confirms-android-dev-verification-will-have-free-and-paid-tiers-no-public-list-of-devs/">Read full article</a></p>
