                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Our explanation of the outer Solar System has revealed a host of icy moons, many with surface features that suggest a complex geology. In some cases, these features—most notably the geysers of Enceladus—hint at the presence of oceans beneath the icy surfaces. These oceans have been ascribed to gravitational interactions that cause flexing and friction within the moon, creating enough heat to melt the body’s interior.</p>
<p>Something that has received a bit less attention is that some of these orbital interactions are temporary or cyclical. The orbits of any body are not always regular and often have long-term cycles. That’s also true for the other moons that provide the gravitational stress. As a result, the internal oceans may actually come and go, as the interiors of the moons melt and refreeze.</p>
<p>A new study, released today by Nature Astronomy, looks at one of the consequences of the difference in density between liquid water and ice (about 10 percent): the potential for the moon’s interior to shrink as it melts, leaving an area of low pressure immediately below its icy shell. If the moon is small enough, this study suggests, that could cause the surface of the ocean to boil.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/formation-of-oceans-within-icy-moons-could-cause-the-waters-to-boil/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most prominent change for most users is that in the consumer app experiences (web, mobile, and desktop), Claude will be less prone to abruptly hard-stopping conversations because they have run too long. The improvement to memory within a single conversation applies not just to Opus 4.5, but to any current Claude models in the apps.</p>
<p>Users who experienced abrupt endings (despite having room left in their session and weekly usage budgets) were hitting a hard context window (200,000 tokens). Whereas some large language model implementations simply start trimming earlier messages from the context when a conversation runs past the maximum in the window, Claude simply ended the conversation rather than allow the user to experience an increasingly incoherent conversation where the model would start forgetting things based on how old they are.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/anthropic-introduces-opus-4-5-cuts-api-pricing-and-enables-much-longer-claude-chats/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Launch companies with facilities near SpaceX’s Starship pads are not pleased.

<p>This isn’t the first time Blue Origin and ULA have tried to throw up roadblocks in front of SpaceX. The companies sought to prevent NASA from leasing a disused launch pad to SpaceX in 2013, but they lost the fight.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/rivals-object-to-spacexs-starship-plans-in-florida-whos-interfering-with-whom/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After Donald Trump curiously started referring to the Department of Government Efficiency exclusively in the past tense, an official finally confirmed Sunday that DOGE “doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-doesnt-exist-with-eight-months-left-its-charter-2025-11-23/">Talking to Reuters</a>, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Kupor confirmed that DOGE—a government agency notoriously created by Elon Musk to rapidly and dramatically slash government agencies—was terminated more than eight months early. This may have come as a surprise to whoever runs the <a href="https://x.com/DOGE">DOGE account</a> on X, which continued posting up until two days before the Reuters report was published.</p>
<p>As Kupor explained, a “centralized agency” was no longer necessary, since OPM had “taken over many of DOGE’s functions” after Musk left the agency last May. Around that time, DOGE staffers were embedded at various agencies, where they could ostensibly better coordinate with leadership on proposed cuts to staffing and funding.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/doge-doesnt-exist-anymore-but-expert-says-its-still-not-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Some members of the maker community are distraught about Arduino’s <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/terms-conditions/">new terms of service</a> (ToS), saying that the added rules put the company’s open source DNA at risk.</p>
<p>Arduino updated its ToS and<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/"> privacy policy</a> this month, which is about a month after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/arduino-retains-its-brand-and-mission-following-acquisition-by-qualcomm/">Qualcomm announced that it’s acquiring</a> the open source hardware and software company.

<blockquote><p>User shall not:</p>
<ul>
<li>translate, decompile or reverse-engineer the Platform, or engage in any other activity designed to identify the algorithms and logic of the Platform’s operation, unless expressly allowed by Arduino or by applicable license agreements …</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to concerns from some <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adafruit_opensource-privacy-techpolicy-activity-7396903362237054976-r14H/">members of the maker community</a>, including from open source hardware distributor and manufacturer <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/about">Adafruit</a>, Arduino posted a <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2025/11/21/the-arduino-terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy-update-setting-the-record-straight/">blog</a> on Friday.

                            <![CDATA[<p>The emergence of synthetic pigments in the 19th century had an immense impact on the art world, particularly the availability of emerald-green pigments, prized for their intense brilliance by such masters as Paul Cézanne, Edvard Munch, Vincent van Gogh, and Claude Monet. The downside was that these pigments often degraded over time, resulting in cracks and uneven surfaces and the formation of dark copper oxides—even the release of arsenic compounds.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s a major concern for conservationists of such masterpieces. So it should be welcome news that European researchers have used synchrotron radiation and various other analytical tools to determine whether light and/or humidity are the culprits behind that degradation and how, specifically, it occurs, according to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady1807">a paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances.</p>
<p>Science has become a valuable tool for art conservationists, especially various X-ray imaging methods. For instance, in 2019, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/scientists-develop-new-tool-to-study-acne-in-georgia-okeefe-paintings/">we reported</a> on how many of the oil paintings at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico, had been developing tiny, pin-sized blisters, almost like acne, for decades. Chemists concluded that the blisters are actually metal carboxylate soaps, the result of a chemical reaction between metal ions in the lead and zinc pigments and fatty acids in the binding medium used in the paint. The soaps start to clump together to form the blisters and migrate through the paint film.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/why-synthetic-emerald-green-pigments-degrade-over-time/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>LAS VEGAS—Formula 1 held the third annual Las Vegas Grand Prix this past weekend in the Nevada city. The race is an outlier in so many ways, and a divisive one at that. Some love the bright lights that make it appear to be set in Mega-City One or <em>F-Zero</em>. Others resent the rampant commercialism of F1 at its most excessive. And this time, Ars was on the ground, making one of our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/why-f1s-switch-from-13-inch-to-18-inch-tires-is-important/">periodic visits</a> to the series. The race we saw was something of a damp squib, seemingly leaving McLaren’s Lando Norris in control of the championship.</p>
<p>At least that’s how it looked when I left the track on Saturday night. Within a few hours, Norris and his teammate (and one of his two title rivals) Oscar Piastri were both disqualified for having worn away too much of the “legality plank” underneath the car—more on that in a while.</p>

      I was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/f1-succeeds-in-making-its-las-vegas-debut-a-spectacular-one/"&gt;a huge skeptic of the idea&lt;/a&gt; when the Las Vegas race was announced, but the first two events put on a good show. Year 3 was a little more dull, however.

<h2>Emblematic of the new F1</h2>
<p>Unlike most Grands Prix, Liberty Media promotes this one itself. It spent half a billion dollars to get ready for the 2023 event, some of that on the pit lane and paddock complex, yet more on resurfacing the roads to the standards preferred by these thoroughbred racing cars. The track layout—which looks like a pig on its back—is typical of North American street circuits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/f1-in-las-vegas-this-sport-is-a-200-mph-soap-opera/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hacker conferences—like all conventions—are notorious for giving attendees a parting gift of mystery illness. To combat “con crud,” New Zealand’s premier hacker conference, Kawaiicon, quietly launched a real-time, room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system for attendees.</p>
<p>To get the system up and running, event organizers installed DIY CO<sub>2</sub> monitors throughout the Michael Fowler Centre venue before conference doors opened on November 6. Attendees were able to check a public online dashboard for clean air readings for session rooms, kids’ areas, the front desk, and more, all before even showing up. “It’s ALMOST like we are all nerds in a risk-based industry,” the organizers <a href="https://kawaiicon.org/health-and-safety/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://kawaiicon.org/health-and-safety/" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">wrote</a> on the convention’s website.</p>
<p>“What they did is fantastic,” Jeff Moss, founder of the <a href="https://defcon.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://defcon.org/" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">Defcon</a> and <a href="https://blackhat.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://blackhat.com/" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">Black Hat</a> security conferences, told WIRED. “CO<sub>2</sub> is being used as an approximation for so many things, but there are no easy, inexpensive network monitoring solutions available. Kawaiicon building something to do this is the true spirit of hacking.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/this-hacker-conference-installed-a-literal-antivirus-monitoring-system/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The International Association of Cryptologic Research (IACR) <a href="https://www.iacr.org/news/item/27138">said Friday</a> that the votes were submitted and tallied using <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/about">Helios</a>, an open source voting system that uses peer-reviewed cryptography to cast and count votes in a verifiable, confidential, and privacy-preserving way. Helios encrypts each vote in a way that assures each ballot is secret. Other cryptography used by Helios allows each voter to confirm their ballot was counted fairly.</p>
<h2>An “honest but unfortunate human mistake”</h2>
<p>Per the association’s bylaws, three members of the election committee act as independent trustees. To prevent two of them from colluding to cook the results, each trustee holds a third of the cryptographic key material needed to decrypt results.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/cryptography-group-cancels-election-results-after-official-loses-secret-key/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A man in Ireland earned the unpleasant distinction of developing an exceedingly rare infection on his penis—one that has a puzzling origin, but may be connected to his work with dead animals.</p>
<p>According to an article published in<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/asmcr.00141-25"> ASM Case Reports</a> on Thursday, the 57-year-old man went to a hospital in Dublin after his penis became red, swollen, and painful over the course of a week. He also had a fever. Doctors promptly admitted him to the hospital and noted that he had received a kidney transplant 15 years prior. As such, he was on immunosuppressive drugs, which keep his body from rejecting the organ, but could also allow infections to run amok.</p>
<p>Initial blood work found hints of an infection, and the doctors initially suspected a bacterial skin infection (cellulitis) had taken hold in his nether region. So, they put him on some standard antibiotics for that. But his penis only got worse, redder, and more swollen. This prompted consultation with infectious disease doctors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/why-you-dont-want-to-get-tuberculosis-on-your-penis/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Discovery Channel founder John Hendricks launched Curiosity Stream in 2015. The streaming service costs $40 per year, and it doesn’t have commercials.</p>
<p>The streaming business has grown to also include the Curiosity Channel TV channel. CuriosityStream Inc. also makes money through original programming and its Curiosity University educational programming. The firm turned its first positive net income in its fiscal Q1 2025, after about a decade of business.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/curiosity-stream-expects-to-make-most-of-its-money-from-ai-deals-by-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the past couple of weeks, friends and colleagues have made me aware of multiple ingeniously implemented, browser-based ways to play classic MS-DOS and Windows games with other people on basically any hardware.</p>
<p>The late 1990s and early 2000s were the peak of multiplayer gaming for me. It was the era of real-time strategy games and boomer shooters, and not only did I attend many LAN parties, but I also played online with friends.</p>
<p>That’s still possible today with several old-school games; there are Discord servers that arrange scheduled matches of <em>Starsiege Tribes</em>, for example. But oftentimes, it’s not exactly trivial to get those games running in modern Windows, and as in the old days, you might have some annoying network configuration work ahead of you—to say nothing of the fact that many folks who were on Windows back in those days are now on macOS or Linux instead.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/return-to-the-year-2000-with-classic-multiplayer-dos-games-in-your-browser/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Asus routers have been hacked and are under the control of a suspected China-state group that has yet to reveal its intentions for the mass compromise, researchers said.</p>
<p>The hacking spree is either primarily or exclusively targeting seven models of Asus routers, all of which are no longer supported by the manufacturer, meaning they no longer receive security patches, researchers from SecurityScorecard <a href="https://securityscorecard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/STRIKE_Asus_WrtHug-Report_V6.pdf">said</a>. So far, it’s unclear what the attackers do after gaining control of the devices. SecurityScorecard has named the operation WrtHug.</p>
<h2>Staying off the radar</h2>
<p>SecurityScorecard said it suspects the compromised devices are being used similarly to those found in ORB (operational relay box) networks, which hackers primarily use to conduct espionage to conceal their identity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/thousands-of-hacked-asus-routers-are-under-control-of-suspected-china-state-hackers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While AI bubble talk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/were-in-an-llm-bubble-hugging-face-ceo-says-but-not-an-ai-one/">fills the air</a> these days, with fears of overinvestment that could <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ars-live-recap-is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-pop-ed-zitron-weighs-in/">pop</a> at any time, something of a contradiction is brewing on the ground: Companies like Google and OpenAI can barely build infrastructure fast enough to fill their AI needs.</p>
<p>During an all-hands meeting earlier this month, Google’s AI infrastructure head Amin Vahdat told employees that the company must double its serving capacity every six months to meet demand for artificial intelligence services, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/google-must-double-ai-serving-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-demand.html">reports</a> CNBC. The comments show a rare look at what Google executives are telling its own employees internally. Vahdat, a vice president at Google Cloud, presented slides to its employees showing the company needs to scale “the next 1000x in 4-5 years.”</p>
<p>While a thousandfold increase in compute capacity sounds ambitious by itself, Vahdat noted some key constraints: Google needs to be able to deliver this increase in capability, compute, and storage networking “for essentially the same cost and increasingly, the same power, the same energy level,” he told employees during the meeting. “It won’t be easy but through collaboration and co-design, we’re going to get there.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/google-tells-employees-it-must-double-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-ai-demand/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AI systems have recently had a lot of success in one key aspect of biology: the relationship between a protein’s structure and its function. These efforts have included the ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/google-details-its-protein-folding-software-academics-offer-an-alternative/">predict the structure</a> of most proteins and to design proteins structured so that they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/polyurethane-is-the-latest-polymer-broken-down-by-designer-enzymes/">perform useful functions</a>. But all of these efforts are focused on the proteins and amino acids that build them.</p>
<p>But biology doesn’t generate new proteins at that level. Instead, changes have to take place in nucleic acids before eventually making their presence felt via proteins. And information at the DNA level is fairly removed from proteins, with lots of critical non-coding sequences, redundancy, and a fair degree of flexibility. It’s not necessarily obvious that learning the organization of a genome would help an AI system figure out how to make functional proteins.</p>
<p>But it now seems like using bacterial genomes for the training can help develop a system that can predict proteins, some of which don’t look like anything we’ve ever seen before.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/generative-ai-meets-the-genome/">Read full article</a></p>
