<p>More than 200 kilometers off Norway’s coast in the North Sea sits the world’s first offshore carbon capture and storage project. Built in 1996, the Sleipner project strips carbon dioxide from natural gas—largely made up of methane—to make it marketable. But instead of releasing the CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere, the greenhouse gas is buried.</p>
<p>The effort stores around 1 million metric tons of CO<sub>2 </sub>per year—and is praised by many as a pioneering success in global attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Last year, total global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions hit an all-time high of around 35.8 billion tons, or gigatons. At these levels, scientists estimate, we have roughly six years left before we emit so much CO<sub>2</sub> that global warming will consistently exceed 1.5° Celsius above average preindustrial temperatures, an internationally agreed-upon limit. (Notably, the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-june-2024">global average temperature</a> for the past 12 months has exceeded this threshold.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036280#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036280&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Before clearing Boeing's Starliner crew capsule to depart the International Space Station and head for Earth, NASA managers want to ensure the spacecraft's problematic control thrusters can help guide the ship's two-person crew home.</p>
<p>The two astronauts who launched June 5 on the Starliner spacecraft's first crew test flight agree with the managers, although they said Wednesday that they're comfortable with flying the capsule back to Earth if there's any emergency that might require evacuation of the space station.</p>
<p>NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were supposed to return to Earth weeks ago, but managers are keeping them at the station as engineers continue probing thruster problems and helium leaks that have plagued the mission since its launch.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036270#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036270&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple recently announced new games coming to Apple Arcade, its gaming subscription service for iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Vision Pro headsets. The headlining title is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, an indie hit that combined the gameplay of bullet hell shooters and the addictive quality of clickers to become a mega sensation two years ago. Also coming is <em>Temple Run: Legends</em>, an updated take on the popular game from 2011.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was already available on the App Store, but it was ad-supported, with the option to spend money in-app to get additional content. The Apple Arcade version, dubbed <em>Vampire Survivors+</em>, is more akin to the PC or Xbox versions that don't have ads. Both paid expansions will be included at no additional charge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Temple Run: Legends</em> is a completely new game (not just a remake of the original <em>Temple Run</em>) that bucks the "endless runner" genre label by breaking its gameplay into individual levels—though there will be some kind of optional endless mode, too.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036212#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036212&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Threat actors carried out zero-day attacks that targeted Windows users with malware for more than a year before Microsoft fixed the vulnerability that made them possible, researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, present in both Windows 10 and 11, causes devices to open Internet Explorer, a legacy browser that Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/06/15/internet-explorer-11-has-retired-and-is-officially-out-of-support-what-you-need-to-know/">decommissioned</a> in 2022 after its aging code base made it increasingly susceptible to exploits. Following the move, Windows made it difficult, if not impossible, for normal actions to open the browser, which was first introduced in the mid-1990s.</p>
<h2>Tricks old and new</h2>
<p>Malicious code that exploits the vulnerability dates back to at least January 2023 and was circulating as recently as May this year, according to the researchers who discovered the vulnerability and reported it to Microsoft. The company <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-38112">fixed</a> the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-CVE-38112, on Tuesday as part of its monthly patch release program. The vulnerability, which resided in the MSHTML engine of Windows, carried a severity rating of 7.0 out of 10.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036304#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036304&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Spanish youth court has <a href="https://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Noticias-Judiciales/Imponen-la-medida-de-libertad-vigilada-durante-un-ano-a-los-15-menores-acusados-de-manipular-y-difundir-imagenes-de-menores-desnudas-en-Badajoz">sentenced</a> 15 minors to one year of probation after spreading AI-generated nude images of female classmates in two WhatsApp groups.</p>
<p>The minors were charged with 20 counts of creating child sex abuse images and 20 counts of offenses against their victims’ moral integrity. In addition to probation, the teens will also be required to attend classes on gender and equality, as well as on the "responsible use of information and communication technologies," a press release from the Juvenile Court of Badajoz said.</p>
<p>Many of the victims were too ashamed to speak up when the inappropriate fake images began spreading last year. Prior to the sentencing, a mother of one of the victims <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/09/spain-sentences-15-school-children-over-ai-generated-naked-images">told The Guardian</a> that girls like her daughter "were completely terrified and had tremendous anxiety attacks because they were suffering this in silence."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036279#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036279&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Republican lawmakers are fighting a Biden administration attempt to bring cheap broadband service to low-income people, claiming it is an illegal form of rate regulation. GOP leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/e-and-c-leaders-open-investigation-into-ntia-s-iija-bead-funding-deployment-citing-abnormal-lack-of-transparency-and-allegations-of-rate-regulation">announced an investigation</a> into the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which is administering the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/us-allocates-42b-in-broadband-funding-find-out-how-much-your-state-will-get/">$42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program</a> that was approved by Congress in November 2021.</p>
<p>"States have reported that the NTIA is directing them to set rates and conditioning approval of initial proposals on doing so. This undoubtedly constitutes rate regulation by the NTIA," states a letter to the NTIA from Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), Subcommittee on Communications and Technology Chair Bob Latta (R-Ohio), and Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Morgan Griffith (R-Va.).</p>
<p>As evidence, the letter points to a <a href="https://dhcd.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/DocX/vati/ntiacuringround2changes-virginiabeadvolume2.pdf">statement by Virginia</a> that described feedback received from the NTIA. The federal agency told Virginia that "the low-cost option must be established in the Initial proposal as an exact price or formula."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036276#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036276&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The beta-testing cycle for Apple's latest operating system updates is in full swing—earlier this week, the third developer betas rolled out for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15 Sequoia, and the rest of this fall's updates. The fourth developer beta ought to be out in a couple of weeks, and it's reasonably likely to coincide with the first betas that Apple offers to the full public (though the less-stable developer-only betas got significantly more public last year when Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/how-to-install-ios-17-and-macos-14-developer-betas-now-that-anyone-can-do-it/">stopped making people pay for a developer account to access them</a>).</p>
<p>Many of the new updates' features are present and available to test, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/my-favorite-macos-sequoia-feature-so-far-might-be-the-old-timey-mac-wallpaper/">cosmetic updates</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-quietly-improves-mac-virtualization-in-macos-15-sequoia/">under-the-hood improvements</a>. But none of Apple's much-hyped Apple Intelligence features are available to test in any form. MacRumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/ios-18-beta-3-simulator-apple-intelligence/">reports</a> that Settings menus for the Apple Intelligence features have appeared in the Xcode Simulator for current versions of iOS 18 but, as of now, those settings still appear to be non-functional placeholders that don't actually do anything.</p>

<p>That may change soon; Apple did say that the first wave of Apple Intelligence features would be available "this summer," and I would wager a small amount of money on the first ones being available in the public beta builds later this month.

<p>There is a curious section in the new congressional reauthorization bill for NASA that concerns the agency's large Space Launch System rocket.</p>
<p>The section is titled "Reaffirmation of the Space Launch System," and in it Congress asserts its commitment to a flight rate of twice per year for the rocket. The reauthorization legislation, which cleared a House committee on Wednesday, also said NASA should identify other customers for the rocket.</p>
<p>"The Administrator shall assess the demand for the Space Launch System by entities other than NASA and shall break out such demand according to the relevant Federal agency or nongovernment sector," the legislation states.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036101#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036101&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Supermassive black holes appear to reside at the center of every galaxy and to have done so since galaxies formed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/half-of-the-mass-of-an-early-galaxy-is-in-its-central-black-hole/2/">early in the history of the Universe</a>. Currently, however, we can't entirely explain their existence, since it's difficult to understand how they could grow quickly enough to reach the cutoff for supermassive as quickly as they did.</p>
<p>A possible bit of evidence was recently found by using about 20 years of data from the Hubble Space Telescope. The data comes from a globular cluster of stars that's thought to be the remains of a dwarf galaxy and shows that a group of stars near the cluster's core are moving so fast that they should have been ejected from it entirely. That implies that something massive is keeping them there, which the researchers argue is a rare intermediate-mass black hole, weighing in at over 8,000 times the mass of the Sun.</p>
<h2>Moving fast</h2>
<p>The fast-moving stars reside in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Centauri">Omega Centauri</a>, the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way. With an estimated 10 million stars, it's a crowded environment, but observations are aided by its relative proximity, at "only" 17,000 light-years away. Those observations have been hinting that there might be a central black hole within the globular cluster, but the evidence has not been decisive.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036246#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036246&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AMD is to buy Finnish artificial intelligence startup Silo AI for $665 million in one of the largest such takeovers in Europe as the US chipmaker seeks to expand its AI services to compete with market leader Nvidia.</p>
<p>California-based AMD said Silo’s 300-member team would use its software tools to build custom large language models (LLMs), the kind of AI technology that underpins chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. The all-cash acquisition is expected to close in the second half of this year, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>“This agreement helps us both accelerate our customer engagements and deployments while also helping us accelerate our own AI tech stack,” Vamsi Boppana, senior vice president of AMD’s artificial intelligence group, told the Financial Times.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036193#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036193&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Both BMW and Stellantis are recalling hundreds of thousands of vehicles in the US this month due to airbag problems. For BMW, the problem, which potentially affects 394,029 cars, is a continuation of the Takata airbag recall, the largest automotive recall in history. Stellantis has slightly fewer potentially affected cars, with 322,000 subject to recall, but for a different problem caused by a suspect sensor in the seat belt buckle.</p>
<h2>BMW</h2>
<p>While <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V513-4713.PDF">the BMW recall</a> will be sent to almost 400,000 owners, the company suspects only 1 percent of that population will have a problem that needs remedying. That's because it wants dealers to check any cars where the owner has replaced the factory-fitted steering wheel with a Sport or M-Sport version equipped with a PSDI-5 inflator.</p>
<p>These inflators lack a desiccant or drying agent that would otherwise prevent the ammonium nitrate airbag propellant from taking on moisture, degrading the airbag's performance to the point where it could overinflate and shower the interior with metal fragments. At least 24 people have been killed by defective Takata airbags in the US, which led to 42 million cars being recalled to fix the problem.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036201#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036201&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A federal judge yesterday granted Elon Musk's motion to dismiss a class-action complaint alleging that laid-off Twitter employees were wrongfully denied the severance they were entitled to under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).</p>
<p>The employees may be able to latch onto another lawsuit against Twitter that alleges different severance-related violations, but their claim under ERISA was denied by US District Judge Trina Thompson in the Northern District of California.</p>
<p>"Plaintiffs are not without recourse," Thompson wrote, noting that they may benefit from similar cases ongoing against the Musk-owned firm. "Indeed, there are other cases brought against Twitter for the failure to pay wages or provide employee severance benefits during the same or overlapping period that Plaintiffs allege Defendants denied them and the putative class sufficient severance benefits under the severance plan at issue here."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036189#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036189&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years now, Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass has set itself apart by offering subscribers launch-day access to new first-party titles in addition to a large legacy library of older games. That important "day one" perk is now set to go away for all but the highest tier of Game Pass' console subscribers, even as Microsoft asks for more money for Game Pass across the board.</p>
<p>Let's start with the price increases for existing Game Pass tiers, which are relatively straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Game Pass Ultimate" is going from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</li>
<li>"Game Pass for PC" is going from $9.99 to $11.99 per month.</li>
<li>"Game Pass Core" (previously known as Xbox Live Gold) is going from $59.99 to $74.99 for annual subscriptions (and remains at $9.99 for monthly subscriptions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Things get a bit more complicated for the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/xbox-game-pass-for-console/CFQ7TTC0K6L8"> $10.99/month "Xbox Game Pass for Console"</a> tier. Microsoft announced that it will no longer accept new subscriptions for that tier after today, though current subscribers will be able to keep it (for now) if they auto-renew their subscriptions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036150#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036150&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has withdrawn from its non-voting observer role on OpenAI's board, while Apple has opted not to take a similar position, reports <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/10/microsoft-openai-board-seat-observer">Axios</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ecfa69df-5d1c-4177-9b14-a3a73072db12">Financial Times</a>. The ChatGPT maker plans to update its business partners and investors through regular meetings instead of board representation. The development comes as regulators in the EU and US increase their scrutiny of Big Tech's investments in AI startups due to concerns about stifling competition.</p>

<p>Axios reports that on Tuesday, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, Keith Dolliver, sent a letter to OpenAI stating that the tech giant's board role was "no longer necessary" given the "significant progress" made by the newly formed board. Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/sam-altman-officially-back-as-openai-ceo-we-didnt-lose-a-single-employee/">accepted a non-voting position on OpenAI's board</a> in November following the ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</p>
<p>Last week, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/apple-to-get-openai-board-observer-role-as-part-of-ai-agreement?srnd=undefined">reported</a> that Apple's Phil Schiller, who leads the App Store and Apple Events, might join OpenAI's board in an observer role as part of an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/apple-and-openai-currently-have-the-most-misunderstood-partnership-in-tech/">AI deal</a>. However, the Financial Times now reports that Apple will not take up such a position, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036094#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036094&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Samsung, much like every large tech company on this planet, led its Galaxy Unpacked event with a focus on its own AI offering, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/galaxy-ai/">Galaxy AI</a>. There were folding phones, sure, but "Life Opens Up with Galaxy AI" was the first pitch of the event. The "Next Frontier of Mobile AI" is here, Samsung claimed, with "cross-device intelligence." But, in a familiar tone, the company said its AI will be personalized for users, good for humanity, and empowering for creators.</p>

<p>A long, messy affair between US regulators and a Ukrainian businessman named Max Polyakov seems to have finally been resolved.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Polyakov's venture capital firm Noosphere Venture Partners announced that the US government has released him and his related companies from all conditions imposed upon them in the run-up to the Russian invasion of <span class="xn-location">Ukraine</span>.</p>
<p>This decision comes more than two years after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the US Air Force forced Polyakov to sell his majority stake in the Texas-based launch company Firefly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035991#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035991&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the space of 24 hours, a piece of Russian disinformation about Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s wife buying a Bugatti car with American aid money traveled at warp speed across the internet. Though it originated from an unknown French website, it quickly became a trending topic on X and the top result on Google.</p>
<p>On Monday, July 1, a news story was published on a website called Vérité Cachée. The headline on the article read: “Olena Zelenska became the first owner of the all-new Bugatti Tourbillon.” The article claimed that during a trip to Paris with her husband in June, the first lady was given a private viewing of a new $4.8 million supercar from Bugatti and immediately placed an order. It also included a video of a man that claimed to work at the dealership.</p>
<p>But the video, like the website itself, was completely fake. </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035995#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035995&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The inspiration for the titular device in last year's blockbuster, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny"><em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em></a>, was an actual archaeological artifact: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a>, a 2,200-year-old bronze mechanical computer. It doesn't have any mystical time-traveling powers, but the device <em>has</em> been the subject of fierce scientific scrutiny for many decades and is believed to have been used to predict eclipses and calculate the positions of the planets.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bhi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07-HJJuly24-AOTM-2.pdf">new paper</a> published in The Horological Journal found evidence, based on statistical techniques drawn from physics, particularly the study of gravitational waves, that the mechanism's calendar ring was designed to track the lunar calendar. This contradicts a century-long assumption among scholars of the mechanism that the calendar ring had 365 holes, thus tracking with a solar calendar, but is in keeping with the conclusions of a 2020 analysis.</p>
<p>“It’s a neat symmetry that we’ve adapted techniques we use to study the universe today to understand more about a mechanism that helped people keep track of the heavens nearly two millennia ago,"<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_1086643_en.html"> said co-author Graham Woan</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of Glasgow. “We hope that our findings about the Antikythera mechanism, although less supernaturally spectacular than those made by Indiana Jones, will help deepen our understanding of how this remarkable device was made and used by the Greeks.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035434#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035434&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Advances in artificial intelligence are making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between uniquely human behaviors and those that can be replicated by machines. Should artificial general intelligence (AGI) arrive in full force—artificial intelligence that surpasses human intelligence—the boundary between human and computer capabilities will diminish entirely.</p>
<p>In recent months, a significant swath of journalistic bandwidth has been devoted to this potentially dystopian topic. If AGI machines develop the ability to consciously experience life, the moral and legal considerations we’ll need to give them will rapidly become unwieldy. They will have feelings to consider, thoughts to share, intrinsic desires, and perhaps fundamental rights as newly minted beings. On the other hand, if AI does<i> not</i> develop consciousness—and instead simply the capacity to out-think us in every conceivable situation—we might find ourselves subservient to a vastly superior yet sociopathic entity.</p>
<p>Neither potential future feels all that cozy, and both require an answer to exceptionally mind-bending questions: What exactly is consciousness? And will it remain a biological trait, or could it ultimately be shared by the AGI devices we’ve created?</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032516#p3">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032516&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
