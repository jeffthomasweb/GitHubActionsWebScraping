                            <![CDATA[<p>Biotechnology company Regeneron will acquire 23andMe out of bankruptcy for $256 million, with a plan to keep the DNA-testing company running without interruption and uphold its privacy protection promises.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/regeneron-enters-asset-purchase-agreement-acquire-23andmer-256">its announcement of the acquisition</a>, Regeneron assured 23andMe's 15 million customers that their data—including genetic and health information, genealogy, and other sensitive personal information—would be safe and in good hands. Regeneron aims to use the large trove of genetic data to further its own work using genetics to develop medical advances—something 23andMe tried and failed to do.</p>
<p>"As a world leader in human genetics, Regeneron Genetics Center is committed to and has a proven track record of safeguarding the genetic data of people across the globe, and, with their consent, using this data to pursue discoveries that benefit science and society," Aris Baras, senior vice president and head of the Regeneron Genetics Center, said in a statement. "We assure 23andMe customers that we are committed to protecting the 23andMe dataset with our high standards of data privacy, security, and ethical oversight and will advance its full potential to improve human health."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/biotech-company-regeneron-to-buy-bankrupt-23andme-for-256m/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>That's no longer the case. NASA is finding success in its partnerships with commercial space companies, especially SpaceX, with lower costs, quicker results, and improved performance.</p>
<p>The Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government's spy satellite agency, are also capitalizing on new products and services from commercial industry. In many cases, these new capabilities come from venture-backed startups already developing and operating satellites for commercial use.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/space-force-official-commercial-satellites-can-do-a-lot-more-than-we-thought/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Llama Productions is the official signatory to SAG-AFTRA's collective bargaining agreement for <em>Fortnite</em>, making it legally responsible for adhering to the union's terms regarding the employment of voice actors and other performers.</p>
<p>"We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies," SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-fortnites-use-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-ulp-filing">stated</a> in a news release. "However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-spawns-unfair-labor-practice-charge-from-voice-union/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last year, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-offers-its-ai-watermarking-tech-as-free-open-source-toolkit/">open-sourced its SynthID AI watermarking system</a>, allowing other developers access to a toolkit for imperceptibly marking content as AI-generated. Now, Google is rolling out a web-based portal to let people easily test if a piece of media has been watermarked with SynthID.</p>
<p>After uploading a piece of media to the SynthID Detector, users will get back results that "highlight which parts of the content are more likely to have been watermarked," Google said. That watermarked, AI-generated content should remain detectable by the portal "even when the content is shared or undergoes a range of transformations," the company said.</p>
<p>The detector will be available to beta testers starting today, and Google says journalists, media professionals, and researchers can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17AiEqHpgnp7GwsIfQNFLCB-5nSr7YxnLI_4jmm7kBGU/viewform?edit_requested=true">apply for a waitlist</a> to get access themselves. To start, users will be able to upload images and audio to the portal for verification, but Google says video and text detection will be added in the coming weeks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/google-launches-online-portal-to-detect-watermarked-ai-content/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">After dragging its feet for years, America is finally taking its first big step toward shielding victims of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)—also known as revenge porn—from constantly being retraumatized online.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday afternoon, Donald Trump is scheduled to sign the <a href="ttps://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/146/text">Take It Down Act</a> into law. That means that within one year, every online platform will be required to remove both actual NCII and fake nudes generated by artificial intelligence within 48 hours of victims' reports or face steep penalties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters have touted the 48-hour timeline as remarkably fast, empowering victims to promptly stop revenge porn from spreading widely online. The law's passing comes at a time when AI-generated revenge porn is increasingly harming a wider pool of victims—including some who may have never shared a compromising photo, like dozens of kids in middle and high schools nationwide. Acknowledging the substantial harm to kids already, the law includes steeper penalties for NCII targeting minor victims, a threat lawmakers hope will help minors get harmful images removed "as soon as possible."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/trump-to-sign-law-forcing-platforms-to-remove-revenge-porn-in-48-hours/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's Windows Subsystem for Linux has become an important tool for developers and power users since it was introduced in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update back in 2016, giving them access to a built-in Linux command line and Linux applications from within Windows.</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/the-best-part-of-windows-11-is-a-revamped-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">steadily improved WSL since then</a>, improving performance, making it easier to install and use, and adding features like GPU and audio support. But today as part of its Build developer conference, Microsoft announced that it would be <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/05/19/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-is-now-open-source/">making almost all of WSL open source</a>, closing <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1">the very first issue</a> that the then-new WSL project attracted on Github in 2016.</p>
<p>"WSL could never have been what it is today without its community," writes Microsoft Senior Software Engineer Pierre Boulay in the company's blog post. "We’ve seen how much the community has contributed to WSL without access to the source code, and we can’t wait to see how WSL will evolve now that the community can make direct code contributions to the project."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsoft-takes-windows-subsystem-for-linux-open-source-after-nearly-a-decade/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's shaping up to be a big year for telecom mergers, and it appears the Federal Communications Commission is eager to approve the deals—as long as companies involved drop any DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies criticized by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. Verizon just got a big merger approved, and cable giant Charter is seeking permission to buy Cox.</p>
<p>The FCC on Friday announced approval of Verizon's purchase of Frontier, one day after Verizon committed to end DEI policies in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/105150776713979/1">filing</a> with the commission. Carr previously sent letters to Verizon and other companies alleging that their diversity policies are "invidious forms of discrimination" that violate federal law and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/fcc-s-carr-threatens-to-block-m-a-for-companies-with-dei-plans">threatened</a> to block mergers pursued by firms that enforce such policies.</p>
<p>"Verizon has now agreed to end its DEI policies as specified in a new FCC filing," Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1923355671036035101">wrote in a post on X</a>. "These changes are effective immediately. A good step forward for equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, and the public interest."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/fcc-chair-brendan-carr-is-letting-isps-merge-as-long-as-they-end-dei-programs/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1's busy 2025 schedule saw the sport return to its European heartland this past weekend. Italy has two races on the calendar this year, and this was the first, the (deep breath) "Formula 1 AWS Gran Premio Del Made in Italy e Dell'Emilia-Romagna," which took place at the scenic and historic (another deep breath) Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, better known as Imola. It's another of F1's old-school circuits where overtaking is far from easy, particularly when the grid is as closely matched as it is. But Sunday's race was no snoozer, and for a couple of teams, there was a welcome change in form.</p>
<p>Red Bull was one. The team has looked a bit shambolic at times this season, with some wondering whether this change in form was the result of <a href="https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/the-key-staff-who-quit-red-bull-f1-strategy-chief-is-latest-departure/">a number of high-profile staff departures</a> toward the end of last season. Things looked pretty bleak during the first of three qualifying sessions, when Yuki Tsunoda got too aggressive with a curb and, rather than finding lap time, found himself in a violent crash that tore all four corners off the car and relegated him to starting the race last from the pit lane.</p>
<p>2025 has also been trying for Ferrari. Italy expects a lot from the red team, and the replacement of Mattia Binotto with Frédéric Vasseur as team principal was supposed to result in Maranello challenging for championships. Signing Lewis Hamilton, a bona fide superstar with seven titles already on his CV, hasn't exactly reduced the amount of pressure on Scuderia Ferrari, either.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/f1-in-imola-reminds-us-its-about-strategy-as-much-as-a-fast-car/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In the mood for a jauntily charming sci-fi comedy dripping with wry wit and an intriguing mystery? Check out Apple TV+'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderbot_(TV_series)"><em>Murderbot</em></a>, based on Martha Wells' bestselling series of novels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries"><em>The Murderbot Diaries</em></a>. It stars Alexander Skarsgård as the titular Murderbot, a rogue cyborg security (SEC) unit that gains autonomy and must learn to interact with humans while hiding its new capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>(Some minor spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>There are seven books in Wells' series thus far. All are narrated by Murderbot, who is technically owned by a megacorporation but manages to hack and override its governor module. Rather than rising up and killing its former masters, Murderbot just goes about performing its security work, relieving the boredom by watching a lot of entertainment media; its favorite is a soap opera called <em>The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/the-making-of-apple-tvs-murderbot/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There's a lot of matter around, which ensures that any antimatter <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">produced experiences a very short lifespan. Studying antimatter, therefore, has been extremely difficult. But that's changed a bit in recent years, as CERN has set up a facility that produces and traps antimatter, allowing for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/antimatter-falls-downward-not-upward-just-like-regular-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensive studies</a> of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/06/antimatter-atom-held-trapped-for-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">properties</a>, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/11/researchers-trap-antihydrogen-atoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire anti-atoms</a></span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hardware used to capture antiprotons also produces interference that limits the precision with which measurements can be made. So CERN decided that it might be good to determine how to move the antimatter away from where it's produced. Since it was tackling that problem anyway, CERN decided to make a shipping container for antimatter, allowing it to be put on a truck and potentially taken to labs throughout Europe.</p>
<h2>A shipping container for antimatter</h2>
<p>The problem facing CERN comes from its own hardware. The antimatter it captures is produced by smashing a particle beam into a stationary target. As a result, all the anti-particles that come out of the debris carry a lot of energy. If you want to hold on to any of them, you have to slow them down, which is done using electromagnetic fields that can act on the charged antimatter particles. Unfortunately, as the team behind the new work notes, many of the measurements we'd like to do with the antimatter are "extremely sensitive to external magnetic field noise."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/cern-gears-up-to-ship-antimatter-across-europe/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Thanks to our new global tariff war, the wild world of importing and exporting has been thrust into the forefront. There's a lot of logistics involved in keeping your local Walmart stocked and your Amazon Prime deliveries happening, and you might be surprised at how much of that world has already been automated.</p>
<p>While cars from autonomy providers like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/after-50-million-miles-waymos-crash-a-lot-less-than-human-drivers/">Waymo</a> are still extremely rare in most stretches of the open road, the process of loading and unloading cargo has become almost entirely automated at some major ports around the world. Likewise, there's an increasing shift to electrify the various vehicles involved along the way, eliminating a significant source of global emissions.</p>
<p>But there's been one sticking point in this automated, electrified logistical dream: plugging in. The humble act of charging still happens via human hands, but that's changing. At a testing facility in Sweden, a company called Rocsys has demonstrated an automated charger that works with self-driving electric trucks from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/are-autonomous-trucks-going-to-save-the-industry-or-destroy-it/">Einride</a> in a hands-free and emissions-free partnership that could save time, money, and even lives.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/removing-the-weakest-link-in-electrified-autonomous-transport-humans/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There aren't any games quite like the Anno series, and based on some hands-on time at a recent press junket, I can say that the latest entry has the potential to be an appealing on-ramp for history buffs and strategy game fans who haven't explored the franchise before—provided players approach it with a lot of patience.</p>
<p>The previous entry in the series, 2019's <em>Anno 1800</em>, was seen as something of a return to form by longtime franchise fans, who weren't as thrilled with the futuristic entries that preceded it. It reportedly reached 5 million players, which is quite a lot for a PC-focused strategy title, so <em>1800</em> was a popularization moment for the franchise, too.</p>
<p><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em>, due later this year, aims to build on that momentum and turn the franchise into a crossover hit. While the Anno games have long been popular with a certain crowd (strategy gamers in Europe, and specifically Germany, where the games are developed), its addictive gameplay and top-tier presentation have the potential to appeal with even more people, provided publisher Ubisoft makes the right choices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/anno-117-pax-romana-hands-on-deep-city-building-in-a-gorgeous-ancient-rome/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>New Orleans police have reportedly spent years scanning live feeds of city streets and secretly using facial recognition to identify suspects in real time—in seeming defiance of a city ordinance designed to prevent false arrests and protect citizens' civil rights.</p>
<p>A Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/19/live-facial-recognition-police-new-orleans/">investigation</a> uncovered the dodgy practice, which relied on a private network of more than 200 cameras to automatically ping cops' phones when a possible match for a suspect was detected. Court records and public data suggest that these cameras "played a role in dozens of arrests," the Post found, but most uses were never disclosed in police reports.</p>
<p>That seems like a problem, the Post reported, since a 2022 city council ordinance required much more oversight for the tech. Rather than instantly detaining supposed suspects the second they pop up on live feeds, cops were only supposed to use the tech to find "specific suspects in their investigations of violent crimes," the Post reported. And in those limited cases, the cops were supposed to send images to a "fusion center," where at least two examiners "trained in identifying faces" using AI software had to agree on alleged matches before cops approached suspects.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/cops-pause-use-of-flawed-ai-cameras-secretly-monitoring-streets-for-suspects/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-after-court-slams-apples-obvious-cover-up/">last month's bombshell legal ruling</a> forcing Apple to allow the use of external payment processors for in-app purchases on iOS, Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said Epic Games was "going to do everything we can to bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the iOS App Store." That "everything" now includes <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-16-25-epic-games-filing-16f7f43cb85d.pdf">a legal motion</a> in the District Court of California seeking to force Apple to "accept any compliant version of <em>Fortnite</em> onto the US storefront of the App Store."</p>
<p>Apple removed <em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store and terminated Epic's US App Store account in August 2020 after Epic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/epic-gives-fortnite-players-discounts-for-skirting-apple-google-fees/">snuck its famous Epic Direct Payments "hotfix" into the game</a> (thereby setting off <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/epic-vs-apple-google/">a yearslong legal battle</a>). On May 9, though, Epic used an iOS account for its Swedish subsidiary—which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/apple-backtracks-reinstates-epic-games-ios-developer-account-in-europe/">was recently used to take advantage of Europe's DMA policies</a>—to submit a new version of <em>Fortnite</em> to the US App Store.</p>
<p>Apple formally rejected that submission on May 15, saying in <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-15-25-letter-from-apple-14bad27bb985.pdf">a letter shared by Epic</a> that it believes the recent court rulings "do not diminish Apple’s bases and legal right to have terminated Epic Games’ [iOS developer account]." Even under that new ruling, Apple notes, the 2020 "hotfix" allowing Epic Direct Payments <em>inside the app </em>rather than via an external storefront would still violate Apple's current lawful restrictions on such practices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/epic-goes-to-court-to-force-fortnite-back-on-us-ios/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In 2013, a deep-sea mining company named UK Seabed Resources contracted marine biologist Diva Amon and other scientists from the University of Hawaii at Manoa to survey a section of the seafloor in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast swath of international waters located in the Pacific Ocean that spans around 2 million square miles between Hawaii and Mexico.</p>
<p>The area is known to have an abundant supply of rocky deposits the size of potatoes called polymetallic nodules. They are rich in metals like nickel, cobalt, copper, and manganese, which have historically been used to make batteries and electric vehicles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/experts-alarmed-over-trumps-promotion-of-deep-sea-mining-in-international-waters/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here after they air</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Going from a sudden shot of beatific Pedro Pascal at the end of the last episode to a semi-related flashback with a young Joel Miller and his brother was certainly a choice. I almost respect how overtly they are just screwing with audience expectations here.</p>
<p>As for the opening flashback scene itself, I guess the message is "Hey, look at the generational trauma his family was dealing with—isn't it great he overcame that to love Ellie?" But I'm not sure I can draw a straight line from "he got beat by his dad" to "he condemned the entire human race for his surrogate daughter."</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I do not have the same problems you did with either the Joel pop-in at the end of the last episode or the flashback at the start of this episode—last week, the show was signaling "here comes Joel!" and this week the show is signaling "look, it's Joel!" Maybe I'm just responding to Tony Dalton as Joel's dad, who I know best as the charismatic lunatic Lalo Salamanca from <em>Better Call Saul</em>. I do agree that the throughline between these two events is shaky, though, and without the flashback to fill us in, the "I hope you can do a little better than me" sentiment feels like something way out of left field.</p>
<p>But I dunno, it's Joel week. Joel's back! This is the Duality of Joel: you can simultaneously think that he is horrible for failing a civilization-scale trolley problem when he killed a building full of Fireflies to save Ellie, and you can't help but be utterly charmed by Pedro Pascal enthusiastically describing the many ways to use a Dremel. (He's right! It's a versatile tool!)</p>
<p>Truly, there's pretty much nothing in this episode that we couldn't have inferred or guessed at based on the information the show has already made available to us. And I say this as a non-game-player—I didn't need to see exactly <em>how</em> their relationship became as strained as it was by the beginning of the season to have some idea of why it happened, nor did I need to see The Porch Scene to understand that their bond nevertheless endured. But this is also <em>the dynamic that everybody came to the show for</em> last season, so I can only make myself complain about it to a point.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: It's true, Joel Week is a time worth celebrating. If I'm coming across as cranky about it at the outset, it's probably because this whole episode is a realization of what we're missing out on this season thanks to Joel's death.</p>
<p>As you said, a lot of this episode was filling in gaps that could well have been inferred from events we did see. But I would have easily taken a full season (or a full second game) of Ellie growing up and Joel dealing with Ellie growing up. You could throw in some zombie attacks or an overarching Big Bad enemy or something if you want, but the development of Joel and Ellie's relationship deserves more than just some condensed flashbacks.</p>

<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, it's hard not to be upset about the original sin of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> which is (assuming it's like the show) that having some boring underbaked villain crawl out of the woodwork to kill the show's main character is kind of a cheap shot. Sure, you shock the hell out of viewers like me who didn't see it coming! But part of the reason I didn't see it coming is because if you kill Joel, you need to do a whole bunch of your show <em>without Joel</em> and why on Earth would you decide to do that?</p>
<p>To be clear, I don't mind this season so much, and I've found things to like about it, though Ellie does sometimes veer into being a protagonist so short-sighted and impulsive and occasionally just-plain-stupid that it's hard to be in her corner. But yeah, flashing back to a time just two months after the end of season 1 really does make you wonder, "Why couldn't the story just be this?"</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: In the gaming space, I understand the desire to not have your sequel game be just "more of the same" from the last game. But I've always felt <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> veered too hard in the other direction and became something almost entirely unrecognizable from the original game I loved.</p>
<p>But let's focus on what we do get in this episode, which is an able recreation of my favorite moment from the second game, Ellie enjoying the heck out of a ruined science museum. The childlike wonder she shows here is a great respite from a lot of action-heavy scenes in the game, and I think it serves the same purpose here. It's also much more drawn out in the game—I could have luxuriated in just this part of the flashback for an entire episode!</p>
</div>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: The <em>only</em> thing that kept me from being fully on board with that scene was that I think Ellie was acting quite a bit younger than 16, with her pantomimed launch noises and flipping of switches, But I could believe that a kid who had such a rough and abbreviated childhood would have some fun sitting in an Apollo module. For someone with no memories of the pre-outbreak society, it must seem like science fiction, and the show gives us some lovely visuals to go with it.</p>
<p>The things I like best here are the little moments in between scenes rather than the parts where the show insists on showing us events that it had already alluded to in other episodes. What sticks with me the most, as we jump between Ellie's birthdays, is Joel's insistence that "we could do this kind of thing more often" as they go to a museum or patrol the trails together. That it needs to be stated multiple times suggests that they are not, in fact, doing this kind of thing more often in between birthdays.</p>
<p>Joel is thoughtful and attentive in his way—a little better than his father—but it's such a bittersweet little note, a surrogate dad's clumsy effort to bridge a gap that he knows is there but doesn't fully understand.</p>

      Why can't it be like this forever?

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, I'm OK with a little arrested development in a girl that has been forced to miss so many of the markers of a "normal" pre-apocalypse childhood.</p>
<p>But yeah, Joel is pretty clumsy about this. And as we see all of these attempts with his surrogate daughter, it's easy to forget what happened to his real daughter way back at the beginning of the first season. The trauma of that event shapes Joel in a way that I feel the narrative sometimes forgets about for long stretches.</p>
<p>But then we get moments like Joel leading Gail's newly infected husband to a death that the poor guy would very much like to delay by an hour for one final moment with his wife. When Joel says that you can always close your eyes and see the face of the one you love, he may have been thinking about Ellie. But I like to think he was thinking about his actual daughter.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yes to the extent that Joel's actions are relatable (I won't say "excusable," but "relatable") it's because the undercurrent of his relationship with Ellie is that he can't watch another daughter die in his arms. I watched the first episode again recently, and that whole scene remains a masterfully executed gut-punch.</p>
<p>But it's a tough tightrope to walk, because if the story spends <em>too</em> much time focusing on it, you draw attention to how unhealthy it is for Joel to be forcing Ellie to play that role in his life. Don't get me wrong, Ellie was looking for a father figure, too, and that's why it works! It's a "found family" dynamic that they were both looking for. But I can't hear Joel's soothing "baby girl" epithet without it rubbing me the wrong way a little.</p>
<p>My gut reaction was that it was <em>right</em> for Joel not to fully trust Gail's husband, but then I realized I can never <em>not</em> suspect Joe Pantoliano of treachery because of his role as betrayer in the 26-year-old movie <em>The Matrix</em>. Brains are weird.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I did like the way Ellie tells Joel off for lying to her (and to Gail) about the killing; it's a real "growing up" moment for the character. And of course it transitions well into The Porch Scene, Ellie's ultimate moment of confronting Joel on his ultimate betrayal.</p>
<p>While I'm not a fan of the head-fake "this scene isn't going to happen" thing they did earlier this season. I think the TV show once again did justice to one of the most impactful parts of the game. But the game also managed to spread out these Joel-centric flashbacks a little more, so we're not transitioning from "museum fun" to "porch confrontation" quite so quickly. Here, it feels like they're trying hard to rush through all of their "bring back Pedro Pascal" requirements in a single episode.</p>

      When you've only got one hour left, how you spend it becomes pretty important.

<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, because you don't need to pay a 3D model's appearance fees if you want to use it in a bunch of scenes of your video game. Pedro Pascal has other stuff going on!</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: That's probably part of it. But without giving too much away, I think we're seeing the limits of stretching the events of "Part 2" into what is essentially two seasons. While there have been some cuts, on the whole, it feels like there's also been a lot of filler to "round out" these characters in ways that have been more harmful than helpful at points.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, our episode ends by depositing us back in the main action, as Ellie returns to the abandoned theater where she and Dina have holed up. I'm curious to see what we're in for in this last run of almost-certainly-Joel-less episodes, but I suspect it involves a bunch of non-Joel characters ping-ponging between the WLF forces and the local cultists. There will probably be some villain monologuing, probably some zombie hordes, probably another named character death or two. Pretty standard issue.</p>
<p>What I <em>don't</em> expect is for anyone to lovingly and accurately describe the process of refurbishing a guitar. And that's the other issue with putting this episode where it is—just as you're getting used to a show without Joel, you're reminded that he's missing all over again.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Mission patches are a decades-old tradition in spaceflight. They can range from the figurative to the abstract, prompting valuable insights or feeding confusion. Some are just plain weird.</p>
<p>Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/after-60-years-of-spaceflight-patches-here-are-some-of-our-favorites/">published a story</a> a few months ago on spaceflight patches from NASA, SpaceX, Russia, and the NRO, the US government's spy satellite agency, which is responsible for some of the most head-scratching mission logos.</p>
<p>Until recently, China's entries in the realm of spaceflight patches often lacked the originality found in patches from the West. For example, a <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/001665.html">series of patches</a> for China's human spaceflight missions used a <a href="http://spacefacts.de/mission/english/shenzhou_13.htm">formulaic design</a> with a <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/001749.html">circular shape</a> and a mix of <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/001780.html">red and blue</a>. The patch for China's most recent Shenzhou crew to the country's Tiangong space station last month finally broke the mold with a <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/001939.html">triangular shape</a> after China's human spaceflight agency put the patch up for a public vote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/do-these-buddhist-gods-hint-at-the-purpose-of-chinas-super-secret-satellites/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, the US health department announced a plan to <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fda-to-remove-ingestible-fluoride-drug-products-for-children.html">ban prescription fluoride supplements for children</a>. These ingested fluoride products are dispensed at safe doses by doctors and dentists to prevent tooth decay in children who are unable to get adequate fluoride doses from community water systems—something that may become more common as more states and cities remove or ban fluoride from their water.</p>
<p>Both the American Dental Association (ADA) and <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/FAQ-Fluoride-and-Children.aspx">the American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommend fluoridating community water and <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Fluoride-Supplements.aspx">advise prescribing fluoride supplements for children</a> who do not get adequate fluoride dosages through their water.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under anti-vaccine advocate and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr states without clear evidence that fluoride supplements harm children's microbiome and pose other health risks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/rfk-jr-wants-to-ban-fluoride-supplements-based-on-nonsense/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Spotify rushed to remove hundreds of obviously fake podcasts found to be marketing prescription drugs in violation of Spotify's policies and, likely, federal law.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Business Insider (BI) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-takes-down-podcasts-peddling-drugs-opioids-2025-5">reported</a> that Spotify removed 200 podcasts advertising the sale of opioids and other drugs, but that wasn't the end of the scandal. Today, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/tech/spotify-removing-drug-sales-podcasts">revealed</a> that it easily uncovered dozens more fake podcasts peddling drugs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the podcasts may have raised a red flag for a human moderator—with titles like "My Adderall Store" or "Xtrapharma.com" and episodes titled "Order Codeine Online Safe Pharmacy Louisiana" or "Order Xanax 2 mg Online Big Deal On Christmas Season," CNN reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/spotify-plays-whack-a-mole-with-fake-podcasts-selling-drugs-scamming-users/">Read full article</a></p>
