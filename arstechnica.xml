<p>The US Treasury Department has sanctioned three Chinese nationals for their involvement in a VPN-powered botnet with more than 19 million residential IP addresses they rented out to cybercriminals to obfuscate their illegal activities, including COVID-19 aid scams and bomb threats.</p>
<p>The criminal enterprise, the Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2375">said Tuesday</a>, was a residential proxy service known as 911 S5. Such services provide a bank of IP addresses belonging to everyday home users for customers to route Internet connections through. When accessing a website or other Internet service, the connection appears to originate with the home user.</p>
<p>In 2022, researchers at the University of Sherbrooke <a href="https://gric.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/rpaas/">profiled</a> 911[.]re, a service that appears to be an earlier version of 911 S5. At the time, its infrastructure comprised 120,000 residential IP addresses. This pool was created using one of two free VPNs—MaskVPN and DewVPN—marketed to end users. Besides acting as a legitimate VPN, the software also operated as a botnet that covertly turned users’ devices into a proxy server. The complex structure was designed with the intent of making the botnet hard to reverse engineer.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027288#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027288&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BARCELONA—The days of big engines are numbered, even for big spenders. Owning a GT that lets you drive across Europe in a day in cosseted luxury means very little if you're not allowed to drive it into the city you're meant to be visiting, after all. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/04/london-ultra-low-emission-zone-details/">Low emissions zones</a> are either a fact of life or on the way in many of the more desirable urban postcodes, and even here in the US, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/new-epa-doe-fuel-regs-give-automakers-longer-to-reduce-co2-emissions/">we're about to start getting quite tough</a> on fuel efficiency. Which is why Bentley is saying goodbye to its W12-powered Continental GT Speed and replacing it with a new plug-in hybrid instead.</p>
<p>The W12 engine has become something of a trademark for Bentley in the 21st century. For many years, Bentleys were essentially just badge-engineered Rolls-Royces, while both companies were owned by the aircraft maker Vickers. But VW group took control of Bentley in 1998—BMW got Rolls-Royce—and it was time for something fresh.</p>
<p>Originally developed within parent company Volkswagen Group for use in the all-aluminum Audi A8, the W12 design essentially mated a pair of narrow-angle V6 engines as used in the Golf VR6 to create a compact and powerful multi-cylinder engine for those customers looking for a powertrain a bit less common than a V8.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027175#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027175&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brain-computer interface company Precision Neuroscience says that it has set a new world record for the number of neuron-tapping electrodes placed on a living human's brain—4,096, surpassing the previous record of 2,048 set last year, according to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2024/05/28/2889069/0/en/Precision-Neuroscience-Announces-World-Record-for-Number-of-Electrodes-Placed-On-Human-Brain.html">an announcement from the company on Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>The high density of electrodes allows neuroscientists to map the activity of neurons at unprecedented resolution, which will ultimately help them to better decode thoughts into intended actions.</p>
<p>Precision, like many of its rivals, has the preliminary goal of using its brain-computer interface (BCI) to restore speech and movement in patients, particularly those who have suffered a stroke or spinal cord injury. But Precision stands out from its competitors due to a notable split from one of the most high-profile BCI companies, Neuralink, owned by controversial billionaire Elon Musk.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027276#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027276&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>They wanted to make money by selling cheating tools to <em>Destiny 2</em> players. They may have ended up setting US legal precedent.</p>
<p>After a trial in federal court in Seattle last week, a jury found cheat-seller AimJunkies, along with its parent company Phoenix Digital and four of its employees and contractors, liable for copyright infringement and assigned damages to each of them. The jury split $63,210 in damages, with $20,000 to Phoenix Digital itself and just under $11,000 each to the four individuals. That's just under the $65,000 revenue the defendants claimed to have generated from 1,400 copies of its <em>Destiny 2</em> cheats.</p>
<p>Bungie's case appears to have gone <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungie-aimjunkies-destiny-2-trial">further than any other game-cheating suit</a> has made it in the US court system. Because cheating at an online game is not, in itself, illegal, game firms typically lean on the anti-circumvention aspects of the 1998 Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA). That's how the makers of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/gta-online-cheat-tool-maker-ordered-to-pay-150000/"><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/blizzard-ups-the-ante-against-overwatch-cheats-by-filing-lawsuit/"><em>Overwatch</em></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/rainbow-six-cheat-maker-faces-ubisoft-lawsuit-after-bbc-appearance/"><em>Rainbow Six</em></a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/fortnite-gta-v-hackers-face-legal-action-for-online-cheating/"><em>Fortnite</em></a> have pursued their cheat-making antagonists. Bungie, in taking their claim past settlement and then winning a copyright claim from a jury, has perhaps provided game makers a case to point to in future proceedings, and perhaps more incentive.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027163#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027163&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Some of the most infamous so-called shadow libraries have increasingly faced legal pressure to either stop pirating books or risk being shut down or driven to the dark web. Among the biggest targets are Z-Library, which the US Department of Justice has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/z-library-returns-aims-to-avoid-seizures-by-giving-each-user-a-secret-url/">charged with criminal copyright infringement</a>, and Library Genesis (Libgen), which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/most-notorious-illegal-shadow-library-sued-by-textbook-publishers/">sued by textbook publishers last fall</a> for allegedly distributing digital copies of copyrighted works "on a massive scale in willful violation" of copyright laws.</p>
<p>But now these shadow libraries and others accused of spurning copyrights have seemingly found an unlikely defender in Nvidia, the AI chipmaker among those profiting most from the recent AI boom.</p>
<p>Nvidia seemed to defend the shadow libraries as a valid source of information online when responding to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/novelists-sue-nvidia-to-stop-spread-of-ai-models-trained-on-copyrighted-books/#:~:text=In%20a%20proposed%20class%20action,large%20language%20models%20(LLMs).">lawsuit from book authors</a> over the list of data repositories that were scraped to create the Books3 dataset used to train Nvidia's AI platform NeMo.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027205#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027205&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>IFixit and Samsung were once leading the charge in device repair, but <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/96162/were-ending-our-samsung-collaboration">iFixit says</a> it's ending its repair partnership with Samsung because it feels Samsung just isn't participating in good faith. iFixit says the two companies "have not been able to deliver" on the promise of a viable repair ecosystem, so it would rather shut the project down than continue. The repair site says "flashy press releases and ambitious initiatives don’t mean much without follow-through."</p>
<p>iFixit's Scott Head explains: "As we tried to build this ecosystem we consistently faced obstacles that made us doubt Samsung’s commitment to making repair more accessible. We couldn’t get parts to local repair shops at prices and quantities that made business sense. The part prices were so costly that many consumers opted to replace their devices rather than repair them. And the design of Samsung’s Galaxy devices remained frustratingly glued together, forcing us to sell batteries and screens in pre-glued bundles that increased the cost."</p>
  <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">
          <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screen.png" alt=""></div>
          <p>
            Samsung's screen replacement parts usually require buying the display, battery, phone frame, and buttons, which is a big waste.                           [credit:
                              iFixit                            ]
                      </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>A good example of Samsung's parts bundling is this <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-usa-screen-and-battery-genuine">Galaxy S22 Ultra "screen" part</a> for $233. The screen is the most common part to break, but rather than just sell a screen, Samsung makes you buy the screen, a new phone frame, a battery, and new side buttons and switches. As we said when this was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/samsung-and-ifixit-launch-repair-program-for-flagship-phones-and-tablets/">announced</a>, that's like half of the total parts in an entire phone. This isn't a perfect metric, but the Samsung/iFixit parts store only offers <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Samsung_Galaxy_S22_Ultra">three parts</a> for the S22 Ultra, while the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Google_Pixel_8_Pro">Pixel 8 Pro store</a> has 10 parts, and the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/iPhone_14_Pro_Max">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> store has 23 parts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027154#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027154&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dinosaurs were once assumed to have been ectothermic, or cold-blooded, an idea that makes sense given that they were reptiles. While scientists had previously discovered evidence of dinosaur species that were warm-blooded, though what could have triggered this adaptation remained unknown. A team of researchers now think that dinosaurs that already had some cold tolerance evolved endothermy, or warm-bloodedness, to adapt when they migrated to regions with cooler temperatures. They also think they’ve found a possible reason for the trek.</p>
<p>Using the Mesozoic fossil record, evolutionary trees, climate models, and geography, plus factoring in a drastic climate change event that caused global warming, the team found that theropods (predators and bird ancestors such as velociraptor and T. rex) and ornithischians (such as triceratops and stegosaurus) must have made their way to colder regions during the Early Jurassic. Lower temperatures are thought to have selected for species that were partly adapted to endothermy.</p>
<p>“The early invasion of cool niches… [suggests] an early attainment of homeothermic (possibly endothermic) physiology in [certain species], enabling them to colonize and persist in even extreme latitudes since the Early Jurassic,” the researchers said in a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)00525-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982224005256%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">study</a> recently published in Current Biology.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027153#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027153&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-board-forms-safety-and-security-committee/">announced</a> the formation of a new "Safety and Security Committee" to oversee risk management for its projects and operations. The announcement comes as the company says it has "recently begun" training its next frontier model, which it expects to bring the company closer to its goal of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), though some critics say AGI is farther off than we might think. It also comes as a reaction to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/openai-on-the-defensive-after-multiple-pr-setbacks-in-one-week/">terrible two weeks</a> in the press for the company.</p>

<p>Whether the aforementioned new frontier model is intended to be GPT-5 or a step beyond that is currently unknown. In the AI industry, "frontier model" is a term for a new AI system designed to push the boundaries of current capabilities. And "AGI" refers to a hypothetical AI system with human-level abilities to perform novel, general tasks beyond its training data (unlike narrow AI, which is trained for specific tasks).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new Safety and Security Committee, led by OpenAI directors Bret Taylor (chair), Adam D'Angelo, Nicole Seligman, and Sam Altman (CEO), will be responsible for making recommendations about AI safety to the full company board of directors. In this case, "safety" partially means the usual "we won't let the AI go rogue and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/">take over the world</a>," but it also includes a broader set of "processes and safeguards" that the company spelled out in a <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-safety-update/">May 21 safety update</a> related to alignment research, protecting children, upholding election integrity, assessing societal impacts, and implementing security measures.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027105#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027105&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

The most obvious visual indicator is the presence of vertical strakes in the front air intakes. But we're much more interested in what's gone on under the skin. (credit: Porsche)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Today, Porsche gave the venerable 911 a bit of a spiff-up, putting an updated engine in the base 911 Carrera and making some design tweaks to keep the 992-generation machine looking fresh. But the most interesting update is an all-new powertrain in the 911 Carrera GTS. For the first time, you can now buy a hybrid 911.</p>
<p>When Porsche has been asked about adding electrification to the 911, the answer has generally been some variation of "we'll do it when the technology gets light enough." <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/this-porsche-plug-in-suv-is-a-pricey-dayglo-antidepressant-on-wheels/">Plug-in hybrid Cayennes</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/the-new-2025-porsche-panamera-has-a-better-ride-sharper-handling/">Panameras</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/the-porsche-taycan-4s-better-than-a-911-believe-it/">battery electric Taycans</a> are all well and good because they are big cars.</p>
<p>But a Porsche 911 remains a relatively small car, even if it has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/08/porsche-911-52-years-of-staying-true-to-its-roots/">grown a little since 1963</a>. The engine bay behind the rear axle isn't exactly expansive, and adding a high-voltage battery and electric motors had to be done thoughtfully.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026995#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026995&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>European car manufacturers are currently tripping over themselves to figure out how personal transport and "last mile" solutions will look in the years to come. The solutions are always electric, and they're also tiny. What most companies (bar Citroen, Renault, and Fiat) seem to have forgotten is that we've had an answer to this problem all along: the microcar.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/microcar-madness-at-the-lane-motor-museum/">The microcar is a singular little thing</a>—its job is to frugally take one person (or maybe two people) where they need to go while taking up as little space as possible. A few have broken their way into the public consciousness—<em>Top Gear</em> made a global megastar of Peel's cars, BMW's Isetta remains a design icon, and the Messerschmitt KR200 is just plain cool—but where did these tiny wonders come from? And do they have a future?</p>
<p>Well, without the microcar's predecessors, we may not have the modern motorcar as we know it. Sort of.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017785#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017785&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In early August 2023, a beekeeper near the port of Savannah, Georgia, noticed some odd activity around his hives. Something was hunting his honeybees. It was a flying insect bigger than a yellowjacket, mostly black with bright yellow legs. The creature would hover at the hive entrance, capture a honeybee in flight, and butcher it before darting off with the bee’s thorax, the meatiest bit.</p>
<p>“He’d only been keeping bees since March… but he knew enough to know that something wasn’t right with this thing,” says Lewis Bartlett, an evolutionary ecologist and honeybee expert at the University of Georgia, who helped to investigate. Bartlett had seen these honeybee hunters before, during his PhD studies in England a decade earlier. The dreaded yellow-legged hornet had arrived in North America.</p>
<p>With origins in Afghanistan, eastern China, and Indonesia, the yellow-legged hornet, <em>Vespa velutina</em>, has expanded during the last two decades into South Korea, Japan, and Europe. When the hornet invades new territory, it preys on <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2017/whole-food-diet-bees">honeybees</a>, <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2023/underappreciated-benefits-wild-bees">bumblebees</a>, and other vulnerable insects. One yellow-legged hornet can kill up to dozens of honeybees in a single day. It can decimate colonies through intimidation by deterring honeybees from foraging. “They’re not to be messed with,” says honeybee researcher Gard Otis, professor emeritus at the University of Guelph in Canada.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026903#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026903&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When the Brazilian nutritional scientist Carlos Monteiro coined the term “ultra-processed foods” 15 years ago, he established what he calls a “new paradigm” for assessing the impact of diet on health.</p>
<p>Monteiro had noticed that although Brazilian households were spending less on sugar and oil, obesity rates were going up. The paradox could be explained by increased consumption of food that had undergone high levels of processing, such as the addition of preservatives and flavorings or the removal or addition of nutrients.</p>
<p>But health authorities and food companies resisted the link, Monteiro tells the FT. “[These are] people who spent their whole life thinking that the only link between diet and health is the nutrient content of foods ... Food is more than nutrients.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026867#p3">Read 52 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026867&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Senior managers from NASA and Boeing told reporters on Friday that they plan to launch the first crew test flight of the Starliner spacecraft as soon as June 1, following several weeks of detailed analysis of a helium leak and a "design vulnerability" with the ship's propulsion system.</p>
<p>Extensive data reviews over the last two-and-a-half weeks settled on a likely cause of the leak, which officials described as small and stable. During these reviews, engineers also built confidence that even if the leak worsened, it would not add any unacceptable risk for the Starliner test flight to the International Space Station, officials said.</p>
<p>But engineers also found that an unlikely mix of technical failures in Starliner's propulsion system—representing 0.77 percent of all possible failure modes, according to Boeing's program manager—could prevent the spacecraft from conducting a deorbit burn at the end of the mission.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027053#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027053&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A previously unknown piece of ransomware, dubbed ShrinkLocker, encrypts victim data using the BitLocker feature built into the Windows operating system.</p>
<p>BitLocker is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/manage-bde">full-volume encryptor</a> that debuted in 2007 with the release of Windows Vista. Users employ it to encrypt entire hard drives to prevent people from reading or modifying data in the event they get physical access to the disk. Starting with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-1507-and-1511">rollout of Windows 10</a>, BitLocker by default has used the 128-bit and 256-bit XTS-AES encryption algorithm, giving the feature extra protection from attacks that rely on manipulating cipher text to cause predictable changes in plain text.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers from security firm Kaspersky found a threat actor using BitLocker to encrypt data on systems located in Mexico, Indonesia, and Jordan. The researchers named the new ransomware ShrinkLocker, both for its use of BitLocker and because it shrinks the size of each non-boot partition by 100 MB and splits the newly unallocated space into new primary partitions of the same size.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027056#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027056&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Minnesota this week eliminated two laws that made it harder for cities and towns to build their own broadband networks. The state-imposed restrictions were repealed in an <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=senate&amp;f=Sf4097&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2024">omnibus commerce policy bill</a> signed on Tuesday by Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat.</p>
<p>Minnesota was previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/isp-lobby-has-already-won-limits-on-public-broadband-in-20-states/">one of about 20 states</a> that imposed significant restrictions on municipal broadband. The <a href="https://broadbandnow.com/report/municipal-broadband-roadblocks">number</a> can differ depending on who's <a href="https://www.localnetchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CLIC-List-State-Barriers-7-1-21.pdf">counting</a> because of disagreements over what counts as a significant restriction. But the list has gotten smaller in recent years because states including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/gop-plan-for-broadband-competition-would-ban-city-run-networks-across-us/#:~:text=Republicans%20in%20the-,Arkansas,-State%20Legislature.%20Baller">Arkansas</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/colorado-kills-law-that-made-it-harder-for-cities-to-offer-internet-service/">Colorado</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/victory-for-municipal-broadband-as-wash-state-lawmakers-end-restrictions/">Washington</a> repealed laws that hindered municipal broadband.</p>
<p>The Minnesota bill enacted this week <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF4097&amp;version=latest&amp;session=ls93&amp;session_year=2024&amp;session_number=0#:~:text=Any%20municipality%20shall%20have%20the%20right%20to%20own%20and%20operate%20a%20telephone%20exchange">struck down</a> a requirement that municipal telecommunications networks be approved in an election with 65 percent of the vote. The law is over a century old, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance's Community Broadband Network Initiative <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/minnesota-strikes-down-preemption-laws-blocking-municipal-broadband">wrote</a> yesterday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027041#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027041&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX is targeting June 5 for the next flight of its massive Starship rocket, the company said Friday.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated test flight—the fourth in a program to bring Starship to operational readiness and make progress toward its eventual reuse—will seek to demonstrate the ability of the Super Heavy first stage to make a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico and for the Starship upper stage to make a controlled reentry through Earth's atmosphere before it falls into the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>This mission will carry no payloads as SpaceX seeks additional flight data about the performance of the complex Starship vehicle. It is simultaneously the largest and most powerful rocket ever built and the first launch system ever intended to be fully and rapidly reusable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026961#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026961&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you're tired of Google's AI Overview extracting all value from the web while also telling people to eat glue or run with scissors, you can turn it off—sort of. Google has been telling people its AI box at the top of search results is <em>the future</em>, and you can't turn it off, but that ignores how Google search works: A lot of options are powered by URL parameters. That means you can turn off AI search with this one simple trick! (Sorry.)</p>
<p>Our method for killing AI search is defaulting to the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-search-adds-web-filter-as-it-pivots-to-ai-focused-search-results/">"web" search filter,</a> which Google recently launched as a way to search the web without Google's alpha-quality AI junk. It's actually pretty nice, showing only the traditional 10 blue links, giving you a clean (well, other than the ads), uncluttered results page that looks like it's from 2011. Sadly, Google's UI doesn't have a way to make "web" search the default, and switching to it means digging through the "more" options drop-down <em>after</em> you do a search, so it's a few clicks deep.</p>
<p>Check out the URL after you do a search, and you'll see a mile-long URL full of esoteric tracking information and mode information. We'll put each search result URL parameter on a new line so the URL is somewhat readable:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026948#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026948&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, the Biden administration announced it would <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-ev-china-tariffs-biden/">levy dramatic new tariffs</a> on <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/electric-vehicles/">electric vehicles</a>, electric vehicle batteries, and battery components imported into the United States from China. The move kicked off another round of global debate on how best to push the transportation industry toward an emissions-free future, and how global automotive manufacturers outside of China should compete with the Asian country’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-chinas-ev-boom-caught-western-car-companies-asleep-at-the-wheel/">well-engineered and low-cost car options</a>.</p>
<p>But what is an electric <em>vehicle</em> exactly? China has dominated bicycle manufacturing, too; it was responsible for some 80 percent of US bicycle imports in 2021, according to <a href="https://prosperousamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Global-Bicycle-Market-A-Comprehensive-Plan-to-Re-Shore-the-U.S.-Bike-E-Bike-Industry-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://prosperousamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Global-Bicycle-Market-A-Comprehensive-Plan-to-Re-Shore-the-U.S.-Bike-E-Bike-Industry-1.pdf" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://prosperousamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Global-Bicycle-Market-A-Comprehensive-Plan-to-Re-Shore-the-U.S.-Bike-E-Bike-Industry-1.pdf"}'>one report</a>. In cycling circles, the US’s new trade policies have raised questions about how much bicycle companies will have to pay to get Chinese-made bicycles and components into the US, and whether any new costs will get passed on to US customers. </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>

<p>Despite the delusions of the raw milk crowd, drinking unpasteurized milk brimming with infectious avian H5N1 influenza virus is a very bad idea, according to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2405495">freshly squeezed data published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison squirted raw H5N1-containing milk from infected cows into the throats of anesthetized laboratory mice, finding that the virus caused systemic infections after the mice were observed swallowing the dose. The illnesses began quickly, with symptoms of lethargy and ruffled fur starting on day 1. On day 4, the animals were euthanized to prevent extended suffering. Subsequent analysis found that the mice had high levels of H5N1 bird flu virus in their respiratory tracts, as well their hearts, kidneys, spleens, livers, mammary glands, and brains.</p>
<p>"Collectively, our data indicate that HPAI [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza] A(H5N1) virus in untreated milk can infect susceptible animals that consume it," the researchers concluded. The researchers also found that raw milk containing H5N1 can remain infectious for weeks when stored at refrigerator temperatures.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027000#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027000&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On May 20, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/ios-and-ipados-17-5-1-fix-a-nasty-bug-that-resurfaced-old-photos/">Apple released iOS 17.5.1</a> to fix a bug users had found a few days prior in iOS 17.5 that resurfaced old photos that had been previously deleted. So far, the update seems to have resolved the issue, but users were left wondering exactly what had happened. Now Apple has clarified the issue somewhat, describing the nature of the bug to 9to5Mac.</p>
<p>Apple told the publication that the photos were not regurgitated from iCloud Photos after being deleted on the local device; rather, they were local to the device. Apple says they were neither left in the cloud after deletion nor synced to it after, and the company did not have access to the deleted photos.</p>
<p>The photos were retained on the local device storage due to a database corruption issue, and the bug resurfaced photos that were flagged for deletion but were not actually fully deleted locally.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026970#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026970&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
