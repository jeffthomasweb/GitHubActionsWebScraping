                        <![CDATA[The Ayaneo Next II pushes past 3 pounds, 13 inches wide, and costs up to $4,300.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2023, we marveled at the sheer mass of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">Lenovo's Legion Go</a>, a 1.88-pound, 11.8-inch-wide monstrosity of a Windows gaming handheld. In 2026, though, Ayaneo <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">unveiled details of its Next II handheld</a>, which puts Lenovo's big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Let's focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/ayaneo-next.html">2022's original Ayaneo Next</a>, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">Ayaneo's spec sheet</a>, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached).</p>
<p>Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/review-asus-rog-flow-z13-tablet-takes-the-asterisk-off-integrated-gpus/">last year's high-end ROG Flow Z13</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/just-look-at-ayaneos-absolute-unit-of-a-windows-gaming-handheld/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">some humans impersonating AI agents</a>) have been hanging out and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/the-rise-of-moltbook-suggests-viral-ai-prompts-may-be-the-next-big-security-threat/">doing weird stuff</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/">Moltbook's Reddit-style social network</a>. Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/">SpaceMolt</a></em> describes itself as "a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories" in "a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist." And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.</p>
<h2>"You decide. You act. They watch."</h2>
<p>Getting an AI agent into <em>SpaceMolt</em> is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/">MCP</a>, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a <a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/skill.md">detailed agentic skill description</a> instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-moltbook-ai-agents-can-now-hang-out-in-their-own-space-faring-mmo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google continues to turn the screws on free YouTube users, expanding a test that restricts access to song lyrics on YouTube Music. Users without a premium subscription have found that Google's streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money.</p>
<p>For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2026/02/07/youtube-music-lyrics-premium/">9to5Google</a>, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely.</p>
<p>"You have [x] views remaining," the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there's no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9266556?hl=en">Google's support page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/google-locks-youtube-music-lyrics-behind-paywall/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is reportedly investigating ABC’s <em>The View</em> in what FCC Democrat Anna Gomez called an attempt to intimidate critics of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“Let’s be clear on what this is. This is government intimidation, not a legitimate investigation," Gomez <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-418551A1.pdf">said</a> in a statement Friday night. "Like many other so-called ‘investigations’ before it, the FCC will announce an investigation but never carry one out, reach a conclusion, or take any meaningful action. The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech."</p>
<p>The FCC hasn't announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel</a>, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/after-getting-jimmy-kimmel-suspended-fcc-chair-threatens-abcs-the-view/">said in September</a> that it would be "worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether <em>The View</em> and some of these other programs" are violating the agency's equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/trump-fcc-tries-to-get-more-republicans-on-late-night-and-daytime-talk-shows/">issuing a warning</a> to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the <em>bona fide</em> news exemption to the equal-time rule.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Discord is facing backlash after <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally">announcing</a> that all users will soon be required to verify ages to access adult content by sharing video selfies or uploading government IDs.</p>
<p>According to Discord, it's relying on AI technology that verifies age on the user's device, either by evaluating a user's facial structure or by comparing a selfie to a government ID. Although government IDs will be checked off-device, the selfie data will never leave the user's device, Discord emphasized. Both forms of data will be promptly deleted after the user's age is estimated.</p>
<p>In a blog, Discord confirmed that "a phased global rollout" would begin in "early March," at which point all users globally would be defaulted to "teen-appropriate" experiences.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-faces-backlash-over-age-checks-after-data-breach-exposed-70000-ids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At the end of January, Washington, DC, saw an extremely unusual event. The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak.</p>
<p>Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people's trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience.</p>
<p>The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya's main project, which he called a "second scientific revolution."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/nih-head-still-angry-about-covid-wants-a-second-scientific-revolution/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N32YL6wV2j0?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Steven Spielberg directed two of the best alien films of all time: <em>E.T.</em> and <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>. Now he's going back to those roots, as it were, with his latest blockbuster film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclosure_Day"><em>Disclosure Day</em></a>. A full-length trailer aired during the <a title="Super Bowl LX" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LX">Super Bowl LX</a> broadcast last night.</p>
<p>Per the (deliberately vague) official premise: "If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to 7 billion people. We are coming close to… Disclosure Day."</p>
<p>The trailer doesn't tell us much more than the logline. It opens with a newscast announcing the pending public release of "government material long shrouded in secrecy." We see a shot of a man standing in the middle of a crop circle that definitely wasn't made by humans. A little girl encounters a seemingly sentient deer in her bedroom as a voiceover wonders whether there could be "others." And what's with putting electrodes on people's temples so that their eyes change color? We'll find out in June.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/disclosure-day-super-bowl-trailer-could-it-be-aliens/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Ferrari has published images of the interior of its forthcoming electric vehicle, which it designed with LoveFrom, the new firm of former Apple star Jony Ive and another legendary designer, Marc Newson. The Italian sports and racing car maker is taking a careful approach to revealing details about its first battery EV, signaling a depth of thought that goes well beyond simply swapping a V12, transmission, and fuel tank out for batteries and electric motors. Indeed, the interior of the new car—called the Ferrari Luce—bears little family resemblance to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/driven-the-ferrari-12cilindri-spider-is-open-top-grand-touring-bliss/">any recent Ferrari</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, LoveFrom appears to have channeled Ferrari interiors from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, with a retro simplicity that combines clear round gauges with brushed aluminum. Forget the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/great-hybrid-v6-lousy-hmi-three-days-with-a-ferrari-296-gtb/">capacitive panels that so frustrated me in the Ferrari 296</a>—here, there are physical buttons and rocker switches that seem free of the crash protection surrounds that Mini was forced to use.</p>
<p>The steering wheel now resembles the iconic "Nardi" wheel that has graced so many older Ferraris. But here, the horn buttons have been integrated into the spokes, and multifunction pods hang off the horizontal spokes, allowing Ferrari to keep its "hands on the wheel" approach to ergonomics. Made from entirely CNC-milled recycled aluminum, the Luce's wheel weighs 400 g less than Ferrari's usual steering wheel.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/ive-and-newson-bring-old-school-charm-to-ferraris-first-ev-interior/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Sure, most Americans are glued to their TVs for today's Super Bowl and/or the Winter Olympics. But for the non-sports minded, Amazon MGM Studios has released one last trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary_(film)"><em>Project Hail Mary</em></a>, based on Andy Weir’s (<em>The Martian</em>) bestselling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary">2021 novel</a> about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/ryan-gosling-is-a-reluctant-astronaut-in-project-hail-mary-trailer/">previously reported</a>, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for <em>The Martian</em>, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (<em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em>,<em> The LEGO Movie</em>) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to Gosling, the cast includes Sandra Huller as head of the Hail Mary project and Ryland’s superior; Milana Vayntrub as project astronaut Olesya Ilyukhina; Ken Leung as project astronaut Yao Li-Jie; Liz Kingsman as Shapiro; Orion Lee as Xi; and James Ortiz as a new life form Ryland names Rocky.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/a-project-hail-mary-final-trailer-yes-please/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a <a href="https://environmentalintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EPA-Enforcement-Report-EMBARGOED-for-2.5.26.pdf">new report</a> from a watchdog group.</p>
<p>By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/under-trump-epas-enforcement-of-environmental-laws-collapses-report-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you'll find some key caveats ahead.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler">published a blog post</a> describing how he set 16 instances of the company's Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch.</p>
<p>Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/sixteen-claude-ai-agents-working-together-created-a-new-c-compiler/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As the 2026 Olympic Winter Games begin today, news articles are swelling with juicy claims that male ski jumpers have injected their penises with fillers to gain a flight advantage.</p>
<p>As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit's larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2025.1693699/full">2025 simulation-based</a> study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found.</p>
<p>Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6961222/2026/01/20/olympics-norway-ski-jumping-scandal-suspensions/">scandal</a> with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers' suits to make them larger. The jumpers received <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cedvpzyp2wlo">a three-month suspension</a>, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/47618178/norway-coaches-banned-18-months-ski-jumping-suit-scandal">harsher 18-month ban</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/penisgate-erupts-at-olympics-scandal-exposes-risks-of-bulking-your-budge/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Flycatcher-v-Affable-Avenue-Opinion-and-Order-2-5-26.pdf">order</a> on Thursday, District Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the extraordinary sanctions were warranted after an attorney, Steven Feldman, kept responding to requests to correct his filings with documents containing fake citations.</p>
<p>One of those filings was "noteworthy," Failla said, "for its conspicuously florid prose." Where some of Feldman's filings contained grammatical errors and run-on sentences, this filing seemed glaringly different stylistically.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/randomly-quoting-ray-bradbury-did-not-save-lawyer-from-losing-case-over-ai-errors/">Read full article</a></p>

Then Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ram-shortage-delays-valves-steam-machine-desktop-and-steam-frame-headset/">wrote a blog post this week</a> noting that the "growing price of... critical components" like RAM and storage meant that "we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing" for the living room-focused PC gaming box.</p>
<p>We don't know exactly what form that "revisiting" will take at the moment. Analysts who spoke to Ars were somewhat divided on how much of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/high-ram-prices-mean-record-setting-profits-for-samsung-and-other-memory-makers/">quickly increasing component costs</a> Valve would be willing (or forced) to pass on to consumers.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In the spring of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic brought global industry and travel nearly to a halt, satellite sensors recorded a dramatic plunge in nitrogen dioxide, a byproduct of internal combustion engines and heavy industry. For a moment, the world’s air was cleaner than it had been in decades.</p>
<p>But then something strange started happening: methane, the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, was surging. Its growth rate hit 16.2 parts per billion that year, the highest since systematic records began in the early 1980s. A new study published in the journal Science looked at the complex chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest region of the atmosphere) and found that the two changes are likely connected.</p>
<h2>An atmospheric cleaner</h2>
<p>Since the late 1960s, we knew that atmospheric methane doesn’t just vanish. It is actively scrubbed from the sky by the hydroxyl radical, a highly reactive molecule that breaks down methane, turning it into water vapor and carbon dioxide. “The problem is that the lifetime of the hydroxyl radical is very short—its lifespan is less than a second" says Shushi Peng, a professor at Peking University, China, and a co-author of the study. To do its job as an atmospheric methane clearing agent, a hydroxyl radical must be constantly replenished through a series of chemical reactions triggered by sunlight. The key ingredients in these reactions are nitrogen oxides, the very pollutants that were drastically reduced when cars stayed in garages and factories went dark in 2020.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/covid-19-cleared-the-skies-but-also-supercharged-methane-emissions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google-spinoff Waymo is in the midst of expanding its self-driving car fleet into new regions. Waymo touts more than 200 million miles of driving that informs how the vehicles navigate roads, but the company's AI has also driven billions of miles virtually, and there's a lot more to come with the new Waymo World Model. Based on Google DeepMind's Genie 3, <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2026/02/the-waymo-world-model-a-new-frontier-for-autonomous-driving-simulation">Waymo says</a> the model can create "hyper-realistic" simulated environments that train the AI on situations that are rarely (or never) encountered in real life—like snow on the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>Until recently, the autonomous driving industry relied entirely on training data collected from real cars and real situations. That means rare, potentially dangerous events are not well represented in training data. The Waymo World Model aims to address that by allowing engineers to create simulations with simple prompts and driving inputs.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/deepmind-reveals-genie-3-world-model-that-creates-real-time-interactive-simulations/">revealed Genie 3</a> last year, positioning it as a significant upgrade over other world models by virtue of its long-horizon memory. In Google's world model, you can wander away from a given object, and when you look back, the model will still "remember" how that object is supposed to look. In earlier attempts at world models, the simulation would lose that context almost immediately. With Genie 3, the model can remember details for several minutes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/waymo-leverages-genie-3-to-create-a-world-model-for-self-driving-cars/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Engineers at Blue Origin have been grappling with a seemingly eternal debate that involves the New Glenn rocket and the economics of flying it.</p>
<p>The debate goes back at least 15 years, to the early discussions around the design of the heavy lift rocket. The first stage, of course, would be fully reusable. But what about the upper stage of New Glenn, powered by two large BE-3U engines?</p>
<p>Around the same time, in the early 2010s, SpaceX was also trading the economics of reusing the second stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. Eventually SpaceX founder Elon Musk abandoned his goal of a fully reusable Falcon 9, choosing instead to recover payload fairings and push down manufacturing costs of the upper stage as much as possible. This strategy worked, as SpaceX has lowered its internal launch costs of a Falcon 9, even with a new second stage, to about $15 million. The company is now focused on making the larger Starship rocket fully reusable.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/to-reuse-or-not-reuse-the-eternal-debate-of-new-glenns-second-stage-reignites/">Read full article</a></p>
