                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers from Anthropic said they recently observed the “first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign” after detecting China-state hackers using the company’s Claude AI tool in a campaign targeting dozens of targets. Outside researchers are much more measured in describing the significance of the discovery.</p>
<p>Anthropic published the reports on Thursday <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage">here</a>. In September, the reports said, Anthropic discovered a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign,” carried out by a Chinese state-sponsored group, that used <a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> to automate up to 90 percent of the work. Human intervention was required “only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign).” Anthropic said the hackers had employed AI agentic capabilities to an “unprecedented” extent.</p>
<p>“This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI ‘agents’—systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention,” Anthropic said. “Agents are valuable for everyday work and productivity—but in the wrong hands, they can substantially increase the viability of large-scale cyberattacks.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/researchers-question-anthropic-claim-that-ai-assisted-attack-was-90-autonomous/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.19 of the Rocket Report! Thursday was a monumental day in launch history with Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket not just taking off successfully, but with the first stage masterfully returning to the surface of the ocean, hovering near the <em>Jacklyn</em> drone ship, and then making a landing in the center of the barge. It was fantastic to watch, and cements our new reality of reusable rockets. The future of space access is very bright indeed.</p>

<p><strong>Private Chinese rocket fails</strong>. Galactic Energy’s solid-fuel Ceres-1 rocket lifted off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on Sunday, carrying three satellites toward low Earth orbit. The rocket’s first three stages performed well, according to media reports, but its fourth and final stage shut down too early, leading to the loss of all three payloads, <a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/china-galactic-energy-ceres-1-rocket-launch-failure">Space.com reports</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/rocket-report-blue-origins-stunning-success-vive-le-baguette-one/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>About 170 Starshield satellites built by SpaceX for the US government’s National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) have been sending signals in the wrong direction, a satellite researcher found.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/spacex-building-hundreds-of-spy-satellites-for-us-government-report-says/">SpaceX-built spy satellites</a> are helping the NRO greatly expand its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/nro-chief-you-cant-hide-from-our-new-swarm-of-spacex-built-spy-satellites/">satellite surveillance capabilities</a>, but the purpose of these signals is unknown. The signals are sent from space to Earth in a frequency band that’s allocated internationally for Earth-to-space and space-to-space transmissions.</p>
<p>There have been no public complaints of interference caused by the surprising Starshield emissions. But the researcher who found them says they highlight a troubling lack of transparency in how the US government manages the use of spectrum and a failure to coordinate spectrum usage with other countries.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/us-spy-satellites-built-by-spacex-send-signals-in-the-wrong-direction/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Health officials in the United Kingdom are warning that this year’s flu season for the Northern Hemisphere is looking like it will be particularly rough—and the US is not prepared.</p>
<p>The bleak outlook is driven by a new strain of H3N2, which emerged over the summer (at the end of the Southern Hemisphere’s season) sporting several mutations. Those changes are not enough to spark the direst of circumstances—a deadly pandemic—but they could help the virus dodge immune responses, resulting in an outsized number of severe illnesses that could put a significant strain on hospitals and clinics.</p>
<p>In the UK, the virus has taken off. The region’s flu season has started around five weeks earlier than normal and is making a swift ascent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/this-flu-season-looks-grim-as-h3n2-emerges-with-mutations/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you ask random gamers what price they think Valve will charge for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">newly announced Steam Machine hardware</a>, you’ll get <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kyleor.land/post/3m5hg7cmz422g">a wide range of guesses</a>. But if you ask the analysts who follow the game industry for a living the same question… well, you’ll actually get the same wide range of (somewhat better-informed) guesses.</p>
<p>At the high end of those guesses are analysts like <a href="https://www.fsquared.biz/about-fsquared/">F-Squared</a>‘s Michael Futter, who expects a starting price of $799 to $899 for the entry-level 512GB Steam Machine and a whopping $1,000 to $1,100 for the 2TB version. With <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">internal specs</a> that Futter says “will rival a PS5 and maybe even hit PS5 Pro performance,” we can expect a “hefty price tag” from Valve’s new console-like effort. At the same time, since Valve is “positioning this as a dedicated, powerful gaming PC… I suspect that the price will be below a similarly capable traditional desktop,” Futter said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dfcint.com/">DFC Intelligence</a> analyst David Cole similarly expects the Steam Machine to start at a price “around $800” and go up to “around $1,000” for the 2TB model. Cole said he expects Valve will seek “very low margins” or even break-even pricing on the hardware itself, which he said would probably lead to pricing “below a gaming PC but slightly above a high-end console.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/are-you-ready-for-a-1000-steam-machine-some-analysts-think-you-should-be/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Standard brain implants use electrodes that penetrate the gray matter to stimulate and record the activity of neurons. These typically need to be put in place via a surgical procedure. To go around that need, a team of researchers led by Deblina Sarkar, an electrical engineer and MIT assistant professor, developed microscopic electronic devices hybridized with living cells. Those cells can be injected into the circulatory system with a standard syringe and will travel the bloodstream before implanting themselves in target brain areas.</p>
<p>“In the first two years of working on this technology at MIT, we’ve got 35 grant proposals rejected in a row,” Sarkar says. “Comments we got from the reviewers were that our idea was very impactful, but it was impossible.” She acknowledges that the proposal sounded like something you can find in science fiction novels. But after more than six years of research, she and her colleagues have pulled it off.</p>
<h2>Nanobot problems</h2>
<p>In 2022, when Sarkar and her colleagues gathered initial data and got some promising results with their cell-electronics hybrids, the team proposed the project for the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award. For the first time, after 35 rejections, it made it through peer review. “We got the highest impact score ever,” Sarkar says.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/tiny-chips-hitch-a-ride-on-immune-cells-to-sites-of-inflammation/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Ars chats with particle physicist Daniel Whiteson about his new book <em>Do Aliens Speak Physics?</em>]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Science fiction has long speculated about the possibility of first contact with an alien species from a distant world and how we might be able to communicate with them. But what if we simply don’t have enough common ground for that to even be possible? An alien species is bound to be biologically very different, and their language will be shaped by their home environment, broader culture, and even how they perceive the universe. They might not even share the same math and physics. These and other fascinating questions are the focus of an entertaining new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Do-Aliens-Speak-Physics-Questions/dp/1324064641"><em>Do Aliens Speak Physics? And Other Questions About Science and the Nature of Reality</em></a>.</p>
<p>Co-author Daniel Whiteson is a particle physicist at the University of California, Irvine, who has worked on the ATLAS collaboration at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. He’s also a gifted science communicator who previously co-authored two books with cartoonist Jorge Cham of <a href="https://phdcomics.com"><em>PhD Comics</em></a> fame: 2018’s <em>We Have No Idea</em> and 2021’s <em>Frequently Asked Questions About the Universe</em>. (The pair also co-hosted a podcast from 2018 to 2024, <em>Daniel and Jorge Explain the Universe</em>.) This time around, cartoonist <a href="https://www.andywarnercomics.com">Andy Warner</a> provided the illustrations, and Whiteson and Warner charmingly dedicate their book to “all the alien scientists we have yet to meet.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whiteson has long been interested in the philosophy of physics. “I’m not the kind of physicist who’s like, ‘whatever, let’s just measure stuff,'” he told Ars. “The thing that always excited me about physics was this implicit promise that we were doing something universal, that we were learning things that were true on other planets. But the more I learned, the more concerned I became that this might have been oversold. None are fundamental, and we don’t understand why anything emerges. Can we separate the human lens from the thing we’re looking at? We don’t know in the end how much that lens is distorting what we see or defining what we’re looking at. So that was the fundamental question I always wanted to explore.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/what-if-the-aliens-come-and-we-just-cant-communicate/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We got our first glimpse of the much-anticipated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_season_2">second season</a> of <em>Fallout</em> (adapted from the popular video game franchise) in August when Prime Video released an extended teaser. We now have the official trailer, with all the deadpan humor, explosions, and mutant atrocities one could hope for—including ghoulish Elvis impersonators in New Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/fallout-s2-teaser-brings-us-to-new-vegas/">previously reported</a>, in S1, we met Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), a young woman whose vault is raided by surface dwellers. The raiders kill many vault residents and kidnap her father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan), so the sheltered Lucy sets out on a quest to find him. Life on the surface is pretty brutal, but Lucy learns fast. Along the way, she finds an ally (and love interest) in Maximus (Aaron Moten), a squire masquerading as a knight of the Brotherhood of Steel. And she runs afoul of a gunslinger and bounty hunter known as the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a former Hollywood actor named Cooper Howard who survived the original nuclear blast, but radiation exposure turned him into, well, a ghoul.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/11/civil-war-is-brewing-in-the-wasteland-in-fallout-s2-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple CarPlay, the interface that lets you cast your phone to your car’s infotainment screen, may finally be coming to Tesla’s electric vehicles. CarPlay is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/01/one-week-with-apples-carplay/">nearly a decade old at this point</a>, and it has become <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/apples-push-to-take-over-the-dashboard-resisted-by-car-makers/">so popular</a> that almost half of car buyers have said they won’t consider a car without the feature, and the overwhelming majority of automakers have included CarPlay in their vehicles.</p>
<p>Until now, that hasn’t included Tesla. CEO Elon Musk doesn’t appear to have opined on the omission, though he has frequently criticized Apple. In the past, Musk has said the goal of Tesla infotainment is to be “the most amount of fun you can have in a car.” Tesla has regularly added puerile features like fart noises to the system, and it has also integrated video games that drivers can play while they charge.</p>
<p>For customers who want to stream music, Tesla has instead offered Spotify, Tidal, and even Apple Music apps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/after-years-of-saying-no-tesla-reportedly-adding-apple-carplay-to-its-cars/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google recently decided that the freedom afforded by Android was a bit too much and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-will-block-sideloading-of-unverified-android-apps-starting-next-year/">announced developer verification</a>, a system that will require developers outside the Google Play platform to register with Google. Users and developers didn’t accept Google’s rationale and have been complaining loudly. As Google begins early access testing, it has conceded that “experienced users” should have an escape hatch.</p>
<p><a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-developer-verification-early.html">According to Google</a>, online scam and malware campaigns are getting more aggressive, and there’s real harm being done in spite of the platform’s sideloading scare screens. Google says it’s common for scammers to use social engineering to create a false sense of urgency, prompting users to bypass Android’s built-in protections to install malicious apps.</p>
<p>Google’s solution to this problem, as announced several months ago, is to force everyone making apps to verify their identities. Unverified apps won’t install on any Google-certified device once verification rolls out. Without this, the company claims malware creators can endlessly create new apps to scam people. However, the centralized nature of verification threatened to introduce numerous headaches into a process that used to be straightforward for power users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/google-will-let-android-power-users-bypass-upcoming-sideloading-restrictions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday’s announcement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">new living room</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valve-rejoins-the-vr-hardware-wars-with-standalone-steam-frame/">VR hardware</a> from Valve obviously has many gamers clamoring for any news of a more powerful version of the nearly 4-year-old Steam Deck. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">a new interview with IGN</a>, though, Valve Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais says that portable gaming silicon still hasn’t advanced enough to justify brand-new benchmark hardware.</p>
<p>“The thing we’re making sure of is that it’s a worthwhile enough performance upgrade [for a Steam Deck 2] to make sense as a standalone product,” Griffais told IGN. “We’re not interested in getting to a point where it’s 20 or 30 or even 50 percent more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that.”</p>
<p>“So we’ve been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there’s no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC [System on a Chip] landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck,” Griffais continued.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/valve-says-its-still-waiting-for-better-chips-to-power-steam-deck-2/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Mars is cold, parched, and extremely dusty. Powerful gusts of wind kick up literal tons of reddish dust that often takes the form of whorls known as dust devils. These winds also shroud the planet in dust by lifting material from the surface and blowing it into the atmosphere (what little Mars has left of an atmosphere), sometimes creating dust storms that rage for days.</p>
<p>Researcher Valentin Bickel wanted to know just how intense winds can be on the red planet. Using data obtained by the <a href="https://www.cassis.unibe.ch/">Mars camera CaSSIS</a> (Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System), the <a href="https://exploration.esa.int/web/mars/-/46124-mission-overview">ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter</a>, and <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Mars_Express_orbiter_instruments">stereo camera HRSC</a> (High Resolution Stereo Camera) on board ESA orbiter Mars Express, he and his team used deep learning to analyze stereo images that were taken seconds apart at the same location. These images can track the motion of dust devils, and the researchers use them to infer how the winds behind the dust devils move and lift dust from the surface. That dust goes on to have a big influence on the Martian weather.</p>
<p>Bickel, of the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern, noticed that the tumultuous Martian winds are even faster than previous observations had made them out to be. They carry more dust than was previously thought. “Our observations show that strong near-surface winds are abundant on Mars and play an important role in atmospheric dust sourcing, directly informing more accurate models of Mars’ atmosphere, weather, and climate,” the researchers said in a study recently published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw5170">Science Advances</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/tracking-the-winds-that-have-turned-mars-into-a-planet-of-dust/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>As part of this move, Duffy asked NASA’s current lunar lander contractors, SpaceX and Blue Origin, for more nimble plans. Neither has specified those plans publicly, but a recent update from SpaceX <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates#moon-and-beyond"> referenced</a> a “simplified” version of the Starship system it’s building to help NASA return humans to the Moon.</p>
<p>“Since the contract was awarded, we have been consistently responsive to NASA as requirements for Artemis III have changed and have shared ideas on how to simplify the mission to align with national priorities,” the company said. “In response to the latest calls, we’ve shared and are formally assessing a simplified mission architecture and concept of operations that we believe will result in a faster return to the Moon while simultaneously improving crew safety.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/what-would-a-simplified-starship-plan-for-the-moon-actually-look-like/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent months, Google has promised to inject generative AI into the online shopping experience, and now it’s following through. The previously announced shopping features of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/">AI Mode search</a> are rolling out, and Gemini will also worm its way into Google’s forgotten Duplex automated phone call tech. It’s all coming in time for the holidays to allegedly make your gifting more convenient and also conveniently ensure that Google gets a piece of the action.</p>
<p>At Google I/O in May, the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-shopping-ai-mode-virtual-try-on-update/">announced</a> its intention to bring conversational shopping to AI Mode. According to Google, its enormous “Shopping Graph” or retailer data means its AI is uniquely positioned to deliver useful suggestions. In the coming weeks, users in the US will be able to ask AI Mode complex questions about what to buy, and it will deliver suggestions, guides, tables, and other generated content to help you decide. And since this is gen AI, it comes with the usual disclaimers about possible mistakes.</p>

<p>You’re probably wondering where you’ll see sponsored shopping content in these experiences. Google says some of the content that appears in AI Mode will be ads, just like if you look up shopping results in a traditional search. Shopping features are also coming to the Gemini app, but Google says it won’t have sponsored content in the results for the time being.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-rolling-out-conversational-shopping-and-ads-in-ai-mode-search/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/">released</a> GPT-5.1 Instant and GPT-5.1 Thinking, two updated versions of its flagship AI models now available in ChatGPT. The company is wrapping the models in the language of anthropomorphism, claiming that they’re warmer, more conversational, and better at following instructions.</p>
<p>The release follows complaints earlier this year that its previous models were excessively cheerful and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/annoyed-chatgpt-users-complain-about-bots-relentlessly-positive-tone/">sycophantic</a>, along with an opposing controversy among users over how OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/strengthening-chatgpt-responses-in-sensitive-conversations/">modified</a> the default GPT-5 output style after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-lawsuit-suicide-56e63e5538602ea39116f1904bf7cdc3">several suicide lawsuits</a>.</p>
<p>The company now faces <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/openai-fights-order-to-hand-over-20-million-private-chatgpt-conversations/">intense scrutiny</a> from lawyers and regulators that could threaten its future operations. In that kind of environment, it’s difficult to just release a new AI model, throw out a few stats, and move on like the company could even a year ago. But here are the basics: The new GPT-5.1 Instant model will serve as ChatGPT’s faster default option for most tasks, while GPT-5.1 Thinking is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">simulated reasoning model</a> that attempts to handle more complex problem-solving tasks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/openai-walks-a-tricky-tightrope-with-gpt-5-1s-eight-new-personalities/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida—Another Falcon 9 rocket fired off its launch pad here on Monday night, taking with it another 29 Starlink Internet satellites to orbit.</p>
<p>This was the 94th orbital launch from Florida’s Space Coast so far in 2025, breaking the previous record for the most satellite launches in a calendar year from the world’s busiest spaceport. Monday night’s launch came two days after a Chinese Long March 11 rocket lifted off from an oceangoing platform on the opposite side of the world, marking humanity’s 255th mission to reach orbit this year, a new annual record for global launch activity.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, a handful of additional missions have pushed the global figure this year to 259, putting the world on pace for around 300 orbital launches by the end of 2025. This will more than double the global tally of 135 orbital launches in 2021.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/with-another-record-broken-the-worlds-busiest-spaceport-keeps-getting-busier/">Read full article</a></p>

But the old operating system’s enduring popularity has prompted Microsoft to promise between one and three years of Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for many Windows 10 PCs. For individuals with Windows 10 PCs, it’s relatively easy to get an additional year of updates<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/how-to-get-another-free-year-of-updates-for-your-windows-10-pc/"> at no cost</a>.</p>
<p>Or at least, it’s supposed to be. Bugs <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/11/12/windows-10-kb5071959-released-to-fix-microsofts-bug-that-accidentally-blocked-esu-extended-security-updates/">initially identified by Windows Latest</a> were keeping some Windows 10 PCs from successfully enrolling in the ESU program, preventing those PCs from signing up to grab the free updates. And because each Windows 10 PC has to be manually enrolled in the program, a broken enrollment process also meant broken security updates.</p>
<p>To fix the problems, Microsoft released an update for Windows 10 22H2 (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/november-11-2025-kb5071959-windows-10-version-22h2-os-build-19045-6466-out-of-band-565c78a7-5b5f-4cbd-8ca8-2a73a48f4e2b">KB5071959</a>) this week that both acknowledges and fixes an issue “where the enrollment wizard may fail during enrollment.” It’s being offered to all Windows 10 PCs regardless of whether they’re enrolled in the ESU program “as it resolves an issue that was preventing affected customers from receiving essential security updates.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/microsoft-releases-update-fixing-update-for-update-eligible-windows-10-pcs/">Read full article</a></p>
