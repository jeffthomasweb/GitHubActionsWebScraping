                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.16 of the Rocket Report! The 10th anniversary of SpaceX’s first Falcon 9 rocket landing is coming up at the end of this year. We’re still waiting for a second company to bring back an orbital-class booster from space for a propulsive landing. Two companies, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and China’s LandSpace, could join SpaceX’s exclusive club as soon as next month. (Bezos might claim <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/679116636310360067">he’s already part of the club</a>, but there’s a distinction to be made.) Each company is in the final stages of launch preparations<span class="s1">—Blue Origin for its second New Glenn rocket, and LandSpace for the debut flight of its Zhuque-3 rocket. Blue Origin and LandSpace will both attempt to land their first stage boosters downrange from their launch sites. They’re not exactly in a race with one another, but it will be fascinating to see how New Glenn and Zhuque-3 perform during the uphill and downhill phases of flight, and whether one or both of the new rockets stick the landing.</span></p>

<p><b>The race for space-based interceptors. </b>The Trump administration’s announcement of the Golden Dome missile defense shield has set off a race among US companies to develop and test space weapons, some of them on their own dime, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/california-startup-to-demonstrate-space-weapon-on-its-own-dime/">Ars reports</a>. One of these companies is a 3-year-old startup named Apex, which announced plans to test a space-based interceptor as soon as next year. Apex’s concept will utilize one of the company’s low-cost satellite platforms outfitted with an “Orbital Magazine” containing multiple interceptors, which will be supplied by an undisclosed third-party partner. The demonstration in low-Earth orbit could launch as soon as June 2026 and will test-fire two interceptors from Apex’s Project Shadow spacecraft. The prototype interceptors could pave the way for operational space-based interceptors to shoot down ballistic missiles.

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI has <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-acquires-software-applications-incorporated/">acquired</a> Software Applications Incorporated (SAI), perhaps best known for the core team that produced what became Shortcuts on Apple platforms. More recently, the team has been working on Sky, a context-aware AI interface layer on top of macOS. The financial terms of the acquisition have not been publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>“AI progress isn’t only about advancing intelligence—it’s about unlocking it through interfaces that understand context, adapt to your intent, and work seamlessly,” an OpenAI rep wrote in the company’s blog post about the acquisition. The post goes on to specify that OpenAI plans to “bring Sky’s deep macOS integration and product craft into ChatGPT, and all members of the team will join OpenAI.”</p>
<p>That includes SAI co-founders Ari Weinstein (CEO), Conrad Kramer (CTO), and Kim Beverett (Product Lead)—all of whom worked together for several years at Apple after Apple acquired Weinstein and Kramer’s previous company, which produced an automation tool called Workflows, to integrate Shortcuts across Apple’s software platforms.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-acquires-the-team-that-made-apples-shortcuts/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Reddit alleged that Perplexity feeds off Reddit and Google, claiming to be “the world’s first answer engine” but really doing “nothing groundbreaking.”</p>
<p>“Its answer engine simply uses a different company’s” large language model “to parse through a massive number of Google search results to see if it can answer a user’s question based on those results,” the lawsuit said. “But Perplexity can only run its ‘answer engine’ by wrongfully accessing and scraping Reddit content appearing in Google’s own search results from Google’s own search engine.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/reddit-sues-to-block-perplexity-from-scraping-google-search-results/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On the surface, it seems obvious that training an LLM with “high quality” data will lead to better performance than feeding it any old “low quality” junk you can find. Now, a group of researchers is attempting to quantify just how much this kind of low quality data can cause an LLM to experience effects akin to human “brain rot.”</p>
<p>For <a href="https://llm-brain-rot.github.io/">a pre-print paper published this month</a>, the researchers from Texas A&amp;M, the University of Texas, and Purdue University drew inspiration from existing research showing how humans who consume “large volumes of trivial and unchallenging online content” can develop problems with attention, memory, and social cognition. That led them to what they’re calling the “LLM brain rot hypothesis,” summed up as the idea that “continual pre-training on junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in LLMs.”</p>
<p>Figuring out what counts as “junk web text” and what counts as “quality content” is far from a simple or fully objective process, of course. But the researchers used a few different metrics to tease a “junk dataset” and “control dataset” from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/enryu43/twitter100m_tweets">HuggingFace’s corpus of 100 million tweets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/researchers-show-that-training-on-junk-data-can-lead-to-llm-brain-rot/">Read full article</a></p>

But the asteroid arrived amid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/new-dates-show-massive-volcanic-eruptions-overlapped-with-dinosaurs-death/">major volcanic eruptions</a> associated with previous mass extinctions. And fossils dating to just before the impact have suggested that dinosaur-dominated ecosystems had become less diverse, making them more prone to collapse.</p>
<p>Now, a new study has revealed that fossils we already know about originated within the last few hundred thousand years before the impact that killed off all dinosaurs except birds. The results indicate that species richness wasn’t likely to be a problem—at least in the neighborhood of the impact itself.</p>
<h2>Wyoming vs. New Mexico</h2>
<p>Most of what we know about the last days of the non-avian dinosaurs comes from the Hell Creek Formation, rich fossil beds in present-day Wyoming. These not only date from within a few hundred thousand years prior to the impact, but there may be deposits that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/scientists-say-they-have-deposits-formed-hours-after-dino-killing-impact/">capture the immediate aftermath</a> of the impact. Beyond this area, which reflects the ecosystem of the northern Great Plains, we have little else. It hasn’t been clear whether the diversity of species present at Hell Creek reflects what was present more globally, or if there were regional differences in ecosystems</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/dinosaurs-may-have-flourished-right-up-to-when-the-asteroid-hit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The director of a federal health institute that has arguably produced two of the most controversial government studies in recent years has accepted a new federal role to advance the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement. Meanwhile, the person replacing him as director is a close friend of Vice President JD Vance and was installed in a process that experts describe as completely outside standard hiring practices.</p>
<p>The series of events—revealed in an email to staff last week from the National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya—is only exacerbating the spiraling fears that science is being deeply corrupted by politics under the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Richard Woychik, a molecular geneticist, is the outgoing director of the NIH’s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), which is located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. He has been director since 2020 and was recently appointed to a second five-year term, according to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/jd-vance-officiated-wedding-new-head-nih-environmental-institute">Science magazine</a>. Woychik was hired at the institute in 2010, when he joined as deputy director, and was appointed acting director in 2019.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/an-nih-director-joins-maha-gets-replaced-by-jd-vances-close-friend/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft said earlier this month that it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsofts-vision-for-ai-pcs-looks-a-lot-like-another-crack-at-cortana/">wanted to add better voice controls to Copilot</a>, Windows 11’s built-in chatbot-slash-virtual assistant. As described, this new version of Copilot sounds an awful lot like another stab at Cortana, the voice assistant that Microsoft tried (and failed) to get people to use in Windows 10 in the mid-to-late 2010s.</p>
<p>Turns out that the company isn’t done trying to reformulate and revive ideas it has already tried before. As part of a push toward what it calls “human-centered AI,” Microsoft is now <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2025/10/23/human-centered-ai/">putting a face on Copilot</a>. Literally, a face: “Mico” is an “expressive, customizable, and warm” blob with a face that dynamically “listens, reacts, and even changes colors to reflect your interactions” as you interact with Copilot. (Another important adjective for Mico: “optional.”)</p>
<p>Mico (rhymes with “pico”) recalls old digital assistants like Clippy, Microsoft Bob, and <a href="https://the-microsoft-windows-xp.fandom.com/wiki/Rover">Rover</a>, ideas that Microsoft tried in the ’90s and early 2000s before mostly abandoning them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsoft-makes-copilot-human-centered-with-a-90s-style-animated-assistant/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Australia’s First Peoples may or may not have hunted the continent’s megafauna to extinction, but they definitely collected fossils.</p>
<p>A team of archaeologists examined the fossilized leg bone of an extinct kangaroo and realized that instead of evidence of butchery, cut marks on the bone reveal an ancient attempt at fossil collecting. That leaves Australia with little evidence of First Peoples hunting or butchering the continent’s extinct megafauna—and reopens the question of whether humans were responsible for the die-off of that continent’s giant Ice Age marsupials.</p>
<h2>Fossil hunting in the Ice Age</h2>
<p>In the unsolved case of whether humans hunted Australia’s Ice Age megafauna to extinction, the key piece of evidence so far is a tibia (one of the bones of the lower leg) from an extinct short-faced kangaroo. Instead of hopping like their modern relatives, these extinct kangaroos walked on their hind legs, probably placing all their weight on the tips of single hoofed toes. This particular kangaroo wasn’t quite fully grown when it died, which happened sometime between 44,500 and 55,200 years ago, based on uranium-series dating of the thin layer of rock covering most of the fossils in Mammoth Cave (in what’s now Western Australia).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/the-first-people-to-set-foot-in-australia-were-fossil-hunters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>From the outside, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> looks a lot like a game that’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/is-counter-strike-2s-new-match-abandonment-penalty-too-harsh/">primarily about shooting people</a>. For millions of players, though, the game is more about collecting and/or buying rare in-game loot and flipping it for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/ultra-rare-csgo-gun-reportedly-sells-for-over-400000/">what can be very significant sums on the Steam Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Wednesday night, Valve sent that multi-billion-dollar market into turmoil as part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004?l=english">a so-called “small update.”</a> Now, players can use the game’s “Trade Up contracts” to exchange five common, “Covert” items (also known as “reds”) for the kinds of knives and gloves that have until now been much harder to obtain.</p>
<p>That “small update” has unsurprisingly had an immediate and sharp impact on the Marketplace price for those items. One rare knife that sold for over $14,000 less than 24 hours ago <a href="https://pricempire.com/cs2-items/skin/karambit-doppler-ruby">has seen its minimum price plummet over 50 percent</a> as of this writing, according to the trackers at Pricempire. Meanwhile, the median sale price for a common P90 Asimov gun on the Steam Marketplace shot up from $10 on Wednesday to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/P90%20%7C%20Asiimov%20%28Field-Tested%29">well over $100 as of this writing</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/valve-upends-the-cs2-item-marketplace-with-new-trade-up-update/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Ferrari provided flights from Washington, DC, to Austin, Texas, and accommodation so Ars could attend the Lone Star Le Mans. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/the-2023-ferrari-296-gts-we-drive-ferraris-plug-in-hybrid-convertible/">first time I drove</a> this generation of mid-engined Ferrari, it was on a curated route on the company’s home turf. As the Po Valley gives way to the Apennines, you find plenty of narrow winding roads, steep gradients, and hairpin turns. It was an engaging few hours of driving, but it was too brief to properly assess some of the 296’s technology. I found the ride firm but comfortable on rough Italian tarmac and the hybrid system easy to operate, flicking into calm-and-quiet electric-only mode through the villages I encountered.</p>
<p>That was back in 2022 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/the-499p-meet-ferraris-beautiful-new-le-mans-hybrid-prototype/">during the unveiling</a> of Ferrari’s 499P race car. Last month, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/behind-the-scenes-with-the-most-beautiful-car-in-racing-the-ferrari-499p/">I met the 499P again</a> as it visited the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, along with the rest of the World Endurance Championship. And that afforded another chance to get to know the 296, with three days rather than three hours to form an impression.</p>
<p>Head west from Austin and you’ll find twisty roads that wrap around the hills. It would have been easy to spend an entire day out there, but that seemed repetitive—I’d experienced the 296’s back road behavior already. Plus, there were things to do at the racetrack, although I’ll admit I took the long way there and back each day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/great-hybrid-v6-lousy-hmi-three-days-with-a-ferrari-296-gtb/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is eyeing taking equity stakes in quantum computing firms in exchange for federal funding, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/entrepreneurship/trump-administration-in-talks-to-take-equity-stakes-in-quantum-computing-firms-60ee5143">reported</a>.</p>
<p>At least five companies are weighing whether allowing the government to become a shareholder would be worth it to snag funding that the Trump administration has “earmarked for promising technology companies,” sources familiar with the potential deals told the WSJ.</p>
<p>IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are currently in talks with the government over potential funding agreements, with minimum awards of $10 million each, some sources said. Quantum Computing Inc. and Atom Computing are reportedly “considering similar arrangements,” as are other companies in the sector, which is viewed as critical for scientific advancements and next-generation technologies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trumps-industry-meddling-may-give-us-a-stake-in-quantum-computing-firms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> was the company’s most interesting new iPhone this year, at least insofar as it was the one most different from previous iPhones. We came away impressed by its size and weight <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/iphone-air-review-apples-different-est-phone-in-years-is-appealing-despite-itself/">in our review</a>. But early reports suggest that its novelty might not be translating into sales success.</p>
<p>A note from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, whose supply chain sources are often accurate about Apple’s future plans, <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1981051589000671742">said yesterday</a> that demand for the iPhone Air “has fallen short of expectations” and that “both shipments and production capacity” were being scaled back to account for the lower-than-expected demand.</p>
<p>Kuo’s note is backed up by reports from other analysts at Mizuho Securities (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/iphone-air-production-to-be-cut-amid-lower-sales/">via MacRumors</a>) and <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/apple-slashes-iphone-air-production-plans-boosts-other-17-models-sources">Nikkei Asia</a>. Both of these reports say that demand for the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro models remains strong, indicating that this is <em>just</em> a problem for the iPhone Air and not a wider slowdown caused by tariffs or other external factors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/early-indicators-analyst-reports-suggest-apples-iphone-air-isnt-taking-off/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PgcAIgpwPA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>We’ve got a new international trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator:_Badlands"><em>Predator: Badlands</em></a>, the latest installment in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_(franchise)">popular franchise</a> that’s been around since 1987. It’s directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who is very familiar with the franchise, having also directed 2022’s highly acclaimed standalone Predator movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey_(2022_film)"><em>Prey</em></a>.</p>
<p>In April, Twentieth Century Studios released <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/elle-fanning-teams-up-with-a-predator-in-first-predator-badlands-trailer/">the first teaser</a>, which involved multiple predators fighting or threatening one another, Elle Fanning looking very strange and cool as an android, and glimpses of new monsters and the alien world the movie focuses on. And the film was featured prominently at San Diego Comic-Con this summer. But it hasn’t quite wormed its way into the cultural zeitgeist for fall releases. Perhaps this latest trailer will boost its profile.</p>
<p>This is a standalone film in the franchise, with a particular focus on the culture of the Predator species; in fact, the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_creators">conlanger</a> who created the Na’Vi language for James Cameron’s Avatar franchise also created a written and verbal language for the Predators. (We hear a bit of the dialogue in the new trailer.) And this time around, the primary Predator is actually the film’s protagonist rather than an adversary. Per the official premise: “Set in the future on a deadly remote planet, <em>Predator: Badlands</em> follows a young Predator outcast (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) who finds an unlikely ally in Thia (Elle Fanning) as he embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/an-outcast-faces-a-deadly-alien-world-in-predator-badlands-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Have you heard the news that Texas’ senators want to chop up NASA’s retired space shuttle <em>Discovery</em> in order to move it from the Smithsonian to Houston? The lawmakers in question have and are now crying foul to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), together with Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas), on Wednesday sent a letter to the DOJ <a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-102225a-space-shuttle-discovery-smithsonian-doj-anti-lobbying-letter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urging the Smithsonian be investigated</a> for allegedly violating the Anti-Lobbying Act. They claim that the institution—<em>Discovery</em>‘s home for the past 13 years—improperly used appropriated funds to influence Congress regarding the relocation of the winged orbiter.</p>
<p>“Public reporting suggests the Smithsonian Institution has taken affirmative steps to oppose the passage and implementation of the shuttle’s relocation, as part of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” wrote Cornyn and Cruz to Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate. “These steps include lobbying the staff of the Senate Appropriations and Rules Committees to express disapproval, coordinating with members of the press to generate public opposition to the law’s passage and disseminating misinformation about the cost and logistics of the move.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/texas-lawmakers-double-down-on-discovery-call-for-doj-investigation-into-smithsonian/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Defense contractors are in full sales mode to win a piece of a potentially trillion-dollar pie for development of the Trump administration’s proposed Golden Dome missile shield.</p>
<p>CEOs are touting their companies’ ability to rapidly spool up satellite, sensor, and rocket production. Publicly, they all agree with the assertion of Pentagon officials that US industry already possesses the technologies required to make a homeland missile defense system work.</p>
<p>The challenge, they say, is tying all of it together under the umbrella of a sophisticated command and control network. Sensors must be able to detect and track missile threats, and that information must rapidly get to weapons that can shoot them down. Gen. Chance Saltzman, the Space Force’s top commander, likes to call Golden Dome a “systems of systems.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/california-startup-to-demonstrate-space-weapon-on-its-own-dime/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openais-new-atlas-web-browser-wants-to-let-you-chat-with-a-page/">announced Atlas</a>, a new web browser with ChatGPT integration, to let you “chat with a page,” as the company puts it. But Atlas also goes beyond the usual LLM back-and-forth with Agent Mode, a “preview mode” feature the company says can “get work done for you” by clicking, scrolling, and reading through various tabs.</p>
<p>“Agentic” AI is far from new, of course; OpenAI itself rolled out <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/">a preview of the web browsing Operator agent in January</a> and introduced <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/">the more generalized “ChatGPT agent” in July</a>. Still, prominently featuring this capability in a major product release like this—even in “preview mode”—signals a clear push to get this kind of system in front of end users.</p>
<p>I wanted to put Atlas’ Agent Mode through its paces to see if it could really save me time in doing the kinds of tedious online tasks I plod through every day. In each case, I’ll outline a web-based problem, lay out the Agent Mode prompt I devised to try to solve it, and describe the results. My final evaluation will rank each task on a 10-point scale, with 10 being “did exactly what I wanted with no problems” and one being “complete failure.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/10/we-let-openais-agent-mode-surf-the-web-for-us-heres-what-happened/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The makers of BIND, the Internet’s most widely used software for resolving domain names, are warning of two vulnerabilities that allow attackers to poison entire caches of results and send users to malicious destinations that are indistinguishable from the real ones.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities, tracked as <a href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2025-40778">CVE-2025-40778</a> and <a href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2025-40780">CVE-2025-40780</a>, stem from a logic error and a weakness in generating pseudo-random numbers, respectively. They each carry a severity rating of 8.6. Separately, makers of the Domain Name System resolver software Unbound <a href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2025-11411.txt">warned</a> of similar vulnerabilities that were reported by the same researchers. The unbound vulnerability severity score is 5.6</p>
<h2>Revisiting Kaminsky’s cache poisoning attack</h2>
<p>The vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause DNS resolvers located inside thousands of organizations to replace valid results for domain lookups with corrupted ones. The corrupted results would replace the IP addresses controlled by the domain name operator (for instance, 3.15.119.63 for arstechnica.com) with malicious ones controlled by the attacker. Patches for all three vulnerabilities became available on Wednesday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/bind-warns-of-bugs-that-could-bring-dns-cache-attack-back-from-the-dead/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2025 this afternoon. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-reverses-sales-decline-in-q3-sells-50k-more-cars-than-it-built/">Earlier this month</a>, we learned that the electric vehicle manufacturer had a pretty good Q3 in terms of sales, which grew by 7.3 percent year over year and cleared out tens of thousands of cars from inventory in the process. However, that hasn’t translated into greater profitability.</p>
<p>Even though revenues grew by 12 percent to $28 billion compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/teslas-q3-buoyed-by-credits-cost-cutting-as-auto-revenue-stays-flat/">the same period last year</a>, Tesla’s operating expenses grew by 50 percent. As a result, its operating margin halved to just 5.8 percent. And so its profit for the quarter fell by 37 percent to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Some growth in revenue came from its battery and solar division; this increased by 44 percent to $3.4 billion compared to Q3 2024. Services—including the Supercharger network, which is now open to an increasing number of other makes of EV—also grew, increasing by 25 percent to $3.4 billion. EV deliveries increased by 7 percent to 497,099, most of which were the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover. Automotive revenues grew slightly less, increasing 6 percent year over year to $21.2 billion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-profits-fall-37-in-q3-despite-healthy-sales/">Read full article</a></p>
