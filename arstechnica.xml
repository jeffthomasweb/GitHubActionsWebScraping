<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington to Munich and accommodation so Ars could be briefed about the A5, as well as two other models you can read about in the coming weeks. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>MUNICH—Although the world's automakers are in the midst of a great electrification, some of the more ambitious timelines for ditching the internal combustion engine are now looking quite unrealistic. That's due to a number of factors, but the relative lack of charging infrastructure and the still-high cost of lithium-ion batteries are both contributors. With ICE still on the menu for at least the next decade, Audi has developed a new platform, and the first model to debut will be the next Audi A5, due in US dealerships by next summer.</p>
<h2>Now it’s a sedan</h2>
<p>Audi's long-term model nomenclature recently went through a bit of a change. In the past, even-numbered cars like the A4, A6, and A8 were (mostly) sedans, and odd-numbered models (the A5 and A7) were different body styles, including five-door fastbacks—known as sportbacks in Audi-speak—but also coupes and convertibles. (The exception to this has been the station wagon variants, <em>aka</em> Avants, which were A4s and A6s.)</p>
<p>Forget all that. From now on, all even-numbered Audis are battery-electric vehicles, with odd-numbered Audi designations reserved for gas, diesel, and hybrid cars. (The same applies to the Q-designated SUVs and crossovers, but more on those in a few weeks.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036784#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036784&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Isaac Newton would never have discovered the laws of motion had he studied only cats.</p>
<p>Suppose you hold a cat, stomach up, and drop it from a second-story window. If a cat is simply a mechanical system that obeys Newton’s rules of matter in motion, it should land on its back. (OK, there are some technicalities—like this should be done in a vacuum, but ignore that for now.) Instead, most cats usually avoid injury by twisting themselves on the way down to land on their feet.</p>
<p>Most people are not mystified by this trick—everybody has seen videos attesting to cats’ acrobatic prowess. But for more than a century, scientists have wondered about the physics of how cats do it. Clearly, the mathematical theorem analyzing the falling cat as a mechanical system <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04565">fails for live cats</a>, as Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek points out in a recent paper.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036947#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036947&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During their summit in Washington, DC, this week, NATO member states committed more than $1 billion to improve the sharing of intelligence from national and commercial reconnaissance satellites.</p>
<p>The agreement is a further step toward integrating space assets into NATO military commands. It follows the bloc's adoption of an official space policy in 2019, which recognized space as a fifth war-fighting domain alongside air, land, maritime, and cyberspace. The next step was the formation of the NATO Space Operations Center in 2020 to oversee space support for NATO military operations.</p>
<p>On June 25, NATO announced the establishment of a "space branch" in its Allied Command Transformation, which identifies trends and incorporates emerging capabilities into the alliance's security strategy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036686#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036686&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google is making it easier for people to lock down their accounts with strong multifactor authentication by adding the option to store secure cryptographic keys in the form of passkeys rather than on physical token devices.</p>
<p>Google’s Advanced Protection Program, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/googles-strongest-security-those-who-need-it-most/">introduced</a> in 2017, requires the strongest form of multifactor authentication (MFA). Whereas many forms of MFA rely on one-time passcodes sent through SMS or emails or generated by authenticator apps, accounts enrolled in advanced protection require MFA based on cryptographic keys stored on a secure physical device. Unlike one-time passcodes, security keys stored on physical devices are immune to credential phishing and can’t be copied or sniffed.</p>
<h2>Democratizing APP</h2>
<p>APP, short for Advanced Protection Program, requires the key to be accompanied by a password whenever a user logs into an account on a new device. The protection prevents the types of account takeovers that allowed Kremlin-backed hackers to access the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/russia-linked-phishing-campaign-behind-the-dnc-breach-also-hit-podesta-powell/">Gmail accounts of Democratic officials</a> in 2016 and go on to leak stolen emails to interfere with the presidential election that year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036985#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036985&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">OpenAI recently unveiled a five-tier system to gauge its advancement toward developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to an OpenAI spokesperson who spoke with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/openai-sets-levels-to-track-progress-toward-superintelligent-ai">Bloomberg</a>. The company shared this new classification system on Tuesday with employees during an all-hands meeting, aiming to provide a clear framework for understanding AI advancement. However, the system describes hypothetical technology that does not yet exist and is possibly best interpreted as a marketing move to garner investment dollars.</p>

<p>OpenAI has previously stated that AGI—a nebulous term for a hypothetical concept that means an AI system that can perform novel tasks like a human without specialized training—is currently the <a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/">primary goal</a> of the company. The pursuit of technology that can replace humans at most intellectual work drives most of the enduring hype over the firm, even though such a technology would likely be wildly disruptive to society.</p>
<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has previously <a href="https://time.com/6342827/ceo-of-the-year-2023-sam-altman/">stated his belief</a> that AGI could be achieved within this decade, and a large part of the CEO's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ai-technology-can-go-quite-wrong-openai-ceo-tells-senate/">public messaging</a> has been related to how the company (and society in general) might handle the disruption that AGI may bring. Along those lines, a ranking system to communicate AI milestones achieved internally on the path to AGI makes sense.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036853#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036853&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the ancient Chinese game of <em>Go</em>, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence has generally been able to defeat the best human players <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/google-ai-begins-battle-with-humanitys-best-go-player-tonight/">since at least 2016</a>. But in the last few years, researchers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/new-go-playing-trick-defeats-world-class-go-ai-but-loses-to-human-amateurs/">discovered flaws in these top-level AI <em>Go</em> algorithms</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/man-beats-machine-at-go-in-human-victory-over-ai/">give humans a fighting chance</a>. By using unorthodox "cyclic" strategies—ones that even a beginning human player could detect and defeat—a crafty human can often exploit gaps in a top-level AI's strategy and fool the algorithm into a loss.</p>
<p>Researchers at MIT and <a href="https://far.ai/">FAR AI</a> wanted to see if they could improve this "worst case" performance in otherwise "superhuman" AI Go algorithms, testing a trio of methods to harden the top-level <a href="https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo">KataGo algorithm</a>'s defenses against adversarial attacks. The results show that creating truly robust, unexploitable AIs may be difficult, even in areas as tightly controlled as board games.</p>
<h2>Three failed strategies</h2>
<p>In the pre-print paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12843">"Can <em>Go</em> AIs be adversarially robust?"</a>, the researchers aim to create a <em>Go</em> AI that is truly "robust" against any and all attacks. That means an algorithm that can't be fooled into "game-losing blunders that a human would not commit" but also one that would require any competing AI algorithm to spend significant computing resources to defeat it. Ideally, a robust algorithm should also be able to overcome potential exploits by using additional computing resources when confronted with unfamiliar situations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036897#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036897&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The German Navy is working on modernizing its <a href="https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/ausruestung-technik-bundeswehr/seesysteme-bundeswehr/brandenburg-klasse-f123-fregatte">Brandenburg-class F123 frigates</a>, which means ending their reliance on 8-inch floppy disks.</p>
<p>The F123 frigates use floppy disks for their onboard data acquisition (DAQ) systems, as noted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/german-navy-aims-to-replace-aging-8-inch-floppy-drives-with-an-emulated-solution-for-its-anti-submarine-frigates">Tom’s Hardware</a> on Thursday. <a href="https://augengeradeaus.net/2024/07/modernisierung-der-brandenburg-klasse-mach-mir-eine-floppy/">Augen geradeaus!</a>, a German defense and security policy blog by journalist <a href="https://wiegold.de/bio/">Thomas Wiegold</a>, notes that DAQs are important for controlling frigates, including power generation, "because the operating parameters have to be recorded," per a Google translation. The ships themselves specialize in anti-submarine warfare and air defense.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Augen geradeaus! spotted a tender for service published June 21 by Germany's Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology, and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) to modernize the German Navy's four F123 frigates. The ships were commissioned from October 1994 to December 1996. As noted by German IT news outlet <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/opinion/Floppy-disk-drive-wanted-Why-the-Navy-defends-the-country-with-floppy-disks-9796441.html">Heise</a>, the continued use of 8-inch floppies despite modern alternatives being available for years "has to do with the fact that established systems are considered more reliable.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036848#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036848&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The launch date for the Europa Clipper mission to study the intriguing moon orbiting Jupiter, which ranks alongside the Cassini spacecraft to Saturn as NASA's most expensive and ambitious planetary science mission, is now in doubt.</p>
<p>The $4.25 billion spacecraft had been due to launch in October on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. However, NASA revealed that transistors on board the spacecraft may not be as radiation-hardened as they were believed to be.</p>
<p>"The issue with the transistors came to light in May when the mission team was advised that similar parts were failing at lower radiation doses than expected," the space agency wrote <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/europaclipper/2024/07/11/nasa-continues-assessing-electrical-switches-on-europa-clipper/">in a blog post</a> Thursday afternoon. "In June 2024, an industry alert was sent out to notify users of this issue. The manufacturer is working with the mission team to support ongoing radiation test and analysis efforts in order to better understand the risk of using these parts on the Europa Clipper spacecraft."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036841#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036841&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T today said a breach on a third-party cloud platform exposed the call and text records of nearly all its cellular customers. The leaked data is said to include phone numbers that AT&amp;T subscribers communicated with, but not names.</p>
<p>An AT&amp;T spokesperson confirmed to Ars that the data was exposed in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/hackers-steal-significant-volume-of-data-from-hundreds-of-snowflake-customers/">recently reported attack</a> on "AI data cloud" provider Snowflake, which also affected Ticketmaster and many other companies. As previously reported, Snowflake was compromised by a group that obtained login credentials through information-stealing malware.</p>

<p>The basic outline of the interactions between modern humans and Neanderthals is now well established. The two came in contact as modern humans began their major expansion out of Africa, which occurred roughly 60,000 years ago. Humans picked up some Neanderthal DNA through interbreeding, while the Neanderthal population, always fairly small, was swept away by the waves of new arrivals.</p>
<p>But there are some aspects of this big-picture view that don't entirely line up with the data. While it nicely explains the fact that Neanderthal sequences are far more common in non-African populations, it doesn't account for the fact that every African population we've looked at has some DNA that matches up with Neanderthal DNA.</p>
<p>A study published on Thursday argues that much of this match came about because an early modern human population also left Africa and interbred with Neanderthals. But in this case, the result was to introduce modern human DNA to the Neanderthal population. The study shows that this DNA accounts for a lot of Neanderthals' genetic diversity, suggesting that their population was even smaller than earlier estimates had suggested.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036663#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036663&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Analogue has released multiple variations of the Analogue Pocket, its Game Boy-style handheld console that can play old cartridges and game ROMs using its FPGA chip. But until now, all of those designs have been riffs on the regular Pocket’s black (or white) plastic shell.</p>
<p>The company’s latest Pocket iteration might appeal more to people who prefer the solidity and durability of anodized aluminum to the cheap practicality of plastic. <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1811777618447888740">On July 15</a>, the company will release <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum">a limited run of all-aluminum Analogue Pocket consoles</a> in four different colors: white, gray, black, and a Game Boy Advance-esque indigo. The company says that "every single piece" of these consoles is "entirely CNC'd from aluminum," including not just the frame but also all of the buttons.</p>
<p>The new material will cost you, though: Each aluminum Pocket sells for $500, over twice as much as the $220 price of a regular plastic Pocket.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036791#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036791&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple is struggling to attract fresh content for its innovative Vision Pro headset, with just a fraction of the apps available when compared with the number of developers created for the iPhone and iPad in their first few months.</p>
<p>The lack of a “killer app” to encourage customers to pay upwards of $3,500 for an unproven new product is seen as a problem for Apple, as the Vision Pro goes on sale in Europe on Friday.</p>
<p>Apple said recently that there were “more than 2,000” apps available for its “spatial computing” device, five months after it debuted in the US.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036823#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036823&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Studios has dropped the first teaser for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Brave_New_World"><em>Captain America: Brave New World</em></a>, star Anthony Mackie's first cinematic appearance as the new Captain America after the Phase Four 2021 TV miniseries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falcon_and_the_Winter_Soldier"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>. This is the fifth film in the MCU's Phase Five, directed by Julius Onah (<em>The Cloverfield Paradox</em>) and building on events not just in <em>F&amp;WS</em> but also the 2008 film <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>. The teaser feels like a half-superhero movie, half-political thriller, and with the tantalizing introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hulk">Red Hulk</a>, it promises to be an entertaining ride.</p>

Sam and Bucky had to grapple with losing Steve and the burden of his legacy. Meanwhile, the US government had named its own new Captain America, John Walker (Wyatt Russell), a decorated veteran and ultimate "good soldier" who thought he could better embody "American values" than Rogers.  </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036757#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036757&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I know how to solder, but I do not always want to solder, and I think there are a lot of folks like me. Even if the act itself can be done (and undone, and redone), the friction of hauling out the gear, preparing a space, and fine-motor-skilling a perfect shiny blob can put a halt to one's tinkering ambitions.</p>

<p>Arduino, the building block of many off-hours projects, has put the challenge to you, your kids, or anyone you know who just needs the right kit to fall down a rabbit hole, minus a dangerously hot iron. The <a href="https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/plug-and-make-kit?selectedStore=us">Arduino Plug and Make Kit</a> has at its core an Arduino UNO R4 board with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a built-in 12×8 LED matrix display. That board gets screwed into the prime lot on a yellow board, and then you pick from among seven other "Modulino" boards to attach. By "attach," I mean running one of those little push-in-with-your-fingers cables from the main board to a little board, and maybe daisy-chaining from there. All your boards fit onto the larger base with M3 screws and nuts, and the whole thing is powered by a USB-C cable (with USB A or C on the other end).</p>

<p>What can you plug in? A knob, eight LEDs, a proximity sensor, a motion sensor, a simple buzzer/speaker, a temperature/humidity sensor, and three simple buttons. With those things, the newcomer can make a low-key weather station, an 8-bit-style synthesizer, a smart lamp controller, and <a href="https://courses.arduino.cc/plugandmake/">a few other things</a> (registration required). Of course, those are just the starter projects put together by Arduino; on the web, in the corners of GitHub, and inside the curious mind, there are loads of other things to be built.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036761#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036761&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Driver assists that help steer for you on the highway haven't contributed much to road safety, according <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/bibliography/ref/2309">to a new study</a> from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute. That's in contrast to other features often bundled together as "advanced driver assistance systems," or ADAS, many of which have shown a marked reduction in crash and claim rates.</p>
<p>"Everything we’re seeing tells us that partial automation is a convenience feature like power windows or heated seats rather than a safety technology," said David Harkey, IIHS president.</p>
<p>However, we should note that, as a follow-up to a pair of earlier studies published in 2021, the new research by IIHS and HLDI focused on two older partially automated driving systems, model-year 2017–2019 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/the-2018-nissan-rogue-review-wildly-popular-but-room-for-improvement/">Nissan Rogues</a> with ProPilot Assist and model year 2013–2017 BMWs with Driving Assistant Plus.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036773#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036773&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's overhaul of the Twitter verification system deceives users and violates the Digital Services Act, the European Commission said today in an announcement of preliminary findings that could lead to a big financial penalty.</p>
<p>The social media platform now called X "designs and operates its interface for the 'verified accounts' with the 'Blue checkmark' in a way that does not correspond to industry practice and deceives users," <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_3761">the EU regulator said</a>. "Since anyone can subscribe to obtain such a 'verified' status, it negatively affects users' ability to make free and informed decisions about the authenticity of the accounts and the content they interact with. There is evidence of motivated malicious actors abusing the 'verified account' to deceive users."</p>
<p>Blue checkmarks "used to mean trustworthy sources of information," Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said. The EC said it "informed X of its preliminary view that it is in breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA) in areas linked to dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access for researchers."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036765#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036765&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the early 2000s, local fossil collector Mohamed ‘Ou Said’ Ben Moula discovered numerous fossils at Fezouata Shale, a site in Morocco known for its well-preserved fossils from the Early Ordovician period, roughly 480 million years ago. Recently, a team of researchers at the University of Lausanne (UNIL) studied 100 of these fossils and identified one of them as the earliest ancestor of modern-day chelicerates, a group that includes spiders, scorpions, and horseshoe crabs.</p>
<p>The fossil preserves the species <i>Setapedites abundantis</i>, a tiny animal that crawled and swam near the bottom of a 100–200-meter-deep ocean near the South Pole 478 million years ago. It was 5 to 10 millimeters long and fed on organic matter in the seafloor sediments. “Fossils of what is now known as <i>S. abundantis</i> have been found early on—one specimen mentioned in the 2010 paper that recognized the importance of this biota. However, this creature wasn’t studied in detail before simply because scientists focused on other taxa first,” Pierre Gueriau, one of the researchers and a junior lecturer at UNIL, told Ars Technica.</p>
<p>The study from Gueriau and his team is the first to describe <i>S. abundantis </i>and its connection to modern-day chelicerates (also called euchelicerates). It holds great significance, because “the origin of chelicerates has been one of the most tangled knots in the arthropod tree of life, as there has been a lack of fossils between 503 to 430 million years ago,” Gueriau added.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036532#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036532&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <p><em><p><em><a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781538181614/Rescuing-Science-Restoring-Trust-In-an-Age-of-Doubt">Rescuing Science: Restoring Trust in an Age of Doubt</a></em> was the most difficult book I've ever written. I'm a cosmologist—I study the origins, structure, and evolution of the Universe. I love science. I live and breathe science. If science were a breakfast cereal, I'd eat it every morning. And at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I watched in alarm as public trust in science disintegrated.
</p>
<p>But I don't know how to change people's minds. I don't know how to convince someone to trust science again. So as I started writing my book, I flipped the question around: is there anything we can do to make the institution of science more worthy of trust?
</p>
<p>The short answer is yes. The long answer takes an entire book. In the book, I explore several different sources of mistrust—the disincentives scientists face when they try to communicate with the public, the lack of long-term careers, the complicitness of scientists when their work is politicized, and much more—and offer proactive steps we can take to address these issues to rebuild trust.
</p>
<p>The section below is taken from a chapter discussing the relentless pressure to publish that scientists face, and the corresponding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8">explosion in fraud</a> that this pressure creates. Fraud can take many forms, from the "hard fraud" of outright fabrication of data, to many kinds of "soft fraud" that include plagiarism, manipulation of data, and careful selection of methods to achieve a desired result. The more that fraud thrives, the more that the public loses trust in science. Addressing this requires a fundamental shift in the incentive and reward structures that scientists work in. A difficult task to be sure, but not an impossible one—and one that I firmly believe will be worth the effort.</p></em></p>
    

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Modern science is hard, complex, and built from many layers and many years of hard work. And modern science, almost everywhere, is based on computation. Save for a few (and I mean very few) die-hard theorists who insist on writing things down with pen and paper, there is almost an absolute guarantee that with any paper in any field of science that you could possibly read, a computer was involved in some step of the process.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img right medium"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9781538181614.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9781538181614-300x463.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9781538181614.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9781538181614.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow"></a> </p></div>
<p>Whether it’s studying bird droppings or the collisions of galaxies, modern-day science owes its very existence—and continued persistence—to the computer. From the laptop sitting on an unkempt desk to a giant machine that fills up a room, “S. Transistor” should be the coauthor on basically all three million journal articles published every year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030357#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030357&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.02 of the Rocket Report! The highlight of this week was the hugely successful debut of Europe's Ariane 6 rocket. They will address the upper stage issue, I am sure. Given Europe's commitment to zero debris, stranding the second stage is not great. But for a debut launch of a large new vehicle, this was really promising.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese launch company suffers another setback</strong>. Chinese commercial rocket firm iSpace suffered a launch failure late Wednesday in a fresh setback for the company, <a href="https://spacenews.com/chinese-commercial-rocket-firm-suffers-4th-launch-failure/">Space News reports</a>. The four-stage Hyperbola-1 solid rocket lifted off from Jiuquan spaceport in the Gobi Desert at 7:40 pm ET (23:40 UTC) on Wednesday. Beijing-based iSpace later issued a release stating that the rocket’s fourth stage suffered an anomaly. The statement did not reveal the name nor nature of the payloads lost on the flight.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036368#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036368&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
