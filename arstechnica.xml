              <![CDATA[<p>Subscribers to Prime Video's ad tier will start seeing more commercials next year, further testing how much advertising streamers will tolerate.</p>
<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f8112991-820c-4e09-bcf4-23b5e0f190a5">Financial Times</a> today, Kelly Day, VP of Prime Video International, said that Amazon will offer more Prime Video ad slots to advertisers next year. She didn't get into specifics but confirmed that Prime Video's ad load would "ramp up a little bit more into 2025."</p>
<p>In January, when Amazon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-jacks-up-price-of-ad-free-prime-video-by-2-99-starting-in-2024/">launched Prime Video's ad tier</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/amazon-is-now-charging-prime-members-extra-for-ad-free-streaming-for-some-thats-a-deal-breaker-068d4896">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported that subscribers would see an average of between two and three-and-a-half minutes of ads per hour. Day told FT today that upon launch, Prime Video with ads was given a "very light ad load," providing subscribers “gentle entry into advertising that has exceeded customers expectations in terms of what the ad experience would be like." The executive pointed out that Prime Video with ads doesn't show commercials in the middle of content. That could change next year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazon-prime-video-is-getting-more-ads-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Attackers are actively exploiting a critical vulnerability in mail servers sold by Zimbra in an attempt to remotely execute malicious commands that install a backdoor, researchers warn.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-45519, resides in the Zimbra email and collaboration server used by medium and large organizations. When an admin manually changes default settings to enable the postjournal service, attackers can execute commands by sending maliciously formed emails to an address hosted on the server. Zimbra recently <a href="https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories">patched the vulnerability</a>. All Zimbra users should install it or, at a minimum, ensure that postjournal is disabled.</p>
<h2>Easy, yes, but reliable?</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Security researcher Ivan Kwiatkowski <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@justicerage/113231837285277188">first reported</a> the in-the-wild attacks, which he described as “mass exploitation.” He said the malicious emails were sent by the IP address 79.124.49[.]86 and, when successful, attempted to run a file hosted there using the tool known as curl. Researchers from security firm Proofpoint took to social media later that day to confirm the report.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/attackers-exploit-critical-vulnerability-recently-patched-in-zimbra-servers/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Two Harvard students recently <a href="https://x.com/AnhPhuNguyen1/status/1840786336992682409">revealed</a> that it's possible to combine Meta smart glasses with face image search technology to "reveal anyone's personal details," including their name, address, and phone number, "just from looking at them."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iWCqmaOUKhKjcKSktIwC3NNANoFP7vPsRvcbOIup_BA/preview">Google document</a>, AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio explained how they linked a pair of Meta Ray Bans 2 to an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/search-engine-that-scans-billions-of-faces-tries-blocking-kids-from-results">invasive face search engine called PimEyes</a> to help identify strangers by cross-searching their information on various people-search databases. They then used a large language model (LLM) to rapidly combine all that data, making it possible to dox someone in a glance or surface information to scam someone in seconds—or other nefarious uses, such as "some dude could just find some girl’s home address on the train and just follow them home,” Nguyen <a href="https://www.404media.co/someone-put-facial-recognition-tech-onto-metas-smart-glasses-to-instantly-dox-strangers/">told 404 Media</a>.</p>
<p>This is all possible thanks to recent progress with LLMs, the students said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/harvard-students-make-auto-doxxing-smart-glasses-to-show-need-for-privacy-regs/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI, the company behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, has now raised $6.6 billion in a new funding round that values the company at $157 billion, nearly doubling its previous valuation of $86 billion, according to a report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-157-billion-in-funding-round-ee220607">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>The funding round comes with strings attached: Investors have the right to withdraw their money if OpenAI does not complete its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openai-plans-tectonic-shift-from-nonprofit-to-for-profit-giving-altman-equity/">planned conversion</a> from a nonprofit (with a for-profit division) to a fully for-profit company.</p>
<p>Venture capital firm Thrive Capital led the funding round with a $1.25 billion investment. Microsoft, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/regulators-arent-convinced-that-microsoft-and-openai-operate-independently/">longtime backer</a> of OpenAI to the tune of $13 billion, contributed just under $1 billion to the latest round.

            <![CDATA["Clients and artists have a right to know what's in the inks they are using.”]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Recently, chemists at Binghamton University learned that many tattoo inks in the US contain different pigments than those listed, or unlisted additives. One might expect the European Union, with its stricter regulations, to have fewer issues on that score, but according to a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/an/d4an00793j">new paper</a> published in the journal Analyst, that's not the case, particularly for green and blue tattoo inks. Most had components that were not listed on the label, and some included banned ingredients.</p>
<p>"Our work cannot say anything about the safety of tattoos, but we think it's an important first step in addressing the question 'Are tattoos safe?'" <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1059872">said co-author John Swierk</a>, a chemist at Binghamton University. "If we don't know what's in a bottle of tattoo ink, then we cannot figure out what might be causing an adverse event in the near and long term, whether that’s an allergic reaction or something more serious. As a team, we aren't anti-tattoo, we just believe that clients and artists have a right to know what's in the inks they are using."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/caveat-emptor-90-of-tattoo-inks-have-unlabeled-or-mislabeled-ingredients/">previously</a> reported, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/whats-in-that-tattoo-ink-labels-are-often-inaccurate-study-finds/">typical tattoo ink</a> contains one or more pigments (which give the ink its color) within a "carrier package" to help deliver the pigments into the skin. The pigments are the same as those used in paints and textiles. They can be either small bits of solids or discrete molecules, such as titanium dioxide or iron oxide (for white or rust-brown colors, respectively). As for the carrier packages, most ink manufacturers use grain or rubbing alcohol, sometimes with a bit of witch hazel added to the mix to help the skin heal after the tattooing process. There may also be other additives to adjust the viscosity and keep pigment particles suspended in the carrier package.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/despite-stricter-regulations-europe-has-issues-with-tattoo-ink-ingredients/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's push to get Windows and Office users to buy Microsoft 365 subscriptions can be irritating, but to the company's credit, it's one of the few that has continued to sell buy-once, use-forever versions of its flagship software after launching a subscription model. This week the company has officially launched <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/09/30/office-2024-for-consumers-available-october-1/">Microsoft Office 2024</a>, a new "locked-in-time" update to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other apps for people who don't want the continuously developed Microsoft 365 versions.</p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed charges against Amazon, alleging that the e-commerce giant has illegally refused to bargain with a union representing drivers who are frustrated by what they claim are low wages and dangerous working conditions.</p>
<p>Back in August, drivers celebrated what they considered a major win <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/labor-board-confirms-amazon-drivers-are-employees-in-finding-hailed-by-union/">when the NLRB found that Amazon was a joint employer</a> of sub-contracted drivers, cheering "We are Amazon workers!" At that time, Amazon seemed to be downplaying the designation, telling Ars that the union was trying to "misrepresent" a merit determination that the NLRB confirmed was only "the first step in the NLRB’s General Counsel litigating the allegations after investigating an unfair labor practice charge."</p>
<p>But this week, the NLRB took the next step, signing charges soon after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/backlash-over-amazons-return-to-office-comes-as-workers-demand-higher-wages/">Amazon began facing intensifying worker backlash</a>, not just from drivers but also from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/91-percent-of-amazon-employees-are-dissatisfied-with-remote-work-ending-poll/">disgruntled office</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/backlash-over-amazons-return-to-office-comes-as-workers-demand-higher-wages/">fulfillment workers</a>. According <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-hit-with-us-labor-board-complaint-over-joint-employment-drivers-2024-10-02/">to Reuters</a>, the NLRB accused Amazon of "a series of illegal tactics to discourage union activities" organized by drivers in a Palmdale, California, facility.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/amazon-illegally-refused-to-bargain-with-drivers-union-nlrb-alleges/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/directv-agrees-to-buy-satellite-rival-dish-and-its-debt-for-one-dollar/">DirecTV's agreement to buy</a> the Dish satellite and streaming TV business from EchoStar is facing opposition from Dish creditors who would be forced to take a loss on the value of their debt.</p>
<p>Dish creditors "plan to block a distressed exchange that's a key part of its tie-up with rival DirecTV, according to people familiar with the matter," <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-02/dish-directv-deal-sparks-creditor-revolt-over-1-6-billion-loss">Bloomberg reported today</a>. "A group of steering committee investors has gained a blocking position in order to negotiate with the company, the people said. They may even explore a better outcome through litigation, said some of the people." The Bloomberg article was titled, "Dish-DirecTV Deal Sparks Creditor Revolt Over $1.6 Billion Loss."</p>
<p>As Bloomberg notes, "Dish needs consent from its bondholders to exchange old debts for notes issued out of the new combined entity" in order to complete the deal. A previous <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-30/ergen-needs-creditors-he-once-spurned-to-seal-dish-directv-deal">Bloomberg article</a> said that "just over two-thirds of [Dish] bondholders in each series of notes have to agree to the exchange, with the deadline set for October 29." EchoStar executives argue that debt holders will benefit from the merger by "owning debt of a stronger company with lower leverage," the article said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/dish-creditors-revolt-over-directv-merger-try-to-block-loss-making-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>When the update launched in May, customers revolted over missing features, like the ability to search music libraries, edit song and playlist queues, and set sleep timers. In addition, some already purchased hardware, especially older models, began having problems.</p>
<p>In a note to investors on Tuesday, Sonos said that "more than 80 percent of the app's missing features have been reintroduced." The app should be "almost 100 percent restored in the coming weeks." Sonos has been updating the app every two weeks in an effort to bring it to parity with the old one.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/sonos-ceo-admits-to-insufficient-app-testing-we-released-it-too-soon/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Owners of the popular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/">home EV chargers</a> made by Juicebox are about to lose a whole lot of features. Its owner, the energy company Enel X, has just announced that it is leaving the North American market entirely as of October 11.</p>
<p>Enel X says its strategy will be to pursue "further growth by providing bundled offers, including private charging solutions, to its electricity customers as well as by developing public charging infrastructure in countries where it has an electricity retail business." And since it does not have an electricity business in the US, merely a charging hardware and software one, it makes little sense to remain active here.</p>
<p>The company also blames high interest rates and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/ev-sales-remain-healthy-despite-online-doom-and-gloom/">a cooling EV market</a> as reasons for its exit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/if-you-own-a-juicebox-ev-charger-you-need-to-read-this/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>As you can see, we've refreshed the site design. We hope you'll come to love it. Ars Technica is a little more than 26 years old, yet this is only our ninth site relaunch (number eight was rolled out way back in 2016!).</p>
<p>We think the Ars experience gets better with each iteration, and this time around, we've brought a ton of behind-the-scenes improvements aimed squarely at making the site faster, more readable, and more customizable. We've added responsive design, larger text, and more viewing options. We've also added the highly requested "Most Read" box so you can find our hottest stories at a glance. And if you're a subscriber, you can now hide certain topics that we cover—and never see those stories again.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/welcome-to-our-latest-design-update-ars-9-0/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>This morning, Tesla posted its sales and production numbers for the third quarter of 2024. While not spectacular when compared to Q3 2023, the numbers do show modest growth, unlike the rather disappointing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/tesla-production-fell-by-15-percent-in-q2-2024-as-sales-continue-to-decline/">Q2 2024</a>. However, the production and sales numbers were still below many analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Tesla built 469,796 vehicles across the months of July, August, and September, a 9 percent increase on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/tesla-just-posted-its-q3-financial-results-and-theyre-underwhelming/">Q3 2023</a>. Of those, 443,668 were Models 3 and Y, a 6 percent growth from last year. Thanks to the Cybertruck, the previously moribund "other" category that also includes the slow-selling and outdated Models S and X has grown 91 percent compared to Q3 2023.</p>
<p>Tesla sold fewer cars than it built in Q3, though. Total sales for the quarter amounted to 462,890—6 percent up compared to Q3 2023. That's better than some analyst estimates, but UBS and Barclays were both estimating 470,000 cars sold during the three months.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/tesla-reverses-sales-slump-sees-modest-growth-in-q3/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Millions of people across the US South have gone without power or have been forced to evacuate following days of extreme downpours brought on by Hurricane Helene. North Carolina has borne the brunt of the devastation, with the state accounting for a third of all recorded fatalities to date. And as relief operations get underway, the eyes of the world are on a small town of about 2,000 in the western part of the state.</p>
<p>Spruce Pine sits about an hour northeast of Asheville, Mitchell County, and is home to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-science-of-ultra-pure-silicon/">world’s biggest known source of ultrapure quartz</a>—often referred to as high-purity quartz, or HPQ. This material is used for <a href="https://abachy.com/catalog/materials/crystal-growing-materials/crucibles">manufacturing crucibles</a>, on which global semiconductor production relies, as well as to make <a href="https://www.themanufacturer.com/press-releases/rise-in-demand-for-semiconductors-to-drive-global-high-purity-quartz-market/">components within semiconductors themselves</a>.</p>
<p>Semiconductors are the fundamental building blocks of modern IT. Transistors, a type of semiconductor device, are the small electronic switches that perform computation functions in every tech gadget, from smartphones to electric scooters, data centers, and military aircraft. They make possible the processors that power most of the world’s smart gadgets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/helene-takes-ultrapure-quartz-mines-offline-threatens-tech-supply-chains/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Popular open source Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx has been <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx">removed from GitHub</a>, and the team behind it has reportedly ceased development of the project after apparent discussions with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Ryujinx developer <a href="https://github.com/riperiperi">riperiperi</a> writes on the project's Discord server <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428">and social media</a> that fellow developer gdkchan was "contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of." While the final outcome of that negotiation is not yet public, riperiperi reports that "the organization has been removed" (presumably from GitHub) and thus "I think it's safe to say what the outcome is."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://ryujinx.org/">the Ryujinx website is still up</a> as of this writing, the download page and other links to GitHub-hosted information from that website no longer function. The developers behind the project have not posted a regular progress report update <a href="https://blog.ryujinx.org/progress-report-january-2024/">since January</a> after posting similar updates <a href="https://blog.ryujinx.org/">almost every month throughout 2023</a>. Before today, the Ryujinx social media account last posted an announcement <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1763916049647382644">in March</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/switch-emulator-ryujinx-shuts-down-development-after-contact-by-nintendo/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The co-owner of a Chicago-based lab has pleaded guilty for his role in a COVID testing scam that raked in millions—which he used to buy stocks, cryptocurrency, and several luxury cars while still squirreling away over $6 million in his personal bank account.</p>
<p>Zishan Alvi, 45, of Inverness, Illinois, co-owned LabElite, which <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431203/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431203.1.0.pdf">federal prosecutors say</a> billed the federal government for COVID-19 tests that were either never performed or were performed with purposefully inadequate components to render them futile. Customers who sought testing from LabElite—sometimes for clearance to travel or have contact with vulnerable people—received either no results or results indicating they were negative for the deadly virus.</p>
<p>The scam, which ran from around February 2021 to about February 2022, made over $83 million total in fraudulent payments from the federal government's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which covered the cost of COVID-19 testing for people without insurance during the height of the pandemic. Local media coverage indicated that people who sought testing at LabElite were discouraged from providing health insurance information.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/covid-fraudster-pleads-guilty-faces-20-years-for-role-in-83m-testing-scam/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Imagine you're a podcaster who regularly does quick 10- to 12-minute summary reviews of written works. Now imagine your producer gives you multiple pages of nothing but the words "poop" and "fart" repeated over and over again and asks you to have an episode about the document on their desk within the hour.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I'd have trouble even knowing where to start with such a task. But when Reddit user sorryaboutyourcats gave the same prompt to Google's NotebookLM AI model, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fs9wlf/analyzing_poop_fart_written_1000_times_creating/">the result</a> was a surprisingly cogent and engaging AI-generated podcast that touches on the nature of art, the philosophy of attention, and the human desire to make meaning out of the inherently meaningless.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal prosecutors have charged a man for an alleged “hack-to-trade” scheme that earned him millions of dollars by breaking into the Office365 accounts of executives at publicly traded companies and obtaining quarterly financial reports before they were released publicly.</p>
<p>The action, taken by the office of the US Attorney for the district of New Jersey, accuses UK national Robert B. Westbrook of earning roughly $3.75 million in 2019 and 2020 from stock trades that capitalized on the illicitly obtained information. After accessing it, prosecutors said, he executed stock trades. The advance notice allowed him to act and profit on the information before the general public could. The US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a separate civil suit against Westbrook seeking an order that he pay civil penalties and return all ill-gotten gains.</p>
<h2>Buy low, sell high</h2>
<p>“The SEC is engaged in ongoing efforts to protect markets and investors from the consequences of cyber fraud,” Jorge G. Tenreiro, acting chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, said in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-153">statement</a>. “As this case demonstrates, even though Westbrook took multiple steps to conceal his identity—including using anonymous email accounts, VPN services, and utilizing bitcoin—the Commission’s advanced data analytics, crypto asset tracing, and technology can uncover fraud even in cases involving sophisticated international hacking.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/crook-made-millions-by-breaking-into-execs-office365-inboxes-feds-say/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, OpenAI kicked off its annual <a href="https://openai.com/devday/">DevDay</a> event in San Francisco, unveiling four major API updates for developers that integrate the company's AI models into their products. Unlike last year's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">single-location event</a> featuring a keynote by CEO Sam Altman, DevDay 2024 is more than just one day, adopting a global approach with additional events planned for London on October 30 and Singapore on November 21.</p>

<p>The San Francisco event, which was invitation-only and closed to press, featured <a href="https://x.com/swyx/status/1841173181002051911">on-stage speakers</a> going through technical presentations. Perhaps the most notable new API feature is the Realtime API, now in public beta, which supports speech-to-speech conversations using six preset voices and enables developers to build features very similar to ChatGPT's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/when-counting-quickly-openais-new-voice-mode-stops-to-catch-its-breath/">Advanced Voice Mode</a> (AVM) into their applications.</p>
<p>OpenAI says that the Realtime API streamlines the process of creating voice assistants. Previously, developers had to use multiple models for speech recognition, text processing, and text-to-speech conversion. Now, they can handle the entire process with a single API call.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/openai-unveils-easy-voice-assistant-creation-at-2024-developer-event/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile has agreed to pay a $15.75 million fine and improve its security in a settlement over a series of data breaches over three years that affected tens of millions of customers.</p>
<p>"T-Mobile suffered data breaches in 2021, 2022, and 2023," the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau said in an <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-860A1.pdf">order approving a consent decree</a> yesterday. "Combined, these breaches affected millions of current, former, or prospective T-Mobile customers and millions of end-user customers of T-Mobile wireless service resellers, which operate on T-Mobile's network infrastructure and are known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)."</p>
<p>Four breaches occurring over three years exposed personal information, including customer names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, the features customers subscribed to, and the number of lines on their accounts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/t-mobile-pays-16-million-fine-for-three-years-worth-of-data-breaches/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The disaster <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/news-services/ap/20230205-89080/">drew global attention</a> as the governors of <a href="https://x.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1622409784593993729">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://x.com/GovernorShapiro/status/1622682965988761600">Pennsylvania</a> urged <a href="https://ema.ohio.gov/media-publications/news/dewine-020523">evacuations for a mile</a> around the site. Flames and smoke billowed from burning chemicals, and an acrid odor radiated from the derailment area as chemicals entered the air and spilled into a nearby creek.</p>
<p>Three days later, at the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20240625.aspx">urging of the rail company</a> Norfolk Southern, about 1 million pounds of <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxProfiles/ToxProfiles.aspx?id=282&amp;tid=51">vinyl chloride</a>, a chemical that can be toxic to humans at high doses, was released from the damaged train cars and set aflame.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/toxic-chemicals-from-ohio-train-derailment-lingered-in-buildings-for-months/">Read full article</a></p>
