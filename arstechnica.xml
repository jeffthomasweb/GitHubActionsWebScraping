<p>United Launch Alliance is targeting September 16 for the second test flight of the new Vulcan rocket, and a flawless mission could finally set the stage for the first Vulcan launch for the US military by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The US Space Force has contracted ULA's Vulcan rocket to launch the majority of the military's space missions over the next few years. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/air-force-is-growing-concerned-about-the-pace-of-vulcan-rocket-launches/">Pentagon officials are eager</a> for Vulcan to get flying so they can start checking off a backlog of 25 military space missions the Space Force wants to launch by the end of 2027.</p>
<p>By any measure, the first Vulcan launch in January was a resounding success. On its debut flight, the new rocket delivered a commercial lunar lander to an on-target orbit. The next Vulcan mission, which ULA calls Cert-2, will be the rocket's second certification flight. The Space Force requires ULA to complete two successful flights of the Vulcan rocket before entrusting it to launch national security satellites.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038450#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038450&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A second Colorado poultry farm has reported a case of bird flu in a worker, marking the state's <a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/state-health-officials-closely-monitor-farms-responding-to-avian-flu-spread-in">seventh human case this month</a> amid the ongoing outbreak among dairy cows.</p>
<p>Colorado health officials said the seventh case is, for now, a presumptive positive. That means that the person has tested positive at the state level while confirmatory testing is being carried out at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The presumptive positive worker was at a poultry facility in the state's northeastern Weld County. In recent weeks, six workers at another poultry farm in Weld also tested positive for bird flu. In that facility, a commercial egg layer operation with about 1.8 million birds, workers were infected as they culled chickens known to be infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza. Genetic testing of the virus in the birds and the workers indicated that they were infected with a strain of H5N1 closely related to the virus found spreading in dairy cattle and to dairy farm workers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038535#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038535&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlgreytv.jpg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="598" data-width="800">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=836VlTPxnFc">Carl the Person/YouTube</a>)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Smart TV owners have been subjected to a growing amount of ads and tracking. Ad fatigue, only worsened by a trend that sees streaming providers trying to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/netflix-is-kicking-us-subscribers-off-its-cheapest-ad-free-plan-soon/">force customers</a> into subscriptions <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/prime-video-subs-will-soon-see-ads-for-amazon-products-when-they-hit-pause/">with commercials</a>, is understandable. We’re at the point where someone would rather use a <a href="https://carltheperson.com/posts/earlgreytv/">broken laptop dangling off a TV</a> than be subjected to the watchful eye of the TV's native operating system.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/custom-linux-powered-smart-tv-breaks-free-from-ads-and-tracking-enables-ultimate-customizability-earlgreytv-straps-a-laptop-to-the-back-to-unlock-unlimited-control">Tom’s Hardware</a>, a blogger named Carl Riis, who says he’s a software engineer, shared his DIY project, a <a href="https://carltheperson.com/posts/earlgreytv/">Linux-based “smart TV.”</a> Riis’ project doesn’t stand out because it’s the most unique, clever, or clean. In fact, if you’re the type of person willing to pay a lot for TVs with strong aesthetic appeal, like TVs that can<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201121/hisense-canvas-tv-samsung-frame-price-sizes"> look like artwork</a> or appear <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/lg-oled-t-is-a-transparent-77-inch-tv-that-will-arrive-in-2024/">transparent</a>, you’ll be put off by the EarlGreyTV. The system uses an old Lenovo laptop that has a broken keyboard and is attached to a TV by a string. As Riis wrote: “This may look a little insane, but it has been a great way to keep things neat while retaining access to the laptop."</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg"><img alt="The backside of the DIY smart TV." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back-640x378.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">The backside of the DIY smart TV.</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=836VlTPxnFc">Carl the Person/YouTube</a>)</p></div>
<p>The laptop is broken because Riis spilled tea onto the keyboard years ago. The keyboard stopped working, making it hard to turn the laptop on and off. “I have to short two specific pins where the keyboard connects to the motherboard. For this reason, I have the back removed, which probably also helps it run less hot,” Riis wrote.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038479#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038479&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Right now, the world's best weather forecast model is a General Circulation Model, or GCM, put together by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. A GCM is in part based on code that calculates the physics of various atmospheric processes that we understand well. For a lot of the rest, GCMs rely on what's termed "parameterization," which attempts to use empirically determined relationships to approximate what's going on with processes where we don't fully understand the physics.</p>
<p>Lately, GCMs have faced some competition from machine-learning techniques, which train AI systems to recognize patterns in meteorological data and use those to predict the conditions that will result over the next few days. Their forecasts, however, tend to get a bit vague after more than a few days and can't deal with the sort of long-term factors that need to be considered when GCMs are used to study climate change.</p>
<p>On Monday, a team from Google's AI group and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are announcing NeuralGCM, a system that mixes physics-based atmospheric circulation with AI parameterization of other meteorological influences. Neural GCM is computationally efficient and performs very well in weather forecast benchmarks. Strikingly, it can also produce reasonable-looking output for runs that cover decades, potentially allowing it to address some climate-relevant questions. While it can't handle a lot of what we use climate models for, there are some obvious routes for potential improvements.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038449#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038449&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Founded in Dresden in the early 1990s, Germany’s Solarwatt quickly became an emblem of Europe’s renewable energy ambitions and bold plan to build a solar power industry.</p>
<p>Its opening of a new solar panel plant in Dresden in late 2021 was hailed as a small victory in the battle to wrestle market share from the Chinese groups that have historically supplied the bulk of panels used in Europe.</p>
<p>Now, Solarwatt is preparing to halt production at the plant and shift that work to China.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038454#p3">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038454&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>By Monday morning, many of the major disruptions from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">the flawed CrowdStrike security update</a> late last week had cleared up. Flight delays and cancellations were no longer front-page news, and multiple Starbucks locations near me are taking orders through the app once again.</p>
<p>But the cleanup effort continues. Microsoft estimates that <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/">around 8.5 million Windows systems</a> were affected by the issue, which involved a buggy .sys file that was automatically pushed to Windows PCs running the CrowdStrike Falcon security software. Once downloaded, that update caused Windows systems to display the dreaded Blue Screen of Death and enter a boot loop.</p>
<p>"While software updates may occasionally cause disturbances, significant incidents like the CrowdStrike event are infrequent," wrote Microsoft VP of Enterprise and OS Security David Weston in a blog post. "We currently estimate that CrowdStrike’s update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines. While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038277#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038277&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After years of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/apple-photo-scanning-plan-faces-global-backlash-from-90-rights-groups/">controversies over plans to scan iCloud</a> to find more child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/apple-details-reasons-to-abandon-csam-scanning-tool-more-controversy-ensues/">abandoned those plans</a> last year. Now, child safety experts have accused the tech giant of not only failing to flag CSAM exchanged and stored on its services—including iCloud, iMessage, and FaceTime—but also allegedly failing to report all the CSAM that is flagged.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) shared UK police data <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/22/apple-security-child-sexual-images-accusation">with The Guardian</a> showing that Apple is "vastly undercounting how often" CSAM is found globally on its services.</p>
<p>According to the NSPCC, police investigated more CSAM cases in just the UK alone in 2023 than Apple reported globally for the entire year. Between April 2022 and March 2023 in England and Wales, the NSPCC found, "Apple was implicated in 337 recorded offenses of child abuse images." But in 2023, Apple only <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/2023-reports-by-esp.pdf">reported</a> 267 instances of CSAM to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), supposedly representing all the CSAM on its platforms worldwide, The Guardian reported.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038409#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038409&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2024, it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/thanks-to-ai-its-probably-time-to-take-your-photos-off-the-internet/">almost trivial</a> to create realistic AI-generated images of people, which has led to fears about how these deceptive images might be detected. Researchers at the University of Hull <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/news/want-spot-deepfake-look-stars-their-eyes">recently unveiled</a> a novel method for detecting AI-generated deepfake images by analyzing reflections in human eyes. The technique, presented at the <a href="https://nam2024.hull.ac.uk/">Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting</a> last week, adapts tools used by astronomers to study galaxies for scrutinizing the consistency of light reflections in eyeballs.</p>

<p>Adejumoke Owolabi, an MSc student at the University of Hull, headed the research under the guidance of <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/kevin-pimbblet">Dr. Kevin Pimbblet</a>, professor of astrophysics.</p>
<p>Their detection technique is based on a simple principle: A pair of eyes being illuminated by the same set of light sources will typically have a similarly shaped set of light reflections in each eyeball. Many AI-generated images created to date don't take eyeball reflections into account, so the simulated light reflections are often inconsistent between each eye.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038332#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038332&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Porsche's high-performance variants of the 911 might make for great headlines, proving the incredible potential of the world's most iconic rear-engined sports car to serve as a track toy and off-road rally racer simultaneously. But while motorsport heritage always factors into any Porsche conversation, the 911 is anything but the top rung of the company's sales ladder. Instead, the Cayenne and then Macan SUVs have led the pack in volume since 2002, bolstering the company's financial position and allowing the smaller-scale 911s and 718s to continue production.</p>
<p>For model year 2024, the facelifted third-gen Cayenne now comes in seven trim levels, including the technologically advanced and startlingly quick Turbo E-Hybrid, which offers 35 miles of all-electric range and a 3.5-second sprint to 60 mph. And yet a base V6 Cayenne offers a far more attainable entree into what it's like to own something other than a fully loaded, paint-to-sample uber-Porsche that can easily cost well over $200,000.</p>
<h2>Revisiting the Cayenne SUV</h2>
<p>A V6-powered Cayenne starts at $79,200, or almost $20,000 more than the smaller gasoline-powered Macan crossover. But the larger platform allows for a more refined vision of Porsche luxury on the interior, with more headroom, legroom, and cargo capacity. Despite the additional size, however, the latest iteration of the Cayenne never sacrifices the spirit that originally put the Sport in Sport Utility Vehicle. And even a small-displacement turbo V6 still delivers the highlights of Porsche performance, engineering, and reliability.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038347#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038347&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was only about 10 days ago that the Falcon 9 rocket's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/07/the-unmatched-streak-of-perfection-with-spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-is-over/">upper stage failed in flight</a>, preventing the rocket from delivering its 20 Starlink satellites into a proper orbit. Because they were released lower than expected—about 135 km above the Earth's surface and subject to atmospheric drag—these satellites ultimately reentered the planet's atmosphere and burnt up.</p>
<p>Typically, after a launch failure, a rocket will be sidelined for months while engineers and technicians comb over the available data and debris to identify a cause, perform tests, and institute a fix.</p>
<p>However, according to multiple sources, SpaceX was ready to launch the Falcon 9 rocket as soon as late last week. Currently, the company has a launch opportunity for no earlier than 12:14 am ET (04:14 UTC) on Wednesday for its Starlink 10-4 mission.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038295#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038295&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Phoebus 2A, the most powerful space nuclear reactor ever made, was fired up at Nevada Test Site on June 26, 1968. The test lasted 750 seconds and confirmed it could carry first humans to Mars. But Phoebus 2A did not take anyone to Mars. It was too large, it cost too much, and it didn’t mesh with Nixon’s idea that we had no business going anywhere further than low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t NASA that first called for rockets with nuclear engines. It was the military that wanted to use them for intercontinental ballistic missiles. And now, the military wants them again.</p>
<h2>Nuclear-powered ICBMs</h2>
<p>The work on nuclear thermal rockets (NTRs) started with the Rover program initiated by the US Air Force in the mid-1950s. The concept was simple on paper. Take tanks of liquid hydrogen and use turbopumps to feed this hydrogen through a nuclear reactor core to heat it up to very high temperatures and expel it through the nozzle to generate thrust. Instead of causing the gas to heat and expand by burning it in a combustion chamber, the gas was heated by coming into contact with a nuclear reactor.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038124#p3">Read 56 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038124&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On April 11, a small company called Graphyte began pumping out beige bricks, somewhat the consistency of particle board, from its new plant in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The bricks don’t look like much, but they come with a lofty goal: to help stop climate change.</p>
<p>Graphyte, a startup backed by billionaire <a href="https://www.graphyte.com/post/breakthrough-energy-state-of-thetransition-2023">Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures</a>, will bury its bricks deep underground, trapping carbon there. The company bills it as the largest carbon dioxide removal project in the world.</p>
<p>Scientists have long warned of the dire threat posed by global warming. It’s gotten so bad though that the long-sought mitigation, <a href="https://undark.org/2022/08/12/the-fervent-debate-over-the-best-way-to-confront-global-warming/">cutting carbon dioxide emissions</a> from every sector of the economy, might not be enough of a fix. To stave off the worst—including large swaths of the Earth exposed to severe heat waves, water scarcity, and crop failures—some experts say there is a deep need to remove <a href="https://undark.org/2024/02/19/carbon-seafloor/">previously emitted carbon</a>, too. And that can be done anywhere on Earth—even in places not known for climate-friendly policies, like Arkansas.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038257#p3">Read 48 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038257&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Of all the potential super-Earths—terrestrial exoplanets more massive than Earth—out there, an exoplanet orbiting a star only 40 light-years away from us in the constellation Cetus might be the most similar to have been found so far.</p>
<p>Exoplanet LHS 1140 b was assumed to be a mini-Neptune when it was first discovered by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope toward the end of 2023. After analyzing data from those observations, a team of researchers, led by astronomer Charles Cadieux, of Université de Montréal, suggest that LHS 1140 b is more likely to be a super-Earth.</p>
<p>If this planet is an alternate version of our own, its relative proximity to its cool red dwarf star means it would most likely be a gargantuan snowball or a mostly frozen body with a substellar (region closest to its star) ocean that makes it look like a cosmic eyeball. It is now thought to be the exoplanet with the best chance for liquid water on its surface, and so might even be habitable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038095#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038095&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For nearly 20 years, scientists have known an asteroid named Apophis will pass unusually close to Earth on Friday, April 13, 2029. But most officials at the world's space agencies stopped paying much attention when updated measurements ruled out the chance Apophis will impact Earth any time soon.</p>
<p>Now, Apophis is again on the agenda, but this time as a science opportunity, not as a threat. The problem is, there's not much time to design, build, and launch a spacecraft to get into position near Apophis in less than five years. The good news is there are designs, and in some cases, existing spacecraft, that governments can repurpose for missions to Apophis, a rocky asteroid about the size of three football fields.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered Apophis in 2004, and the first measurements of its orbit indicated there was a small chance it could strike Earth in 2029 or in 2036. Using more detailed radar observations of Apophis, scientists in 2021 ruled out any danger to Earth for at least the next 100 years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037417#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037417&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7328a3.htm?s_cid=mm7328a3_w">Newly released testing data</a> of Diamond Shruumz-brand gummies purchased in 2023 identified the presence of psilocin, a hallucinogenic drug closely related to the magic-mushroom drug psilocybin that is classified as a Schedule I drug, alongside psilocybin, heroin, and LSD.</p>
<p>The finding comes as Diamond Shruumz's current line of gummies, chocolates, and candy cones is being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/microdosing-candies-linked-to-seizures-intubation-finally-recalled/">recalled</a> and are under active investigation in connection to a nationwide rash of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/people-are-seizing-being-intubated-after-eating-microdose-chocolates/">severe illnesses, which have involved seizures, intubation, and intensive care.</a> As of the latest update on July 15, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024">69 people in 28 states have been sickened</a> after eating a Diamond Shruumz product. Sixty of the 69 sought medical care, 36 were hospitalized, and there is one potentially associated death under investigation.</p>
<p>The new finding, published by researchers at the University of Virginia, of psilocin in the products adds to growing concern about psychedelic mushroom candies generally. Although the candies are marketed as being legal, they have often been found to contain various undisclosed illegal drugs or gray market synthetic versions of drugs, as well as dangerous adulterants and contaminants.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038241#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038241&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Samsung is delaying the release of the $250 Galaxy Buds3 Pro in the US from July 24 to August 28, per its website. The third-generation earbuds have Samsung moving from a bean-like shape to an Apple AirPods Pro-like design, including silicone ear tips. But some users have claimed that the new tips rip too easily.</p>
<p>Samsung confirmed to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-suspend-shipments-3462708/">Android Authority</a> today that it has temporarily stopped shipping units to stores. The devices were no longer available for preorder on Amazon or Best Buy as of this writing.</p>
<p>Samsung’s statement to Android Authority noted “reports relating to a limited number of early production devices” and asserted that it's taking the problem “very seriously.” The statement continues:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038166#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038166&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idh8n5XuYIA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Ryan Reynolds and High Jackman join forces in <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em>. </p></div>
<p>If there's anything the Deadpool franchise is known for, it's R-rated cheeky irreverence. The forthcoming <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> clearly has that in spades, but the final trailer strikes an uncharacteristically somber note, reminding us just what Wade Wilson/Deadpool stands to lose if Wolverine can't rise to the challenge. Bonus: There's a surprise cameo from Hugh Jackman's co-star in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_(film)">Logan</a>.</em></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/trailer-for-deadpool-and-wolverine-is-filled-with-fun-slo-mo-action-f-bombs/">previously reported</a>, Ryan Reynolds found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/wade-wilson-joins-the-mcu-in-deadpool-and-wolverine-super-bowl-teaser/">the perfect fit</a> with 2016's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(film)"><em>Deadpool</em></a>, starring as Wade Wilson, a former Canadian special forces operative (dishonorably discharged) who develops regenerative healing powers that heal his cancer but leave him permanently disfigured with scars all over his body. Wade decides to become a masked vigilante, turning down an invitation to join the X-Men and abandon his bad-boy ways. The first <em>Deadpool</em> was a big hit, racking up $782 million at the global box office, critical praise, and a couple of Golden Globe nominations for good measure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2"><em>Deadpool 2</em></a> was released in 2018 and was just as successful.</p>
<p><em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> reunites Reynolds with many familiar faces from the first two films. Morena Baccarin is back as Wade's girlfriend, Vanessa, along with Leslie Uggams as Blind Al; Karan Soni as Wade's personal chauffeur, taxi driver Dopinder; Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead; Stefan Kapičić as the voice of Colossus; Shioli Kutsuna as Negasonic's mutant girlfriend, Yukio; Randal Reeder as Buck; and Lewis Tan as X-Force member Shatterstar.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038206#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038206&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Citing frustration with mobile carriers enforcing different phone-unlocking policies that are bad for consumers, the Federal Communications Commission is proposing a 60-day unlocking requirement that would apply to all wireless providers.</p>
<p>The industry's "confusing and disparate cell phone unlocking policies" mean that "some consumers can unlock their phones with relative ease, while others face significant barriers," Commissioner Geoffrey Starks <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404092A3.pdf">said</a> at yesterday's FCC meeting. "It also means certain carriers are subject to mandatory unlocking requirements while others are free to dictate their own. This asymmetry is bad for both consumers and competition."</p>
<p>The FCC is "proposing a uniform 60-day unlocking policy" so that "consumers can choose the carrier that offers them the best value," Starks said. Unlocking a phone allows it to be used on a different carrier's network as long as the phone is compatible.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038188#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038188&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Formula E provided flights from Washington to Portland and accommodation so Ars could attend the Portland E-Prix. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore.—Formula E wraps up its 10th series with a pair of races in London this weekend. It's been a competitive manufacturer's championship between Porsche and Jaguar. This weekend, <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-e/five-things-to-watch-formula-e-tense-london-decider/">seven drivers are still in contention</a> to win the driver's title after a double-header in Portland on June 29-30 that saw cars going five-wide down the main straight as they reached the highest top speeds of the season. It was the second visit by Formula E to the picturesque Portland International Raceway, and Ars spoke with some of the sport's bigwigs to see what they think it's getting right and where the technical evolution of the cars is headed.</p>
<p>Formula E has come a long way since 2014. Racing then exclusively in city centers, the cars were slow at first. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/check-out-how-much-quicker-formula-e-has-gotten-in-just-three-years/">even as they developed</a>, they carried too small a battery to complete even a relatively short race distance. There was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/formula-es-new-electric-car-looks-like-nothing-else-in-racing/">a big upgrade in 2018</a> with the start of season five: The Gen2 car now has battery packs sufficient for 45 minutes-plus-a-lap races. The Gen2 car raced well, too, even putting on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hum3zqKj5sQ">a better show at Monaco</a> than Formula 1 has been able to muster for decades.</p>
<p>We expected another big improvement in lap times when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/formula-es-new-electric-race-car-is-lighter-more-powerful-more-nimble/">the Gen3 car arrived at the start of last season</a>. The Gen3 car featured much less weight and much more power, but also a change of tire supplier. Originally meant to last multiple race weekends, the rubber supplied by Hankook this season and last has much less grip than the Michelins it replaced. That's kept cornering speeds relatively low and made the cars even harder to drive.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038164#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038164&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
