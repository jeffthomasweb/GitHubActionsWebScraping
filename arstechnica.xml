                            <![CDATA[
<p>When the Switch 2 was fully unveiled <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">back in April</a>, we weren't alone in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-were-expecting-from-nintendos-switch-2-announcement-wednesday/">expecting</a> the announcement of a true follow-up to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>—one of the original Switch's best-selling games and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2017/">our pick for the best game of 2017</a>. Instead, we got our first look at <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, the big ape's first fully 3D adventure since the Rare-developed <em>Donkey Kong 64</em> back in 1999.</p>
<p>The fact that Nintendo wasn't willing to commit its longstanding plumber mascot to its first first-party platformer on the Switch 2 could have been seen as a sign of a rushed, second-tier spin-off effort here. After playing through <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, though, I'm happy to report nothing could be further from the truth for this deep and worthy spiritual successor to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> (from <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">many of the same development staff</a>). <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> captures the same sense of joyful movement and exploration as the best Mario games, while adding in an extremely satisfying terrain destruction system that shows off the Switch 2 hardware to great effect.</p>
<h2>Beat up the earth</h2>
<p>Its that terrain destruction system that most sets <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> from previous 3D platformers from Nintendo and others. Fully three of the four face buttons on the Switch 2 controllers are devoted to letting Donkey Kong punch either horizontally, upward, or downward, often taking out large chunks of the nearby scenery as he does.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-worthy-successor-to-super-mario-odysseys-legacy/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>For a star, its initial mass is everything. It determines how quickly it burns through its hydrogen and how it will evolve once it starts fusing heavier elements. It's so well understood that scientists have devised a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence">main sequence</a>" that acts a bit like a periodic table for stars, correlating their mass and age with their properties.</p>
<p>The main sequence, however, is based on an assumption that's almost always true: All of the energy involved comes from the gravity-driven fusion of lighter elements into heavier ones. However, three astrophysicists consider an alternative source of energy that may apply at the very center of our galaxy— energy released when dark matter particles and antiparticles collide and annihilate. While we don't even know that dark matter can do that, it's a hypothetical with some interesting consequences, like seemingly immortal stars, and others that move backward along the main sequence path.</p>
<h2>Dark annihilations</h2>
<p>We haven't figured out what dark matter is, but there are lots of reasons to think that it is comprised of elementary particles. And, if those behave like all of the particles we understand well, then there will be both regular and antimatter versions. Should those collide, they should annihilate each other, releasing energy in the process. Given dark matter's general propensity not to interact with anything, these collisions will be extremely rare except in locations with very high dark matter concentrations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/there-may-be-dark-main-sequence-stars-at-the-galactic-center/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hackers are stashing malware in a place that’s largely out of the reach of most defenses—inside domain name system (DNS) records that map domain names to their corresponding numerical IP addresses.</p>
<p>The practice allows malicious scripts and early-stage malware to fetch binary files without having to download them from suspicious sites or attach them to emails, where they frequently get quarantined by antivirus software. That’s because traffic for DNS lookups often goes largely unmonitored by many security tools. Whereas web and email traffic is often closely scrutinized, DNS traffic largely represents a blind spot for such defenses.</p>
<h2>A strange and enchanting place</h2>
<p>Researchers from DomainTools on Tuesday <a href="https://dti.domaintools.com/malware-in-dns/">said</a> they recently spotted the trick being used to host a malicious binary for Joke Screenmate, a strain of nuisance malware that interferes with normal and safe functions of a computer. The file was converted from binary format into hexadecimal, an encoding scheme that uses the digits 0 through 9 and the letters A through F to represent binary values in a compact combination of characters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/hackers-exploit-a-blind-spot-by-hiding-malware-inside-dns-records/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA["This is very early evidence of a preacher weaving pop culture into a sermon to keep his audience hooked."]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Medieval poet Geoffrey Chaucer twice made references to an early work featuring a Germanic mythological character named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_(folklore)">Wade</a>. Only three lines survive, discovered buried in a sermon by a late 19th century scholar. There has been much debate over how to translate those fragments ever since, and whether the long-lost work was a monster-filled epic or a chivalric romance. Two Cambridge University scholars now say those lines have been "radically misunderstood" for 130 years, supplying their own translation—and argument in favor of a romance—in a <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/fe8b2356-37e8-4ea7-b162-f741bab7f232">new paper</a> published in the Review of English Studies.</p>
<p>We know such a medieval work once existed because it's referenced in other texts, most notably by Chaucer. He alludes to the "tale of Wade" in his epic poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troilus_and_Criseyde"><em>Troilus and Criseyde</em></a> and mentions "Wade's boat [<em>boot</em>]" in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant%27s_Tale"><em>The Merchant's Tale</em></a>—part of his masterpiece, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales"><em>The Canterbury Tales</em></a>. A late 16th century editor of Chaucer's works, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Speght">Thomas Speght</a>, made a passing remark that Wade's boat was named "Guingelot," and that Wade's "strange exploits" were "long and fabulous," but didn't elaborate any further, no doubt assuming the tale was common knowledge and hence not worth retelling. Speght's truncated comment "has often been called the most exasperating note ever written on Chaucer," F.N. Robinson wrote in 1933.</p>
<p>So, the full story has been lost to history, although some remnant details have survived. For instance, there are mentions of Wade in an Old English poem, describing him as the son of a king and a "serpent-legged mermaid." The Poetic Edda mentions Wade's son, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_the_Smith">Wayland</a>, as well as Wayland's brothers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egil,_brother_of_Volund">Egil</a> and Slagfin. Wade is also briefly referenced in Malory's <em>Morte D'Arthur</em> and a handful of other texts from around the same period. Fun fact: J.R.R. Tolkien based his Middle-earth character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%A4rendil_and_Elwing">Earendil</a> on Wade; Earendil sails across the sky in a magical ship called Wingelot (or Vingilot).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/medieval-preacher-invoked-chivalric-hero-as-a-meme-in-sermon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A sweeping analysis of health data from more than 1.2 million children in Denmark born over a 24-year period found no link between the small amounts of aluminum in vaccines and a wide range of health conditions—including asthma, allergies, eczema, autism, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
<p>The finding, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997">published in the Annals of Internal Medicine</a>, firmly squashes a persistent anti-vaccine talking point that can give vaccine-hesitant parents pause.</p>
<p>Small amounts of aluminum salts have been added to vaccines for decades as adjuvants, that is, components of the vaccine that help drum up protective immune responses against a target germ. Aluminum adjuvants can be found in a variety of vaccines, including those against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib), and hepatitis A and B.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/large-study-squashes-anti-vaccine-talking-points-about-aluminum/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A budget-writing panel in the House of Representatives passed a $24.8 billion NASA budget bill Tuesday, joining a similar subcommittee in the Senate in maintaining the space agency's funding after the White House proposed a nearly 25 percent cut.</p>
<p>The budget bills making their way through the House and Senate don't specify funding levels for individual programs, but the topline numbers—$24.8 billion in the House version and $24.9 billion the Senate bill—represent welcome news for scientists, industry, and space enthusiasts bracing for severe cuts requested by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The spending plan passed Tuesday by the House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies covers NASA and numerous other federal agencies. The $24.8 billion budget the House seeks for NASA is $6 billion more than the Trump administration's budget proposal, and keeps NASA's funding next year the same as this year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/congress-moves-to-reject-bulk-of-white-houses-proposed-nasa-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For more than two decades, hard drive manufacturer Seagate has been experimenting with heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology for increasing hard drive density—drives that use tiny lasers to heat up and expand parts of the drive platter, write data, and then shut off to allow the platter to cool and contract, all within less than a nanosecond.</p>
<p>After decades of overly rosy availability predictions, Seagate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/after-decades-of-talk-seagate-seems-ready-to-actually-drop-the-hamr-hard-drives/">announced in late 2024</a> that it was finally delivering HAMR-based drives with capacities of up to 36TB to some datacenter customers. Today, the drives are finally <a href="https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-ships-30tb-drives-to-meet-global-surge-in-data-center-ai-storage-demand-pr/">available for end users</a> and individual IT administrators to buy, albeit only in smaller capacities for now. Seagate and other retailers will sell you massive <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/nas-drives/ironwolf-pro-hard-drive/?sku=ST30000NT011&amp;store=1">30TB IronWolf Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/enterprise-drives/exos/exos-m/?ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranMID=53538&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-PSXu4CAm82J_wC1YVfJaoA&amp;utm_campaign=10&amp;utm_content=TnL5HPStwNw">Exos M hard drives</a> for $600, and 28TB drives for $570. Both drives use conventional magnetic recording (CMR) technology, which performs better than the shingled magnetic recording (SMR) technology sometimes used to increase disk density.</p>
<p>The drives are based on <a href="https://www.seagate.com/innovation/mozaic/?utm_source=RAN&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;utm_campaign=10&amp;ranMID=53538&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-kuLygliH3dM.3zkE898EtQ">Seagate's Mosaic 3+</a> platform, which "incorporates Seagate’s unique implementation of HAMR to deliver mass-capacity storage at unprecedented areal densities of 3TB per disk and beyond."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/seagates-massive-30tb-600-hard-drives-are-now-available-for-anyone-to-buy/">Read full article</a></p>

The chip giant expects to receive US government licenses soon so that it can restart shipments of the restricted processors just days after CEO Jensen Huang <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ceo-promotes-ai-in-dc-and-china/">met</a> with President Donald Trump, potentially generating $15 billion to $20 billion in additional revenue this year.</p>
<p>Nvidia <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ceo-promotes-ai-in-dc-and-china/">said</a> in a statement that it is filing applications with the US government to resume H20 sales and that "the US government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon."</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I went for a run this morning while holding my iPhone, which was connected to a cable that attached to my earbuds. I’ve exercised with wired headphones for years, but today, the cord, with its persistent jostling, was especially distracting.</p>
<p>That’s because I was previously running with a pair of Bluetooth earbuds, <a href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/epos/gtw-270-hybrid-truly-wireless">EPOS’s GTW 270</a>. They came out in 2021 for $200, and I received them as a gift. They typically sat in a drawer until this spring, when I started running outside (rather than in a gym or not at all) for the first time in a couple of years. Without a place to store my phone, wired headphones felt cumbersome while running. I previously overlooked the GTW 270 because they are not as comfortable as my wired earbuds and tend to lose their connection (especially with my PC) if the audio stops playing momentarily. The latter problem proved less common when using the earbuds with my phone, though. Suddenly, I was enamored with a gadget that had spent most of its life forgotten in a drawer.</p>
<p>But after a few short months, one of my earliest concerns about wireless earbuds was realized: I lost the GTW 270’s case, which charges the earbuds and enables pairing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/fickle-business-strategy-has-turned-my-new-favorite-earbuds-into-e-waste/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>More and more, we're seeing imaging technologies and machine learning showing up in automotive applications. It's usually to diagnose some kind of problem like quality control, although not always—the camera-based system by UVeye <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/this-ai-mechanic-scans-your-car-or-tires-to-diagnose-defects/">that we wrote about a few years ago</a> made news recently after Hertz started using it to charge renters for things like <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/this-is-what-happens-when-hertzs-ai-scanner-finds-damage-on-your-rental">scuffs on hubcaps</a>. I have fewer concerns about customer abuse with General Motors' use of CT scanning, which simply seems like a clever adaptation of medical technology into another industry.</p>
<p>Ignore, if you can, GM's business decisions. Maybe you're upset because it killed your favorite brand,  changed the shape of the Corvette headlights, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/gm-confirms-its-dropping-apple-carplay-and-android-auto-from-2024-evs/">abandoned</a> Apple CarPlay. There are many valid reasons, but none change the fact that the company's engineers are quite creative. (That's probably why it stings so much when the company starts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/gm-confirms-chevy-bolt-will-die-this-year-making-way-for-electric-pickups/">hacking things up</a>.)</p>
<p>GM first turned to X-rays as a way of doing two-dimensional quality control on castings during the development process, according to Ed Duby, manufacturing engineering executive director at GM. "Much like the application to people, when you think about X-ray and CT scan, it's really trying to diagnose something without having to go into surgery. We kind of want to do the same thing with our castings," Duby told me.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/from-the-hospital-to-the-car-plant-what-is-gm-doing-with-ct-scanners/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A week after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/grok-praises-hitler-gives-credit-to-musk-for-removing-woke-filters/">Grok's antisemitic outburst</a>, which included praise of Hitler and a post calling itself "MechaHitler," Elon Musk's xAI has landed a US military contract worth up to $200 million. xAI announced a "Grok for Government" service after getting the contract with the US Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The military's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) yesterday <a href="https://www.ai.mil/Latest/News-Press/PR-View/Article/4242822/cdao-announces-partnerships-with-frontier-ai-companies-to-address-national-secu/">said</a> that "awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI—each with a $200M ceiling—will enable the Department to leverage the technology and talent of US frontier AI companies to develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas." While government grants typically take many months to be finalized, Grok's antisemitic posts didn't cause the Trump administration to change course before announcing the awards.</p>
<p>The US announcement didn't include much detail but said the four grants "to leading US frontier AI companies [will] accelerate Department of Defense (DoD) adoption of advanced AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges." The CDAO has been talking about grants for what it calls frontier AI <a href="https://www.ai.mil/Portals/137/Documents/Resources%20Page/2024-12-CDAO-Artificial-Intelligence-Rapid-Capabilities-Cell.pdf">since at least December 2024</a>, when it said it would establish "partnerships with Frontier AI companies" and had identified "a need to accelerate Generative AI adoption across the DoD enterprise from analysts to warfighters to financial managers."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/groks-mechahitler-meltdown-didnt-stop-xai-from-winning-200m-military-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Perhaps most controversial of the bills is the one that's closest to reaching Trump's desk, the GENIUS Act, which creates a framework for banks and private companies to issue stablecoins. After passing in the Senate last month, the House of Representatives is hoping to hold a vote as soon as Thursday, insiders <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/14/congress/house-crypto-week-votes-00451112">told Politico</a>.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are often hyped as a more reliable form of cryptocurrency, considered the "cash of the blockchain" because their value can be pegged to the US dollar, Delicia Hand, Consumer Reports' senior director monitoring digital marketplaces, told Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/trumps-stablecoin-push-will-open-floodgates-to-massive-fraud-lawmaker-warns/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Representing the joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP, or Soyuz-Apollo in the Soviet Union), both crews wore a cloth patch that featured the artwork of an accomplished space artist. The design that flew, however, was not the astronauts' first pick. That patch idea was rejected because Paul Calle opted to highlight the détente nature of the international handshake in space.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In mid-2022, when BYD executive Lian Yubo was asked to compare Chinese manufacturing with Tesla’s technology, he remarked that Elon Musk was an example that all Chinese carmakers could learn from.</p>
<p>“Tesla is a very successful company no matter what. BYD respects Tesla and we admire Tesla,” he said in an interview on Chinese state media.</p>
<p>Yet just three years later, Tesla’s technological lead over its Chinese rivals has narrowed dramatically. It is fighting to stay ahead in the world’s largest car market, its sales are falling in many other countries and its efforts to develop fully self-driving vehicles are running into regulatory roadblocks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/byd-has-caught-up-with-tesla-in-the-global-ev-race-heres-how/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA's New Horizons spacecraft got a fleeting glimpse of Pluto 10 years ago, revealing a distant world with a picturesque landscape that, paradoxically, appears to be refreshing itself in the cold depths of our Solar System.</p>
<p>The mission answered numerous questions about Pluto that have lingered since its discovery by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. As is often the case with planetary exploration, the results from New Horizons' flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/early-results-from-new-horizons-rendezvous-with-pluto/">posed countless more questions</a>. First and foremost, how did such a dynamic world come to be so far from the Sun?</p>
<p>For at least the next few decades, the only resources available for scientists to try to answer these questions will be either the New Horizons mission's archive of more than 50 gigabits of data recorded during the flyby, or observations from billions of miles away with powerful telescopes on the ground or space-based observatories like Hubble and James Webb.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/ten-years-on-from-pluto-prospects-for-a-revisit-are-a-long-way-off/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Physicists with the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration have detected the gravitational wave signal (dubbed GW231123) of the most massive merger between two black holes yet observed, resulting in a new black hole that is 225 times more massive than our Sun. The results were presented at the <a href="https://www.iop.org/events/24th-international-conference-general-relativity-and-gravitation-16th-edoardo-amaldi">Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves</a> in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
<p>The LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration searches the universe for gravitational waves produced by the mergers of black holes and neutron stars. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/danish-physicists-claim-to-cast-doubt-on-detection-of-gravitational-waves/">LIGO detects</a> gravitational waves via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/ligos-gravitational-wave-detection-takes-home-a-nobel/">laser interferometry</a>, using high-powered lasers to measure tiny changes in the distance between two objects positioned kilometers apart. LIGO has detectors in Hanford, Washington, and in Livingston, Louisiana. A third detector in Italy, Advanced Virgo, came online in 2016. In Japan, KAGRA is the first gravitational-wave detector in Asia and the first to be built underground. Construction began on LIGO-India in 2021, and physicists expect it will turn on sometime after 2025.</p>
<p>To date, the collaboration has detected dozens of merger events since its first <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-2017-nobel-prize">Nobel Prize-winning discovery</a>. Early detected mergers involved either two black holes or two neutron stars.  In 2021, LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA confirmed the detection of two separate "mixed" mergers between black holes and neutron stars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/physicists-detected-the-most-massive-black-hole-merger-to-date/">Read full article</a></p>

However, <a href="https://metr.org/Early_2025_AI_Experienced_OS_Devs_Study.pdf">a new randomized controlled trial</a> has found that experienced open source coders became less efficient at coding-related tasks when they used current AI tools.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">their study</a>, researchers at <a href="https://metr.org/about">METR</a> (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) recruited 16 software developers, each with multiple years of experience working on specific open source repositories. The study followed these developers across 246 individual "tasks" involved with maintaining those repos, such as "bug fixes, features, and refactors that would normally be part of their regular work." For half of those tasks, the developers used AI tools like <a href="https://cursor.com/en/pricing">Cursor Pro</a> or Anthropic's Claude; for the others, the programmers were instructed not to use AI assistance. Expected time forecasts for each task (made before the groupings were assigned) were used as a proxy to balance out the overall difficulty of the tasks in each experimental group, and the time needed to fix pull requests based on reviewer feedback was included in the overall assessment.</p>

      Experts and the developers themselves expected time savings that didn't materialize when AI tools were actually used.

<p>Before performing the study, the developers in question expected the AI tools would lead to a 24 percent reduction in the time needed for their assigned tasks. Even after completing those tasks, the developers believed that the AI tools had made them 20 percent faster, on average. In reality, though, the AI-aided tasks ended up being completed 19 percent <em>slower</em> than those completed without AI tools.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/study-finds-ai-tools-made-open-source-software-developers-19-percent-slower/">Read full article</a></p>
