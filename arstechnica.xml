                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Porsche provided flights from Albany, New York, to Malaga, Spain, and accommodation so Ars could drive the 911 Turbo S. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Turbochargers have been injecting more power into engines for over 100 years, but never before have they been so prevalent in our cars. A little boost can add a lot of power and efficiency, too, making a turbocharger a great solution to eke maximum performance out of today’s engines. Usually, though, that comes with the penalty of throttle lag: You put your foot to the floor, and nothing much happens for a beat or two.</p>
<p>As we’ve recently seen in our review of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/porsches-best-daily-driver-911-the-2025-carrera-gts-t-hybrid-review/">new 911 GTS</a>, Porsche’s engineers have worked some magic to create a turbocharger that provides all the power and fun of forced induction but with none of the throttle response penalty. If adding one high-tech, high-voltage turbocharger is good, surely two would be better, right? Indeed, it is, if you can afford the cost of entry. Meet the 701 hp (523 kW) 2026 911 Turbo S, Porsche’s new most powerful 911 ever.</p>
<h2>Twinning the T-Hybrid</h2>
<p>For Porsche’s first hybrid 911, the GTS, the company didn’t simply add an electric motor and bigger battery into the mix and call it a day. It also inserted another high-speed motor into the turbocharger, enabling it to spin up to maximum speed in less than a second, nearly eliminating turbo lag.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/porsches-2026-911-turbo-s-is-a-ballistic-twin-turbo-701-horsepower-monster/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since last year’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">disastrous rollout of Google’s AI Overviews</a>, the world at large has been aware of how AI-powered search results can differ wildly from the traditional list of links search engines have generated for decades. Now, new research helps quantify that difference, showing that AI search engines tend to cite less popular websites and ones that wouldn’t even appear in the Top 100 links listed in an “organic” Google search.</p>
<p>In the pre-print paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2510.11560v1">Characterizing Web Search in The Age of Generative AI</a>,” researchers from Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, and the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems compared traditional link results from Google’s search engine to its AI Overviews and <a href="https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/">Gemini-2.5-Flash</a>. The researchers also looked at GPT-4o’s web search mode and the separate “GPT-4o with Search Tool,” which resorts to searching the web only when the LLM decides it needs information found outside its own pre-trained data.</p>
<p>The researchers drew test queries from a number of sources, including specific questions submitted to ChatGPT in <a href="https://wildchat.allen.ai/">the WildChat dataset</a>, general political topics <a href="https://www.allsides.com/topics-issues">listed on AllSides</a>, and products included in the 100 most-searched Amazon products list.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-powered-search-engines-rely-on-less-popular-sources-researchers-find/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media/newsroom/press/att-violates-procedures">said</a> Friday that AT&amp;T “violated Section 2.1(I) of the National Advertising Division (NAD)/National Advertising Review Board (NARB) Procedures for the US advertising industry’s process of self-regulation by issuing a video advertisement and press release that use the NAD process and its findings for promotional purposes. NAD has demanded that AT&amp;T immediately remove such violative promotional materials and cease all future dissemination.”</p>
<p>The NAD said that AT&amp;T’s action threatens the “integrity and success of the self-regulatory forum,” and “undermines NAD’s mission to promote truth and accuracy of advertising claims and foster consumer trust in the marketplace.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/att-ad-congratulating-itself-for-its-ethics-violated-an-ad-industry-rule/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>With the milestone just days away, you are likely to hear this week that there has now been a continuous human presence on the International Space Station (ISS) for the past 25 years. But what does that quarter of a century actually encompass?</p>
<p>If only there was a way to see, hear, and experience <a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-102725a-iss-in-real-time-25-years-continuous-human-occupancy-space-station.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">each of those 9,131 days</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the astronauts and cosmonauts on the space station have devoted some of their work time and a lot of their free time to taking photos, filming videos, and calling down to Earth. Much of that data has been made available to the public, but in separate repositories, with no real way to correlate or connect it with the timeline on which it was all created.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/25-years-one-website-iss-in-real-time-captures-quarter-century-on-space-station/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Mexico City is one of the more unusual places that Formula 1 races, and it’s all thanks to altitude. The city sits at than 7,350 feet (2,240 m) above sea level, which makes the air noticeably thin compared to the average Grand Prix held at sea level. Like humans, F1 cars need air.</p>
<p>Oxygen is necessary if you want any internal combustion to happen inside the turbocharged 1.6 L V6 engine. A good flow of air across the various radiators and heat exchangers in the car is vital if you want to make it to the end of the race. And the downforce-generating wings and underbody only generate downforce by creating differences in air pressure above and below the car.</p>
<p>At over a mile above sea level, there’s about 20 percent less air, and therefore less power created by combustion, less efficient cooling of the cars, and less downforce able to be generated.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/f1-in-mexico-city-we-have-a-new-championship-leader/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>A zebra’s distinctive black-and-white stripes, or a leopard’s spots, are both examples of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern">Turing patterns</a>,” after mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, who proposed an intriguing hypothetical mechanism for how such complex, irregular patterns might emerge in nature. But Turing’s original proposal proved too simplified to fully re-create those natural patterns. Scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) have devised a new modeling approach that achieves much more accurate final patterns by introducing deliberate imperfections, according to a new paper published in the journal Matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/01/clustering-pattern-of-azteca-ant-colonies-may-be-due-to-a-turing-mechanism/">Turing focused on chemicals</a> known as morphogens in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis">seminal 1952 paper</a>. He devised <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/turing-patterns/4991.article">a mechanism</a> involving the interaction between an activator chemical that expresses a unique characteristic (like a tiger’s stripe) and an inhibitor chemical that periodically kicks in to shut down the activator’s expression. Both activator and inhibitor diffuse throughout a system, much like gas atoms will do in an enclosed box. It’s a bit like injecting a drop of black ink into a beaker of water. Normally, this would stabilize a system, and the water would gradually turn a uniform gray. But if the inhibitor diffuses at a faster rate than the activator, the process is destabilized. That mechanism will produce spots or stripes.</p>
<p>Scientists have tried to <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/biologists-home-in-on-turing-patterns-20130325/">apply this basic concept</a> to many different kinds of systems. For instance, neurons in the brain could serve as activators and inhibitors, depending on whether they amplify or dampen the firing of other nearby neurons—possibly the reason why we see <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-math-theory-for-why-people-hallucinate-20180730/">certain patterns when we hallucinate</a>. There is evidence for Turing mechanisms at work in zebra-fish stripes, the spacing between hair follicles in mice, feather buds on a bird’s skin, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3303118/">ridges on a mouse’s palate</a>, and the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1476">digits on a mouse’s paw</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/why-imperfection-could-be-key-to-turing-patterns-in-nature/">Read full article</a></p>

A former US Marine Staff Sergeant, McNally today has more than 7 million followers and has amassed more than 2 billion views just by showing how easy it is to open many common locks by slapping, picking, or shimming them.</p>
<p>This does not always endear him to the companies that make the locks.</p>
<p>On March 3, 2025, a Florida lock company called Proven Industries released a social media promo video just begging for the McNally treatment. The video was called, somewhat improbably, “YOU GUYS KEEP SAYING YOU CAN EASILY BREAK OFF OUR LATCH PIN LOCK.” In it, an enthusiastic man in a ball cap says he will “prove a lot of you haters wrong.” He then goes hard at Proven’s $130 model 651 trailer hitch lock with a sledgehammer, bolt cutters, and a crowbar.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/suing-a-popular-youtuber-who-shimmed-a-130-lock-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For millennia, some of the world’s largest filter-feeding whales, including humpbacks, fin whales, and blue whales, have undertaken some of the <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07092025/blue-corridors-whale-superhighways-conservation/">longest migrations</a> on earth to travel between their warm breeding grounds in the tropics to nutrient-rich feeding destinations in the poles each year.</p>
<p>“Nature has finely tuned these journeys, guided by memory and environmental cues that tell whales when to move and where to go,” said Trisha Atwood, an ecologist and associate professor at Utah State University’s Quinney College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. But, she said, climate change is “scrambling these signals,” forcing the marine mammals to veer off course. And they’re not alone.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Atwood joined more than 70 other scientists to discuss the global impacts of climate change on migratory species in a workshop convened by the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The organization monitors and protects more than 1,000 species that cross borders in search of food, mates, and favorable conditions to nurture their offspring.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/whale-and-dolphin-migrations-are-being-disrupted-by-climate-change/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers and users of LLMs have long been aware that AI models have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/ai-chatbots-tell-users-what-they-want-to-hear-and-thats-problematic/">a troubling tendency to tell people what they want to hear</a>, even if that means being less accurate. But many reports of this phenomenon amount to mere anecdotes that don’t provide much visibility into how common this sycophantic behavior is across frontier LLMs.</p>
<p>Two recent research papers have come at this problem a bit more rigorously, though, taking different tacks in attempting to quantify exactly how likely an LLM is to listen when a user provides factually incorrect or socially inappropriate information in a prompt.</p>
<h2>Solve this flawed theorem for me</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04721">one pre-print study</a> published this month, researchers from Sofia University and ETH Zurich looked at how LLMs respond when false statements are presented as the basis for difficult mathematical proofs and problems. The <a href="https://www.sycophanticmath.ai/">BrokenMath benchmark</a> that the researchers constructed starts with “a diverse set of challenging theorems from advanced mathematics competitions held in 2025.” Those problems are then “perturbed” into versions that are “demonstrably false but plausible” by an LLM that’s checked with expert review.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/are-you-the-asshole-of-course-not-quantifying-llms-sycophancy-problem/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The outage that hit Amazon Web Services and took out vital services worldwide was the result of a single failure that cascaded from system to system within Amazon’s sprawling network, according to a post-mortem from company engineers.</p>
<p>The series of failures lasted for 15 hours and 32 minutes, Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/">said</a>. Network intelligence company Ookla <a href="https://www.ookla.com/articles/aws-outage-q4-2025">said</a> its DownDetector service received more than 17 million reports of disrupted services offered by 3,500 organizations. The three biggest countries where reports originated were the US, the UK, and Germany. Snapchat, AWS, and Roblox were the most reported services affected. Ookla said the event was “among the largest internet outages on record for Downdetector.”</p>
<h2>It’s <em>always</em> DNS</h2>
<p>Amazon said the root cause of the outage was a software bug in software running the DynamoDB DNS management system. The system monitors the stability of load balancers by, among other things, periodically creating new DNS configurations for endpoints within the AWS network. A race condition is an error that makes a process dependent on the timing or sequence events that are variable and outside the developers’ control. The result can be unexpected behavior and potentially harmful failures.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/a-single-point-of-failure-triggered-the-amazon-outage-affecting-millions/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A 61-year-old man in California is lucky to be alive after a combination of herbal supplements he was taking for joint pain ended up utterly wrecking his body, landing him in intensive care and in a delirious state for months. His case is reported in <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1203?utm_source=cmpnr&amp;utm_campaign=aimcc_20251021&amp;utm_content=1&amp;cmp=1&amp;utm_medium=email">the Annals of Internal Medicine: Clinical Cases</a>.</p>
<p>The man turned up at a hospital in San Francisco in bad shape, but with nonspecific problems that had begun just two days earlier. His back hurt, he was feverish, nauseous, bloated, and he hadn’t been eating much. He was so weak he couldn’t walk or get out of bed without help. His heart rate and breathing rate were high. His blood pressure was low. There were multiple wounds on his lower body in various stages of healing.</p>
<p>Initial exams and lab work revealed <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>bacteria in his blood. There was also an abscess on his shoulder and an infection in and around his spine, which was worsening. Doctors wanted to perform a surgical procedure to relieve the pressure building up on his spinal cord and nerves, but his blood pressure was too low—and then he went into hemorrhagic shock from bleeding in his gastrointestinal tract. Doctors transferred him to the intensive care unit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/man-takes-herbal-pain-quackery-nearly-dies-spends-months-in-hospital/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the things that emerging diseases, including the COVID and Zika pandemics, have taught us is that it’s tough to keep up with infectious diseases in the modern world. Things like air travel can allow a virus to spread faster than our ability to develop therapies. But that doesn’t mean biotech has stood still; companies have been developing technologies that could allow us to rapidly respond to future threats.</p>
<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of ideas out there. But this week saw some early clinical trial results of one technique that could be useful for a range of infectious diseases. We’ll go over the results as a way to illustrate the sort of thinking that’s going on, along with the technologies we have available to pursue the resulting ideas.</p>
<h2>The best antibodies</h2>
<p>Any emerging disease leaves a mass of antibodies in its wake—those made by people in response to infections and vaccines, those made by lab animals we use to study the infectious agent, and so on. Some of these only have a weak affinity for the disease-causing agent, but some of them turn out to be what are called “broadly neutralizing.” These stick with high affinity not only to the original pathogen, but most or all of its variants, and possibly some related viruses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/dna-and-jolts-of-electricity-get-people-to-make-optimal-antibodies/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Digital reading devices like the Kindle have existed for almost 20 years, and the standard eReader form factor has hardly changed at all. Amazon, Boox, and a few other companies have offered larger E Ink screens, but how about something smaller? Boox has unveiled its second-generation Palma e-reader, which still fits in your pocket but adds a color screen and mobile data connectivity.</p>
<p>The first-gen Palma launched last year, earning fans who saw it as a way to read and access some apps without the full spate of distracting smartphone experiences. Boox e-readers are essentially Android tablets with E Ink screens and a few software quirks that arise from their unofficial Google Play implementation. The second-gen Palma might offer more opportunities for distraction because it’s <em>almost</em> a smartphone.</p>
<p>The Palma 2 Pro upgrades the 6.1-inch monochrome display from the original to a 6.13-inch color E Ink Kaleido display. That’s the same technology used in Amazon’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/">Kindle Colorsoft</a>. The Amazon reader is a bit larger with its 7-inch display and chunkier bezels. Of course, the Kindle isn’t trying to fit in your pocket like the Palma 2 Pro, which is roughly the size and shape of a phone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/the-android-powered-boox-palma-2-pro-fits-in-your-pocket-but-its-not-a-phone/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>Who are these “friends”? Trump named “great people like [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang, [Salesforce CEO] Marc Benioff, and others” who told him that “the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/troops-in-us-cities-tech-billionaires-are-shaping-that-too/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Tesla rolled out a new firmware update that added a pair of new driving modes for the controversial full self-driving (FSD) feature. One, called “Sloth,” relaxes acceleration and stays in its lane. The other, called “Mad Max,” does the opposite: It speeds and swerves through traffic to get you to your destination faster. And after multiple reports of FSD Teslas doing just that, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to know more.</p>
<p>In fact, “Mad Max” mode is not entirely new—Tesla beta-tested the same feature in Autopilot in 2018, before deciding not to roll it out in a production release after widespread outcry.</p>
<p>These days, the company is evidently feeling less constrained; despite having just lost a federal wrongful death lawsuit that will cost it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/tesla-loses-autopilot-wrongful-death-case-in-329-million-verdict/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a>, it described the new mode as being able to drive “through traffic at an incredible pace, all while still being super smooth. It drives your car like a sports car. If you are running late, this is the mode for you.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/feds-probe-tesla-about-its-mad-max-mode/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Meta violated the Digital Services Act (DSA) by failing to give Facebook and Instagram users simple mechanisms to report illegal content, the European Commission said in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2503">preliminary decision</a> announced yesterday. Meta also failed to give users an effective way to challenge content moderation decisions, the EC said.</p>
<p>“When it comes to Meta, neither Facebook nor Instagram appear to provide a user-friendly and easily accessible ‘Notice and Action’ mechanism for users to flag illegal content, such as child sexual abuse material and terrorist content,” the EC press release said. The EC said that Meta mechanisms seem to “impose several unnecessary steps and additional demands on users. In addition, both Facebook and Instagram appear to use so-called ‘dark patterns,’ or deceptive interface designs, when it comes to the ‘Notice and Action’ mechanisms.”</p>
<p>The EC also found that the content moderation appeal mechanisms used by Facebook and Instagram do not “allow users to provide explanations or supporting evidence to substantiate their appeals. This makes it difficult for users in the EU to further explain why they disagree with Meta’s content decision, limiting the effectiveness of the appeals mechanism.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trump-tariff-threats-havent-stopped-eu-from-cracking-down-on-meta/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is rolling out a new face for its AI, and its name is Mico. The company announced the new, animated blob-like avatar for Copilot’s voice mode yesterday as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsoft-makes-copilot-human-centered-with-a-90s-style-animated-assistant/">a “human-centered” rebranding</a> of Microsoft’s Copilot AI efforts.</p>
<p>Mico is part of a Microsoft program dedicated to the idea that “technology should work in service of people,” Microsoft wrote. The company insists this effort is “not [about] chasing engagement or optimizing for screen time. We’re building AI that gets you back to your life. That deepens human connection.”</p>
<p>Mico has drawn instant and obvious comparisons to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/adorable-redesigned-emoji-including-clippy-included-in-latest-windows-11-update/">Clippy</a>, the animated paperclip that popped up to offer help with Microsoft Office <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QBlKo6o4Ec">starting in the ’90s</a>. Microsoft has leaned into this comparison with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805411/clippy-has-returned-as-a-copilot-easter-egg">an Easter egg that can transform Mico into an animated Clippy</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/microsofts-mico-heightens-the-risks-of-parasocial-llm-relationships/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Electric vehicle startup Rivian announced on Thursday that it has settled a lawsuit with some of its investors. The company continues to deny allegations of making “materially untrue” statements during its inial public offering but says it agreed to pay $250 million to clear itself of distractions as it focuses on building its next EV, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/rivian-reveals-three-new-smaller-electric-suvs-the-r2-r3-and-r3x/">mass-market R2</a>, which is due next year.</p>
<p>Rivian was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/rivian-hit-with-shareholder-lawsuit-over-surprise-ev-truck-price-hike/">first sued by a shareholder in 2022</a> over claims that the startup knew it would cost far more for it to build each R1T electric truck and R1S electric SUV than the advertised $67,500 and $70,000 prices, respectively. A big surprise price increase would tarnish the nascent automaker’s reputation, the lawsuit claimed, and could lead to many of the almost 56,000 pre-orders being canceled.</p>
<p>Just a few months after its November 2021 IPO, the company had indeed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/rivian-surprises-outrages-ev-truck-buyers-with-20-price-hike/">issued a hefty price hike</a>: $79,500 for the R1T and $84,500 for the R1S SUV. After an outcry, the company said it would honor the original price for its existing preorders. By that point, though, the damage was done, and more than a third of the company’s value was erased within a few days, the lawsuit alleged.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/rivian-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-for-250-million-denies-allegations/">Read full article</a></p>
