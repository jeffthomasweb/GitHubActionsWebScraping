<p>A critical vulnerability recently discovered in a widely used piece of software is putting huge swaths of the Internet at risk of devastating hacks, and attackers have already begun actively trying to exploit it in real-world attacks, researchers warn.</p>
<p>The software, known as MOVEit and sold by Progress Software, allows enterprises to transfer and manage files using various specifications, including SFTP, SCP, and HTTP protocols and in ways that comply with regulations mandated under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPAA</a>. At the time this post went live, Internet scans <a href="https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/iot-devices/time-series/?date_range=7&amp;vendor=progress&amp;model=moveit&amp;dataset=count&amp;limit=1000&amp;group_by=geo&amp;style=stacked">indicated</a> it was installed inside almost 1,800 networks around the world, with the biggest number in the US. A separate scan performed Tuesday by security firm Censys <a href="https://censys.com/moveit-transfer-auth-bypass/">found</a> 2,700 such instances.</p>
<h2>Causing mayhem with a null string</h2>
<p>Last year, a critical MOVEit vulnerability led to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/mass-exploitation-of-critical-moveit-flaw-is-ransacking-orgs-big-and-small/">compromise of more than 2,300 organizations</a>, including Shell, British Airways, the US Department of Energy, and Ontario’s government birth registry, BORN Ontario, the latter of which led to the compromise of information for 3.4 million people.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033848#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033848&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft's mid-generation plans for the Xbox Series S and X consoles looked a whole lot different a couple of years ago than it does now. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/ftc-v-microsoft-document-leak-outs-detailed-plans-for-mid-gen-xbox-refresh/">A leaked slide deck from the <em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> case last year</a> outlined detailed plans for a spruced up Series S, an overhauled Series X, and even a redesigned controller. Another part of that roadmap included a streaming-only version of the Xbox, codenamed Keystone, that was designed to connect to Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming servers rather than rendering games locally.</p>

<p>Microsoft has talked openly about this version of the Xbox before. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23460485/microsoft-xbox-streaming-console-keystone-delay-price">told The Verge</a> that the Keystone console was designed and fully functional, but that it wasn't launched because Microsoft had a hard time getting the price down low enough that it made sense next to the $299 Series S (which already occasionally goes on sale in the $200 to $250 range).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033759#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033759&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has identified a synthetic psychedelic compound as well as compounds from a potentially toxic plant in the Diamond Shruumz-brand microdosing candies linked to a growing number of severe illnesses nationwide that have included seizures, intubation, and admissions to intensive care units.</p>
<p>As of June 25, the case total has grown to 39, including 23 hospitalizations, across 20 states, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">the FDA</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/environmental-health-studies/outbreak-investigation-diamond-shruumz-products/index.html#cdc_generic_section_1-outbreak-investigation-summary">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> reported.</p>
<p>It remains unclear what is in the candies and what may be causing the severe illnesses. Diamond Shruumz does not provide a full list of ingredients. The term "microdosing" and other marketing used by Diamond Shruumz suggests the candies contain a psychedelic compound, but the company does not name any. To figure it out, the FDA has been analyzing multiple samples of Diamond Shruumz-brand candies, including chocolates, gummies, and candy cones. On Tuesday, the FDA reported finding the synthetic psychedelic compound 4-AcO-DMT in the company's Dark Chocolate Bar and its Birthday Cake Chocolate Bar.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033774#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033774&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While CRISPR is probably the most prominent gene-editing technology, there are others, some developed before and since. And people have been developing CRISPR variants to perform more specialized functions, like altering specific bases. In all of these cases, researchers are trying to balance a number of competing factors: convenience, flexibility, specificity and precision for the editing, low error rates, and so on.</p>
<p>So, having additional options for editing can be a good thing, enabling new ways of balancing those different needs. On Wednesday, a pair of papers in Nature describe a DNA-based parasite that moves itself around bacterial genomes through a mechanism that hasn't been previously described. It's nowhere near ready for use in humans, but it may have some distinctive features that make it worth further development.</p>
<h2>Going mobile</h2>
<p>Mobile genetic elements, commonly called transposons, are quite common in many species—they make up nearly half the sequences in the human genome, for example. They are indeed mobile, showing up in new locations throughout the genome, sometimes by cutting themselves out and hopping to new locations, other times by sending a copy out to a new place in the genome. For any of this to work, they need to have an enzyme that cuts DNA and specifically recognizes the right transposon sequence to insert into the cut.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033770#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033770&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court tossed out claims that the Biden administration coerced social media platforms into censoring users by removing COVID-19 and election-related content.</p>
<p>Complaints alleging that high-ranking government officials were censoring conservatives had previously convinced a lower court to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/judge-rules-white-house-pressured-social-networks-to-suppress-free-speech/">order an injunction limiting the Biden administration's contacts with platforms</a>. But now that injunction has been overturned, re-opening lines of communication just ahead of the 2024 elections—when officials will once again be closely monitoring the spread of misinformation online targeted at voters.</p>
<p>In a 6–3 vote, the majority ruled that none of the plaintiffs suing—including five social media users and Republican attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri—had standing. They had alleged that the government had "pressured the platforms to censor their speech in violation of the First Amendment," demanding an injunction to stop any future censorship.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033738#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033738&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328025906/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ-7nNw-04Q&amp;google_comment_id=z12fwdq4rt2kzjftz22nz53rrwjgsfgkv">a panel discussion</a> at a space conference in Singapore 11 years ago that has since become legendary in certain corners of the space industry for what it reveals about European attitudes toward upstart SpaceX.</p>
<p>The panel included representatives from a handful of launch enterprises, including Europe-based Arianespace, and the US launch company SpaceX. At one point during the discussion, the host asked the Arianespace representative—its chief of sales in Southeast Asia, Richard Bowles—how the institutional European company would respond to SpaceX's promise of lower launch costs and reuse with the Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>"What I'm discovering in the market is that SpaceX primarily seems to be selling a dream, which is good. We should all dream," Bowles replied. "I think a $5 million launch or a $15 million launch is a bit of a dream. Personally, I think reusability is a dream. How am I going to respond to a dream? My answer to respond to a dream is, first of all, you don't wake people up."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033625#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033625&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla has announced two more recalls of the Cybertruck, both of which affect over 11,000 vehicles produced since the car first became available late last year. Cybertruck owners will need to bring their cars in for service because of faulty windshield wiper motors and a cosmetic piece that could come off the vehicle while it's being driven.</p>

<p>On Monday, Toys "R" Us <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toysrus-studios-and-native-foreign-use-openais-sora-to-narrate-the-origin-story-of-beloved-toyrus-brand-302180332.html">announced</a> that it had partnered with an ad agency called Native Foreign to create what it calls "the first-ever brand film using OpenAI's new text-to-video tool, Sora." OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">debuted Sora</a> in February, but the video synthesis tool has not yet become available to the public. The <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/pages/studios">brand film</a> tells the story of Toys "R" Us founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lazarus">Charles Lazarus</a> using AI-generated video clips.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to partner with Native Foreign to push the boundaries of Sora, a groundbreaking new technology from OpenAI that's gaining global attention," <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/pages/studios">wrote</a> Toys "R" Us on its website. "Sora can create up to one-minute-long videos featuring realistic scenes and multiple characters, all generated from text instruction. Imagine the excitement of creating a young Charles Lazarus, the founder of Toys "R" Us, and envisioning his dreams for our iconic brand and beloved mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe in the early 1930s."</p>
<p>The company says that <em>The Origin of Toys "R" Us</em> commercial was co-produced by Toys "R" Us Studios President Kim Miller Olko as executive producer and Native Foreign's Nik Kleverov as director. "Charles Lazarus was a visionary ahead of his time, and we wanted to honor his legacy with a spot using the most cutting-edge technology available," Miller <span class="xn-person">Olko said in a statement.</span></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033621#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033621&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/">started officially allowing "retro game emulators" on the iOS App Store</a> without the need for cumbersome jailbreaking or sideloading. But if you want to emulate retro PC games on your iOS device, you are apparently still out of luck.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://litchie.com/2024/04/new-hope">a recent blog update</a>, iDOS developer Chaoji Li said that the latest version of <a href="https://litchie.com/dospad">the DOSBox-based MS-DOS emulator</a> was finally rejected from the iOS App Store this month after a lengthy, two-month review process:</p>
<blockquote><p>They have decided that iDOS is not a retro game console, so the new rule is not applicable. They suggested I make changes and resubmit for review, but when I asked what changes I should make to be compliant, they had no idea, nor when I asked what a retro game console is. It's still the same old unreasonable answer along the line of "we know it when we see it."</p></blockquote>
<p>The developer of <a href="https://getutm.app/">iOS Virtual Machine app UTM</a> told a similar tale of App Store rejection <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1799647652134654045">on social media</a>. The reported two-month review process for the UTM app ended with "the App Store review board determin[ing] that 'PC is not a console' regardless of the fact that there are retro Windows/DOS games fo[r] the PC that UTM SE can be useful in running," the developer said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033688#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033688&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Volkswagen is committing $5 billion to upstart EV company Rivian, with $1 billion in cash upfront and $4 billion over time. The companies aim to use this <a href="https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-and-volkswagen-group-announce-plans-for-joint-venture">joint venture</a> to deliver new vehicles "in the second half of the decade," according to the announcement, and the cash will likely help push along Rivian's next generation of vehicles, including more affordable models.</p>

VW Group, which also controls Porsche, Lamborghini, Audi, and Ducati, among others, has a lot to gain from working with Rivian, particularly when it comes to software and ride control. Ars and most other reviewers have been impressed by Rivian's drive engineering and display software on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/rivians-67-500-314-mile-electric-adventure-truck-put-to-the-test/2/">R1T truck</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/rivians-r1s-is-an-electric-suv-for-those-with-an-adventurous-lifestyle/">R1S SUV</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/rivians-revamped-r1-electric-pickup-and-suv-tested-on-and-off-road/">the second generations of them both</a>, which majorly reworked the underpinnings and offerings, largely through design and software choices.</p>
<p>Volkswagen's recent software moves have been on an opposing trajectory. The Group's 2019 moves to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/">align all its brands' software under one division</a>, Cariad, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/whats-going-on-with-volkswagens-software-division/">three platforms developed at once</a>, has led to massive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/volkswagens-troubled-software-division-is-getting-new-leadership-again/">leadership shake-ups and restarts</a>.

<p>YouTube is in talks with record labels to license their songs for artificial intelligence tools that clone popular artists’ music, hoping to win over a skeptical industry with upfront payments.</p>
<p>The Google-owned video site needs labels’ content to legally train AI song generators, as it prepares to launch new tools this year, according to three people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The company has recently offered lump sums of cash to the major labels—Sony, Warner, and Universal—to try to convince more artists to allow their music to be used in training AI software, according to several people briefed on the talks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033608#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033608&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Star Wars franchise is creeping up on the 50-year mark for the original 1977 film that started it all, and Disney+ has successfully kept things fresh with its line of live-action Star Wars spinoff series. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/andor-first-impressions-star-wars-inches-toward-the-best-of-modern-adult-tv/"><em>Andor</em></a> were both unquestionably popular and critical successes, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/review-the-book-of-boba-fett-is-lots-of-fun-but-its-really-the-mandalorian-2-5/"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a> ultimately proved disappointing, focusing less on our favorite bounty hunter and more on setting up the third season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi_(miniseries)"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)"><em>Ahsoka</em></a> fell somewhere in between, bolstered by strong performances from its leads but often criticized for sluggish pacing.</p>
<p>It's unclear where the latest addition to the TV franchise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>, will ultimately fall, but the first five episodes aired thus far bode well for its place in the growing canon. The series eschews the usual Star Wars space-battle fare for a quieter, space Western detective story—who is killing the great Jedi masters of the galaxy?—with highly choreographed fight scenes that draw heavily from the martial arts. And like its predecessors, <em>The Acolyte</em> is recognizably Star Wars<em>.</em> Yet it also boasts a unique aesthetic style that is very much its own.</p>

<p>Researchers claim to have developed a new way to run AI language models more efficiently by eliminating matrix multiplication from the process. This fundamentally redesigns neural network operations that are currently accelerated by GPU chips. The findings, detailed in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02528">recent preprint paper</a> from researchers at the University of California Santa Cruz, UC Davis, LuxiTech, and Soochow University, could have deep implications for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/is-generative-ai-really-going-to-wreak-havoc-on-the-power-grid/">environmental impact</a> and operational costs of AI systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication">Matrix multiplication</a> (often abbreviated to "MatMul") is at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/deepmind-breaks-50-year-math-record-using-ai-new-record-falls-a-week-later/">center</a> of most neural network computational tasks today, and GPUs are particularly good at executing the math quickly because they can perform large numbers of multiplication operations in parallel. That ability momentarily made Nvidia the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-ascent-to-most-valuable-company-has-echoes-of-dot-com-boom-dd836c90">most valuable company</a> in the world last week; the company currently holds an estimated <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/06/10/nvidia-shipped-3-76-million-data-center-gpus-in-2023-according-to-study/">98 percent market share</a> for data center GPUs, which are commonly used to power AI systems like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/google-launches-gemini-a-powerful-ai-model-it-says-can-surpass-gpt-4/">Google Gemini</a>.</p>
<p>In the new paper, titled "Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling," the researchers describe creating a custom 2.7 billion parameter model without using MatMul that features similar performance to conventional large language models (LLMs). They also demonstrate running a 1.3 billion parameter model at 23.8 tokens per second on a GPU that was accelerated by a custom-programmed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a> chip that uses about 13 watts of power (not counting the GPU's power draw). The implication is that a more efficient FPGA "paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures," they write.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033314#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033314&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/">MDMA therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder dramatically failed to impress Food and Drug Administration advisers</a> earlier this month, researchers are moving forward with another psychedelic—a slow-release oral dose of the hallucinogenic drug ketamine—as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p>In a mid-stage, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, researchers tested slow-release ketamine pills, taken twice weekly. The trial, sponsored by New Zealand-based Douglas Pharmaceuticals, found ketamine to be safe compared with placebo. At the trial's highest dose, the treatment showed some efficacy against depression in patients who had previously tried an average of nearly five antidepressants without success, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03063-x">according to the results published Monday in Nature Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>But the Phase II trial, which started with 231 participants, indicated that the pool of patients who may benefit from the treatment could be quite limited. The researchers behind the trial chose an unusual "enrichment" design to test the depression treatment. This was intended to thwart the high failure rates generally seen in trials for depression treatments, even in patients without treatment-resistant cases. But even after selecting patients who initially responded to ketamine, 59.5 percent of the enriched participants still dropped out of the trial before its completion, largely due to a lack of efficacy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033492#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033492&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The gryphon, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin">griffin</a>, is a legendary creature dating back to classical antiquity, sporting the body, legs, and tail of a lion and the wings, head, and front talons of an eagle. Since the 1980s, a popular "geomyth" has spread that the griffin's unique appearance was inspired by the fossilized skeleton of a horned dinosaur known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoceratops"><em>Protoceratops</em></a>. It's a fascinating and colorful story, but according to the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03080188241255543">new paper</a> published in the journal Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, there is no hard evidence to support such a connection.</p>
<p>"Everything about griffin origins is consistent with their traditional interpretation as imaginary beasts, just as their appearance is entirely explained by them being [mythological] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)">chimeras</a> of big cats and raptorial birds," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1048872">said co-author Mark Witton</a>, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth. "Invoking a role for dinosaurs in griffin lore, especially species from distant lands like <em>Protoceratops</em>, not only introduces unnecessary complexity and inconsistencies to their origins, but also relies on interpretations and proposals that don’t withstand scrutiny.”</p>
<p>There are representations of griffin-like creatures in ancient Egyptian art dated to before 3000 BCE, while in ancient Greek and Roman texts the creatures were associated with gold deposits in Central Asia. By the Middle Ages, griffins were common figures in medieval iconography and in heraldry. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippogriff">hippogriff</a> named Buckbeak in <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> is a related mythical creature, the product of a griffin and a mare.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032976#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032976&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Almost exactly two years ago, as it prepared for the next generation of human spaceflight, NASA chose a pair of private companies to design and develop new spacesuits. These were to be new spacesuits that would allow astronauts to both perform spacewalks outside the International Space Station as well as walk on the Moon as part of the Artemis program.</p>
<p>Now, that plan appears to be in trouble, with one of the spacesuit providers—Collins Aerospace—expected to back out, Ars has learned. It's a blow for NASA, because the space agency really needs modern spacesuits.</p>
<p>NASA's Apollo-era suits have long been retired. The current suits used for spacewalks in low-Earth orbit are four decades old. "These new capabilities will allow us to continue on the ISS and allows us to do the Artemis program and continue on to Mars," said the director of Johnson Space Center, Vanessa Wyche, during a celebratory news conference in Houston <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/nasa-announces-a-new-plan-to-buy-private-spacesuits-to-make-lunar-landing-date/">two years ago</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033392#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033392&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Verizon Wireless agreed to pay a $1,050,000 penalty to the US Treasury and implement a compliance plan because of a 911 outage in December 2022 that was caused by a botched update, the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-settles-verizon-911-outage-violations-over-1-million">announced</a> today.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-578A1.pdf">consent decree</a> explains that the outage was caused by "the reapplication of a known flawed security policy update file." During the outage, lasting one hour and 44 minutes, Verizon failed to deliver hundreds of 911 calls in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, the FCC said.</p>
<p>"The [FCC] Enforcement Bureau takes any potential violations of the Commission's 911 rules extremely seriously. Sunny day outages, as occurred here, can be especially troubling because they occur when the public and 911 call centers least expect it," Bureau Chief Loyaan Egal said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033451#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033451&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gaming news site PCGamesN has a web tool, <a href="https://www.steamidfinder.com/">SteamIDFinder</a>, that can do a neat trick. If you buy PC games on Steam and have your user profile set to make your gaming details public, you can enter your numeric user ID into it and see a bunch of stats. One set of stats is dedicated to the total value of the games listed as unplayed; you can share this page as an image linking to your "Pile of Shame," which includes the total "Value" of your Steam collection and unplayed games.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img alt="Example findings from SteamIDFinder, from someone who likely has hundreds of games from Humble Bundles and other deals in their library." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Example findings from SteamIDFinder, from someone who likely has hundreds of games from Humble Bundles and other deals in their library. (credit: SteamIDFinder)</p></div>
<p>Using data from what it claims are the roughly 10 percent of 73 million Steam accounts in its database set to Public, PCGamesN extrapolates $1.9 billion in unplayed games, multiplies it by 10, and casually suggests that <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam/pile-of-shame">there are $19 billion in unplayed games hanging around</a>. That is "more than the gross national product of Nicaragua, Niger, Chad, or Mauritius," the site notes.</p>
<h2>That is a very loose “$19 billion”</h2>
<p>"Multiply by 10" is already a pretty soft science, but the numbers are worth digging into further. For starters, SteamIDFinder is using the current sale price of every game in your unplayed library, as confirmed by looking at a half-dozen "Pile of Shame" profiles. An informal poll of Ars Technica co-workers and friends with notable Steam libraries suggests that games purchased at full price make up a tiny fraction of the games in our backlogs. Games acquired through package deals, like the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a>, or during one of Steam's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/steam-summer-sale-best-deals-hidden-gems-indie-games/">annual or one-time sales</a>, are a big part of most people's Steam catalogs, I'd reckon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033313#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033313&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Late last week, both <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-data-centers-power-grids/">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/21/artificial-intelligence-nuclear-fusion-climate/">The Washington Post</a> published stories focused on the ostensibly disastrous impact artificial intelligence is having on the power grid and on efforts to collectively reduce our use of fossil fuels. The high-profile pieces lean heavily on recent projections from <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6b2fd954-2017-408e-bf08-952fdd62118a/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf">the International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) to cast AI's "insatiable" demand for energy as an almost apocalyptic threat to our power infrastructure. The Post piece even cites anonymous "some [people]" in reporting that "some worry whether there will be enough electricity to meet [the power demands] from any source."</p>
<p>Digging into the best available numbers and projections available, though, it's hard to see AI's current and near-future environmental impact in such a dire light. While generative AI models and tools can and will use a significant amount of energy, we shouldn't conflate AI energy usage with the larger and largely pre-existing energy usage of "data centers" as a whole. And just like any technology, whether that AI energy use is worthwhile depends largely on your wider opinion of the value of generative AI in the first place.</p>
<h2>Not all data centers</h2>
<p>While the headline focus of both Bloomberg and The Washington Post's recent pieces is on artificial intelligence, the actual numbers and projections cited in both pieces overwhelmingly focus on the energy used by Internet "data centers" as a whole. Long before generative AI became the current Silicon Valley buzzword, those data centers were already growing immensely in size and energy usage, powering everything from Amazon Web Services servers to online gaming services, Zoom video calls, and cloud storage and retrieval for billions of documents and photos, to name just a few of the more common uses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033273#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033273&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
