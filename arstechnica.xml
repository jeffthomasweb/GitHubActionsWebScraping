                            <![CDATA[<p>On November 2, 1988, graduate student Robert Morris <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/morris-worm-30-years-since-first-major-attack-on-internet-110218">released</a> a self-replicating program into the early Internet. Within 24 hours, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">Morris worm</a> had infected roughly 10 percent of all connected computers, crashing systems at Harvard, Stanford, NASA, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The worm exploited security flaws in Unix systems that administrators knew existed but had not bothered to patch.</p>
<p>Morris did not intend to cause damage. He wanted to measure the size of the Internet. But a coding error caused the worm to replicate far faster than expected, and by the time he tried to send instructions for removing it, the network was too clogged to deliver the message.</p>
<p>History may soon repeat itself with a novel new platform: networks of AI agents carrying out instructions from prompts and sharing them with other AI agents, which could spread the instructions further.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/the-rise-of-moltbook-suggests-viral-ai-prompts-may-be-the-next-big-security-threat/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The launch of NASA's Artemis II mission, the first flight of astronauts to the Moon in more than 53 years, will have to wait another month after a fueling test Monday uncovered hydrogen leaks in the connection between the rocket and its launch platform at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>"Engineers pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives," NASA said in a statement following the conclusion of the mock countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), early Tuesday morning. "To allow teams to review data and conduct a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, NASA now will target March as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test."</p>
<p>The practice countdown was designed to identify problems and provide NASA an opportunity to fix them before launch. Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/unable-to-tame-hydrogen-leaks-nasa-delays-launch-of-artemis-ii-until-march/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you know anything about the history of id Software, you know how 1992's <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/306/wolfenstein-3d/"><em>Wolfenstein 3D</em></a> helped establish the company's leadership in the burgeoning first-person shooter genre, leading directly to subsequent hits like <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em>. But only the serious id Software nerds remember <em>Catacomb 3D</em>, id's first-person adventure game that directly preceded and inspired work on <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>.</p>
<p>Now, nearly 35 years after <em>Catacomb 3D</em>'s initial release, id co-founder John Romero brought the company's founding members together for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcUqwMf01pI">an informative retrospective video</a> on the creation of the oft-forgotten game. But the pioneering game—which included mouse support, color-coded keys, and shooting walls to find secrets—almost ended up being a gimmicky dead end for the company.</p>

<h2>Texture maps and "undo" animation</h2>
<p><em>Catacomb 3D</em> was a follow-up to <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/16300/catacomb/">id's earlier <em>Catacomb</em></a>, which was a simplified clone of the popular arcade hit <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1837/gauntlet/"><em>Gauntlet</em></a>. As such, the 3D game still has some of that "quarter eater" mentality that was not very fashionable in PC gaming at the time, as John Carmack remembered.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/looking-back-at-catacomb-3d-the-game-that-led-to-wolfenstein-3d/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Crunchyroll is one of the most popular streaming platforms for anime viewers. Over the past six years, the service has raised prices for fans, and today, it announced that it's increasing monthly subscription prices by up to 25 percent.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/att-sells-crunchyroll-to-sony-for-1-2b-amid-streamlining-efforts/">Sony bought Crunchyroll</a> from AT&amp;T in 2020. At the time, Crunchyroll had 3 million paid subscribers and an additional 197 million users with free accounts, which let people watch a limited number of titles with commercials. At the time, Crunchyroll monthly subscription tiers cost $8, $10, or $15.</p>
<p>After its acquisition by Sony, like many <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/broadcoms-prohibitive-vmware-prices-create-a-learning-barrier-it-pro-says/">large technology companies</a> that buy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/an-absolute-mess-google-seemingly-ignores-hundreds-of-fitbit-complaints/">a smaller, beloved product</a>, the company made controversial changes.

"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!"</p>
<p>The merging of what is arguably Musk's most successful company, SpaceX, with the more speculative xAI venture is a risk. Founded in 2023, xAI's main products are the generative AI chatbot, Grok, and the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. The company aims to compete with OpenAI and other artificial intelligence firms. However, Grok has been controversial, including the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/uk-investigating-x-after-grok-undressed-thousands-of-women-and-children/">sexualization of women and children</a> through AI-generated images, as has Musk's management of Twitter.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/spacex-acquires-xai-plans-1-million-satellite-constellation-to-power-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ukraine and SpaceX say they recently collaborated to stop strikes by Russian drones using Starlink and will soon block all unregistered use of Starlink terminals in an attempt to stop Russia's military from using the satellite broadband network over Ukraine territory.</p>
<p>Ukrainians will soon be required to register their Starlink terminals to get on a whitelist. After that, "only verified and registered terminals will be allowed to operate in the country. All others will be disconnected," the Ukraine Ministry of Defense said in a <a href="https://mod.gov.ua/en/news/ukraine-rolls-out-starlink-terminal-verification-to-counter-russian-aerial-terror">press release</a> today.</p>
<p>Ukraine Minister of Defense Mykhailo Fedorov "emphasized that the only technical solution to counter this threat is to introduce a 'whitelist' and authorize all terminals," according to the ministry. "This is a necessary step by the Government to save Ukrainian lives and protect critical energy infrastructure," Fedorov said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/russian-drones-use-starlink-but-ukraine-has-plan-to-block-their-internet-access/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration is no fan of renewable energy, but it reserves special ire for wind power. Trump himself has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/wind-turbines-power-electricity-energy-trump-5eb370dfb407b86a11d420917e4acaba">repeatedly made false statements</a> about the cost of wind power, its use around the world, and its environmental impacts. That animosity was paired with an executive order that blocked all permitting for offshore wind and some land-based projects, an order that has since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trumps-order-blocking-wind-development-thrown-out-by-court/">been thrown out</a> by a court that ruled it arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p>Not content to block all future developments, the administration has also gone after the five offshore wind projects currently under construction. After temporarily blocking two of them for reasons that were never fully elaborated, the Department of the Interior settled on a single justification for blocking turbine installation: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/us-government-finds-new-excuse-to-stop-construction-of-offshore-wind/">a classified national security risk</a>.</p>
<p>The response to that late-December announcement has been uniform: The companies building each of the projects sued the administration. As of Monday, every single one of them has achieved the same result: a temporary injunction that allows them to continue construction. This, despite the fact that the suits were filed in three different courts and heard by four different judges.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/court-orders-restart-of-all-us-offshore-wind-construction/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Infrastructure delivering updates for Notepad++—a widely used text editor for Windows—was compromised for six months by suspected China-state hackers who used their control to deliver backdoored versions of the app to select targets, developers said Monday.</p>
<p>“I deeply apologize to all users affected by this hijacking,” the author of a <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/hijacked-incident-info-update/">post</a> published to the official <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">notepad-plus-plus.org</a> site wrote Monday. The post said that the attack began last June with an “infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org.” The attackers, whom multiple investigators tied to the Chinese government, then selectively redirected certain targeted users to malicious update servers where they received backdoored updates. Notepad++ didn’t regain control of its infrastructure until December.</p>
<p>The attackers used their access to install a <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/">never-before-seen payload</a> that has been dubbed Chrysalis.

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cracked down on lead-based products—including lead paint and leaded gasoline—in the 1970s because of its toxic effects on human health. Scientists at the University of Utah have analyzed human hair samples spanning nearly 100 years and found a 100-fold decrease in lead concentrations, concluding that this regulatory action was highly effective in achieving its stated objectives. They described their findings in a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>We've known about the dangers of lead exposure for a very long time—arguably since the second century BCE—so why conduct this research now? Per the authors, it's because there are growing concerns over the Trump administration's move last year to deregulate many key elements of the EPA's mission. Lead specifically has not yet been deregulated, but there are hints that there could be a loosening of enforcement of the 2024 Lead and Cooper rule requiring water systems to replace old lead pipes.</p>
<p>“We should not forget the lessons of history. And the lesson is those regulations have been very important,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1114464?">said co-author Thure Cerling</a>. “Sometimes they seem onerous and mean that industry can't do exactly what they'd like to do when they want to do it or as quickly as they want to do it. But it's had really, really positive effects.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/a-century-of-hair-samples-proves-leaded-gas-ban-worked/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The latest price hike news comes courtesy of Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton, who <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/more-memory-driven-price-rises/">announced</a> today that the company would be raising prices on most of its single-board computers for the second time in two months.</p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, a judge ruled that the Trump administration violated the law in forming its Climate Working Group, which released a report that was intended to undercut the rationale behind greenhouse gas regulations. The judge overseeing the case determined that the government tried to treat the Climate Working Group as a formal advisory body, while not having it obey many of the statutory requirements that govern such bodies.</p>
<p>While the Department of Energy (DOE) later disbanded the Climate Working Group in the hopes of avoiding legal scrutiny, documents obtained during the proceedings have now revealed the group's electronic communications. As such, the judge ruled that the trial itself had essentially overcome the government's illegal attempts to hide those communications.</p>
<h2>Legal and scientific flaws</h2>
<p>The whole saga derives from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2007/04/supreme-court-sends-carbon-regulation-back-to-the-epa/">a Supreme Court Ruling</a> that compelled the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to evaluate the risks posed to the US public by greenhouse gases. During the Obama administration, this resulted in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-trumps-epa-hopes-to-avoid-greenhouse-gas-regulations/">an endangerment finding</a> that created the foundation for the EPA to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act. The science underlying the endangerment finding was so solid that it was left unchallenged during the first Trump administration.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/us-forced-to-disclose-its-climate-working-groups-communications/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on Friday included at least a few dozen unredacted nude photos and names of at least 43 victims, according to news reports.</p>
<p>The DOJ missed a December 19 deadline set by the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a> by more than a month, but still released the files without fully redacting nude photos and names of Jeffrey Epstein's victims. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/01/us/nude-photos-epstein-files.html">reported</a> yesterday that it found "nearly 40 unredacted images that appeared to be part of a personal photo collection, showing both nude bodies and the faces of the people portrayed."</p>
<p>While the people in the photos were young, "it was unclear whether they were minors," the article said. "Some of the images seemed to show Mr. Epstein’s private island, including a beach. Others were taken in bedrooms and other private spaces." The photos "appeared to show at least seven different people," the article said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/doj-released-epstein-files-with-dozens-of-nudes-and-victims-names-reports-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Intel's Core Ultra lineup of desktop and laptop processors has been frustrating to review. None of them has been across-the-board awful or totally without redeeming qualities. But Intel has struggled mightily this decade to produce new processors that are straightforward, easy-to-recommend improvements over their predecessors.</p>
<p>The company's 12th- and 13th-generation Core chips offered big boosts to CPU performance over the 11th-generation CPUs, for example, but they also usually came with a significant hit to battery life, and they only minimally improved the GPU. The first-generation Core Ultra chips, codenamed Meteor Lake, improved the GPU but couldn't beat the CPU performance of older chips. Last year's Core Ultra 200V series, codenamed Lunar Lake, boasted good battery life and solid graphics performance but weaker CPU performance; better-performing Core Ultra 200H chips (codenamed Arrow Lake) improved CPU performance but came with lesser GPUs and some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">other missing features</a>.</p>
<p>The Core Ultra Series 3 processors, codenamed Panther Lake, finally put an end to the years of uneven zig-zagging advancement we've seen in the last half-decade.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/intel-panther-lake-core-ultra-review-intels-best-laptop-cpu-in-a-very-long-time/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A debilitating infection from the parasitic Guinea worm is inching closer to global eradication, with an all-time low of only 10 human cases reported worldwide in 2025, <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/news/guinea-worm-announcement/">the Carter Center announced</a>.</p>
<p>If health workers can fully wipe out the worms, it will be only the second human disease to be eradicated, after smallpox.</p>
<p>Guinea worm (<em>Dracunculus medinensis</em>) is a parasitic nematode transmitted in water. More specifically, it's found in waters that contain small crustacean copepods, which harbor the worm's larvae. If a person consumes water contaminated with Guinea worm, the parasites burrow through the intestinal tract and migrate through the body. About a year later, a spaghetti noodle-length worm emerges from a painful blister, usually in the feet or legs. It can take up to eight weeks for the adult worm to fully emerge. To ease the searing pain, infected people may put their blistered limbs in water, allowing the parasite to release more larvae and continue the cycle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/guinea-worm-on-track-to-be-2nd-eradicated-human-disease-only-10-cases-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Today, OpenAI launched a macOS desktop app for Codex, its large language model-based coding tool that was previously used through a command line interface (CLI) on the web or inside an integrated development environment (IDE) via extensions.</p>
<p>By launching a desktop app, OpenAI is catching up to Anthropic's popular Claude Code, which already offered a macOS version. Whether the desktop app makes sense compared to the existing interfaces depends a little bit on who you are and how you intend to use it.</p>
<p>The Codex macOS app aims to make it easier to manage multiple coding agents in tandem, sometimes with parallel tasks running over several hours—the company argues that neither the CLI nor the IDE extensions are ideal interfaces for that.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openai-picks-up-pace-against-claude-code-with-new-codex-desktop-app/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It has been difficult at times for new mainline releases in the Civilization series of games to win over new players right out of the gate. For <em>Civilization VII</em>—which launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">just shy of one year ago</a>—the struggles seemed to go deeper, with some players saying it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/civilization-vii-one-month-later-the-community-and-developers-chime-in/">didn't feel</a> like a Civilization game.</p>
<p><em>Civ VII’</em>s developer, Firaxis Games, announced today it is planning an update this spring called "Test of Time" that rethinks a few unpopular changes, in some cases replacing key mechanics from the original release.</p>
<p>I spoke with Ed Beach, the Civilization franchise's creative director, as well as Dennis Shirk, its executive producer, about what's changing, the team's interpretation of the player backlash to the choices in the initial release, and Firaxis and 2K's plans for the future of the Civilization model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/interview-civilization-viis-devs-on-the-big-update-meant-to-win-critics-back/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Back in November, <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> publisher Paradox <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/cities-skylines-upheaval-developer-and-publisher-announce-mutual-breakup/">made the surprising announcement</a> that longtime series developer Colossal Order would be ceasing work on the series as part of a "mutual" breakup. Now, we're getting our first glimpse into the kinds of patches and upgrades new developer Iceflake (<em>Surviving the Aftermath</em>) is prioritizing for the popular city-builder going forward.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/502848649741467986?l=english">a City Corner Developer Diary</a> posted late last week, Iceflake focuses mainly on the visual improvements it's planning for its first major <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> patch. Chief among these is improvements to the game's user interface that Iceflake admits can "sometimes be a bit confusing when it comes to communicating things."</p>
<p>The new patch will include a "streamlined" onboarding process for new cities, more expressive and context-aware icons, and toolbars with clearer colors and visual style. A new in-game Encyclopedia will also let players search through information about different gameplay topics, though that feature likely won't be ready for Iceflake's first patch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/heres-what-cities-skylines-2s-new-developer-is-updating-first/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For most of their evolutionary history, narwhals have relied more on sound than sight to survive in the Arctic’s dark icy waters.</p>
<p>The speckled toothed whales—sometimes referred to as “unicorns of the sea” for the long, spiral tusks that protrude from the heads of males—navigate, hunt, and communicate using echolocation. By emitting a series of calls, whistles, and high frequency clicks—as many as a thousand per second—and listening for the echoes that bounce back, they are able to locate prey hundreds to thousands of feet deep and detect narrow cracks in sea ice where they can surface to breathe.</p>
<p>But as global temperatures continue to rise, the acoustic world narwhals depend on is rapidly shifting throughout their range, from northeastern Canada and Greenland to Norway’s Svalbard archipelago and Arctic waters in Russia. It’s getting louder.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/narwhals-become-quieter-as-the-arctic-ocean-grows-louder/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If all goes according to plan Monday, NASA's launch team at Kennedy Space Center in Florida will load more than 700,000 gallons of super-cold propellants into the rocket built to send the Artemis II mission toward the Moon.</p>
<p>The fuel loading is part of a simulated countdown for the Space Launch System rocket, a final opportunity for engineers to rehearse for the day NASA will send four astronauts on a nearly 10-day voyage around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth. The Artemis II mission will send humans farther from Earth than ever before. The astronauts will be the first to launch on NASA's SLS rocket and the first people to travel to the vicinity of the Moon in more than 53 years.</p>
<p>Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA's launch director for the Artemis II mission, will supervise the practice countdown from a firing room inside the Launch Control Center a few miles away from the SLS rocket at Kennedy Space Center. In a recent briefing with reporters, she called the Wet Dress Rehearsal—"wet" refers to the loading of liquid propellants—the "best risk reduction test" for verifying all is ready to proceed into the real countdown.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-gears-up-for-one-more-key-test-before-launching-artemis-ii-to-the-moon/">Read full article</a></p>

These political appointees help carry out the president’s agenda, and, at least in theory, make government agencies responsive to elected officials.</p>
<p>Some of these roles—the secretary of state, for example—are well-known. Others, such as the deputy assistant secretary for textiles, consumer goods, materials, critical minerals &amp; metals industry &amp; analysis, are more obscure.</p>
<p>Historically, science agencies like NASA or the National Institutes of Health tend to have fewer political appointees than many other parts of the federal government. Sometimes, very senior roles—with authority over billions of dollars of spending, and the power to shape entire fields of research—are filled without any direct input from the White House or Congress. The arrangement reflects a long-running argument that scientists should oversee the work of funding and conducting research with very little interference from political leaders.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/at-nih-a-power-struggle-over-institute-directorships-deepens/">Read full article</a></p>
