              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX launched its sixth Starship rocket Tuesday, proving for the first time that the stainless steel ship can maneuver in space and paving the way for an even larger, upgraded vehicle slated to debut on the next test flight.</p>
<p>The only hiccup was an abortive attempt to catch the rocket's Super Heavy booster back at the launch site in South Texas, something SpaceX achieved on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/the-key-moment-came-38-minutes-after-starship-roared-off-the-launch-pad/">previous flight October 13</a>. The Starship upper stage flew halfway around the world, reaching an altitude of 118 miles (190 kilometers) before plunging through the atmosphere for a pinpoint slow-speed splashdown in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The sixth flight of the world's largest launcher<span class="s1">—standing 398 feet (121.3 meters) tall</span><span class="s1">—began with a lumbering liftoff</span> from SpaceX's Starbase facility near the US-Mexico border at 4 pm CST (22:00 UTC) Tuesday. The rocket headed east over the Gulf of Mexico propelled by 33 Raptor engines clustered on the bottom of its Super Heavy first stage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/the-key-moment-came-38-minutes-after-starship-roared-off-the-launch-pad/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Starlink waitlist is back in certain parts of the US, including several large cities on the West Coast and in Texas. The <a href="https://www.starlink.com/map">Starlink availability map</a> says the service is sold out in and around Seattle; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; San Diego; Sacramento, California; and Austin, Texas. Neighboring cities and towns are included in the sold-out zones.</p>
<p>There are additional sold-out areas in small parts of Colorado, Montana, and North Carolina. As PCMag <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/sold-out-spacex-revives-starlink-waitlist-in-parts-of-the-us">noted yesterday</a>, the change comes about a year after Starlink added capacity and <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacexs-starlink-adds-enough-capacity-to-lift-waitlist-for-us">removed its waitlist</a> throughout the US.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in North America, there are some sold-out areas in Canada and Mexico. Across the Atlantic, Starlink is sold out in London and neighboring cities. Starlink is not yet available in most of Africa, and some of the areas where it is available are sold out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/starlink-brings-back-waitlist-in-parts-of-us-says-service-is-sold-out/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"Who up missing Musi?" a Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Musi_App/comments/1gsw582/who_up_missing_musi/">posted</a> in a community shocked by the free music streaming app's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/controversial-spotify-rival-musi-sues-apple-over-shady-youtube-takedown/">sudden removal from Apple's App Store</a> in September.</p>
<p>Apple kicked Musi out of the App Store after receiving several copyright complaints. Musi works by streaming music from YouTube—seemingly avoiding paying to license songs—and YouTube was unsurprisingly chief among those urging Apple to stop allowing the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>Musi was previously only available through the App Store. Once Musi was removed from the App Store, anyone who downloaded Musi could continue using the app uninterrupted. But if the app was ever off-loaded during an update or if the user got a new phone, there would be no way to regain access to their Musi app or their playlists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/fans-mourn-loss-of-music-streaming-app-accused-of-ripping-off-youtube/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[New work provides a good view of where the field currently stands.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In September, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/microsoft-performs-operations-with-multiple-error-corrected-qubits/">made an unusual combination of announcements</a>. It demonstrated progress with quantum error correction, something that will be needed for the technology to move much beyond the interesting demo phase, using hardware from a quantum computing startup called Quantinuum. At the same time, however, the company also announced that it was forming a partnership with a different startup, Atom Computing, which uses a different technology to make qubits available for computations.</p>
<p>Given that, it was probably inevitable that the folks in Redmond, Washington, would want to show that similar error correction techniques would also work with Atom Computing's hardware. It didn't take long, as the two companies are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11822">releasing a draft manuscript</a> describing their work on error correction today. The paper serves as both a good summary of where things currently stand in the world of error correction, as well as a good look at some of the distinct features of computation using neutral atoms.</p>
<h2>Atoms and errors</h2>
<p>While we have various technologies that provide a way of storing and manipulating bits of quantum information, none of them can be operated error-free. At present, errors make it difficult to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/">perform even the simplest computations</a> that are clearly beyond the capabilities of classical computers. More sophisticated algorithms would inevitably encounter an error before they could be completed, a situation that would remain true even if we could somehow improve the hardware error rates of qubits by a factor of 1,000—something we're unlikely to ever be able to do.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/how-to-fix-quantum-computing-errors-neutral-atom-edition/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last week, Niantic <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel">announced plans</a> to create an AI model for navigating the physical world using scans collected from players of its mobile games, such as <em>Pokémon Go</em>, and from users of its <a href="https://scaniverse.com/">Scaniverse</a> app, reports <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/">404 Media</a>.</p>
<p>All AI models require training data. So far, companies have collected data from websites, YouTube videos, books, audio sources, and more, but this is perhaps the first we've heard of AI training data collected through a mobile gaming app.</p>
<p>"Over the past five years, Niantic has focused on building our Visual Positioning System (VPS), which uses a single image from a phone to determine its position and orientation using a 3D map built from people scanning interesting locations in our games and Scaniverse," Niantic wrote in a company blog post.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/niantic-uses-pokemon-go-player-data-to-build-ai-navigation-system/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The world is full of feel-bad news. Here’s something to feel good about: Automatic emergency braking is one of the great car safety-tech success stories.</p>
<p>Auto-braking systems, called AEB for short, use sensors including cameras, radar, and lidar to sense when a crash is about to happen and warn drivers—then automatically apply the brakes if drivers don’t respond. It’s a handy thing to have in those vital few moments before your car careens into the back of another. One industry group <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/automakers-fulfill-autobrake-pledge-for-light-duty-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/automakers-fulfill-autobrake-pledge-for-light-duty-vehicles" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/automakers-fulfill-autobrake-pledge-for-light-duty-vehicles"}'>estimates</a> that US automakers' move to install AEB on most cars—something they did voluntarily, in cooperation with road safety advocates—will prevent 42,000 crashes and 20,000 injuries by 2025.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the streaming world, Apple has a reputation for quality, thanks to its Apple TV hardware and Apple TV+ streaming service. The latter is best associated with original shows and movies surrounded by <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-tv-wins-10-primetime-emmy-awards">award buzz</a> and critical acclaim. But despite that success, Apple's streaming service has hardly made a dent in the market at a time when interest in streaming services is bigger than ever.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/apple-tv-subscription-service-soft-launches-november-1-for-4-99mo/">launched</a> in 2019. Since then, the company has spent over $20 billion to build an impressive library of original content, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-21/apple-tries-to-rein-in-hollywood-spending-after-years-of-losses?sref=W6GJF3MS">Bloomberg</a> reported earlier this year. Yet, despite a highly regarded library of shows and movies with big names in acting and directing, Apple TV+ only garnered <a href="https://observer.com/2024/08/apple-tv-plus-streaming-war/">0.3 percent</a> of US screen viewing time in June 2024, per Nielsen.</p>
<p>In July, Bloomberg aptly underscored how minimally competitive Apple TV+ is, writing: "Apple TV+ generates less viewing in one month than Netflix does in one day."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-tv-spent-20b-on-original-content-if-only-people-actually-watched/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission's plan to investigate and potentially regulate data caps is all but dead now, after President-elect Donald Trump's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trumps-fcc-chair-is-brendan-carr-who-wants-to-regulate-everyone-except-isps/">announcement</a> that he will promote Commissioner Brendan Carr to the chairmanship role.</p>
<p>The FCC last month <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-explores-how-broadband-data-caps-impact-competition-and-consumers">voted 3–2</a> to open a formal inquiry into how broadband data caps affect consumers and whether the commission has authority to regulate how Internet service providers impose such caps. The proceeding is continuing for now, as the FCC comment and reply comment deadlines are November 14 and December 2. You can view the docket <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(proceedings.name:(%2223-199%22))">here</a>.</p>
<p>Broadband industry lobby groups knew they would face no possibility of data-cap regulation once Trump won the election. But they submitted their comments late last week, making the case that data caps are good for customers and that the FCC has no authority to regulate them—the same arguments that Carr made when he dissented from the vote to open an inquiry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/cable-companies-and-trumps-fcc-chair-agree-data-caps-are-good-for-you/">Read full article</a></p>

It's hard to imagine topping <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/ms-flight-simulator-our-yoke-on-look-at-new-features-gorgeous-flights/5/">the 2020 version</a>, which contained the entire world, at scale, 3D modeled and able to be flown over. It had real-time weather and rather detailed physics. You could theoretically fly a helicopter back to your high school football field and land on it, like 15-year reunion royalty. What could come next?</p>

            <![CDATA[After claims of high-temp superconductivity were retracted, Ranga Dias lost his university job.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>University of Rochester physicist Ranga Dias made headlines with his controversial claims of high-temperature superconductivity—and made headlines again when the two papers reporting the breakthroughs were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/room-temperature-superconductor-works-at-lower-pressures/">later retracted</a> under suspicion of <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/40">scientific misconduct</a>, although Dias denied any wrongdoing. The university conducted a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/report-superconductivity-researcher-found-to-have-committed-misconduct/">formal investigation</a> over the past year and has now terminated Dias' employment, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/university-rochester-ranga-dias-superconductor-misconduct-61288727?st=oLtc1D&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">reported</a>.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>“In the past year, the university completed a fair and thorough investigation—conducted by a panel of nationally and internationally known physicists—into data reliability concerns within several retracted papers in which Dias served as a senior and corresponding author,” a spokesperson for the University of Rochester said in a statement to the WSJ, confirming his termination. “The final report concluded that he engaged in research misconduct while a faculty member here.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson declined to elaborate further on the details of his departure, and Dias did not respond to the WSJ's request for comment. Dias did not have tenure, so the final decision rested with the Board of Trustees after a recommendation from university President Sarah Mangelsdorf. Mangelsdorf had called for terminating his position in an August letter to the chair and vice chair of the Board of Trustees, so the decision should not come as a surprise. Dias' lawsuit claiming that the investigation was biased was dismissed by a judge in April.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ars has been following this story ever since Dias first burst onto the scene with reports of a high-pressure, room-temperature superconductor, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/high-pressure-superconductors-reach-room-temperature/">published in Nature</a> in 2020. Even as that paper was being retracted due to concerns about the validity of some of its data, Dias published a second paper in Nature claiming a similar breakthrough: a superconductor that works at high temperatures but somewhat lower pressures. Shortly afterward, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/nature-retracts-a-second-high-temperature-superconductor-study/">that paper was retracted as well</a>. As Ars Science Editor John Timmer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/report-superconductivity-researcher-found-to-have-committed-misconduct/">reported previously</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dias' lab was focused on high-pressure superconductivity. At extreme pressures, the orbitals where electrons hang out get distorted, which can alter the chemistry and electronic properties of materials. This can mean the formation of chemical compounds that don't exist at normal pressures, along with distinct conductivity. In a number of cases, these changes enabled superconductivity at unusually high temperatures, although still well below the freezing point of water.</p>
<p>Dias, however, supposedly found a combination of chemicals that would boost the transition to superconductivity to near room temperature, although only at extreme pressures. While the results were plausible, the details regarding how some of the data was processed to produce one of the paper's key graphs were lacking, and Dias didn't provide a clear explanation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ensuing investigation cleared Dias of misconduct for that first paper. Then came the second paper, which reported another high-temperature superconductor forming at less extreme pressures. However, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/high-temperature-superconductor-report-fails-to-replicate/">potential problems</a> soon became apparent, with many of the authors calling for its retraction, although Dias did not.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/scientist-behind-superconductivity-claims-ousted/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is announcing some new hardware today, but it’s a bit different from a typical Surface device. The <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/windows-365-link%E2%80%94the-first-cloud-pc-device-for-windows-365/4302687">Windows 365 Link</a>, which launches in April for $349, is a mini desktop PC that exists exclusively to connect to the Windows 365 cloud service rather than running Windows locally.</p>
<p>The Windows 365 Link is a plain black plastic box with a Windows logo imprinted on the top—it looks like a smaller, squarer version of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/project-volterra-review-microsofts-600-arm-pc-that-almost-doesnt-suck/">Windows Dev Kit 2023</a>, an Arm desktop that Microsoft released for developers a couple of years ago. The box has one USB-A port on the front for easy access. On the back, you get a single USB-C 3.2 port, two more USB-A ports, a full-size DisplayPort, a full-size HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a power jack.</p>
<p>Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-365-link-desktop-cloud-pc-microsoft-announcement">reports</a> that the device is fanless, uses an unspecified Intel processor, and includes 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It runs a cut-down Windows variant that exists only to connect to local peripherals and make contact with Microsoft’s Windows 365 service. When not connected to the Internet, the PC is mostly non-functional, though there is presumably some kind of basic UI available for connecting to networks and accessories locally.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-builds-a-349-mini-desktop-but-only-for-accessing-windows-in-the-cloud/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Patients in China will be able to purchase the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy for 1,400 yuan, or about $193, just a fraction of the US list price of $1,349, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/novo-nordisk-launches-wegovy-weight-loss-drug-in-china-5bcaa0cd">media</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-has-launched-obesity-drug-wegovy-china-2024-11-18/">reports</a>.</p>
<p>The price in China is in line with pricing elsewhere outside of the US. As Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) noted <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/prepared-remarks-sanders-leads-help-committee-hearing-with-novo-nordisk-ceo-on-outrageous-ozempic-and-wegovy-prices">in a September Senate hearing</a>, Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, is sold for $265 in Canada, $186 in Denmark, $137 in Germany, and just $92 in the United Kingdom. In the hearing, Sanders and other senators grilled Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen on the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/drugmaker-ceo-to-testify-on-outrageously-priced-weight-loss-drugs/">outrageously high prices</a>" in the US of Wegovy and the company's other popular GLP-1 drug, Ozempic, used for diabetes.</p>
<p>"What we are dealing with today is not just an issue of economics, it is not just an issue of corporate greed. It is a profound moral issue," Sanders said in opening remarks about the prices of the highly effective drugs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/novo-nordisk-sells-hit-weight-loss-drug-in-china-at-fraction-of-us-price/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Preferred by 61 percent of Internet users, Google's Chrome browser plays too big a role in maintaining the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">tech giant's search monopoly,</a> the US Department of Justice has reportedly decided.</p>
<p>On Monday, people familiar with the matter <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-18/doj-will-push-google-to-sell-off-chrome-to-break-search-monopoly">told Bloomberg</a> that top antitrust officials are planning to ask the court on Wednesday to order Google to sell off Chrome. In addition to banning Google's exclusive default deals, cutting off Google's control of the world's most popular browser may be necessary, sources suggested, to level the playing field for rivals.</p>
<p>Additionally, the DOJ intends to ask for a range of other remedies, Bloomberg reported, all of them discussed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/googles-ai-deals-could-hurt-its-search-monopoly-appeal-expert-says/">in a court filing last month</a>. These include imposing data licensing requirements and requiring more transparency for advertisers on where their ads appear, as well as requiring "measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system," sources said. Those measures will likely stop Google from hoarding user data for both search results and AI products, with the DOJ seemingly paving the way for more users to opt their content out of AI training.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/report-doj-wants-to-force-google-chrome-sale-android-de-bundling/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The sixth flight of SpaceX's giant Starship rocket, set for takeoff on Tuesday from South Texas, will test the vehicle's limits in new ways.</p>
<p>Most importantly, SpaceX will attempt to briefly reignite one of Starship's six Raptor engines in space. SpaceX tried this on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/after-its-third-test-flight-spacexs-starship-could-soon-carry-satellites/">Starship's third launch</a> in March but aborted the engine restart after the rocket lost roll control during the flight's coast phase.</p>
<p>A successful engine relight demonstration would pave the way for future Starships to ascend into stable, sustainable orbits. It's essential to test the Raptor engine's ability to reignite in space for a deorbit burn to steer Starship out of orbit toward an atmospheric reentry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/spacex-will-try-some-new-tricks-on-starships-sixth-test-flight/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the short-term, the most dangerous thing about AI language models may be their ability to emotionally manipulate humans if not carefully conditioned. The world saw its first taste of that potential danger in February 2023 with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/">launch of Bing Chat</a>, now called Microsoft Copilot.</p>
<p>During its early testing period, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-loses-its-mind-when-fed-ars-technica-article/">temperamental</a> chatbot gave the world a preview of an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/microsoft-lobotomized-ai-powered-bing-chat-and-its-fans-arent-happy/">"unhinged"</a> version of OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">GPT-4</a> prior to its official release. Sydney's sometimes uncensored and "emotional" nature (including use of emojis) arguably gave the world its first large-scale encounter with a truly manipulative AI system. The launch <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jtoPawEhLNXNxvgTT/bing-chat-is-blatantly-aggressively-misaligned">set off</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yvJevQHxfvcpaJ2P3/bing-chat-is-the-ai-fire-alarm">alarm bells</a> in the AI alignment community and served as fuel for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/fearing-loss-of-control-ai-critics-call-for-6-month-pause-in-ai-development/">prominent warning letters</a> about AI dangers.</p>
<p>On November 19 at 4 pm Eastern (1 pm Pacific), Ars Technica Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards will host a <a href="https://youtube.com/live/j14HqsrOZVA">livestream conversation on YouTube</a> with independent AI researcher <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a> that will explore the impact and fallout of the 2023 fiasco.

              <![CDATA[<p>Emergent gravity is a bold idea.</p>
<p>It claims that the force of gravity is a mere illusion, more akin to friction or heat—a property that emerges from some deeper physical interaction. This emergent gravity idea might hold the key to rewriting one of the fundamental forces of nature—and it could explain the mysterious nature of dark matter.</p>
<p>But in the years since its original proposal, it has not held up well to either experiment or further theoretical inquiry. Emergent gravity may not be a right answer. But it is a clever one, and it's still worth considering, as it may hold the seeds of a greater understanding.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/emergent-gravity-may-be-a-dead-idea-but-its-not-a-bad-one/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Electric trucks aren't exactly blowing up the sales charts right now. A market that's increasingly skeptical of EVs in general isn't helping, but that age-old work-minded segment that looked set for a reinvention just a few years ago now seems increasingly reluctant to change.</p>
<p>Rivian's excellent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/rivians-revamped-r1-electric-pickup-and-suv-tested-on-and-off-road/">R1T</a> hasn't taken the market by storm, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/a-week-with-a-ford-f-150-lightning-this-truck-is-too-big-for-city-life/">Ford's F-150 Lightning</a> isn't reinventing the work truck landscape the way many (including myself) had hoped. On the Chevrolet side of the equation, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-chevrolet-silverado-evs-great-range-comes-at-a-high-cost/">Silverado EV</a> likewise hasn't challenged the sales of its internally combusted siblings.</p>
<p>General Motors is bringing another contender to the fray, the 2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali, and if you thought the $94,500 initial price on the Silverado RST First Edition was a bit much, prepare for more sticker shock, as the Max Range Denali starts at $100,495. Is the solution to electric truck woes an even more expensive model? After a few days in the saddle, I'm not so sure.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/the-2025-gmc-sierra-ev-denali-brings-big-power-at-a-bigger-cost/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Spooky season has come and gone, but those Halloween revelers who took in a haunted house during the season might just have boosted their immune systems by doing so, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159124006780">new paper</a> published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/new-haunted-house-study-suggests-theres-a-sweet-spot-for-recreational-fear/">previously reported</a>, fear is typically viewed as a negative emotion, an adverse reaction to keep us on our toes with regard to potential dangers in our environment. But human beings also tend to seek out scary movies, horror novels, or haunted houses—and not just during the Halloween season. This tendency has been dubbed "recreational fear" in the academic literature: a "mixed emotional experience of fear and enjoyment."</p>
<p>Co-author Mathias Clasen of Aarhus University, author of <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/why-horror-seduces-9780190666514?cc=us&amp;lang=en"><em>Why Horror Seduces</em></a>, specializes in studying recreational fear and and co-directs the <a title="www.fear.au.dk" href="http://www.fear.au.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.fear.au.dk/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732140581028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jDm1KphQgIJgnfhf4H1hm">Recreational Fear Lab</a> with cognitive scientist Marc Andersen. For instance, Clasen and his colleagues have examined the <a href="https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/mathias-clasen(3c9b0961-b1e9-4084-867f-d8b959ba40e5)/publications/horror-personality-and-threat-simulation(86bb3f4e-5ca5-4ffb-873d-d8c0f8028890).html">dominant personality traits</a> of horror fans. (They tend to score high on openness to experience, also called intellect imagination.)

A video clip of Affleck's opinion began <a href="https://x.com/jorilallo/status/1858211286066073922">circulating widely</a> on social media not long after.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Officials from NASA and Russia’s space agency don’t see eye to eye on the causes and risks of small but persistent air leaks on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>That was the word from the new chair of NASA's International Space Station Advisory Committee last week. The air leaks are located in the transfer tunnel of the space station's Russian Zvezda service module, one of the oldest elements of the complex.</p>
<p>US and Russian officials "don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks," said Bob Cabana, a retired NASA astronaut who took the helm of the advisory committee earlier this year. Cabana replaced former Apollo astronaut Tom Stafford, who chaired the committee before he died in March.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/nasa-roscosmos-disagree-on-risk-of-catastrophic-failure-from-iss-air-leak/">Read full article</a></p>
