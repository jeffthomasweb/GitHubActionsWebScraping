              <![CDATA[<p>Cows in Nevada have been infected with a strain of H5N1 bird flu different from the strain detected in all other herds to this point in the ongoing dairy outbreak. It's the same strain that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/as-us-marks-first-h5n1-bird-flu-death-who-and-cdc-say-risk-remains-low/">killed a Louisiana resident</a> in early January and sent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/teen-in-critical-condition-with-canadas-first-human-case-of-h5-bird-flu/">a Canadian teenager</a> to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890">intensive care</a> in early November.</p>
<p>The new Nevada dairy infections were first detected through milk testing conducted on January 31, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/aphis-confirms-d11-genotype-dairy-cattle-nevada-0">according to an update Wednesday by the US Department of Agriculture</a>. Whole genome sequencing confirmed the finding of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.1. To this point, all other dairy herds affected by the outbreak have been infected with H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13.</p>
<p>To date, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">957 herds across 16 states</a> have been infected with H5N1 since the outbreak began last March. That tally includes four new herds from Nevada.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/strain-of-h5n1-bird-flu-that-killed-louisiana-resident-found-in-nevada-dairies/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, a US district judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, recommended a compromise in a lawsuit <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DOGE-Treasury-Lawsuit-Motion-for-Temporary-Restraining-Order-2-5-25.pdf">seeking a temporary restraining order</a> to stop Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/musks-doge-clashes-with-treasury-over-access-to-payment-system-report-says/">accessing Americans' sensitive Treasury Department data</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If both parties agree, the compromise would allow two "special government employees" hired by the Treasury to continue accessing payments data to further DOGE's mission of eliminating government waste. But until the lawsuit is settled, DOGE and anyone outside the Treasury Department would be prohibited from reviewing that data directly, ensuring that nobody's government financial data is shared with any third parties without consent or proper notice.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kollar-Kotelly was assigned to this case yesterday, but due to the sensitivity of the <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DOGE-complaint-2-3-25.pdf">complaint,</a> she appears motivated to move quickly to ensure that no Americans' private data is illegally shared with anyone outside of the Treasury Department. To that end, she grilled US Department of Justice lawyer Bradley Humphreys to find out exactly who has access to Treasury data and how they are connected to DOGE.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/judge-suggests-temporary-order-blocking-doge-from-treasury-records/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>NASA, which has 1.3 million followers on the live-streaming video service, has previously broadcast events on its <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa">Twitch channel</a>. However, this will be the first time the agency has created an event specifically for Twitch.</p>
<p>During the live event, beginning at 11:45 am ET (16:45 UTC), viewers will hear from NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who is currently on board the space station, as well as Matt Dominick, who recently returned to Earth after the agency’s Crew-8 mission. Viewers will have the opportunity to ask questions about living in space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-has-entered-the-chat-space-agency-to-twitch-stream-from-orbit/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AMD announced its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, and the numbers were <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial">mostly rosy</a>: $7.7 billion in revenue and a 51 percent profit margin, compared to $6.2 billion and 47 percent <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1180/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial">a year ago</a>. The biggest winner was the data center division, which made $3.9 billion thanks to Epyc server processors and Instinct AI accelerators, and Ryzen CPUs are also selling well, helping the company's client segment earn $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>But if you were looking for a dark spot, you'd find it in the company's gaming division, which earned a relatively small $563 million, down 59 percent from a year ago. AMD's Lisa Su blamed this on both dedicated graphics card sales and sales from the company's "semi-custom" chips (that is, the ones created specifically for game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation).</p>
<p>Other data sources suggest that the response from GPU buyers to AMD's Radeon RX 7000 series, launched between late 2022 and early 2024, has been lackluster. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>, a noisy but broadly useful barometer for GPU market share, shows no RX 7000-series models in the top 50; only two of the GPUs (the 7900 XTX and 7700 XT) are used in enough gaming PCs to be mentioned on the list at all, with the others all getting lumped into the "other" category. Jon Peddie Research <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/discrete-gpu-sales-increase-as-intels-share-drops-to-0">recently estimated</a> that AMD was selling roughly one dedicated GPU for every seven or eight sold by Nvidia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amd-promises-mainstream-4k-gaming-with-next-gen-gpus-as-current-gen-gpu-sales-tank/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When Google launched its AI Overviews features last year, we noted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">plenty of examples of false, misleading, and even dangerous information</a> that can be contained in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/googles-ai-overviews-misunderstand-why-people-use-google/">the official-looking answers</a> generated by Google's Gemini model. Now, Google has quietly scrubbed one such falsehood from a demo of <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-ai-help-me-write/">its AI writing assistant</a> that featured prominently in an ad planned for Sunday's Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The ad in question is part of <a href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/50-states-50-stories-small-business-ads/">Google's "50 stories from 50 states" promotion</a>, which <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/google-workspace-super-bowl-59-small-businesses-use-ai/">will run Gemini ads tailored for different local markets</a> during the Super Bowl on Sunday. The Wisconsin-focused ad, as it was posted on YouTube last week, featured the owner of Wisconsin Cheese Mart asking Google's writing assistant for "a description of Smoked Gouda that would appeal to cheese lovers."</p>
<p>The AI-authored response <a href="https://x.com/natejhake/status/1885137074673549460">that was shown in that video</a>—and <a href="https://www.wisconsincheesemart.com/products/gouda-cheese-smoked">still appears verbatim on the Wisconsin Cheese Mart website</a>—notes that Gouda is "one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption." That is almost surely an exaggeration; a <a href="https://www.cheesemarketnews.com/guestcolumn/2007/13apr07_2.html">2007 Cheese Market News editorial</a>, for instance, mentions Gouda as only the third-most-popular cheese in the world, after cheddar and mozzarella. A <a href="https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/cheese-market/">Global Cheese Market analyst report</a> also only includes Gouda in the "Other Cheese" category, while mozzarella, Parmesan, and cheddar each get their own categories.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/not-gouda-nough-google-removes-ai-generated-cheese-error-from-super-bowl-ad/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers said they recently discovered a zero-day vulnerability in the 7-Zip archiving utility that was actively exploited as part of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The vulnerability allowed a Russian cybercrime group to override a Windows protection designed to limit the execution of files downloaded from the Internet. The defense is commonly known as MotW, short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Web">Mark of the Web</a>. It works by placing a “Zone.Identifier” tag on all files downloaded from the Internet or from a networked share. This tag, a type of NTFS Alternate Data Stream and in the form of a ZoneID=3, subjects the file to additional scrutiny from Windows Defender SmartScreen and restrictions on how or when it can be executed.</p>
<h2>There’s an archive in my archive</h2>
<p>The 7-Zip vulnerability allowed the Russian cybercrime group to bypass those protections. Exploits worked by embedding an executable file within an archive and then embedding the archive into another archive. While the outer archive carried the MotW tag, the inner one did not. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-0411, was fixed with the release of version 24.09 in late November.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/7-zip-0-day-was-exploited-in-russias-ongoing-invasion-of-ukraine/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Hugging Face researchers <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/open-deep-research">released</a> an open source AI research agent called "Open Deep Research," created by an in-house team as a challenge 24 hours after the launch of OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">Deep Research</a> feature, which can autonomously browse the web and create research reports. The project seeks to match Deep Research's performance while making the technology freely available to developers.</p>
<p>"While powerful LLMs are now freely available in open-source, OpenAI didn’t disclose much about the agentic framework underlying Deep Research," writes Hugging Face on its announcement page. "So we decided to embark on a 24-hour mission to reproduce their results and open-source the needed framework along the way!"</p>
<p>Similar to both OpenAI's Deep Research and Google's implementation of its own "Deep Research" using Gemini (first <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">introduced in December</a>—before OpenAI), Hugging Face's solution adds an "agent" framework to an existing AI model to allow it to perform multi-step tasks, such as collecting information and building the report as it goes along that it presents to the user at the end.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/after-24-hour-hackathon-hugging-faces-ai-research-agent-nearly-matches-openais-solution/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Method allows a single algorithm to be spread across multiple quantum processors.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Performing complex algorithms on quantum computers will eventually require access to tens of thousands of hardware qubits. For most of the technologies being developed, this creates a problem: It's difficult to create hardware that can hold that many qubits. As a result, people are looking at various ideas of how we might link processors together in order to have them function as a single computational unit (a challenge that has obviously been solved for classical computers).</p>
<p>In today's issue of Nature, a team at Oxford University describes using quantum teleportation to link two pieces of quantum hardware that were located about 2 meters apart, meaning they could easily have been in different rooms entirely. Once linked, the two pieces of hardware could be treated as a single quantum computer, allowing simple algorithms to be performed that involved operations on both sides of the 2-meter gap.</p>
<h2>Quantum teleportation is... different</h2>
<p>Our idea of teleportation has been heavily shaped by Star Trek, where people disappear from one location while simultaneously appearing elsewhere. Quantum teleportation doesn't work like that. Instead, you need to pre-position quantum objects at both the source and receiving ends of the teleport and entangle them. Once that's done, it's possible to perform a series of actions that force the recipient to adopt the quantum state of the source. The process of performing this teleportation involves a measurement of the source object, which destroys its quantum state even as it appears at the distant site, so it does share that feature with the popular conception of teleportation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/quantum-teleportation-used-to-distribute-a-calculation/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Robocallers posing as employees of the Federal Communications Commission made the mistake of trying to scam real employees of the FCC, the FCC announced yesterday. "On the night of February 6, 2024, and continuing into the morning of February 7, 2024, over a dozen FCC staff and some of their family members reported receiving calls on their personal and work telephone numbers," the FCC said.</p>
<p>The calls used an artificial voice that said, "Hello [first name of recipient] you are receiving an automated call from the Federal Communications Commission notifying you the Fraud Prevention Team would like to speak with you. If you are available to speak now please press one. If you prefer to schedule a call back please press two."</p>
<p>You may not be surprised to learn that the FCC does not have any "Fraud Prevention Team" like the one mentioned in the robocalls, and especially not one that demands Google gift cards in lieu of jail time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/robocallers-posing-as-fcc-staff-blocked-after-robocalling-real-fcc-staff/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In a move that will no doubt upset some of the more... orderly minded out there, Polestar is temporarily deviating from its otherwise most logical naming convention. Instead of giving its cars numbers based on some theoretical measurement of performance or their position in the showroom hierarchy, the numbers are chronological. Polestar 1 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/the-polestar-1-is-a-turbocharged-supercharged-plug-in-hybrid-enigma/">was the first</a>, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/now-rear-wheel-drive-the-single-motor-polestar-2-is-better-than-ever/">Polestar 2</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>That remains true for the last couple of Polestars we drove—the big <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-2025-polestar-3-is-a-torque-vectoring-suv-thats-fun-to-drive/">Polestar 3 SUV</a> and the slightly smaller, slightly cheaper, Porsche Macan-rivaling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-2025-polestar-4-great-steering-and-a-small-carbon-footprint-stand-out/">Polestar 4</a>. And later this year we should see the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/watch-out-porsche-polestar-is-working-on-a-proper-taycan-rival/">Polestar 5</a>. But then it will jump to the Polestar 7, a new compact SUV, which undoubtedly has more sales potential than the drop-top Polestar 6 two-seater, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/polestars-stunning-o2-concept-is-an-electric-roadster/">no matter how sharp that car might end up looking</a>.</p>
<p>"I brought in and changed the sequence, because I wanted to bring in the Polestar 7 because I think it's an important car," explained Michael Lohscheller, who became Polestar's CEO last fall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/polestars-ceo-talks-product-plans-local-manufacturing-tariff-woes/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Amid rising exchange rates, Nintendo prez looks to "affordable price that customers expect."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">our first glimpse of the Switch 2</a> last month, we've been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/all-the-things-nintendo-didnt-tell-us-about-the-switch-2/">left guessing</a> on many crucial hardware details, including the all-important launch price. Now, Nintendo has hinted that the unsteady state of the international money market may play an outsize role in that pricing decision.</p>
<p>Addressing a question about Switch 2 hardware pricing during <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf">an investor Q&amp;A session</a> Wednesday, Nintendo president Shintaro Furukawa said (via machine translation):</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the current inflation, we are aware that the exchange rate environment has changed significantly since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. We also need to consider the affordable price that customers expect from Nintendo products. When considering the price of a product, we believe that it is necessary to consider these factors from multiple angles.</p>
<p>At this time, we cannot disclose the specific price of the Nintendo Switch 2, but we are considering it while taking various points into consideration. At this time, we do not plan to change the price of the Nintendo Switch hardware.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of that is the usual polite executive-speak shorthand for "we're not ready to answer that yet." But the bit about exchange rates and inflation got us wondering just how vulnerable a Japanese company like Nintendo might be to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/30/why-is-japans-yen-so-weak-against-the-us-dollar">the yen's historic weakness</a>, and what this might mean for the Switch 2.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/will-japans-weak-enconomy-mean-a-cheaper-switch-2-in-the-us/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Now the nonprofit is ending a useful service, but in an exceedingly rare happenstance, it's probably a good thing for everyone. Starting June 4, 2025, Let's Encrypt will <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/22/ending-expiration-emails/">no longer notify its subscribers that their certification is about to expire</a> and needs renewal. Some hosting providers automatically obtain and manage certificates from Let's Encrypt, so there's not much for them to do. Everyone else will have to do something, and likely it will still be free and automated.</p>
<p>Let's Encrypt is ending automated emails for four stated reasons, and all of them are pretty sensible. For one thing, lots of customers have been able to automate their certificate renewal. For another, providing the expiration notices costs "tens of thousands of dollars per year" and adds complexity to the nonprofit's infrastructure as they are looking to add new and more useful services.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/lets-encrypt-is-ending-expiration-notice-emails-for-some-very-good-reasons/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">It's been a confusing 24 hours at the US Postal Service (USPS) after the Trump administration imposed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/tariffs-on-biggest-us-trading-partners-likely-to-spike-cost-of-cars-tech/">new tariffs on China that eliminated a loophole</a> allowing low-value Chinese packages into the US duty-free.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the USPS abruptly stopped accepting all inbound packages from Hong Kong and China. This briefly halted personal shipments from China, as well as online deliveries from China-based companies. That included blocking orders from online marketplaces increasingly popular with Americans like Alibaba, Temu, and Shein, as well as China-based retailers selling cheap goods on Amazon.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But by Wednesday morning, the USPS reversed the temporary policy, posting an <a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/service-alerts/international/china.htm">international service notice</a> clarifying that the USPS and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) "are working closely together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/americans-likely-to-pay-more-wait-longer-for-online-orders-from-china/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The raptors are back with a host of ravenous friends in the official trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World_Rebirth"><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em></a>, the fourth installment in the <em>Jurassic World</em> series and seventh film overall in the franchise spawned by 1993's <em>Jurassic Park</em>.</p>

<p>The franchise has been lumbering along for over 20 years now with mixed success, but <em>Jurassic World Dominion</em> (2022) at least gave Universal a bona fide box office hit to counter all the negative reviews, grossing just over $1 billion worldwide. (It has a mere 29 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes.) That film ended with dinosaurs and humans figuring out how to co-exist, the establishment of a dino sanctuary by the United Nations, and the evil corporation BioSyn in disgrace.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/jurassic-world-rebirth-roars-into-theaters-this-july/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Early car sales data for January is starting to arrive from countries across the pond, and they paint an alarming picture for Tesla. Sales are crashing in France, Germany, and the UK—all affluent countries that are key markets for Tesla's electric vehicles. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/teslas-2024-financial-results-are-out-and-theyre-terrible/">Coming on the heels of a large financial miss</a>, it's just one more problem for the automaker.</p>
<p>Tesla sales dropped around 13 percent across Europe in 2024, but so far this year, the scale of the problem is far greater. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-03/tesla-sales-plunge-63-in-france-the-eu-s-second-biggest-ev-market">In France</a>, sales of new Teslas fell by 63 percent, while total car sales in the country fell by just 6 percent, with EV sales dropping just half a percent.</p>
<p>Germany was already looking like lost ground for Tesla—its 41 percent drop in 2024 accounted for most of Tesla's lost sales across Europe. That must make the 59 percent drop in German Tesla sales recorded during January even more painful on the profit and loss statements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/tesla-sales-plummet-in-the-uk-france-and-germany/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last year was not a good one for a lunar lander company based in Pittsburgh named Astrobotic.</p>
<p>In January, the company's first spacecraft finally launched after years of delays, carrying dozens of payloads, scientific instruments, and time capsules. But within hours of launch, the Peregrine spacecraft developed a propellant leak in its propulsion system. Although the Astrobotic engineering team fought valiantly, they could not control the leak long enough to attempt a lunar landing. Instead, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/on-its-first-mission-astrobotic-missed-the-moon-but-learned-a-lot/">operators returned it to Earth's atmosphere</a>, where it burned up.</p>
<p>This immediately raised questions about Astrobotic's next mission. Its second spacecraft, Griffin, would be larger. The company had received a large "task order" from NASA to use this lander to deliver the VIPER robotic rover to the south pole of the Moon in 2025 worth more than $300 million. However, NASA officials were concerned that, after Peregrine's problems, the significantly more ambitious Griffin lander might fail.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/after-a-wrenching-decision-by-nasa-private-lunar-lander-finds-a-new-customer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A proposed $58 billion merger to create the world’s fourth-largest carmaker appears on the verge of collapse after Honda made an unexpected proposal to turn Nissan into a fully owned subsidiary, according to three people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The two rivals announced discussions on a combination in December, but just over 40 days later the talks have already soured, as Honda faces shareholder and internal pressure to take full control of Nissan to turn around the ailing carmaker.</p>
<p>The latest proposal, delivered to Nissan at the weekend, deviates from initial plans to bring the two companies under a jointly owned holding company, a structure that would have provided room to retain Nissan’s brand and decision-making powers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/58-billion-honda-nissan-merger-is-in-deep-trouble/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Do you long for that tart fruity flavor of a sour beer but wish the complicated brewing process were faster? Norwegian scientists might have the answer: field peas, as well as beans and lentils. According to a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.4c06748">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, experimental beers made with the sugars found in these foods had similar flavor profiles to your average Belgian-style sour beer, yet the brewing process was shorter with simpler steps.</p>
<p>“Sour beer is the beer enthusiast’s alternative to champagne," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1072068?">said co-author Bjørge Westereng</a> of the Norwegian University of Life Science. "By using sugars derived from peas that yeast cannot metabolize, we promote the growth of bacteria essential for producing sour beer.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/the-chemistry-of-what-makes-sour-beer-so-sour/">previously</a> reported, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_beer">sour beer</a> has been around for centuries and has become a favorite with craft brewers in recent years, although the brewing process can be both unpredictable and time-consuming. Brewers of standard beer carefully control the strains of yeast they use, taking care to ensure other microbes don't sneak into the mix, lest they alter the flavor during fermentation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/pea-sugars-can-speed-up-sour-beer-brewing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A mirror proxy Google runs on behalf of developers of the Go programming language pushed a backdoored package for more than three years until Monday, after researchers who spotted the malicious code petitioned for it to be taken down twice.</p>
<p>The service, known as the <a href="https://proxy.golang.org/">Go Module Mirror</a>, caches open source packages available on GitHub and elsewhere so that downloads are faster and to ensure they are compatible with the rest of the Go ecosystem. By default, when someone uses command-line tools built into Go to download or install packages, requests are routed through the service. A description on the site says the proxy is provided by the Go team and “run by Google.”</p>
<h2>Caching in</h2>
<p>Since November 2021, the Go Module Mirror has been hosting a backdoored version of a widely used module, security firm Socket <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-package-exploits-go-module-proxy-caching-for-persistence">said Monday</a>. The file uses “typosquatting,” a technique that gives malicious files names similar to widely used legitimate ones and plants them in popular repositories. In the event someone makes a typo or even a minor variation from the correct name when fetching a file with the command line, they land on the malicious file instead of the one they wanted. (A similar typosquatting scheme is common with domain names, too.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/backdoored-package-in-go-mirror-site-went-unnoticed-for-3-years/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, a Canadian writer named Cory Doctorow coined the phrase "enshittification" to describe the decay of online platforms. The word immediately set the Internet ablaze, as it captured the growing malaise regarding how almost everything about the web seemed to be getting worse.</p>
<p>"It’s my theory explaining how the Internet was colonized by platforms, why all those platforms are degrading so quickly and thoroughly, why it matters, and what we can do about it," Doctorow explained in a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5">follow-up article</a>. "We’re all living through a great enshittening, in which the services that matter to us, that we rely on, are turning into giant piles of shit. It’s frustrating. It’s demoralizing. It’s even terrifying."</p>
<p>Doctorow believes there are four basic forces that might constrain companies from getting worse: competition, regulation, self-help, and tech workers. One by one, he says, these constraints have been eroded as large corporations squeeze the Internet and its denizens for dollars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/as-internet-enshittification-marches-on-here-are-some-of-the-worst-offenders/">Read full article</a></p>
