<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Early on Saturday morning, at 1:45 am local time, a Falcon 9 rocket soared into orbit from its launch site at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>By some measures this was an extremely routine mission—it was, after all, SpaceX's 73rd launch of this calendar year. And like many other Falcon 9 launches this year, the "Starlink 10-9" mission carried 23 of the broadband internet satellites into orbit. However, after a rare failure earlier this month, this particular Falcon 9 rocket was making a return-to-flight for the company, and attempting to get the world's most active booster back into service.</p>
<p>And by all measures, it performed. The first stage booster, B-1069, made its 17th flight into orbit before landing on the <em>Just Read the Instructions</em> drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Then, a little more than an hour after liftoff, the rocket's second stage released its payload into a good orbit, from which the Starlink spacecraft will use their on-board thrusters to reach operational altitudes in the coming weeks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039608#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039608&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved two injectable versions of the blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drug, semaglutide (Wegovy and Ozempic). Both come in pre-filled pens with pre-set doses, clear instructions, and information about overdoses. But, given the drugs' daunting prices and supply shortages, many patients are turning to imitations—and those don't always come with the same safety guardrails.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/fda-alerts-health-care-providers-compounders-and-patients-dosing-errors-associated-compounded?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">an alert Friday</a>, the FDA warned that people are overdosing on off-brand injections of semaglutide, which are dispensed from compounding pharmacies in a variety of concentrations, labeled with various units of measurement, administered with improperly sized syringes, and prescribed with bad dosage math. The errors are leading some patients to take up to 20 times the amount of intended semaglutide, the FDA reports.</p>
<p>Though the agency doesn't offer a tally of overdose cases that have been reported, it suggests it has received multiple reports of people sickened by dosing errors, with some requiring hospitalizations. Semaglutide overdoses cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fainting, headache, migraine, dehydration, acute pancreatitis, and gallstones, the agency reports.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039643#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039643&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The astronauts who rode Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station last month still don't know when they will return to Earth.</p>
<p>Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been in space for 51 days, six weeks longer than originally planned, as engineers on the groundwork through problems with Starliner's propulsion system.</p>
<p>The problems are twofold. The spacecraft's reaction control thrusters overheated, and some of them shut off as Starliner approached the space station June 6. A separate, although perhaps related, problem involves helium leaks in the craft's propulsion system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039480#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039480&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SAG-AFTRA has called for a strike of all its members working in video games, with the union demanding that its next contract not allow "companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">The strike</a> mirrors similar actions taken by SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) last year, which, while also broader in scope than just AI, were similarly focused on concerns about AI-generated work product and the use of member work to train AI.</p>
<p>"Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year—that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, said in a statement.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039502#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039502&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It is hard to escape the feeling that a few too many businesses are jumping on the AI hype train because it's hype-y, rather than because AI offers an underlying benefit to their operation. So I will admit to a little inherent skepticism, and perhaps a touch of morbid curiosity, when General Motors got in touch wanting to show off some of the new AI/machine learning tools it has been using to win more races in NASCAR, sportscar racing, and IndyCar. As it turns out, that skepticism was misplaced.</p>
<p>GM has fingers in a lot of motorsport pies, but there are four top-level programs it really, <em>really</em> cares about. Number one for an American automaker is NASCAR—still the king of motorsport here—where Chevrolet supplies engines to six Cup teams. IndyCar, which could once boast of being America's favorite racing, is home to another six Chevy-powered teams. And then there's sportscar racing; right now, Cadillac is competing in IMSA's GTP class and the World Endurance Championship's Hypercar class, plus a factory Corvette Racing effort in IMSA.</p>
<p>"In all the series we race we either have key partners or specific teams that run our cars. And part of the technical support that they get from us are the capabilities of my team," said Jonathan Bolenbaugh, motorsports analytics leader at GM, based at GM's Charlotte Technical Center in North Carolina.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039592#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039592&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Internet service providers are eager to get money from a $42.45 billion government fund, but are trying to convince the Biden administration to drop demands that Internet service providers offer broadband service for as little as $30 a month to people with low incomes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/us-allocates-42b-in-broadband-funding-find-out-how-much-your-state-will-get/">Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program</a> was created by a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text">US law</a> that requires Internet providers receiving federal funds to offer at least one "low-cost broadband service option for eligible subscribers." The Biden administration says it is merely enforcing that legal requirement, but a <a href="https://acaconnects.org/index.php?checkfileaccess=/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/telecom-industry-letter-raising-concerns-about-bead-implementation.pdf">July 23 letter</a> sent by over 30 broadband industry trade groups claims that the administration is illegally regulating broadband prices.</p>
<p>The fund is administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The NTIA is distributing money to states, which will then distribute it to ISPs. Before obtaining money from the NTIA, each state must get approval for a plan that includes a low-cost option. Nearly half of US states have already gotten approvals.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039582#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039582&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Scientists have been all aflutter since several space-based detectors picked up a powerful gamma-ray burst (GRB) in October 2022—a burst so energetic that astronomers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/its-the-boat-astronomers-observe-brightest-of-all-time-gamma-ray-burst/">nicknamed it the BOAT</a> (Brightest Of All Time). Now an international team of astronomers has analyzed an unusual energy peak detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and concluded that it was an emission spectra, according to a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj3638">new paper</a> published in the journal Science. Per the authors, it's the first high-confidence emission line ever seen in 50 years of studying GRBs.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/its-the-boat-astronomers-observe-brightest-of-all-time-gamma-ray-burst/">reported previously</a>, gamma-ray bursts are extremely high-energy explosions in distant galaxies lasting between mere milliseconds to several hours. There are two classes of gamma-ray bursts. Most (70 percent) are long bursts lasting more than two seconds, often with a bright afterglow. These are usually linked to galaxies with rapid star formation. Astronomers think that long bursts are tied to the deaths of massive stars collapsing to form a neutron star or black hole (or, alternatively, a newly formed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/behold-the-magnetar-natures-ultimate-superweapon/">magnetar</a>). The baby black hole would produce jets of highly energetic particles moving near the speed of light, powerful enough to pierce through the remains of the progenitor star, emitting X-rays and gamma rays.</p>
<p>Those gamma-ray bursts lasting less than two seconds (about 30 percent) are deemed short bursts, usually emitting from regions with very little star formation. Astronomers think these gamma-ray bursts are the result of mergers between two neutron stars, or a neutron star merging with a black hole, comprising a "kilonova." That hypothesis was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.119.161101" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.119.161101" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1722000469041ddb" data-xid="fr1722000469041ddb">confirmed in 2017</a> when the LIGO collaboration picked up the gravitational wave signal of two neutron stars merging, accompanied by the powerful gamma-ray bursts associated with a kilonova.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039494#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039494&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said Thursday that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgekurtz_falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-activity-7222323091652108289-19Xv">97 percent of all Windows systems</a> running its Falcon sensor software were back online, a week after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">an update-related outage</a> to the corporate security software delayed flights and took down emergency response systems, among many other disruptions. The update, which caused Windows PCs to throw the dreaded Blue Screen of Death and reboot, affected <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/microsoft-says-8-5m-systems-hit-by-crowdstrike-bsod-releases-usb-recovery-tool/">about 8.5 million systems</a> by Microsoft's count, leaving roughly 250,000 that still need to be brought back online.</p>
<p>Microsoft VP John Cable <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-resiliency-best-practices-and-the-path-forward/ba-p/4201550">said in a blog post</a> that the company has "engaged over 5,000 support engineers working 24x7" to help clean up the mess created by CrowdStrike's update and hinted at Windows changes that could help—if they don't run afoul of regulators, anyway.</p>
<p>"This incident shows clearly that Windows must prioritize change and innovation in the area of end-to-end resilience," wrote Cable. "These improvements must go hand in hand with ongoing improvements in security and be in close cooperation with our many partners, who also care deeply about the security of the Windows ecosystem."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039500#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039500&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Astronauts on the ISS tend to favor spicy foods and top other foods with things like tabasco or shrimp cocktail sauce with horseradish. “Based on anecdotal reports, they have expressed that food in space tastes less flavorful. This is the way to compensate for this,” said Grace Loke, a food scientist at the RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>Loke’s team did a study to take a closer look at those anecdotal reports and test if our perception of flavor really changes in an ISS-like environment. It likely does, but only some flavors are affected.</p>
<h2>Tasting with all senses</h2>
<p>“There are many environmental factors that could contribute to how we perceive taste, from the size of the area to the color and intensity of the lighting, the volume and type of sounds present, the way our surroundings smell, down to even the size and shape of our cutlery. Many other studies covered each of these factors in some way or another,” said Loke.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039520#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039520&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>This post contains spoilers—for the movie and women's health care.</em></p>
<p>There's nothing like stirrups and a speculum to welcome one to womanhood, but for some, the recent <em>Barbie</em> movie apparently offered its own kind of eye-opening introduction.</p>
<p>The smash-hit film ends with the titular character making the brave decision to exit Barbieland and enter the real world as a bona fide woman. The film's final scene follows her as she fully unfurls her new reality, attending her first woman's health appointment. "I’m here to see my gynecologist," she enthusiastically states to a medical receptionist. For many, the line prompted a wry chuckle, given her unsuspecting eagerness and enigmatic anatomy. But for others, it apparently raised some fundamental questions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039496#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039496&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On the eve of the Olympics <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-2024-olympics-opening-ceremony-paris-games/">opening ceremony</a>, Paris is a city swamped in security. Forty thousand barriers divide the French capital. Packs of police officers wearing stab vests patrol pretty, cobbled streets. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/paris-mayor-defies-poo-threats-to-swim-in-seine-and-prove-a-point/">The river Seine</a> is out of bounds to anyone who has not already been vetted and issued a personal QR code.

<p>French interior minister Gérald Darmanin has spent the past week justifying these measures as vigilance—not overkill. France is facing the “biggest security challenge any country has ever had to organize in a time of peace,” he told reporters on Tuesday. In an interview with weekly newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, he explained that “<a href="https://www.lejdd.fr/politique/exclusif-gerald-darmanin-au-jdd-aucune-menace-caracterisee-sur-louverture-des-jo-de-paris-147734" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.lejdd.fr/politique/exclusif-gerald-darmanin-au-jdd-aucune-menace-caracterisee-sur-louverture-des-jo-de-paris-147734" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.lejdd.fr/politique/exclusif-gerald-darmanin-au-jdd-aucune-menace-caracterisee-sur-louverture-des-jo-de-paris-147734"}'>potentially dangerous individuals</a>” have been caught applying to work or volunteer at the Olympics, including 257 radical Islamists, 181 members of the far left, and 95 from the far right. Yesterday, he told French news broadcaster BFM that a <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/jo-2024-gerald-darmanin-confirme-l-interpellation-d-un-citoyen-russe-soupconne-d-organiser-des-operations-de-destabilisation_VN-202407240214.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/jo-2024-gerald-darmanin-confirme-l-interpellation-d-un-citoyen-russe-soupconne-d-organiser-des-operations-de-destabilisation_VN-202407240214.html" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/jo-2024-gerald-darmanin-confirme-l-interpellation-d-un-citoyen-russe-soupconne-d-organiser-des-operations-de-destabilisation_VN-202407240214.html"}'>Russian citizen</a> had been arrested on suspicion of plotting “large scale” acts of “destabilization” during the Games. </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>

<p>Howdy, Arsians! Last year, we partnered with IBM to host <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2023/10/are-you-near-houston-come-to-our-it-event-at-space-center-houston-on-november-1/">an in-person event in the Houston area</a> where we all gathered together, had some cocktails, and talked about resiliency and the future of IT. Location always matters for things like this, and so we hosted it at Space Center Houston and had our cocktails amidst cool space artifacts. In addition to learning a bunch of neat stuff, it was awesome to hang out with all the amazing folks who turned up at the event. Much fun was had!</p>
<p>This year, we're back partnering with IBM again and we're looking to repeat that success with not one, but <em>two</em> in-person gatherings—each featuring a series of panel discussions with experts and capping off with a happy hour for hanging out and mingling.

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.04 of the Rocket Report! Probably the most striking news this week came from ABL, which said in a terse social media statement that it had lost its second RS1 rocket during pre-flight testing. This is unfortunate, since the company had been so careful and meticulous in working toward this second launch attempt. It's a reminder of how demanding this industry remains.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smalll.png"></div>
<p><strong>ABL loses rocket after static fire test</strong>. ABL Space Systems said Monday that its next rocket had suffered "irrecoverable" damage during preparations for launch. "After a pre-flight static fire test on Friday, a residual pad fire caused irrecoverable damage to RS1," the company <a href="https://x.com/ablspacesystems/status/1815476558385311900">said on the social media site X</a>. "The team is investigating root cause and will provide updates as the investigation progresses." As of the writing of this report three days later, the company has not posted any additional information.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039318#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039318&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The central piece of NASA's second Space Launch System rocket arrived at Kennedy Space Center in Florida this week. Agency officials intend to start stacking the towering launcher in the next couple of months for a mission late next year carrying a team of four astronauts around the Moon.</p>
<p>The Artemis II mission, officially scheduled for September 2025, will be the first voyage by humans to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing mission in 1972. NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canadian mission specialist Jeremy Hansen will ride the SLS rocket away from Earth, then fly around the far side of the Moon and return home inside NASA's Orion spacecraft.</p>
<p>"The core is the backbone of SLS, and it’s the backbone of the Artemis mission," said Matthew Ramsey, NASA's mission manager for Artemis II. "We’ve been waiting for the core to get here because all the integrated tests and checkouts that we do have to have the core stage. It has the flight avionics that drive the whole system. The boosters are also important, but the core is really the backbone for Artemis. So it’s a big day.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039154#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039154&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, Google DeepMind <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/">announced</a> that AI systems called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 reportedly solved four out of six problems from this year's <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> (IMO), achieving a score equivalent to a silver medal. The tech giant claims this marks the first time an AI has reached this level of performance in the prestigious math competition—but as usual in AI, the claims aren't as clear-cut as they seem.</p>

<p>Google says AlphaProof uses reinforcement learning to prove mathematical statements in the formal language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)">Lean</a>. The system trains itself by generating and verifying millions of proofs, progressively tackling more difficult problems. Meanwhile, AlphaGeometry 2 is described as an upgraded version of Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/deepmind-ai-rivals-the-worlds-smartest-high-schoolers-at-geometry/">previous geometry-solving AI modeI</a>, now powered by a Gemini-based language model trained on significantly more data.</p>
<p>According to Google, prominent mathematicians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Gowers">Sir Timothy Gowers</a> and <a href="https://www.friends.edu/staff/myers-joseph/">Dr. Joseph Myers</a> scored the AI model's solutions using official IMO rules. The company reports its combined system earned 28 out of 42 possible points, just shy of the 29-point gold medal threshold. This included a perfect score on the competition's hardest problem, which Google claims only five human contestants solved this year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039221#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039221&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Arguably, few companies have unintentionally contributed more to the increase of AI-generated noise online than OpenAI. Despite its best intentions—and against its <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/">terms of service</a>—its AI language models are often <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697218/ai-generated-spam-fake-user-reviews-as-an-ai-language-model">used to compose spam</a>, and its pioneering research has inspired others to build AI models that can potentially do the same. This influx of AI-generated content has further reduced the effectiveness of SEO-driven search engines like Google. In 2024, web search is in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-search-is-losing-the-fight-with-seo-spam-study-says/">sorry state indeed</a>.</p>

<p>It's interesting, then, that OpenAI is now offering a potential solution to that problem. On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/">revealed</a> a prototype AI-powered search engine called SearchGPT that aims to provide users with quick, accurate answers sourced from the web. It's also a direct challenge to Google, which also has tried to apply generative AI to web search (but with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/">little success</a>).</p>
<p>The company says it plans to integrate the most useful aspects of the temporary prototype into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> in the future. ChatGPT (and Microsoft Copilot) can already perform web searches using Bing, but SearchGPT seems to be OpenAI's purpose-built interface for AI-assisted web searching.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039302#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039302&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google is redesigning Chrome malware detections to include password-protected executable files that users can upload for deep scanning, a change the browser maker says will allow it to detect more malicious threats.</p>
<p>Google has long allowed users to switch on the Enhanced Mode of its <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a>, a Chrome feature that warns users when they’re downloading a file that’s believed to be unsafe, either because of suspicious characteristics or because it’s in a list of known malware. With Enhanced Mode turned on, Google will prompt users to upload suspicious files that aren’t allowed or blocked by its detection engine. Under the new changes, Google will prompt these users to provide any password needed to open the file.</p>
<h2>Beware of password-protected archives</h2>

<p>Nintendo and Lego are at it again—they've announced another collaboration today as a follow-up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/lego-teams-up-with-nintendo-for-super-mario-brick-based-game/">the interactive Mario sets</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/this-200-lego-nes-set-features-a-scrolling-8-bit-mario/">replica Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/2064-piece-lego-set-recreates-super-mario-64-in-miniature-for-170/">unfolding question mark block</a> with the <em>Mario 64 </em>worlds inside, and other sets besides.</p>
<p>The latest addition is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/super-mario-world-mario-yoshi-71438?cmp=REF-202407-Mario_Yoshi_Laun">an homage to 1990's <em>Super Mario World</em></a>, Mario's debut outing on the then-new 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System. At first, the 1,215-piece set just looks like a caped Mario sitting on top of Yoshi. But a look at the back reveals more complex mechanics, including a hand crank that makes Yoshi's feet and arms move and a dial that opens his mouth and extends his tongue.</p>

<p>Most of the Mario sets have included some kind of interactive moving part, even if it's as simple as the movable mouth on the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2023/september/lego-super-mario-piranha-plant">Lego Piranha Plant</a>.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Sonos issued a redesigned app in May, and what lots of customers noticed about it wasn't the refreshed look, but the things from the previous design entirely missing. Not small things, but things that Sonos enthusiasts would really notice: sleep timers, local music library access and management, playlist and song queue editing, plus accessibility downgrades.</p>
<p>In May, a Sonos executive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152675/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-response-statement">told The Verge</a> that it "takes courage to rebuild a brand’s core product from the ground up, and to do so knowing it may require taking a few steps back to ultimately leap into the future." You might ask if bravery could have been mustered to not release an app before it was feature-complete.</p>
<p>Now, nearly three months after shipping, Sonos leadership has pivoted from excitement about future innovations to humility, apology, and a detailed roadmap of fixes.
