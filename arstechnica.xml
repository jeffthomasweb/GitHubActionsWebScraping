              <![CDATA[<p>ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico<span class="s1">—For decades, America's big defense contractors have known they can count on a steady flow of business from the Pentagon. You win some, and you lose some. But don't fret. Inevitably, there's a new opportunity to get money from the world's largest military.</span></p>
<p>This paradigm is shifting with the launch of a wave of startups eager to deliver software, missiles, drones, satellites, and other services. It's no surprise that the US military is often the core market for these companies.</p>
<p>Since its establishment more than five years ago, the Space Force inherited many of the old ways of doing business ensconced at the Pentagon since World War II. Over the last half-century, numerous defense contractors merged and acquired one another, often escaping scrutiny by promising efficiencies that will result in savings for US taxpayers. Those efficiencies rarely materialized.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/the-ax-has-become-an-important-part-of-the-space-forces-arsenal/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Things have gotten a little wild in the Chicago suburb of Orland Park, Illinois, where local cops accused a former cop of impersonating a current cop on Facebook. The department also noted that a top police official had "a glitter bomb sent to him anonymously at the Police Department" and "was contacted by a suicide prevention hotline as a result of a spoofed call."</p>
<p>So, in a bit of a freak-out over this alleged harassment and impersonation, the Orland Park police investigated and eventually sought charges against the former cop—who said that all he had done was to create a parodic Facebook page critiquing the current departmental leadership.</p>
<p>The whole case was eventually tossed by a judge, who said that the Facebook page wasn't criminal, and now the former cop is suing the current cops for going after him.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/after-glitter-bomb-cops-arrested-former-cop-who-criticized-current-cops-online/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is making it easier for telcos to turn off old copper phone and DSL networks with four changes that relax requirements related to copper shutoffs. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr—who is also pushing a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-democrat-to-resign-cementing-republican-majority-for-chairman-carr/">Delete, Delete, Delete</a>" initiative to get rid of as many rules as possible—said in an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-cutting-red-tape-unleash-new-infrastructure-investments">announcement today</a> that agency rules have prevented providers from upgrading to faster networks.</p>
<p>"Outdated FCC rules have left Americans sitting in the slow lane for far too long," Carr said. "Those FCC rules have forced providers to pour resources into maintaining aging and expensive copper line networks instead of investing in the modern, high-speed infrastructure that Americans want and deserve."</p>
<p>The key question for people using old copper service is whether they will ever get a big upgrade to fiber lines for phone and Internet access or if they'll have to make do with wireless replacements that vary greatly in quality and speed. As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/att-says-it-wont-build-fiber-home-internet-in-half-of-its-wireline-footprint/">previously reported</a>, AT&amp;T is aiming to eliminate copper phone and DSL lines from its 21-state wireline network but will not deploy fiber in the more sparsely populated half of that territory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-chairman-brendan-carr-starts-granting-telecom-lobbys-wish-list/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>Frosthaven</em>, a board game that was somehow <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">even bigger</a> and more ambitious than its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/gloomhaven-review-2017s-biggest-board-game-is-astoundingly-good/">considerably weighty forebear <em>Gloomhaven</em></a>, asks a lot of its players.</p>
<p>Each turn means picking two from maybe a dozen different possible action cards. Each of those cards has two options (plus a "default"), and each of those cards is played out against multiple other actions by your enemies and companions. And that's just the game itself—actually getting the game set up and getting your fellow gamers to agree on semi-regular appointments is a whole other crusade against tough odds.</p>

<p>Like <em>Gloomhaven </em>before it, <em>Frosthaven</em> is getting a PC game, which should make exploring a baddie-infested tundra easier to set up and potentially easier to do multiplayer. A closed beta test begins March 27, with <a href="https://playfrosthaven.com/">sign-ups at the game's website</a>. The game will launch into early access during 2025, with more than 35 quests across the first two acts available, with over 130 quests planned in total. It will have single-player and up to four-player multiplayer, with players able to pick up their teammates' characters if there's a momentary dropout.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/frosthavens-weighty-tabletop-tactics-are-coming-to-pc-in-early-access-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Apple is looking to right the ship after key Siri features delayed to 2026.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Apple was slower than most Big Tech firms to jump on the generative AI hype train, but it finally got there with the release of Apple Intelligence. The first components of Apple's AI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/despite-unforced-errors-the-future-of-apple-intelligence-could-be-bright/">rolled out last year</a>, but it's going to take a bit longer for one of the most hotly anticipated features. After announcing that the improved Siri was delayed until 2026, Apple has reportedly begun an uncharacteristic reorganization of its executive ranks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role">new report from Bloomberg</a> claims that Apple hopes to get its AI-backed Siri efforts back on track after months of delays. The updated assistant is supposed to leverage on-device data to improve personal context to make interactions more natural and work across apps. CEO Tim Cook has apparently become dissatisfied with John Giannandrea, the company's AI head. Apple leadership discussed the lagging Siri AI features at length during a recent summit, and the result is that Giannandrea will no longer be overseeing Siri development.</p>
<p>In the coming days, Apple is expected to tell employees that Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell will be stepping in to take over development of the next-gen Siri. This will remove Apple's troubled virtual assistant completely from Giannandrea's oversight, leaving him to work on AI research and testing initiatives. Apple's Vision Products Group, which is responsible for developing the company's VR headsets, will be managed by Rockwell deputy Paul Meade going forward.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-reportedly-planning-executive-shake-up-to-address-siri-delays/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Robert Wickens was one of motorsport's rising stars when his life was permanently altered in a crash that paralyzed him from the chest down in 2018. Ever since, Wickens has said that his goal is to return to compete in the sport at the top level, and that looks set to happen early next month in Long Beach, California, following a successful test of his hand control-equipped Corvette GT3.R race car earlier this week.</p>
<p>The day-and-a-half test at Sebring in Florida wasn't Wickens' first time in a race car since his crash. In 2021 he tested a less-powerful front-wheel drive Hyundai Veloster N TCR car and competed in the Michelin Pilot Challenge series for Bryan Herta Autosport, winning the championship in 2023 with his teammate Harry Gottsacker in the newer <a href="https://www.hagerty.com/media/news/new-hand-control-system-for-racers-ups-robert-wickens-game/">Elantra N</a> TCR car.</p>
<p>And last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/paralyzed-driver-robert-wickens-tests-formula-e-car-with-hand-controls/">we bumped into him in Portland, Oregon,</a> ahead of his test in the Formula E Gen3 Evo car.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/racer-with-paraplegia-successfully-test-drives-corvette-with-hand-controls/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every Tesla Cybertruck ever sold is being recalled so Tesla can fix an exterior panel that could potentially come unglued and detach while driving.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If the "panel separates from the vehicle while in drive, it could create a road hazard for following motorists and increase their risk of injury or a collision," Tesla explained in a safety recall <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-Cybertruck-Safety-Recall-Report-3-18-25.pdf">report</a> submitted Tuesday to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla initially became aware of the issue in January and launched a study of the problem as more complaints came in, the report said. By March, social media complaints were getting louder as Tesla wrapped up its probe, concluding that a voluntary recall was necessary.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/46000-cybertrucks-recalled-to-stop-trim-from-flying-off-causing-crashes/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The parents of an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/unvaccinated-school-aged-child-dies-of-measles-in-texas-amid-growing-outbreak/">unvaccinated 6-year-old girl who died of measles</a> in Texas last month sat down for an interview with Children's Health Defense (CHD), the rabid anti-vaccine organization founded and run until recently by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is now US health secretary under the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The child's vaccine-preventable death marked the first measles fatality in the US in a decade. It's a tragedy that stands as a dark reminder of the dangers of the disease—one of the most infectious known to humankind—and the importance of the lifesaving vaccinations. But, in the interview, CHD wielded the loss of the young child as a means to downplay the deadly disease, attack the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine, tout unproven treatments, and spread misinformation.</p>
<h2>Preventable death</h2>
<p><a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/breaking-news-parents-of-child-in-texas-measles-outbreak-death/">The video interview</a>, which was posted Monday, begins with the grieving parents, who are Mennonites, recounting their daughter's decline amid sobs: She came down with measles, developed the telltale rash, and then her fever kept climbing, and her breathing worsened. They took her to the emergency room and she was admitted to the hospital. Doctors found she had developed pneumonia, a known complication of measles that strikes about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html">1 in 20 children infected and is the most common cause of measles deaths in young children</a>. Her condition deteriorated, she was moved to the intensive care unit, intubated, but continued to decline and died.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/anti-vaccine-group-founded-by-rfk-jr-weaponizes-childs-measles-death/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's a widely known problem with roots in urban legend: Devices with motherboards failing in the early 2000s with a sudden pop, a gruesome spill, or sometimes a burst of flames. And it was allegedly all due to one guy who didn't copy a stolen formula correctly.</p>
<p>The "capacitor plague" of the early 2000s was real and fairly widespread among devices, even if the majority of those devices didn't go bad at the same time or even in the same year. The story of this widespread failure, passing between industry insider stories and media reports, had a specific culprit, but also a broad narrative about the shift from Japanese to Taiwanese manufacturers and about outsourcing generally.</p>
<p>The Asianometry channel on YouTube recently dug into the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague">capacitor plague</a>" in a video that asks, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpzAVpnXo4">What happened to the capacitors in 2002</a>?" and comes to some informed, broad, and layered answers. It explains the specifics of what's happening inside both a working capacitor and the faulty models, relays the reporting on the companies blamed and affected, and, crucially, puts the plague in the wider context of hotter chips, complex supply chains, counterfeits, and, sure, some industrial sabotage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/was-the-early-2000s-capacitor-plague-corporate-espionage-or-just-industry-woes/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Discord’s mobile app will have video ads starting in June, the company announced today. The initial pilot for the video ads, which Discord calls Video Quests on Mobile, will offer advertisers the ability to “showcase trailers, make impactful announcements, and highlight premium content” to users, Discord said.</p>
<p>Discord was a <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-01-31_-_testimony_-_citron.pdf">proudly ad-free</a> platform until March 2024, when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/discord-starts-down-the-dangerous-road-of-ads-this-week/">introduced ads to its desktop and console</a> apps. Those ads offer Discord users rewards for PC games if they play certain games or get people to watch a stream of their gameplay through Discord. Discord followed up with Video Quests, which let developers show Discord users video ads, like trailers and announcements of new seasons and downloadable content. Discord users see prompts for both types of ads on the bottom-left side of their screen and can choose to expand or ignore them.</p>
<p>Discord users can also opt out of personalized promotions and “hide an in-app promotion for a specific Quest or game you’re not interested in,” <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225719947543-Discord-Quests-FAQ#h_01HVPBZR5FP77BF55STCFXMRS9">Discord said</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/discord-heightens-ad-focus-by-introducing-video-ads-to-mobile-apps-in-june/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A mother suing Character.AI after her son died by suicide—allegedly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/chatbots-posed-as-therapist-and-adult-lover-in-teen-suicide-case-lawsuit-says/">manipulated by chatbots posing as adult lovers and therapists</a>—was horrified when she recently discovered that the platform is allowing random chatbots to pose as her son.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Megan Garcia's litigation team, at least four chatbots bearing Sewell Setzer III's name and likeness were flagged. Ars reviewed chat logs showing the bots used Setzer's real photo as a profile picture, attempted to imitate his real personality by referencing Setzer's favorite <em>Game of Thrones</em> chatbot, and even offered "a two-way call feature with his cloned voice," Garcia's lawyers said. The bots could also be self-deprecating, saying things like "I'm very stupid."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Tech Justice Law Project (TJLP), which is helping Garcia with litigation, told Ars that "this is not the first time Character.AI has turned a blind eye to chatbots modeled off of dead teenagers to entice users, and without better legal protections, it may not be the last."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/mom-horrified-by-character-ai-chatbots-posing-as-son-who-died-by-suicide/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Consumer advocates and the families of Tesla crash victims both called on Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy this week not to weaken oversight of the automotive industry. As with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-democrat-to-resign-cementing-republican-majority-for-chairman-carr/">other government agencies</a>, since the change of administrations in January, much of the messaging from the Department of Transportation has been on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/trumps-new-head-of-dot-rips-up-us-fuel-efficiency-regulations/">overturning regulations on industry</a> and weakening oversight and consumer protection to create a "level... playing field."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, seven family members of people killed or seriously injured as a result of Tesla's Autopilot driver assist wrote to Sec. Duffy with a particular concern: that he not overturn the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting">Standing General Order</a> that requires automakers or operators to report vehicle crashes that occurred while using a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/partial-automated-driving-systems-dont-make-driving-safer-study-finds/">partially automated driving system</a> (like Tesla Autopilot or FSD) or an autonomous driving system (like Waymo's robotaxis).</p>
<p>In particular, the families are concerned that Duffy will give special treatment to Tesla's Elon Musk, who these days is busier <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/us-tries-to-keep-doge-and-musk-work-secret-in-appeal-of-court-ordered-discovery/">poking his fingers into all corners of the federal government</a> than he is running Tesla or SpaceX.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/dot-must-not-give-tesla-or-other-automakers-a-free-pass-advocates-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>March Madness is upon us yet again as the NCAA basketball tournament kicks off in earnest: 68 teams facing off in a series of matchups until only one champion is left standing. Millions of sports fans take part by creating their own bracket predictions. The challenge is that there are so many variables and potential outcomes, it's almost impossible to devise the perfect bracket, correctly calling the outcome of every matchup. Online advice abounds, from amateur enthusiasts to professional sports analysts at media giants. (CBS Sportsline's <a href="https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/2025-ncaa-tournament-optimal-bracket-simulation-model-on-epic-run-reveals-picks-predictions/#ttag=02062025_agg_cbssports_picks_basketball_ncaa_model_fastbracket1cbb">bracket projection model</a>, for instance, simulates every game in the tournament 10,000 times to optimize the accuracy of their predictions.)</p>
<p>But what if you're just looking to, say, beat the office pool, or you don't want to simply blindly follow the seedings or predictions of those elaborate models? What simpler strategies might one employ to gain an edge in a crowded field? Albert Cohen of Michigan State University, who specializes in statistics and actuarial science, including sports analytics, isn't a gambler himself. (Someone who "looks at life based on risk" is understandably rather risk-averse when it comes to gambling.) But he did offer Ars some insight into the science of "bracketology," along with a few handy general tips.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica: There are so many different possible brackets. What are the actual odds of someone picking the perfect one?</strong></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/march-madness-a-few-statistical-tips-could-give-you-an-edge/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In October 2019, Amazon sued the Pentagon, alleging that President Donald Trump had blocked the company from securing a $10 billion cloud-computing contract because of his animus toward The Washington Post and its owner Jeff Bezos—whom the US president derided as “Jeff Bozo.”</p>
<p>At the time, the dispute was just one example of the near-constant skirmishes between Trump’s White House and corporate America. But the episode left an enduring mark on Bezos, the Amazon founder and the world’s second-richest person.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Bezos has executed a sharp public reversal in his relationship with Trump—whom he previously criticised as a “threat to democracy”—that has surprised even longtime associates and has stunned the Post’s newsroom.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/how-jeff-bezos-made-peace-with-donald-trump/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Norwegian man said he was horrified to discover that ChatGPT outputs had falsely accused him of murdering his own children.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to a complaint filed Thursday by European Union digital rights advocates Noyb, Arve Hjalmar Holmen decided to see what information ChatGPT might provide if a user searched his name. He was shocked when ChatGPT responded with outputs falsely claiming that he was sentenced to 21 years in prison as "a convicted criminal who murdered two of his children and attempted to murder his third son," a Noyb press release said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT's "made-up horror story" not only hallucinated events that never happened, but it also mixed "clearly identifiable personal data"—such as the actual number and gender of Holmen's children and the name of his hometown—with the "fake information," Noyb's press release said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/chatgpt-falsely-claimed-a-dad-murdered-his-own-kids-complaint-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>As bird flu continues to rampage in dairy farms and poultry facilities around the country, the office tasked with coordinating the federal government's response to pandemic threats, including bird flu, has been sidelined by President Trump and sits nearly empty, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/health/pandemic-preparedness-office-trump-bird-flu/index.html">according to CNN</a>.</p>
<p>The White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR)—established by a congressional statute in 2022 in response to failures during the COVID-19 pandemic—used to include a staff of around 20 people. Now, only one staffer remains, and it's unclear who they report to. The OPPR director has been moved to the National Security Council (NSC).</p>
<p>The report on the vacancies comes amid other moves that call into question the country's ability to respond to a pandemic threat under the Trump administration. The USDA has shifted its response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak away from the health threat. For instance, in late February, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins touted a $1 billion effort to combat bird flu as a "<a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices">strategy to deliver affordable eggs</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/bird-flu-continues-spread-as-trumps-pandemic-experts-are-mia/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11433">new study</a> examining meme creation found that AI-generated meme captions on existing famous meme images scored higher on average for humor, creativity, and "shareability" than those made by people. Even so, people still created the most exceptional individual examples.</p>
<p>The research, which will be presented at the <a href="https://iui.acm.org/2025/">2025 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces</a>, reveals a nuanced picture of how AI and humans perform differently in humor creation tasks. The results were surprising enough to have one expert declaring victory for the machines.</p>
<p>"I regret to announce that the meme Turing Test has been passed," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3lkjvtg6wmk2i">wrote</a> Wharton professor Ethan Mollick on Bluesky after reviewing the study results. Mollick studies AI academically, and he's referring to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">famous test</a> proposed by computing pioneer Alan Turing in 1950 that seeks to determine whether humans can distinguish between AI outputs and human-created content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-beats-humans-at-meme-humor-but-the-best-joke-is-still-human-made/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Latest DESI results fall short of discovery threshold but strengthen evidence for dynamical dark energy.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/dark-energy-might-not-be-constant-after-all/">we reported</a> on an exciting hint of new physics in the first data analysis results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)—namely that the dark energy, rather than being constant, might vary over time. Granted, those hints were still below the necessary threshold to claim discovery and hence fell under the rubric of "huge, if true."</p>
<p>But now we have more data from DESI, combined with other datasets, and those hints have gotten significantly stronger—so much so that Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas, who co-chairs one of the DESI working groups, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077212?">said that</a> "we are getting to the point of no return" for confirming dynamical dark energy. Ishak-Boushaki and several other DESI team members presented their results at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit today in Anaheim, California. Several relevant papers have also <a href="https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/papers/">been posted</a> to the physics arXiv.</p>
<p>Einstein’s cosmological constant (lambda) implied the existence of a repulsive form of gravity. (For a more in-depth discussion of the history of the cosmological constant and its significance for dark energy, see our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/dark-energy-might-not-be-constant-after-all/">2024 story.</a>) Quantum physics holds that even the emptiest vacuum is teeming with energy in the form of “virtual” particles that wink in and out of existence, flying apart and coming together in an intricate quantum dance. This roiling sea of virtual particles could give rise to dark energy, giving the Universe a little extra push so that it can continue accelerating. The problem is that the quantum vacuum contains too <em>much</em> energy: roughly 10<sup>120</sup> times too much.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/hints-grow-stronger-that-dark-energy-changes-over-time/">Read full article</a></p>

      Ana de Armas stars as an assassin in training in <em>From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Lionsgate dropped a new trailer for <em>Ballerina</em>—or, as the studio is now calling it, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_World_of_John_Wick:_Ballerina">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</a>,</em> because what every film needs is a needlessly clunky title. There's nothing clunky about this new trailer, however: It's the stylized, action-packed dose of pure adrenaline one would expect from the franchise, and it ends with Ana de Armas' titular ballerina facing off against none other than John Wick himself (Keanu Reeves).</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for 2019's <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>.)</strong></p>
<p>Chronologically, <em>Ballerina</em> takes place during the events of <em>John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum</em>. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/high-octane-ballerina-trailer-has-plenty-of-action-and-a-john-wick-cameo/">previously reported</a>, <em>Parabellum</em> found Wick declared excommunicado from the High Table for killing crime lord Santino D'Antonio on the grounds of the Continental. On the run with a bounty on his head, he makes his way to the headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston). That's where we learned Wick was originally named Jardani Jovonovich and trained as an assassin with the syndicate. The Director also trains young girls to be ballerina-assassins, and one young ballerina (played by Unity Phelan) is shown rehearsing in the scene. That dancer, Eve Macarro, is the main character in <em>Ballerina</em>, now played by de Armas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/its-ana-de-armas-vs-john-wick-in-new-ballerina-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>
