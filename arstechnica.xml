<p>When the Brazilian nutritional scientist Carlos Monteiro coined the term “ultra-processed foods” 15 years ago, he established what he calls a “new paradigm” for assessing the impact of diet on health.</p>
<p>Monteiro had noticed that although Brazilian households were spending less on sugar and oil, obesity rates were going up. The paradox could be explained by increased consumption of food that had undergone high levels of processing, such as the addition of preservatives and flavorings or the removal or addition of nutrients.</p>
<p>But health authorities and food companies resisted the link, Monteiro tells the FT. “[These are] people who spent their whole life thinking that the only link between diet and health is the nutrient content of foods ... Food is more than nutrients.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026867#p3">Read 52 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026867&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Senior managers from NASA and Boeing told reporters on Friday that they plan to launch the first crew test flight of the Starliner spacecraft as soon as June 1, following several weeks of detailed analysis of a helium leak and a "design vulnerability" with the ship's propulsion system.</p>
<p>Extensive data reviews over the last two-and-a-half weeks settled on a likely cause of the leak, which officials described as small and stable. During these reviews, engineers also built confidence that even if the leak worsened, it would not add any unacceptable risk for the Starliner test flight to the International Space Station, officials said.</p>
<p>But engineers also found that an unlikely mix of technical failures in Starliner's propulsion system—representing 0.77 percent of all possible failure modes, according to Boeing's program manager—could prevent the spacecraft from conducting a deorbit burn at the end of the mission.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027053#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027053&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[ShrinkLocker is the latest ransomware to use Windows' full-disk encryption.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap">





<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A previously unknown piece of ransomware, dubbed ShrinkLocker, encrypts victim data using the BitLocker feature built into the Windows operating system.</p>
<p>BitLocker is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/manage-bde">full-volume encryptor</a> that debuted in 2007 with the release of Windows Vista. Users employ it to encrypt entire hard drives to prevent people from reading or modifying data in the event they get physical access to the disk. Starting with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-1507-and-1511">rollout of Windows 10</a>, BitLocker by default has used the 128-bit and 256-bit XTS-AES encryption algorithm, giving the feature extra protection from attacks that rely on manipulating cipher text to cause predictable changes in plain text.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers from security firm Kaspersky found a threat actor using BitLocker to encrypt data on systems located in Mexico, Indonesia, and Jordan. The researchers named the new ransomware ShrinkLocker, both for its use of BitLocker and because it shrinks the size of each non-boot partition by 100 MB and splits the newly unallocated space into new primary partitions of the same size.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027056#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027056&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Minnesota this week eliminated two laws that made it harder for cities and towns to build their own broadband networks. The state-imposed restrictions were repealed in an <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=senate&amp;f=Sf4097&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2024">omnibus commerce policy bill</a> signed on Tuesday by Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat.</p>
<p>Minnesota was previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/isp-lobby-has-already-won-limits-on-public-broadband-in-20-states/">one of about 20 states</a> that imposed significant restrictions on municipal broadband. The <a href="https://broadbandnow.com/report/municipal-broadband-roadblocks">number</a> can differ depending on who's <a href="https://www.localnetchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CLIC-List-State-Barriers-7-1-21.pdf">counting</a> because of disagreements over what counts as a significant restriction. But the list has gotten smaller in recent years because states including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/gop-plan-for-broadband-competition-would-ban-city-run-networks-across-us/#:~:text=Republicans%20in%20the-,Arkansas,-State%20Legislature.%20Baller">Arkansas</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/colorado-kills-law-that-made-it-harder-for-cities-to-offer-internet-service/">Colorado</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/victory-for-municipal-broadband-as-wash-state-lawmakers-end-restrictions/">Washington</a> repealed laws that hindered municipal broadband.</p>
<p>The Minnesota bill enacted this week <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF4097&amp;version=latest&amp;session=ls93&amp;session_year=2024&amp;session_number=0#:~:text=Any%20municipality%20shall%20have%20the%20right%20to%20own%20and%20operate%20a%20telephone%20exchange">struck down</a> a requirement that municipal telecommunications networks be approved in an election with 65 percent of the vote. The law is over a century old, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance's Community Broadband Network Initiative <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/minnesota-strikes-down-preemption-laws-blocking-municipal-broadband">wrote</a> yesterday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027041#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027041&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX is targeting June 5 for the next flight of its massive Starship rocket, the company said Friday.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated test flight— the fourth in a program to bring Starship to operational readiness and make progress toward its eventual reuse—will seek to demonstrate the ability of the Super Heavy first stage to make a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico and for the Starship upper stage to make a controlled reentry through Earth's atmosphere before it falls into the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>This mission will carry no payloads as SpaceX seeks additional flight data about the performance of the complex Starship vehicle. It is simultaneously the largest and most powerful rocket ever built and the first launch system ever intended to be fully and rapidly reusable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026961#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026961&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you're tired of Google's AI Overview extracting all value from the web while also telling people to eat glue or run with scissors, you can turn it off—sort of. Google has been telling people its AI box at the top of search results is <em>the future</em>, and you can't turn it off, but that ignores how Google search works: A lot of options are powered by URL parameters. That means you can turn off AI search with this one simple trick! (Sorry.)</p>
<p>Our method for killing AI search is defaulting to the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-search-adds-web-filter-as-it-pivots-to-ai-focused-search-results/">"web" search filter,</a> which Google recently launched as a way to search the web without Google's alpha-quality AI junk. It's actually pretty nice, showing only the traditional 10 blue links, giving you a clean (well, other than the ads), uncluttered results page that looks like it's from 2011. Sadly, Google's UI doesn't have a way to make "web" search the default, and switching to it means digging through the "more" options drop-down <em>after</em> you do a search, so it's a few clicks deep.</p>
<p>Check out the URL after you do a search, and you'll see a mile-long URL full of esoteric tracking information and mode information. We'll put each search result URL parameter on a new line so the URL is somewhat readable:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026948#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026948&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, the Biden administration announced it would <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-ev-china-tariffs-biden/">levy dramatic new tariffs</a> on <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/electric-vehicles/">electric vehicles</a>, electric vehicle batteries, and battery components imported into the United States from China. The move kicked off another round of global debate on how best to push the transportation industry toward an emissions-free future, and how global automotive manufacturers outside of China should compete with the Asian country’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-chinas-ev-boom-caught-western-car-companies-asleep-at-the-wheel/">well-engineered and low-cost car options</a>.</p>
<p>But what is an electric <em>vehicle</em> exactly? China has dominated bicycle manufacturing, too; it was responsible for some 80 percent of US bicycle imports in 2021, according to <a href="https://prosperousamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Global-Bicycle-Market-A-Comprehensive-Plan-to-Re-Shore-the-U.S.-Bike-E-Bike-Industry-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://prosperousamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Global-Bicycle-Market-A-Comprehensive-Plan-to-Re-Shore-the-U.S.-Bike-E-Bike-Industry-1.pdf" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://prosperousamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Global-Bicycle-Market-A-Comprehensive-Plan-to-Re-Shore-the-U.S.-Bike-E-Bike-Industry-1.pdf"}'>one report</a>. In cycling circles, the US’s new trade policies have raised questions about how much bicycle companies will have to pay to get Chinese-made bicycles and components into the US, and whether any new costs will get passed on to US customers. </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>

<p>Despite the delusions of the raw milk crowd, drinking unpasteurized milk brimming with infectious avian H5N1 influenza virus is a very bad idea, according to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2405495">freshly squeezed data published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison squirted raw H5N1-containing milk from infected cows into the throats of anesthetized laboratory mice, finding that the virus caused systemic infections after the mice were observed swallowing the dose. The illnesses began quickly, with symptoms of lethargy and ruffled fur starting on day 1. On day 4, the animals were euthanized to prevent extended suffering. Subsequent analysis found that the mice had high levels of H5N1 bird flu virus in their respiratory tracts, as well their hearts, kidneys, spleens, livers, mammary glands, and brains.</p>
<p>"Collectively, our data indicate that HPAI [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza] A(H5N1) virus in untreated milk can infect susceptible animals that consume it," the researchers concluded. The researchers also found that raw milk containing H5N1 can remain infectious for weeks when stored at refrigerator temperatures.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027000#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027000&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On May 20, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/ios-and-ipados-17-5-1-fix-a-nasty-bug-that-resurfaced-old-photos/">Apple released iOS 17.5.1</a> to fix a bug users had found a few days prior in iOS 17.5 that resurfaced old photos that had been previously deleted. So far, the update seems to have resolved the issue, but users were left wondering exactly what had happened. Now Apple has clarified the issue somewhat, describing the nature of the bug to 9to5Mac.</p>
<p>Apple told the publication that the photos were not regurgitated from iCloud Photos after being deleted on the local device; rather, they were local to the device. Apple says they were neither left in the cloud after deletion nor synced to it after, and the company did not have access to the deleted photos.</p>
<p>The photos were retained on the local device storage due to a database corruption issue, and the bug resurfaced photos that were flagged for deletion but were not actually fully deleted locally.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026970#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026970&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>With Valve's Steam gaming platform <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steam20">approaching the US drinking age</a> this year, more and more aging PC gamers may be considering what will happen to their vast digital game libraries after they die. Unfortunately, legally, your collection of hundreds of backlogged games will likely pass into the ether along with you someday.</p>
<p>The issue of digital game inheritability gained renewed attention this week as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/">a ResetEra poster</a> quoted a Steam support response asking about transferring Steam account ownership via a last will and testament. "Unfortunately, Steam accounts and games are non-transferable" the response reads. "Steam Support can't provide someone else with access to the account or merge its contents with another account. I regret to inform you that your Steam account cannot be transferred via a will."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time someone has asked this basic estate planning question, of course. Last year, a Steam forum user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/3820780544823475453/#c3820780544825804543">quoted a similar response from Steam support</a> as saying, "Your account is yours and yours alone. Now you can share it with family members, but you cannot give it away."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026982#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026982&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">Asus' ROG Ally</a> was the first major-brand attempt to compete with Valve's Steam Deck. It was beefy and interesting, but it had three major flaws: It ran Windows on a little touchscreen, had unremarkable ergonomics, and its battery life was painful.</p>
<p>The Asus ROG (Republic of Gamers) Ally X, which has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vze62qJK1Sk">announced</a> and is due out June 2, seems to have had its specs leaked, and they indicate a fix for at least the battery life. Gaming site <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-x-specs-leaked-24gb-lpddr5x-7500-memory-and-massive-80-wh-battery">VideoCardz</a>, starting its leak reveal with "No more rumors," cites the ROG Ally X as having the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU as the prior ROG Ally, as well as the same 7-inch 1080p VRR screen with a 120 Hz refresh rate.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img alt="VideoCardz' leaked image, seemingly from Asus marketing materials, with the ROG Ally X's specifications." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/videocardz_leak2.jpg"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">VideoCardz' leaked image, seemingly from Asus marketing materials, with the ROG Ally X's specifications.

<p>The battery and memory have changed substantially, though. An 80-watt-hour battery, up from 40, somehow adds just 70 grams of weight and about 5 mm of thickness to the sequel device. By increasing the RAM from 16GB to 24GB and making it LPDDR5, the ROG Ally X may be able to lend more of it to the GPU, upping performance somewhat without demanding a new chip or architecture. There is also a second USB-C port, with USB4 speeds, that should help quite a bit with docking, charging while playing with accessories, and, I would guess, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/3/">Linux hackery</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026950#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026950&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Former and current OpenAI employees received a memo this week that the AI company hopes to end the most embarrassing scandal that Sam Altman has ever faced as OpenAI's CEO.</p>
<p>The memo finally clarified for employees that OpenAI would not enforce a non-disparagement contract that employees since at least 2019 were pressured to sign within a week of termination or else risk losing their vested equity. For an OpenAI employee, that could mean losing millions for expressing even mild criticism about OpenAI's work.</p>
<p>You can read the full memo below in a <a href="https://x.com/andrew_n_carr/status/1793773522432753854">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) from Andrew Carr, a former OpenAI employee whose LinkedIn confirms that he left the company in 2021.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026952#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026952&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.45 of the Rocket Report! The most interesting news in launch this week, to me, is that Firefly is potentially up for sale. That makes two of the handful of US companies with operational rockets, Firefly and United Launch Alliance, actively on offer. I'll be fascinated to see what the valuations of each end up being if/when sales go through.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smalll.png"></div>
<p><strong>Firefly may be up for sale</strong>. Firefly Aerospace investors are considering a sale that could value the closely held rocket and Moon lander maker at about $1.5 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-22/firefly-aerospace-backers-said-to-explore-1-5-billion-sale">Bloomberg reports</a>. The rocket company's primary owner, AE Industrial Partners, is working with an adviser on "strategic options" for Firefly. Neither AE nor Firefly commented to Bloomberg about the potential sale. AE invested $75 million into Texas-based Firefly as part of a series B financing round in 2022. The firm made a subsequent investment in its Series C round in November 2023.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026434#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026434&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you use Google regularly, you may have noticed the company's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">AI Overviews</a> providing summarized answers to some of your questions in recent days. If you use social media regularly, you may have <a href="https://twitter.com/kinyt33/status/1793038888241401924">come across</a> many <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xydexxunicorn.bsky.social/post/3kt3p24slzk2q">examples</a> of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/caitlindeangelis.bsky.social/post/3kstxkut2c22n">those AI Overviews</a> being <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rem.postes.club/post/3ksnmkotpj22g">hilariously</a> or even <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/morte.bsky.social/post/3kt4di6uj2i26">dangerously wrong</a>.</p>
<p>Factual errors can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/nycs-government-chatbot-is-lying-about-city-laws-and-regulations/">pop up</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/chatgpt-alarms-users-by-spitting-out-shakespearean-nonsense-and-rambling/">existing LLM chatbots</a> as well, of course. But the potential damage that can be caused by AI inaccuracy gets multiplied when those errors appear atop the ultra-valuable web real estate of the Google search results page.</p>
<p>"The examples we've seen are generally very uncommon queries and aren’t representative of most people’s experiences," a Google spokesperson told Ars. "The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025825#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025825&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The launch of a classified Russian military satellite last week deployed a payload that US government officials say is likely a space weapon.</p>
<p>In a series of statements, US officials said the new military satellite, named Kosmos 2576, appears to be similar to two previous "inspector" spacecraft launched by Russia in 2019 and 2022.</p>
<p>"Just last week, on May 16, Russia launched a satellite into low-Earth orbit that the United States assesses is likely a counter-space weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low-Earth orbit," said Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador to the United Nations. "Russia deployed this new counter-space weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026816#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026816&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A software maker serving more than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the world hosted an application update containing a hidden backdoor that maintained persistent communication with a malicious website, researchers reported Thursday, in the latest episode of a supply-chain attack.</p>
<p>The software, known as the JAVS Viewer 8, is a component of the <a href="https://www.javs.com/javs-suite-8-av-management-software/">JAVS Suite 8</a>, an application package courtrooms use to record, play back, and manage audio and video from proceedings. Its maker, Louisville, Kentucky-based Justice AV Solutions, says its products are used in more than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the US and 11 other countries. The company has been in business for 35 years.</p>
<h2>JAVS Viewer users at high risk</h2>
<p>Researchers from security firm Rapid7 <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/23/cve-2024-4978-backdoored-justice-av-solutions-viewer-software-used-in-apparent-supply-chain-attack/">reported</a> that a version of the JAVS Viewer 8 available for download on javs.com contained a backdoor that gave an unknown threat actor persistent access to infected devices. The malicious download, planted inside an executable file that installs the JAVS Viewer version 8.3.7, was available no later than April 1, when a <a href="https://x.com/2RunJack2/status/1775052981966377148">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) reported it. It’s unclear when the backdoored version was removed from the company’s download page. JAVS representatives didn’t immediately respond to questions sent by email.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026911#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026911&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Owners of Spotify's soon-to-be-bricked Car Thing device are begging the company to open-source the gadgets to save some the landfill. Spotify hasn't responded to pleas to salvage the hardware, which was originally intended to connect to car dashboards and auxiliary outlets to enable drivers to listen to and navigate Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify announced today that it's bricking all purchased Car Things on December 9 and not offering refunds or trade-in options. On a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">support page</a>, Spotify says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings. We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify has no further guidance for device owners beyond asking them to reset the device to factory settings and “safely” get rid of the bricked gadget by “following local electronic waste guidelines.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026806#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026806&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bing, Microsoft's search engine platform, went down in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/bing-search-outages-since-early-this-morning-442499">the very early morning today</a>. That meant that searches from Microsoft's Edge browsers that had yet to change their default providers didn't work. It also meant that services relying on Bing's search API—Microsoft's own Copilot, ChatGPT search, Yahoo, Ecosia, and DuckDuckGo—similarly failed.</p>
<p>Services were largely restored by the morning Eastern work hours, but the timing feels apt, concerning, or some combination of the two. Google, the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">consistently dominating search platform</a>, just last week <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">announced</a> and debuted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/">AI Overviews as a default addition to all searches</a>. If you don't want an AI response but still want to use Google, you can hunt down <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-search-adds-web-filter-as-it-pivots-to-ai-focused-search-results/">the new "Web" option</a> in a menu, or you can, <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/05/17/google-web-search-make-default/">per Ernie Smith</a>, tack "&amp;udm=14" onto your search or use Smith's own <a href="https://udm14.com/">"Konami code" shortcut page</a>.</p>
<p>If dismay about AI's hallucinations, power draw, or <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-is-paying-reddit-60-million-for-fucksmith-to-tell-its-users-to-eat-glue/">pizza recipes</a> concern you—along with perhaps broader Google issues involving privacy, tracking, news, SEO, or monopoly power—most of your other major options were brought down by a single API outage this morning. Moving past that kind of single point of vulnerability will take some work, both by the industry and by you, the person wondering if there's a real alternative.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026559#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026559&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Windows 11 24H2 update isn’t scheduled to be released until sometime this fall, but testers can get a near-final version of it early. Microsoft has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/">released Windows 11 24H2 build 26100.712</a> to its Release Preview testing channel for Windows Insiders, a sign that the update is nearly complete and that the company has shifted into bug-fixing mode ahead of general availability.</p>
<p>Microsoft has generally stuck to smaller but more frequent feature updates during the Windows 11 era, but the annual fall updates still tend to be a bigger deal. They’re the ones that determine whether you’re still eligible for security updates, and they often (but not always) come with more significant under-the-hood changes than the normal feature drops.</p>

<p>Case in point: Windows 11 24H2 includes an updated compiler, kernel, and scheduler, all lower-level system changes made at least in part to better support Arm-based PCs. Existing Windows-on-Arm systems should also see a 10 or 20 percent performance boost when using x86 applications, thanks to improvements in the translation layer (which Microsoft is now calling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsoft-says-prism-translation-layer-does-for-arm-pcs-what-rosetta-did-for-macs/">Prism</a>).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026588#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026588&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
