<p>Northwest Oregon had never seen anything like it. Over the course of three days in June 2021, Multnomah County—the Emerald State’s most populous county, which rests in the swayback along Oregon’s northern border—recorded highs of 108°, 112°, and 116° Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Temperatures were so hot that <a href="https://x.com/PDXStreetcar/status/1409287314870837253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the metal on cable cars melted</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the asphalt on roadways buckled</a>. Nearly half the homes in the county lacked cooling systems because of Oregon’s typically gentle summers, where average highs top out at 81°. Sixty-nine people perished from heat stroke, most of them in their homes.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36289-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientific studies showed</a> that the extreme temperatures were caused by heat domes, which experts say are influenced by climate change, county officials didn’t just chalk it up to a random weather occurrence. They started researching the large fossil fuel companies whose emissions are driving the climate crisis—including ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron—and <a href="https://multco-web7-psh-files-usw2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/First%20Amended%20Complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued them</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035696#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035696&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Despite the fact that Americans buy more electric bicycles than electric cars, widespread adoption of electric motorcycles still lags well behind both. Part of the sluggish sales pace likely comes down to high prices, but as tech continues to evolve, e-moto sticker shock will eventually subside.</p>
<p>Lower prices will only enhance the obvious benefits of electrifying motorbikes: silent operation, quick and easy charging, fewer moving parts to service, and a smaller footprint while commuting. In the meantime, one of the most interesting concepts on the market today comes courtesy of a company called Verge, in Finland, with an utterly baffling hubless rear-wheel motor design.</p>
<p>As usual with bleeding-edge tech, Verge's first model, the TS, commands a serious premium: a base TS starts at $26,900, and the mid-level TS Pro adds $3,000 to that, while the TS Ultra ramps all the way up to $49,900. I recently test-rode an early TS Pro that Verge shipped to the United States, hoping to prove whether this hubless rear motor truly deserves a future in the industry or simply represents another over-priced gimmick.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035501#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035501&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been a whirlwind journey of stops and starts, but <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/05/apple-green-lights-epic-games-store-in-rapid-reversal">AppleInsider reports</a> the Epic Game Store for iOS in the European Union has passed Apple's notarization process.</p>
<p>This paves the way for Epic CEO Tim Sweeney to realize his long-stated goal of launching an alternative game store on Apple's closed platform—at least in Europe.</p>
<p>Apple announced plans to allow third-party app stores on iOS in the region earlier this year, complying with the letter of the law (though some say not the spirit) as required by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which was enacted in hopes of making platforms more open and competitive.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035658#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035658&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The true identity of nosy next-door neighbor Agatha—played to perfection by Kathryn Hahn—was the big reveal of 2021's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/review-wandavision-sticks-the-landing-with-a-very-marvel-esque-finale/"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, even inspiring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8u8md-NiHM">a meta-jingle</a> that went viral. Now Hahn is bringing the character back for her own standalone adventure with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_All_Along_(miniseries)"><em>Agatha All Along.</em></a> Based on the first trailer, it looks like a lot of dark, spooky fun, just in time for the Halloween season. The nine-episode series is one of the TV series in the MCU's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Five">Phase Five</a>, coming on the heels of <em>Secret Invasion, Loki </em>S2, <em>What If...?</em> S2, and <em>Echo</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision"><em>WandaVision</em></a> below.)</strong></p>
<p><em>WandaVision</em> was set immediately after the events of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> (but before <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>), with newlyweds Wanda and Vision starting their married life in the town of Westview, New Jersey. Wacky hijinks ensued as the couple tried to lead a normal life while hiding their superpowers from their neighbors—especially Hahn's nosy Agnes. Each episode was shot in the style of a particular era of sitcom television, from the 1950s through the 2000s. The couple noticed more and more jarring elements—a full-color drone, a voice calling out to Wanda over the radio, neighbors briefly breaking character—hinting that this seemingly idyllic suburban existence might not be what it seemed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035566#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035566&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After "cyber incidents" on June 19 and 20 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/cyberattacks-have-forced-thousands-of-car-dealerships-to-paper-for-a-second-day/">took down CDK Global</a>, a software-as-a-service vendor for more than 15,000 car dealerships, forum and Reddit comments by service tech workers and dealers advised their compatriots to prepare for weeks, not days, before service was restored.</p>
<p>That sentiment proved accurate, as CDK Global <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/07/01/cdk-cyberattack-outage-back-up-update/74270415007/">last expected</a> to have "all dealers' connections" working by either July 3 or 4, roughly two weeks' time. Posts across various dealer-related subreddits today suggest CDK's main services are mostly restored, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/partscounter/comments/1dyb295/is_cdk_back_yet/">if not entirely</a>. Restoration of services is a mixed blessing for some workers, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/partscounter/comments/1dw934a/return_of_cdk_day_5/">huge backlogs of paperwork</a> now need entering into digital systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/cdk-hackers-want-millions-in-ransom-to-end-car-dealership-outage">Bloomberg reported</a> on June 21 that a ransomware gang, BlackSuit, had demanded "tens of millions of dollars" from CDK and that the company was planning to pay that amount, according to a source familiar with the matter. CDK later told its clients on June 25 that the attack was a "cyber ransom event," and that restoring services would take "several days and not weeks." Allan Liska, with analyst Recorded Future, told Bloomberg that BlackSuit was responsible for at least 95 other recorded ransomware breaches around the world.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035541#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035541&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In 2019, Nike got closer than ever to its dreams of popularizing self-tying sneakers by releasing the Adapt BB. Using Bluetooth, the sneakers paired to the Adapt app that let users do things like tighten or loosen the shoes' laces and control its LED lights. However, Nike has <a href="https://www.nike.com/help/a/adapt-app">announced</a> that it's "retiring" the app on August 6, when it will no longer be downloadable from Apple's App Store or the Google Play Store; nor will it be updated.</p>
<p>In an announcement recently spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24192184/nike-adapt-bb-shoes-sneakers-apple-android-app">The Verge</a>, Nike's brief explanation for discontinuing the app is that Nike "is no longer creating new versions of Adapt shoes.” The company started informing owners about the app's retirement about four months ago.</p>
<p>Those who already bought the shoes can still use the app after August 6, but it's expected that iOS or Android updates will eventually make the app unusable. Also, those who get a new device won't be able to download Adapt after August 6.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035526#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035526&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A bunch of eighth graders in a "wealthy Philadelphia suburb" recently targeted teachers with an extreme online harassment campaign that The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/technology/tiktok-fake-teachers-pennsylvania.html">reported</a> was "the first known group TikTok attack of its kind by middle schoolers on their teachers in the United States."</p>
<p>According to The Times, the Great Valley Middle School students created at least 22 fake accounts impersonating about 20 teachers in offensive ways. The fake accounts portrayed long-time, dedicated teachers sharing "pedophilia innuendo, racist memes," and homophobic posts, as well as posts fabricating "sexual hookups among teachers."</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania middle school's principal, Edward Souders, told parents in an email that the number of students creating the fake accounts was likely "small," but that hundreds of students piled on, leaving comments and following the fake accounts. Other students responsibly rushed to report the misconduct, though, Souders said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035561#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035561&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            Testing spellcheck in the latest version of Windows Notepad.                      </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>In March, Microsoft started testing an update to the venerable Notepad app that added spellcheck and autocorrect to the app's limited but slowly growing set of capabilities. The update that adds these features to Notepad is now rolling out to all Windows 11 users via the Microsoft Store, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/8/24194047/microsoft-notepad-spellcheck-autocorrect-features-available">reported by The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>The spellcheck feature underlines words in red when they're misspelled, and users can either left-click the words to see a list of suggestions or right-click words and see suggestions under a separate "spelling" menu item. Autocorrect works automatically to fix minor and obvious misspellings (typing "misspellign" instead of "misspelling," for example), and changes can be reverted manually or by using the Undo command.</p>
<p>Either feature can be disabled from within Notepad's settings. The spellchecker can also be switched on and off for a few different individual file extensions in case you want to see spelling suggestions for .txt files but not for .md or .lic files. The Verge also reports that spellchecking is turned off by default for log files or "other file types associated with coding." Neither feature worked when I opened a batch file in Notepad to edit it, for example.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035496#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035496&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge and pay $243.6 million for violating a 2021 agreement that was spurred by two fatal crashes. The US government notified a judge of Boeing's plea agreement in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.342881/gov.uscourts.txnd.342881.204.0_2.pdf">July 7 filing</a> in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas.</p>
<p>"The parties have agreed that Boeing will plead guilty to the most serious readily provable offense," the Department of Justice said. If accepted by the court, the deal would allow Boeing to avoid a trial.</p>
<p>Families of victims said in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.342881/gov.uscourts.txnd.342881.205.0.pdf">filing yesterday</a> that they will urge the court to reject the deal at a plea hearing. "The families intend to argue that the plea deal with Boeing unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of 346 persons," their lawyers wrote.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035523#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035523&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>This past weekend was a busy one on the racing calendar. Over in the UK, the British Grand Prix at Silverstone was yet more evidence that Red Bull no longer has the fastest car in F1. In Ohio, IndyCar had a mostly successful introduction of its new supercapacitor-based hybrid system. And a couple of Great Lakes over, NASCAR held its second street race in Chicago, choosing that event to also show off its prototype of a fully electric stock car.</p>
<p>In doing so, it has partnered with the technology company ABB, which, among other things, makes charging equipment and is also Formula E's title sponsor. "The objective of the collaboration between NASCAR, ABB in the United States, and the NASCAR industry is to push the boundaries of electrification technology, from EV racing to long-haul transportation to facility operations," said ABB Executive Vice President Ralph Donati.</p>
<p>The NASCAR EV prototype starts with a modified Next Gen chassis, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/nascar-is-getting-a-huge-tech-upgrade-for-its-2022-race-car/">which was introduced to the sport in 2022</a>. This is something of a no-brainer: in addition to the other stuff you want in a race car chassis, like a good ratio of stiffness to weight, it's also designed to be able to safely protect the driver from the consequences of the very high-speed crashes that occur in the series. So, there shouldn't be any concerns about the 78 kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035485#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035485&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Can a washed-up Formula One driver come out of retirement to mentor a young rookie into a champion? That's the basic premise for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_(film)"><em>F1</em></a>, a forthcoming film starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski (<em>Tron: Legacy, Top Gun: Maverick</em>). Warner Bros. dropped the first teaser for the film yesterday, right before the 2024 British Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, a fictional Formula One driver who crashed horribly in the 1990s and retired from the sport. Then his longtime friend Ruben (Javier Bardem), owner of the fictional team APXGP, approaches him about coming out of retirement to mentor his team's rookie prodigy, Joshua "Noah" Pearce (Damson Idris). "They're a last place team, they're 21-22 on the grid, they've never scored a point," <a href="https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/f1/12917967/brad-pitt-im-having-the-time-of-my-life-at-silverstone">Pitt told Sky Sports</a> last year. "But they have a young phenom (Idris) and they bring me in as kind of a Hail Mary and hijinks ensue."</p>
<p>In addition to Pitt, Bardem, and Idris, the cast includes Kerry Condon as Kate; Tobias Menzies as Banning; Kim Bodnia as Kaspar; Shea Wigham as Chip Hart; Joseph Balderrama as Rica Fazio; Sarah Niles as Noah's mother, Bernadette; Samson Kayo as Cashman; Callie Cooke as Jodie; and Layne Harper as Press.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035456#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035456&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em> is now in its 61st year, featuring a host of gifted British actors, each taking on the iconic role in turn. So Ncuti Gatwa had some very big shoes to fill when he took on playing the Fifteenth Doctor. Now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_series_14">the season</a> has concluded and the verdict is in: Gatwa is more than up to the challenge, bringing sparkling energy, charisma, and a superb sense of style to the role. He sings and dances, too, as does winsome new companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson). They have terrific onscreen chemistry, and Davies is in top storytelling form. In short, the new season mostly feels as fresh and energetic as ever, and I'm already looking forward to more.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<p>Here's a brief summation for the benefit of those who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/05/doctor-whos-sparkling-new-season-feels-like-a-fresh-return-to-form/">may not have kept up</a> with the more recent seasons. This is Russell T. Davies' second stint as showrunner, having revived the series in 2005. He lost no time introducing a few new twists after signing back on as show runner. When it came time for Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor to regenerate, fans had expected Gatwa to be introduced. Instead, the new Fourteenth Doctor was played by former Tenth Doctor David Tennant, reuniting with former companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) for three specials.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034205#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034205&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The melting of one of North America’s largest ice fields has accelerated and could soon reach an irreversible tipping point. That’s the conclusion of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49269-y">new research</a> colleagues and I have published on the Juneau Icefield, which straddles the Alaska-Canada border near the Alaskan capital of Juneau.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2022, I skied across the flat, smooth, and white plateau of the icefield, accompanied by <a href="https://juneauicefield.org/">other researchers</a>, sliding in the tracks of the person in front of me under a hot sun. From that plateau, around 40 huge, interconnected glaciers descend towards the sea, with hundreds of smaller glaciers on the mountain peaks all around.</p>
<p>Our work, now published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49269-y">Nature Communications</a>, has shown that Juneau is an example of a climate “feedback” in action: as temperatures are rising, less and less snow is remaining through the summer (technically: the “end-of-summer snowline” is rising). This in turn leads to ice being exposed to sunshine and higher temperatures, which means more melt, less snow, and so on.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035391#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035391&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Death was everywhere. Animal corpses littered the landscape and were mired in the local waterhole as ash swept around everything in its path. For some, death happened quickly; for others, it was slow and painful.</p>
<p>This was the scene in the aftermath of a supervolcanic eruption in Idaho, approximately 1,600 kilometers (900 miles) away. It was an eruption so powerful that it obliterated the volcano itself, leaving a crater 80 kilometers (50 miles) wide and spewing clouds of ash that the wind carried over long distances, killing almost everything that inhaled it. This was particularly true here, in this location in Nebraska, where animals large and small succumbed to the eruption’s deadly emissions.</p>
<p>Eventually, all traces of this horrific event were buried; life continued, evolved, and changed. That's why, millions of years later in the summer of 1971, Michael Voorhies was able to enjoy another delightful day of exploring.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035079#p3">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035079&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Did ancient people practice equality? While stereotypes may suggest otherwise, the remains of one Neolithic society reveal evidence that both men and women, as well as locals and foreigners, were all equal in at least a critical aspect of life: what they ate.</p>
<p>The Neolithic saw the dawn of agriculture and animal husbandry some 6,000 years ago. In what is now Valais, Switzerland, the type and amount of food people ate was the same regardless of sex or where they had come from. Researchers led by Déborah Rosselet-Christ of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) learned this by analyzing isotopes in the bones and teeth of adults buried in what is now called the Barmaz necropolis. Based on the 49 individuals studied, people at the Barmaz site enjoyed dietary equality.</p>
<p>“Unlike other similar studies of Neolithic burials, the Barmaz population appears to have drawn its protein resources from a similar environment, with the same access to resources for adults, whether male or female,” the researchers said in a study recently published in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X2400213X?via%3Dihub">Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035401#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035401&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the world races to decarbonize everything from the electricity grid to industry, it faces particular problems with transportation—which alone is responsible for about a quarter of our planet’s energy-related <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2019/calculate-carbon-footprint">greenhouse gas emissions</a>. The fuels for transport need to be not just green, cheap, and powerful, but also lightweight and safe enough to be carried around.</p>
<p>Fossil fuels—mainly gasoline and diesel—have been extraordinarily effective at powering a diverse range of mobile machines. Since the Industrial Revolution, humanity has perfected the art of dredging these up, refining them, distributing them and combusting them in engines, creating a vast and hard-to-budge industry. Now we have to <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2021/cost-of-climate-change">step away from fossil fuels</a>, and the world is finding no one-size-fits-all replacement.</p>
<p>Each type of transportation has its own peculiarities—which is one reason we have different formulations of hydrocarbons today, from gasoline to diesel, bunker fuel to jet fuel. Cars need a convenient, lightweight power source; container ships need enough oomph to last months; planes absolutely need to be reliable and to work at subzero temperatures. As the fossil fuels are phased out, the transport fuel landscape is “getting more diverse,” says Timothy Lipman, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035363#p3">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035363&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.01 of the Rocket Report! We're compiling this week's report a day later than usual due to the Independence Day holiday. Ars is beginning its seventh year publishing this weekly roundup of rocket news, and there's a lot of it this week despite the holiday here in the United States. Worldwide, there were 122 launches that flew into Earth orbit or beyond in the first half of 2024, up from 91 in the same period last year.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>Firefly launches its fifth Alpha flight. </b>Firefly Aerospace placed eight CubeSats into orbit on a mission funded by NASA on the first flight of the company’s Alpha rocket since an upper stage malfunction more than half a year ago, <a href="https://spacenews.com/firefly-aerospace-launches-nasa-sponsored-cubesats/">Space News reports</a>. The two-stage Alpha rocket lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California late Wednesday, two days after an issue with ground equipment aborted liftoff just before engine ignition. The eight CubeSats come from NASA centers and universities for a range of educational, research, and technology demonstration missions. This was the fifth flight of Firefly's Alpha rocket, capable of placing about a metric ton of payload into low-Earth orbit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035341#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035341&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One person may have died from eating Diamond Shruumz microdosing candies, which were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/microdosing-candies-linked-to-seizures-intubation-finally-recalled/">recalled last week</a> amid a rash of severe illnesses involving <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/people-are-seizing-being-intubated-after-eating-microdose-chocolates/">seizures, intubation, and intensive care stays</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024">an update this week from the Food and Drug Administration</a>, the cluster of cases continues to increase across the country. To date, 48 people across 24 states have fallen ill after eating the candies, which include chocolate bars, gummies, and candy cones that were sold online and in retail locations, such as smoke and vape shops. Of the 48 people sickened, 46 were ill enough to seek medical care, and 27 were admitted to a hospital.</p>
<p>For now, the death noted in the FDA's latest update is only "potentially associated" with the candies and is still under investigation. No other information is yet available.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035387#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035387&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, the people managing the ITER experimental fusion reactor <a href="https://www.iter.org/doc/www/content/com/Lists/Stories/Attachments/4056/Baseline_Press_Conference_Summary_July-2024_b.pdf">announced</a> that a combination of delays and altered priorities meant that its first-of-its-kind hardware wouldn't see plasma until 2036, with the full-energy deuterium-tritium fusion pushed back to 2039. The latter represents a four-year delay relative to the previous roadmap. While the former is also a delay, it's due in part to changing priorities.</p>
<h2>COVID and construction delays</h2>
<p>ITER is an attempt to build a fusion reactor that's capable of sustaining plasmas that allow it to operate well beyond the break-even point, where the energy released by fusion reactions significantly exceeds the energy required to create the conditions that enable those reactions. It's meant to hit that milestone by scaling up a well-understood design called a tokamak.</p>
<p>But the problem has been plagued by delays and cost overruns nearly from its start. At early stages, many of these stemmed from changes in designs necessitated by a better and improved understanding of plasmas held at extreme pressures and temperatures due to better modeling capabilities and a better understanding of the behavior of plasmas in smaller reactions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035383#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035383&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
