                            <![CDATA[<p>A Georgia college student named Darian DeCruise has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27170664-decruise-v-opeenai/">sued</a> OpenAI, alleging that a <a href="https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/">recently deprecated</a> version of ChatGPT “convinced him that he was an oracle” and “pushed him into psychosis.”</p>
<p>This case, <a href="https://www.law.com/2026/01/26/new-california-lawsuits-against-openai-bring-to-11-the-number-of-claims-linking-chatbot-to-mental-health-harms/">which was first reported by ALM</a>, marks the 11th such known lawsuit to be filed against OpenAI that involves mental health breakdowns allegedly caused by the chatbot. Other incidents have ranged from highly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/after-using-chatgpt-man-swaps-his-salt-for-sodium-bromide-and-suffers-psychosis/">questionable medical and health advice</a> to a man who <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-suicide-openai-gpt4o">took his own life</a>, apparently after similarly sycophantic conversations with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>DeCruise’s lawyer, Benjamin Schenk—whose firm bills itself as “<a href="https://schenklawfirm.com/ai-psychosis-lawsuit/">AI Injury Attorneys</a>”—told Ars in an email that a version of ChatGPT, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/openai-brings-back-gpt-4o-after-user-revolt/">known as GPT-4o</a>, was created in a negligent fashion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/before-psychosis-chatgpt-told-man-he-was-an-oracle-new-lawsuit-alleges/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>Diablo II</em> is one of those storied classic PC games that's pretty much always fun to come back to—so much so that some players <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">have put thousands of hours into the game</a> over more than two decades. Across all those years, though, the game itself <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/16-years-later-blizzard-is-still-patching-diablo-ii/">has barely changed</a>, becoming something of a familiar, comfortable blanket of hellfire for longtime players.</p>
<p>That makes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/diablo-ii-gets-its-first-new-playable-class-in-over-25-years/">last week's introduction of a new playable Warlock class</a> in <em>Diablo II Resurrected</em>’s new "Reign of the Warlock" DLC a pretty big deal. And after playing through a few Acts with the Warlock over the recent holiday weekend, I found the new option to be a great excuse to come back to a game that's overdue for a shot in the arm.</p>
<h2>War-locked in</h2>
<p>How your Warlock build goes depends heavily on which of the three main upgrade branches you choose to go down. Of these, I found the Eldritch branch had been the most interesting and fun to explore. That's in large part because of a new skill that lets you levitate a powerful two-handed weapon in front of you while still holding a strong shield in your hands. It seems like a small change, but my relief was palpable in this playthrough as I was able to avoid these kinds of tough choices between defense and offense as I juggled my inventory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/diablo-iis-new-warlock-is-a-great-excuse-to-revisit-a-classic-game/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Does "bouba" sound round to you? How about "maluma"? Neither are real words, but we've known for decades that people who hear them tend to associate them with round objects. There have been plenty of ideas put forward about why that would be the case, and most of them have turned out to be wrong. Now, in perhaps the weirdest bit of evidence to date, researchers have found that even newly hatched chickens seem to associate "bouba" with round shapes.</p>
<p>The initial finding dates all the way back to 1947, when someone discovered that people associated some word-like sounds with rounded shapes, and others with spiky ones. In the years since, that association got formalized as the bouba/kiki effect, received a fair bit of experimental attention, and ended up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect">an extensive Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>
<p>One of the initial ideas to explain it was similarity to actual words (either phonetically or via the characters used to spell them), but then studies with speakers of different languages and alphabets showed that it is likely a general human tendency. The association also showed up in infants as young as 4 months old, well before they master speaking or spelling. Attempts to find the bouba/kiki effects in other primates, however, came up empty. That led to some speculation that it might be evidence of a strictly human processing ability that underlies our capacity to learn sophisticated languages.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/newly-hatched-chickens-form-the-same-sound-association-we-do/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's just two weeks until F1 gets underway in Australia, and teams are currently in Bahrain, midway through their third and final preseason test. The 2026 season promises to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/formula-1-is-deploying-new-jargon-for-2026/">wildly different</a> from those of the past few years, with all-new cars, engines, hybrid systems, and sustainable fuels entering the mix and shaking up the established order.</p>
<p>You shouldn't read too much into times from preseason testing. The cars don't have to conform to the in-season rules as teams test new components or fit-test rigs; for example, glowing brake discs could once again be seen on some cars that weren't running wheel covers at an earlier test, something we're unlikely to see during actual races.</p>
<p>You also don't know how much fuel—and therefore extra weight—anyone is carrying. In the past, some teams have even made headlines by running too light to set more competitive lap times in an effort to impress potential sponsors. And as the name explains, it's a test, so drivers will be following run plans devised with their engineers to learn specific things about their new cars. Or as one Internet wag once put it, the times mean as much as "a bacon briefcase."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/f1-preseason-tests-shows-how-different-2026-will-be/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Another day, another Google AI model. Google has really been pumping out new AI tools lately, having just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/">released Gemini 3 in November</a>. Today, it's bumping the flagship model to version 3.1. The new <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/">Gemini 3.1 Pro</a> is rolling out (in preview) for developers and consumers today with the promise of better problem-solving and reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>Google announced improvements to its Deep Think tool last week, and apparently, the "core intelligence" behind that update was Gemini 3.1 Pro. As usual, Google's latest model announcement comes with a plethora of benchmarks that show mostly modest improvements. In the popular Humanity's Last Exam, which tests advanced domain-specific knowledge, Gemini 3.1 Pro scored a record 44.4 percent. Gemini 3 Pro managed 37.5 percent, while OpenAI's GPT 5.2 got 34.5 percent.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In Formula One, grip is everything. The world's best engineers devote their careers to designing cars that maximize downforce and grip to squeeze every bit of performance out of a set of four humble tires. These cars punish their drivers by slinging them at six Gs through corners and offer similar levels of abuse in braking.</p>
<p>It's all wildly impressive, but I've long maintained that those drivers are not the ones having the most fun. When it comes to sheer enjoyment, grip is highly overrated, and if you want proof of that, you need to try ice racing.</p>
<p>Should you be lucky enough to live somewhere that gets cold enough consistently enough, all you need is a good set of tires and a car that's willing and able. That, of course, and a desire to spend more time driving sideways than straight. I've been ice racing for well over 20 years now, and I'm here to tell you that there's no greater thrill on four wheels than sliding through a corner a few inches astern of a hard-charging competitor.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/zero-grip-maximum-fun-a-practical-guide-to-getting-into-amateur-ice-racing/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, Jason Grad issued a late-night warning to the 20 employees at his tech startup. “You've likely seen Clawdbot trending on X/LinkedIn. While cool, it is currently unvetted and high-risk for our environment," he wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasongrad_im-officially-banning-the-most-viral-ai-activity-7422906215166537729-nTSg/">Slack message</a> with a red siren emoji. “Please keep Clawdbot off all company hardware and away from work-linked accounts.”</p>
<p>Grad isn’t the only tech executive who has raised concerns to staff about the experimental agentic AI tool, which was briefly known as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/">MoltBot</a> and is now named OpenClaw. A Meta executive says he recently told his team to keep OpenClaw off their regular work laptops or risk losing their jobs. The executive told reporters he believes the software is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malevolent-ai-agent-openclaw-clawdbot/">unpredictable</a> and could lead to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/security-news-this-week-moltbook-the-social-network-for-ai-agents-exposed-real-humans-data/">a privacy breach</a> if used in otherwise secure environments. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.</p>
<p>Peter Steinberger, OpenClaw’s solo founder, launched it as <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw">a free, open source tool</a> last November. But <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/clawdbot-moltbot-viral-ai-assistant/">its popularity surged last month</a> as other coders contributed features and began sharing their experiences using it on social media. Last week, Steinberger <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/2023150230905159801">joined</a> ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which says it will keep OpenClaw open source and support it through a foundation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openclaw-security-fears-lead-meta-other-ai-firms-to-restrict-its-use/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We love hearing about the latest findings coming out of an Eötvös Loránd University (ELU) research group focused on gifted word learner (GWL) dogs—if only for the pictures of adorable doggoes playing with their toys. Just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/these-dogs-eavesdrop-on-their-owners-to-learn-new-words/">last month</a>, we <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq5474">learned that</a> such dogs can learn the labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. The group is back with yet another <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-026-02047-3">new paper</a>, published in the journal Animal Cognition, presenting evidence that GWL dogs have a preference for novel toys and like to share them with their owners. That social interaction seems to be the key to the unique cognitive abilities of these rare dogs.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/these-dogs-eavesdrop-on-their-owners-to-learn-new-words/">previously reported</a>, ELU co-author Claudia Fugazza has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the <a href="https://ethology.elte.hu/gifteddogs">Genius Dog Challenge</a>. For instance, the group’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-022-01639-z?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_BOOKS_ECOM_PBOK_ALWYS_DEEPLINK_GL&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=5403bdd6926f11f082de00130a82b839" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-022-01639-z?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_BOOKS_ECOM_PBOK_ALWYS_DEEPLINK_GL&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=5403bdd6926f11f082de00130a82b839" data-ml-id="0" data-ml="true" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1771357035162hih" data-xid="fr1771357035162hih">2022 study</a> discovered that dogs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/dogs-rely-on-multiple-senses-to-locate-their-favorite-toys-study-finds/">store key sensory features</a> about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/some-dogs-can-classify-their-toys-by-function/">Last fall</a>, Fugazza’s group <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01079-6">discovered that</a> certain dogs can not only memorize the names of objects like their favorite toys, but also extend those labels to entirely new objects with a similar function, regardless of whether or not they are similar in appearance. It’s a cognitively advanced ability known as “label extension,” and for animals to acquire it usually involves years of intensive training in captivity. But the dogs in this new study developed the ability to classify their toys by function with no formal training, merely by playing naturally with their owners. It’s akin to a person calling a hammer and a rock by the same name, or a child understanding that “cup” can describe a mug, a glass, or a tumbler because they serve the same function.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/rare-gifted-word-learner-dogs-like-to-share-their-toys/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Following our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-makes-customers-wait-35-days-to-unlock-fully-paid-off-phones/">report last week</a> that Verizon is forcing people to wait 35 days for phone unlocks after paying off device installment plans, Verizon is apparently trying to eliminate the inconvenient delay. But Verizon hasn't confirmed the plan to Ars, and a Verizon statement published by Android Authority yesterday did not provide any timeline for implementing the change.</p>
<p>As a refresher, an update to Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposed a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off the remaining balance of a device installment plan online, in the Verizon app, or with a Verizon gift card. There's also a 35-day waiting period after paying off an installment plan over the phone or at a Verizon Authorized Retailer.</p>
<p>Saying restrictions are needed to counter fraud, Verizon will only unlock a phone immediately when someone pays off their device-plan balance at a Verizon corporate store or when someone pays off an installment plan on schedule via automatic payments. If you're partway into one of Verizon’s <a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/device-payment-faqs/">36-month device installment plans</a> and pay off the remaining balance early, but without making a trip to a Verizon corporate store, you'd have to wait 35 days for an unlock that would allow you to switch the phone to a different carrier's network.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-might-drop-its-annoying-35-day-wait-for-unlocking-paid-off-phones/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>2026 is looking like a pretty good year for affordable electric vehicles. There's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/2026-nissan-leaf-review-the-best-budget-ev-on-sale-right-now/">a new Nissan Leaf</a> that starts at a hair under $30,000 (as long as you ignore the destination charge). We'll soon drive the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/the-chevrolet-bolt-is-back-but-for-how-long/">reborn</a> Chevrolet Bolt—with a new lithium iron phosphate battery, it also has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/its-back-the-2027-chevy-bolt-gets-an-all-new-lfp-battery-but-what-else/">a price tag starting with a two</a> (again, ignoring the destination charge). And the closer you get to $40,000, the more your options expand: the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-the-best-all-around-ev-just-got-better/">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/the-chevrolet-equinox-ev-is-high-on-comfort-and-convenience/">Chevy Equinox EV</a>, Toyota bZ, Tesla Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Subaru Solterra all fall within that price bracket, and some of those are pretty good cars.</p>
<p>But what if you only want to spend a fraction of that? Well, you won't be buying anything new, but then neither do three-quarters of American car buyers, and there's nothing wrong with that. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/how-far-does-5000-go-when-you-want-an-electric-car/">we looked at what passes for the used EV bargain basement</a>—ones that cost $5,000 or less. As long as you're OK with limited range and slow charging, going electric on a shoestring is possible. But if you're prepared to spend twice that, it turns out you've got plenty of options.</p>
<p>As before, we stress that you should have a reliable place to charge an EV if you're going to buy one, which means at home at night or at work during the day. At this price range, you're unlikely to find something that DC fast charges quickly, and relying on public AC charging sounds stressful. You'll probably find a car with some battery degradation, but for the vast majority of models that use active battery cooling, this should be minimal; <a href="https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/">about 2 percent a year appears to be the average</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/chevy-bolt-bmw-i3-or-something-else-at-10k-you-have-lots-of-ev-options/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The lawsuit came from more than a dozen environmental and health groups, including the American Public Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), the Clean Air Council, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Sierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>
<p>The groups have asked the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the EPA decision, which also eliminated requirements controlling greenhouse gas emissions in new cars and trucks. Urging a return to the status quo, the groups argued that the Trump administration is anti-science and illegally moving to benefit the fossil fuel industry, despite a mountain of evidence demonstrating the deadly consequences of unchecked pollution and climate change-induced floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/lawsuit-epa-revoking-greenhouse-gas-finding-risks-thousands-of-avoidable-deaths/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Archival storage poses lots of challenges. We want media that is extremely dense and stable for centuries or more, and, ideally, doesn't consume any energy when not being accessed. Lots of ideas have floated around—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/researchers-build-a-metadata-based-image-database-using-dna-storage/">even DNA has been considered</a>—but one of the simplest is to cut the data into glass. Many forms of glass are very physically and chemically stable, and it's relatively easy to create features in it.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of preliminary work demonstrating different aspects of a glass-based storage system. But in Wednesday's issue of Nature, Microsoft Research announced Project Silica, a working demonstration of a system that can read and write data into small slabs of glass with a density of over a Gigabit per cubic millimeter.</p>
<h2>Writing on glass</h2>
<p>We tend to think of glass as fragile, prone to shattering, and capable of flowing downward over centuries, although the last claim is a myth. Glass is a category of material, and a variety of chemicals can form glasses. With the right starting chemical, it's possible to make a glass that is, as the researchers put it, "thermally and chemically stable and is resistant to moisture ingress, temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interference." While it would still need to be handled in a way to minimize damage, glass provides the sort of stability we'd want for long-term storage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/microsofts-new-10000-year-data-storage-medium-glass/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed its shocking refusal to consider Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine for approval.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-refuses-to-review-modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine/">refusal was revealed last week</a> in a sharply worded press release from Moderna. Subsequent reporting found that the decision was made by political appointee Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration's top vaccine regulator, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/trump-official-overruled-fda-scientists-to-reject-modernas-flu-shot/">overruled a team of agency scientists</a> and a top career official in rejecting Moderna's application.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called music "the universal language of mankind." Is that still true when the so-called music is being generated by a probabilistic robot instead of a human? We're about to find out. Google has announced its latest Lyria 3 AI model is being <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/lyria-3/">deployed in the Gemini app</a>, vastly expanding access to AI music generation.</p>
<p>Google DeepMind has been tinkering with Lyria for a while now, offering limited access in developer-oriented products like Vertex AI. Lyria 3 is more capable than previous versions, and it's also quicker to use. Just select the new "Create music" option in the Gemini app or web UI to get started. You can describe what you want and even upload an image to help the robot get the right vibe. And in a few seconds, you get music (or something like it).</p>
<p>In case there was any uncertainty about whether Lyria tracks still counted as a human artistic endeavor, worry not! Unlike past versions of the model, you don't even have to provide lyrics in your prompt. You can be vague with your request, and the model will create suitable lyrics for the 30-second song. Although with that limit, "jingle" might be more accurate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/gemini-can-now-generate-ai-music-for-you-no-lyrics-required/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's that time of year—a new budget Pixel phone is about to hit virtual shelves. The Pixel 10a will be available on March 5, and pre-orders go live today. The 9a will still be on sale for a while, but the 10a will be headlining Google's store. However, you might not notice unless you keep up with the Pixel numbering scheme. This year's A-series Pixel is virtually identical to last year's, both inside and out.</p>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-pixel-9a-review-all-the-phone-you-need/">Pixel 9a</a> was a notable departure from the older design language, but Google made few changes for 2026. We liked that the Pixel 9a emphasized battery capacity and moved to a flat camera bump, and this time, it's <em>really</em> flat. Google says the camera now sits totally flush with the back panel. This is probably the only change you'll be able to identify visually.</p>

<p>Google also says the new Pixel will have a slightly upgraded screen. The resolution, size, and refresh rate are unchanged, but peak brightness has been bumped from 2,700 nits to 3,000 nits (the same as the base model Pixel 10). Plus, the cover glass has finally moved beyond Gorilla Glass 3 to Gorilla Glass 7i, which supposedly has improved scratch and drop protection.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/googles-pixel-10a-arrives-on-march-5-for-499-with-specs-and-design-of-yesteryear/">Read full article</a></p>

The bright iridescent colors in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/metamorphosis-scientists-watch-butterfly-wings-grow-inside-chrysalis-in-real-time/" data-uri="86ff6a37d2983899b6bd60278aac8cf6">butterfly wings</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/french-painters-inspire-new-insights-into-the-physics-of-soap-bubbles/2/" data-uri="8402077486195c3f4a9450074f22b433">soap bubbles</a>, opals, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/01/study-jewel-beetles-use-iridescence-for-camouflage-not-sexual-selection/" data-uri="e9e8ec9b1025fda0931d9abe57f22d26">beetle shells</a> don’t come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured—naturally occurring <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/shiny-things-an-ode-to-photonic-crystals/" data-uri="9bd92986dbfa9ceae97039c93c287f63">photonic crystals</a>. In nature, scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects), for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5783709/the-colorful-story-of-diffraction-grating" data-uri="c6b87d0b1ae84edf70bdb73e548906c9">diffraction grating</a>, except photonic crystals only produce specific colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism. In the case of kingfisher feathers, the color is due to the microscopic ridges that cover the parallel rows of keratin strands that grow along the central shaft.</p>
<p>Also known as photonic band-gap materials, photonic crystals are “tunable,” which means they are precisely ordered to block certain wavelengths of light while letting others through. Alter the structure by changing the size of the tiles, and the crystals become sensitive to a different wavelength. They are used in optical communications as waveguides and switches, as well as in filters, lasers, mirrors, and various anti-reflection stealth devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/what-the-chinese-art-of-tian-tsui-has-to-do-with-kingfishers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every day, people log into an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-ice-forum-where-agents-complain-about-their-jobs/">online forum</a> for current and former <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/social-security-administration-appointment-details-ice/">Homeland Security</a> Investigations (HSI) officers to share their thoughts on the news of the day and complain about their colleagues in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-expansion-across-us-at-heres-where-its-going-next/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE).</p>
<p>“ERO is too busy dressing up as Black Ops Commandos with Tactical body armor, drop down thigh rigs, balaclavas, multiple M4 magazines, and Punisher patches, to do an Admin arrest of a non criminal, non-violent EWI that weighs 90 pounds and is 5 foot 2, inside a secure Federal building where everyone has been screened for weapons,” wrote one user in July 2025. (ERO stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations; along with HSI, it’s one of the two major divisions of ICE, and is responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants.)</p>
<p>The forum describes itself as a space for current and prospective HSI agents, “designed for the seasoned HSI Special Agent as well as applicants for entry level Special Agent positions.” HSI is the division within ICE whose agents are normally responsible for investigating crimes like drug smuggling, terrorism, and human trafficking.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/inside-the-dhs-forum-where-ice-agents-trash-talk-one-another/">Read full article</a></p>
