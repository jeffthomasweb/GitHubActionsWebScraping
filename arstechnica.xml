<p>Tonight, Apple will debut some new Immersive Video content for the Vision Pro headset—the first sports content for the device. It doesn't seem like much after two months of no new content, though.</p>
<p>Starting at 6 pm PT/9 pm ET, Vision Pro users will be able to watch a sports film captured for the platform's Immersive Video format. The video will be a series of highlights from last year's Major League Soccer (MLS) playoffs, and according to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/apples-immersive-mls-highlight-reel-debuts-later-today/">Six Colors</a>, it will run just five minutes. It will be free for all Vision Pro users.</p>
<p>On February 2, Apple released what appeared to be the first episodes of three Immersive Video series: <em>Adventure</em>, <em>Prehistoric Planet</em>, and <em>Wildlife</em>. Each debuted alongside the Vision Pro's launch with one episode labeled "Episode 1" of "Season 1."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013280#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013280&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I enjoy getting my exercise, but hate doing it indoors. I'd much rather get some fresh air and watch the world drift past me as I cycle or hike somewhere than watch a screen while sweating away on something stationary.</p>
<p>To get a bit more of what I like, I've invested in a variety of gear that has extended my cycling season deeper into the winter. But even with that, there are various conditions—near-freezing temperatures, heavy rains, Canada catching fire—that have kept me off the roads. So, a backup exercise plan has always been on my to-do list.</p>
<p>The company LifeSpan offers exercise equipment that fits well into a home office and gave me the chance to try its <a href="https://www.lifespanfitness.com/products/ampera-under-desk-bike">Ampera model</a>. It's a stationary bike that tucks nicely under a standing desk and has a distinct twist: You can pedal to power the laptop you're working on. Overall, the hardware is well-designed, but some glitches, software issues, and design decisions keep it from living up to its potential.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005793#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005793&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last April, Meta <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/red-table-talk-canceled-mina-lefevre-exits-facebook-watch-ends-originals-meta-1235337005/">revealed</a> that it would no longer support original shows, like Jada Pinkett Smith's <em>Red Table Talk</em> talk show, on Facebook Watch. Meta's streaming business that was once viewed as competition for the likes of YouTube and Netflix is effectively dead now; Facebook doesn't produce original series, and Facebook Watch is no longer available as a video-streaming app.</p>
<p>The streaming business' demise has seemed related to cost cuts at Meta that have also included layoffs. However, recently unsealed court documents in an antitrust suit against Meta [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Klein-v.-Meta-Platforms.pdf">PDF</a>] claim that Meta has squashed its streaming dreams in order to appease one of its biggest ad customers: Netflix.</p>
<h2>Facebook allegedly gave Netflix creepy privileges</h2>
<p>As spotted via <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebooks-streaming-watch-killed-sell-netflix-ads-1851367876?utm_source=vip">Gizmodo</a>, a letter was filed on April 14 in relation to a class-action antitrust suit that was filed by Meta customers, accusing Meta of anti-competitive practices that harm social media competition and consumers. The letter, made public Saturday, asks a court to have Reed Hastings, Netflix's founder and former CEO, respond to a subpoena for documents that plaintiffs claim are relevant to the case. The original complaint filed in December 2020 [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/complaint.pdf">PDF</a>] doesn’t mention Netflix beyond stating that Facebook “secretly signed Whitelist and Data sharing agreements” with Netflix, along with “dozens” of other third-party app developers. The case is still ongoing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013174#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013174&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In December 2020, astronomers spotted an unusual burst of light in a galaxy roughly 848 million light-years away—a region with a supermassive black hole at the center that had been largely quiet until then. The energy of the burst mysteriously dipped about every 8.5 days before the black hole settled back down, akin to having a case of celestial hiccups.</p>
<p>Now scientists think they've figured out the reason for this unusual behavior. The supermassive black hole is orbited by a smaller black hole that periodically punches through the larger object's accretion disk during its travels, releasing a plume of gas. This suggests that black hole accretion disks might not be as uniform as astronomers thought, according to a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj8898">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances.</p>
<p>Co-author Dheeraj "DJ" Pasham of MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space research noticed the community alert that went out after the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) detected the flare, dubbed ASASSN-20qc. He was intrigued and still had some allotted time on the X-ray telescope, called NICER (the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) on board the International Space Station. He directed the telescope to the galaxy of interest and gathered about four months of data, after which the flare faded.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013019#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013019&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PyPI, a vital repository for open source developers, temporarily halted new project creation and new user registration following an onslaught of package uploads that executed malicious code on any device that installed them. Ten hours later, it lifted the suspension.</p>
<p>Short for the Python Package Index, PyPI is the go-to source for apps and code libraries written in the Python programming language. Fortune 500 corporations and independent developers alike rely on the repository to obtain the latest versions of code needed to make their projects run. At a little after 7 pm PT on Wednesday, the site started displaying a banner message informing visitors that the site was temporarily suspending new project creation and new user registration. The message didn’t explain why or provide an estimate of when the suspension would be lifted.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Snap Store, where containerized <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap apps</a> are distributed for Ubuntu's Linux distribution, has been attacked for months by fake crypto wallet uploads that seek to steal users' currencies. As a result, engineers at Ubuntu's parent firm are now manually reviewing apps uploaded to the store before they are available.</p>
<p>The move follows weeks of reporting by Alan Pope, a former Canonical/Ubuntu staffer on the Snapcraft team, who is still very active in the ecosystem. In February, Pope blogged about how <a href="https://popey.com/blog/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/">one bitcoin investor lost nine bitcoins</a> (about $490,000 at the time) by using an "Exodus Wallet" app from the Snap store. Exodus is a known cryptocurrency wallet, but this wallet was not from that entity. As detailed by one user <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904">wondering what happened on the Snapcraft forums</a>, the wallet immediately transferred his entire balance to an unknown address after a 12-word recovery phrase was entered (which Exodus tells you on support pages never to do).</p>
<p>Pope takes pains to note that cryptocurrency is inherently fraught with loss risk. Still, Ubuntu's App Center, which presents the Snap Store for desktop users, tagged the "Exodus" app as "Safe," and the web version of the Snap Store describes Snaps as "safe to run." While Ubuntu is describing apps as "Safe" in the sense of being an auto-updating container with runtime confinement (or "sandboxed"), a green checkmark with "Safe" next to it could be misread, especially by a newcomer to Ubuntu, Snaps, and Linux generally.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013152#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013152&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Health officials have long warned that gonorrhea is becoming more and more resistant to all the antibiotic drugs we have to fight it. Last year, the US reached <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/gonorrhea-is-becoming-unstoppable-highly-resistant-cases-found-in-us/">a grim landmark</a>: For the first time, two unrelated people in Massachusetts were found to have gonorrhea infections with complete or reduced susceptibility to every drug in our arsenal, including the frontline drug ceftriaxone. Luckily, they were still able to be cured with high-dose injections of ceftriaxone. But, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bluntly notes: "Little now stands between us and untreatable gonorrhea."</p>
<p>If public health alarm bells could somehow hit a higher pitch, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7312a2.htm?s_cid=mm7312a2_w">a study published Thursday from researchers in China</a> would certainly accomplish it. The study surveyed gonorrhea bacterial isolates—<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>—from around the country and found that the prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant isolates nearly tripled between 2017 and 2021. Ceftriaxone-resistant strains made up roughly 8 percent of the nearly 3,000 bacterial isolates collected from gonorrhea infections in 2022. That's up from just under 3 percent in 2017. The study appears in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>
<p>While those single-digit percentages may seem low, compared to other countries they're extremely high. In the US, for instance, the prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant strains <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/gisp-profiles/default.htm">never went above 0.2 percent between 2017 and 2021</a>, according to the CDC. In Canada, ceftriaxone-resistance was stable at 0.6 percent between 2017 and 2021. The United Kingdom had a prevalence of 0.21 percent in 2022.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013217#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013217&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/28/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-omb-policy-to-advance-governance-innovation-and-risk-management-in-federal-agencies-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">announced</a> the "first government-wide <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf">policy</a> to mitigate risks of artificial intelligence (AI) and harness its benefits." To coordinate these efforts, every federal agency must appoint a chief AI officer with "significant expertise in AI."</p>
<p>Some agencies have already appointed chief AI officers, but any agency that has not must appoint a senior official over the next 60 days. If an official already appointed as a chief AI officer does not have the necessary authority to coordinate AI use in the agency, they must be granted additional authority or else a new chief AI officer must be named.</p>
<p>Ideal candidates, the White House recommended, might include chief information officers, chief data officers, or chief technology officers, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013196#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013196&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Broadcom has made sweeping changes to VMware's business since acquiring the company in November 2023, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">killing off the perpetually licensed versions</a> of VMware's software and instituting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-cuts-at-least-2800-vmware-jobs-following-69-billion-acquisition/#:~:text=Broadcom%20cuts%20at%20least%202%2C800,%2469%20billion%20acquisition%20%7C%20Ars%20Technica">large-scale layoffs</a>. Broadcom executives have acknowledged the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/broadcom-ceo-admits-vmware-changes-have-brought-unease-to-customers-partners/">unease</a>" that all of these changes have created among VMware's customers and partners but so far haven't been interested in backtracking.</p>
<p>Among the casualties of the acquisition is the free version of VMware's vSphere Hypervisor, also known as ESXi. ESXi is "bare-metal hypervisor" software, meaning that it allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single piece of hardware while still allowing those operating systems direct access to disks, GPUs, and other system resources.</p>

<p>One alternative to ESXi for home users and small organizations is <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview">Proxmox Virtual Environment</a>, a Debian-based Linux operating system that provides broadly similar functionality and has the benefit of still being an actively developed product. To help jilted ESXi users, the Proxmox team has just added a new "<a href="https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/new-import-wizard-available-for-migrating-vmware-esxi-based-virtual-machines.144023/">integrated import wizard</a>" to Proxmox that supports importing of ESXi VMs, easing the pain of migrating between platforms.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013153#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013153&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Unboxing a new gadget is always a fun experience, but it's usually marred somewhat by the setup process. Either your device has been in a box for months, or it's just now launching and ships in the box with pre-release software. Either way, the first thing you have to do is connect to Wi-Fi and wait several minutes for an OS update to download and install. The issue is so common that going through a lengthy download is an expected part of buying anything that connects to the Internet.</p>
<p>But what if you could update the device <em>while it's still in the box?</em> That's the latest plan cooked up by Apple, which is close to rolling out a system that will let Apple Stores wirelessly update new iPhones while they're still in their boxes. The new system is called "Presto."</p>
<p>French site <a href="https://www.igen.fr/iphone/2024/03/apple-store-presto-met-un-iphone-jour-en-15-minutes-boite-fermee-142655">iGeneration</a> has the first picture of what this setup looks like. It starts with a clearly Apple-designed silver rack that holds iPhones and has a few lights on the front. The site (through translation) calls the device a "toaster," and yes, it looks like a toaster oven or <a href="https://baldwin2k.com/g/milledgeville-ga/n/212097/new-milledgeville-pizza-hut-and-running">food heating rack</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012836#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012836&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Convicted FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison today, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-sentencing-ftx-fraud-2d92fce9?mod=hp_lead_pos2">news reports</a>.</p>
<p>The founder and ex-CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX was sentenced this morning by Judge Lewis Kaplan in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Bankman-Fried had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/sbf-asks-for-5-year-prison-sentence-calls-100-year-recommendation-grotesque/">requested</a> a sentence of 63 to 78 months (5.25 to 6.5 years), arguing that he deserved leniency because of his "charitable works and demonstrated commitment to others."</p>
<p>Kaplan ordered a forfeiture of $11 billion but did not order restitution "due to the complexity of the case and the number of victims," the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631292/united-states-v-bankman-fried/?filed_after=&amp;filed_before=&amp;entry_gte=&amp;entry_lte=&amp;order_by=desc#minute-entry-382422899">court docket</a> said. Kaplan instead authorized the US to compensate victims with "forfeited assets through a remission process, as restitution would be impractical in this case."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013137#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013137&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In 2022, we brought news that Lola, a once-famous racing company, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/rebuilding-a-once-great-racing-name-the-return-of-lola-cars/">was planning its renaissance</a>. Lola never really cracked Formula 1, but it did have success in IndyCar and sports car racing with cars it designed and built from the 1960s until it <a href="https://us.motorsport.com/wec/news/british-racing-car-constructor-lola-cars-cease-public-trading/2646692/">ceased trading</a> in 2012. Now, under new ownership, the company has been rebuilding its engineering facilities and expertise. And together with Yamaha as its technical partner, it has chosen Formula E for its official return to professional motorsport.</p>
<p>Formula E's dart-shaped electric single-seaters are <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-e/new-formula-e-car-2025-gen3-evo-design-concept/">getting a bit of an update</a> before they start season 11 next year. We expect new bodywork, better tires, and perhaps the ability to use the front electric motor to send power to the wheels instead of just acting as regenerative brakes on the front axle, but those components are all spec parts, meaning every team has to use the same ones without modifying them.</p>
<p>That goes for the battery, too, but there is freedom when it comes to the 470 hp (350 kW) electric motor that powers the rear wheels. And then there's the software, without which the car won't go anywhere.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013140#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013140&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Embracer Group has been backing away from its all-encompassing position in the games industry lately. The latest divestment is Gearbox Entertainment, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/borderlands-studio-gets-scooped-up-in-deal-worth-up-to-1-37-billion/">studio behind the <em>Borderlands </em>series it bought in early 2021</a> for a deal that could have been worth up to $1.37 billion to Gearbox had it stayed inside the Swedish conglomerate's grasp.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240327928202/en/">The buyer is Take-Two Interactive Software</a>, which had previously partnered with Gearbox on publishing <em>Borderlands</em> and other titles. Take-Two will issue new shares of its common stock to pay $460 million for Gearbox, to be completed before the end of June this year. Embracer paid $363 million in cash and stock for Gearbox in 2021 but promised up to $1 billion more should the developer hit earnings goals over six years.</p>
<p>"Today’s announcement marks the result of the final structured divestment process and is an important step in transforming Embracer into the future with notably lower net debt and improved free cash flow," said Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors in a statement intended to start nobody's imagination running.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013096#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013096&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <p><em>Welcome to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/daily-telescope/">Daily Telescope</a>. There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>

<p>Good morning. It's March 28, and today's photo comes from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory as well as a host of other observatories.</p>
<p>It is a composite image of supernova remnant SNR 1181. The name of the object gives us a clue to when this object went supernova: the year 1181. For about half a year, the 'new' star appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. It took a long time before astronomers using modern telescopes were able to find the remnant of this supernova, but they finally did so in the last decade.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012976#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012976&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is the rocket that literally lights itself on fire before it heads to space. It's the world's largest rocket entirely fueled by liquid hydrogen, a propellant that is vexing to handle but rewarding in its efficiency.</p>
<p>The Delta IV Heavy was America's most powerful launch vehicle for nearly a decade and has been a cornerstone for the US military's space program for more than 20 years. It is also the world's most expensive commercially produced rocket, a fact driven not just by its outsize capability but also its complexity.</p>
<p>Now, United Launch Alliance's last Delta IV Heavy rocket is set to lift off Thursday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, with a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government's spy satellite agency.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012923#p3">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012923&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Thousands of servers storing AI workloads and network credentials have been hacked in an ongoing attack campaign targeting a reported vulnerability in Ray, a computing framework used by OpenAI, Uber, and Amazon.</p>
<p>The attacks, which have been active for at least seven months, have led to the tampering of AI models. They have also resulted in the compromise of network credentials, allowing access to internal networks and databases and tokens for accessing accounts on platforms including OpenAI, Hugging Face, Stripe, and Azure. Besides corrupting models and stealing credentials, attackers behind the campaign have installed cryptocurrency miners on compromised infrastructure, which typically provides massive amounts of computing power. Attackers have also installed reverse shells, which are text-based interfaces for remotely controlling servers.</p>
<h2>Hitting the jackpot</h2>
<p>“When attackers get their hands on a Ray production cluster, it is a jackpot,” researchers from Oligo, the security firm that spotted the attacks, wrote in a <a href="https://www.oligo.security/blog/shadowray-attack-ai-workloads-actively-exploited-in-the-wild">post</a>. “Valuable company data plus remote code execution makes it easy to monetize attacks—all while remaining in the shadows, totally undetected (and, with static security tools, undetectable).”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013046#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013046&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>There's a strong consensus that tackling most useful problems with a quantum computer will require that the computer be capable of error correction. There is absolutely no consensus, however, about what technology will allow us to achieve that. A large number of companies, including major players like Microsoft, Intel, Amazon, and IBM, have all committed to different technologies to get there, while a collection of startups are exploring an even wider range of potential solutions.</p>
<p>We probably won't have a clearer picture of what's likely to work for a few years. But there's going to be lots of interesting research and development work between now and then, some of which may ultimately represent key milestones in the development of quantum computing. To give you a sense of that work, we're going to look at three papers that were published within the last couple of weeks, each of which tackles a different aspect of quantum computing technology.</p>
<h2>Hot stuff</h2>
<p>Error correction will require connecting multiple hardware qubits to act as a single unit termed a logical qubit. This spreads a single bit of quantum information across multiple hardware qubits, making it more robust. Additional qubits are used to monitor the behavior of the ones holding the data and perform corrections as needed. Some error-correction schemes require over a hundred hardware qubits for each logical qubit, meaning we'd need tens of thousands of hardware qubits before we could do anything practical.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013053#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013053&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Puerto Rico has declared a public health emergency amid an ongoing outbreak of dengue infections, a mosquito-spread viral infection that can cause fever, aches, rash, vomiting, and, in about 5 percent of cases, a severe disease marked by internal bleeding and shock.</p>
<p>The US territory has tallied 549 cases since the start of the year, representing a <a href="https://www.salud.pr.gov/CMS/DOWNLOAD/8768">140 percent increase</a> compared with cases tallied at this point last year, <a href="https://www.salud.pr.gov/menuInst/download/1833">according to the territory's health department</a>. The Associated Press reported that more than 340 of the 549 cases have been hospitalized.</p>

<p>Starlink's mobile ambitions were dealt at least a temporary blow yesterday when the Federal Communications Commission dismissed SpaceX's application to use several spectrum bands for mobile service.</p>
<p>SpaceX is seeking approval to use up to 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites with spectrum in the 1.6 GHz, 2 GHz, and 2.4 GHz bands. SpaceX could still end up getting what it wants but will have to go through new rulemaking processes in which the FCC will evaluate whether the spectrum bands can handle the system without affecting existing users.</p>
<p>The FCC Space Bureau's <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/spacex-gen2-mss-application-dismissed-unacceptable-filing">ruling</a> dismissed the SpaceX application yesterday as "unacceptable for filing." The application was filed over a year ago.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012994#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012994&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
