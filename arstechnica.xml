                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal vaccine panel entirely hand-selected by health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gathered for its first meeting Wednesday—and immediately announced that it would re-evaluate the entire childhood vaccination schedule, as well as the one for adults.</p>
<p>The meeting overall was packed with anti-vaccine talking points and arguments from the new panel members, confirming public health experts' fears that the once-revered panel is now critically corrupted and that Kennedy's controversial picks will only work to fulfill his long-standing anti-vaccine agenda.</p>
<h2>Controversial committee</h2>
<p>An hour before the meeting began, the American Academy of Pediatrics came out swinging against the new panel, saying that the panel's work is "no longer a credible process." The organization shunned the meeting, refusing to send a liaison to the panel's meeting, which it has done for decades.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/all-childhood-vaccines-in-question-after-first-meeting-of-rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trump-org-launches-47-month-wireless-service-teases-odd-499-phone/">Trump phone</a> was announced last week with a claim that the device would be made entirely in America, and people were rightly skeptical. Trump Mobile's $500 T1 Phone "is a sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance and proudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best from their mobile carrier," the Trump Organization <a href="https://www.trump.com/media/trump-mobile-launches-a-bold-new-wireless-service">said</a> in a press release.</p>
<p>But with electronics supply chain experts <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/mobile-experts-skeptical-of-trump-t1-phone-made-in-america-claims">casting doubt</a> on the feasibility of designing and building an American-made phone in a short span of time, Trump Mobile's website doesn't currently promise an American-made phone. The <a href="https://trumpmobile.com/t1-phone">website</a> says the T1 is "designed with American values in mind," that it is "brought to life right here in the USA," and that there are "American hands behind every device."</p>
<p>The Trump Mobile website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617004920/https://trumpmobile.com/">previously said</a>, "Our MADE IN THE USA 'T1 Phone' is available for pre-order now." The phone was initially supposed to be available in August, but the date was changed to September, and now the website simply says it will be available "later this year."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/after-a-week-trump-mobile-drops-claim-that-trump-phone-is-made-in-the-usa/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Bluetooth trackers have existed for quite a while, but Apple made them worthwhile when it enlisted every iPhone to support AirTags. The tracking was so reliable that Apple had to add <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/apple-plans-airtag-alert-upgrades-to-prevent-stalking-and-other-crimes/">anti-stalking features</a>, and there are just as many Android phones out there. However, Google's version of mobile device tracking, known as Find Hub, has been comparatively spotty. Now, Google is about to offer users a choice that could fix Bluetooth tracking on Android.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-find-hub-setup-screen-3570944/">Android Authority</a>, Google is preparing to add a new screen to the Android setup process. This change, integrated with Play Services version 25.24, has yet to roll out widely, but it will allow anyone setting up an Android phone to choose a more effective method of tracking that will bolster Google's network. This is included in the Play Services changelog as, "You can now configure Find Hub when setting up your phone, allowing the device to be located remotely."</p>
<p>Trackable devices like AirTags and earbuds work by broadcasting a Bluetooth LE identifier, which phones in the area can see. Our always-online smartphones then report the approximate location of that signal, and with enough reports, the owner can pinpoint the tag. Perhaps wary of the privacy implications, Google rolled out its Find Hub network (previously Find My Device) with harsh restrictions on where device finding would work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/googles-spotty-find-hub-network-could-get-better-thanks-to-a-small-setup-tweak/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Critics are increasingly branding Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a failure, including lawmakers fiercely debating how much funding to allot next year to the controversial agency.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats sparred over DOGE's future at a DOGE subcommittee hearing, <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/06/lawmakers-spar-over-doge-republicans-look-lock-cuts/406278/">according to NextGov</a>, a news site for federal IT workers. On one side, Republicans sought to "lock in" and codify the "DOGE process" for supposedly reducing waste and fraud in government, and on the other, Democrats argued that DOGE has "done the opposite" of its intended mission and harmed Americans in the process.</p>
<p>DOGE has "led to poor services, a brain drain on our federal government, and it’s going to cost taxpayers money long term," Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-Va.) argued.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/is-doge-doomed-to-fail-some-experts-are-ready-to-call-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For the past five years, we've been paying a lot of attention to Framework, the upstart PC company focused on modular, repairable, upgradeable, and customizable laptop designs.</p>
<p>So far, Framework has done a solid job of offering a steady stream of hardware upgrades for its systems, particularly the original Framework Laptop 13. But the company's track record on software support—including BIOS updates and driver updates with performance improvements, bug fixes, and important security updates—has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/frameworks-software-and-firmware-have-been-a-mess-but-its-working-on-them/">more of a mixed bag</a>.</p>
<p>As of our piece in April 2024, multiple iterations of the Laptop 13 board had gone years without a BIOS update or updated driver package. The first iteration of the laptop still only had "beta" support for Windows 11, which had been out for 2.5 years by then, and the company was also struggling to provide Linux support and <a href="https://frame.work/blog/framework-laptops-are-now-thunderbolt-4-certified">promised functional upgrades</a> for other models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/looking-at-frameworks-progress-on-software-support-for-its-repairable-laptops/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Company hired Google's book-scanning chief to cut up and digitize "all the books in the world."]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, court documents revealed that AI company Anthropic spent millions of dollars physically scanning print books to build <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/">Claude</a>, an AI assistant similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>. In the process, the company cut millions of print books from their bindings, scanned them into digital files, and threw away the originals solely for the purpose of training AI—details buried in a copyright ruling on fair use whose broader fair use implications we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/key-fair-use-ruling-clarifies-when-books-can-be-used-for-ai-training/">reported</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25982181/authors-v-anthropic-ruling.pdf">32-page legal decision</a> tells the story of how, in February 2024, the company hired Tom Turvey, the former head of partnerships for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books">Google Books</a> book-scanning project, and tasked him with obtaining "all the books in the world." The strategic hire appears to have been designed to replicate Google's legally successful book digitization approach—the same scanning operation that survived copyright challenges and <a href="https://www.authorsalliance.org/2023/02/24/fair-use-week-2023-looking-back-at-google-books-eight-years-later/">established</a> key fair use precedents.</p>
<p>While destructive scanning is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_scanning">common practice</a> among smaller-scale operations, Anthropic's approach was somewhat unusual due to its massive scale. For Anthropic, the faster speed and lower cost of the destructive process appear to have trumped any need for preserving the physical books themselves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu users could see up to a 20 percent boost in graphics performance on Intel-based systems under a change that will turn off security mitigations for blunting a class of attacks known as Spectre.</p>
<p>Spectre, you may recall, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/meltdown-and-spectre-every-modern-processor-has-unfixable-security-flaws/">came to public notice</a> in 2018. Spectre attacks are based on the observation that performance enhancements built into modern CPUs open a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side channel</a> that can leak secrets a CPU is processing. The performance enhancement, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution">speculative execution</a>, predicts future instructions a CPU might receive and then performs the corresponding tasks before they are even called. If the instructions never come, the CPU discards the work it performed. When the prediction is correct, the CPU has already completed the task.</p>
<p>By using code that forces a CPU to execute carefully selected instructions, Spectre attacks can extract confidential data that the CPU would have accessed had it carried out the ghost instructions. Over the past seven years, researchers have uncovered multiple attack variants based on the architectural flaws, which are unfixable. CPU manufacturers have responded by creating patches in both micro code and binary code that restrict speculative execution operations in certain scenarios. These restrictions, of course, usually degrade CPU performance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/ubuntu-disables-intel-gpu-security-mitigations-promises-20-performance-boost/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Nearly a decade ago, Ars testing found that Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steam-machines/">"Steam Machines"-era</a> version of SteamOS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-significant-performance-hit-for-steamos-gaming/">performed significantly worse than Windows</a> when SteamOS's Linux game ports were tested on the same hardware as their Windows counterparts. Today, though, Ars testing on the Lenovo Legion Go S finds recent games generally run at higher frame rates on SteamOS 3.7 than on Windows 11. The performance advantage is yet another way that Valve's upstart OS is differentiating itself from the "default" Windows installation used by most PC gamers for decades now.</p>
<p>While users have been able to install Windows on the Steam Deck since its 2022 launch, Valve <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8">doesn't offer official "Windows on Deck" support</a> for this alternative hardware use case. Lenovo's Legion Go S, on the other hand, is the first gaming portable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/">explicitly designed to work</a> with either Windows 11 (in hardware first released in January) or SteamOS (in hardware first released in May, alongside <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/">a new version of SteamOS</a> designed for non-Valve AMD hardware).</p>
<p>To test the performance impact of this operating system choice, we started with the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S (provided by Lenovo) and tested five high-end 3D games released in the last five years using built-in benchmarking tools and two different graphics/resolution tiers. We then <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/legion-series/legion-go-8apu1/solutions/ht103653-lenovo-digital-download-recovery-service-ddrs-download-the-files-needed-to-create-a-lenovo-usb-recovery-key">installed Windows 11 on the handheld</a>, downloaded <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/legion-series/legion-go-8apu1/downloads/driver-list">updated drivers from Lenovo's support site</a>, and re-ran the benchmarks on the same games downloaded through Steam for Windows.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, we encourage you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/BtNXI-xG1Po">join us for a live chat with Zeke Hausfather</a>, a climate scientist and researcher at Berkeley Earth. We'll talk a bit about how he got into climate science and ended up at Berkeley Earth and the role that organization plays in the world of climate science. It was launched by a physicist who was somewhat skeptical of the work being done by climate scientists, but it has evolved into one of the key groups that does the math needed to track the planet's temperatures.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, those temperatures have seen a remarkable rise to record highs, at one point setting a yearlong string where every month set a record for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/climate-wise-it-was-a-full-year-of-exceptional-months/">warmest instance of that month on record</a>. The rise leaves us at risk of exceeding key climate targets much earlier than expected and has left the climate science community scrambling to explain the intensity of the heat. So we plan to ask Zeke a bit about what scientists are thinking about the dramatic nature of these changes, attempts to explore the relationship between temperatures, and things like tipping points and individual weather events.</p>
<p>And all that leads to the key question: What does this tell us about where our climate is likely to go over the rest of this century?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ars-live-climate-science-in-an-increasingly-hot-world/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Marvel Studios has been ramping up its marketing efforts for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantastic_Four:_First_Steps"><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em></a> in recent weeks, culminating with the release of one last trailer before the film premieres next month. While prior efforts have focused on the (very cool) 1950s/Tomorrowland kitschy vibe of the film, this newest trailer emphasizes the family angle is chock-full of lots of good old-fashioned superhero action, as the quartet takes on a world-devouring cosmic being.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/marvels-first-family-faces-galactus-in-fantastic-four-first-steps-teaser/">previously reported</a>, Marvel Comics' "First Family" hasn't been seen on the big screen since 2015's disastrous reboot of the moderately successful films from the 2000s. Per the film's official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Set against the vibrant backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> introduces Marvel’s First Family—Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ben Grimm/The Thing as they face their most daunting challenge yet. Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer. And if Galactus’ plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren’t bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pedro Pascal plays Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic; Vanessa Kirby plays Sue Storm/Invisible Woman; Joseph Quinn plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch; Ebon Moss-Bachrach plays Ben Grimm/The Thing; and Matthew Wood voices their robot companion HERBIE. Ralph Ineson plays the gigantic cosmic being Galactus, and Julia Garner plays the Silver Surfer. The cast also includes Mark Gatiss as talk show host Ted Gilbert; Sarah Niles as Lynne; and Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, and Natasha Lyonne in as-yet-undisclosed roles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/its-a-family-affair-in-final-fantastic-four-first-steps-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission is approving a merger of big advertising agencies after extracting an agreement that the combined firm won't lead or participate in any advertising boycotts based on political or ideological viewpoints.</p>
<p>The merger condition is a new strategy in the Republican-controlled FTC's fight against alleged advertising boycotts, which could help Elon Musk's X social network and President Trump's own Truth Social platform. The FTC proposal <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trumps-ftc-targets-advertising-boycotts-in-potential-boost-for-elon-musks-x/">surfaced in a news report</a> earlier this month and was made official Monday in an <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/06/ftc-prevents-anticompetitive-coordination-global-advertising-merger">agency announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The FTC is approving Omnicom Group's $13.5 billion acquisition of Interpublic Group. Omnicom and Interpublic "are the third- and fourth-largest media buying advertising agencies in the US" and will be the world's biggest such agency when the merger is finalized, the FTC said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trumps-ftc-announces-merger-condition-that-prohibits-advertising-boycotts/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Mercedes-Benz provided flights from Detroit to Stuttgart and accommodation so Ars could be briefed on the GT XX, as well as some other things we can't publish just yet. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>AFFALTERBACH, Germany—A few years ago, we were treated to the Mercedes-Benz EQXX. It was, at the time, the pinnacle of Mercedes engineering <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/we-test-an-electric-mercedes-that-can-can-go-747-miles-on-a-single-charge/">built for the purpose of maximum electric range</a>. While an impressive piece of machinery that looked like it drove out of Le Mans, it wasn't designed to be a high-performance electric vehicle with an AMG badge. That's ok, though, because there <em>is</em> a high-performance AMG electric concept, called the GT XX, that introduces the world to the future of high-performance AMG electrics and debuts the AMG.EA architecture.</p>
<p>The 800 V AMG.EA isn't like an 800-volt you've experienced before. Mercedes claims that the car can charge at greater than 850 kW over a wide portion of the charging session. While the company didn't provide any graphs, based on the hardware onboard, there's little reason to doubt that claim.</p>
<p>To feed an EV that much power, the charging station would need to output at 1,000 A, and the company worked with its European partner Alpitronic to develop a prototype charging station. The current prototype uses a CCS connector, which is the standard in Europe.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/mercedes-shows-off-new-electric-amg-concept-that-can-charge-at-850-kw/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Some developers prefer to live in the command line interface (CLI), eschewing the flashy graphics and file management features of IDEs. Google's latest AI tool is for those terminal lovers. It's called Gemini CLI, and it shares a lot with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/googles-free-gemini-code-assist-arrives-with-sky-high-usage-limits/">Gemini Code Assist</a>, but it works in your terminal environment instead of integrating with an IDE. And perhaps best of all, it's free and open source.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli">Gemini CLI</a> plugs into Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google's most advanced model for coding and simulated reasoning. It can create and modify code for you right inside the terminal, but you can also call on other Google models to generate images or videos without leaving the security of your terminal cocoon. It's essentially vibe coding from the command line.</p>
<p>This tool is fully open source, so developers can inspect the code and help to improve it. The openness extends to how you configure the AI agent. It supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) and bundled extensions, allowing you to customize your terminal as you see fit. You can even include your own system prompts—Gemini CLI relies on GEMINI.md files, which you can use to tweak the model for different tasks or teams.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-is-bringing-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-gemini-cli/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent years, a curious hypothetical particle called the axion, invented to address challenging problems with the strong nuclear force, has emerged as a leading candidate to explain dark matter. Although the potential for axions to explain dark matter has been around for decades, cosmologists have only recently begun to seriously search for them. Not only might they be able to resolve some issues with older hypotheses about dark matter, but they also offer a dizzying array of promising avenues for finding them.</p>
<p>But before digging into what the axion could be and why it’s so useful, we have to explore why the vast majority of physicists, astronomers, and cosmologists accept the evidence that dark matter exists and that it’s some new kind of particle. While it’s easy to dismiss the dark matter hypothesis as some sort of modern-day epicycle, the reality is much more complex (to be fair to epicycles, it was an excellent idea that fit the data extremely well for many centuries).</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/has-shipwreck-of-hms-endeavour-finally-been-found-us-aussie-teams-at-odds/">we reported</a> on the Australian National Maritime Museum's (ANMM) <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wreck-ship-sailed-british-explorer-james-cook-found-rhode-island-rcna14687">announcement</a> that its researchers had confirmed that a shipwreck proposed as a likely candidate in 2018 is indeed the remains of the HMS <em>Endeavour</em>. However, the <a href="https://www.rimap.org/endeavour">Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project</a> (RIMAP)—the museum's research partner in the project—promptly <a href="https://www.rimap.org/endeavour-statement-feb-2-2022">released a statement</a> calling the announcement premature. RIMAP insisted that more evidence was needed.</p>
<p>The final report is now available, and both RIMAP and ANMM say they have confirmed that the wreck is indeed the <em>Endeavour</em>. (You can read the full report <a href="https://cms-web.seamuseum.net/sites/default/files/2025-05/australian-national-maritime-museum-locating-hmb-endeavour-final-report-2025_0.pdf">here</a>.) “The timbers are British timbers. The size of all the timber scantlings are almost identical to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/endeavour"><em>Endeavour</em></a>, and I’m talking within millimeters—not inches, but millimeters," Kieran Hosty, an ANMM archaeologist who co-wrote the report, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/captain-cook-missing-ship-found-hms-endeavour-b2771322.html">told The Independent</a>. “The stem scarf is identical, absolutely identical. This stem scarf is also a very unique feature—we’ve gone through a whole bunch of 18th-century ships' plans, and we can’t find anything else like it.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/has-shipwreck-of-hms-endeavour-finally-been-found-us-aussie-teams-at-odds/">previously reported</a>, <em>Endeavour</em> Captain James Cook's first voyage (1768–1771) was, in part, a mission to observe and record the 1769 <a title="Transit of Venus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus">transit of Venus</a> across the Sun. The observation was part of a combined global effort to determine the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Those observations proved less conclusive than had been hoped, but during the rest of the voyage, Cook was able to map the coastland of New Zealand before sailing west to the southeastern coast of Australia—the first record of Europeans on the continent's Eastern coastline.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/discovery-of-hms-endeavor-wreck-confirmed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Philips is upping the prices of its popular and already-expensive Hue series of smart lighting products starting July 1. The company is blaming tariffs for the changes and has suggested that prices could go up even higher after the initial bump in July.</p>
<p>Philips started informing its customers via an <a href="https://m.news.philips-hue.com/rest/head/mirrorPage/@Md9FTvAtVg4CA6vCkffTyQDWFUrxsgjB-na8EyccRdCKEs81mM2K6SKa7212pWO-y3LucuTpA1YTCrwZLodS_ibQDvwvOtgBo_3gwlFcxLbIHgpn.html?origin=3_us_en_hue-phue-us-email-d2c-flashsale25off2-2506_acs-b2c_hue_us-en-pr-cn-all-flashsale25off2-email1_conversion_uc_ut">email marketing message</a> earlier this month that prices would go up and urged people to buy Hue lighting sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>The first-of-its-kind ruling that condones AI training as fair use will likely be viewed as a big win for AI companies, but it also notably put on notice all the AI companies that expect the same reasoning will apply to training on pirated copies of books—a question that remains unsettled.</p>
<p>In the specific case that Alsup is weighing—which pits book authors against Anthropic—Alsup found that "the purpose and character of using copyrighted works to train LLMs to generate new text was quintessentially transformative" and "necessary" to build world-class AI models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/key-fair-use-ruling-clarifies-when-books-can-be-used-for-ai-training/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last fall, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/home-users-can-only-buy-one-year-of-extra-windows-10-updates-for-30-per-pc/">announced</a> that individuals who wanted to keep using Windows 10 past <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/lots-of-pcs-are-poised-to-fall-off-the-windows-10-update-cliff-one-year-from-today/">its official end-of-support date</a> could do so by opting into the company's Extended Security Update (ESU) program at a cost of $30 per PC. That payment would get users a single year of additional security updates. Today, less than four months before that October 14, 2025, cutoff, Microsoft is announcing additional options for people who can't or don't want to pay that fee.</p>
<p>Individuals who want to pay $30 for the additional year of updates will still be able to do so. But Microsoft will also extend a year of additional Windows 10 security updates to any users who opt into <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/back-up-and-restore-with-windows-backup-87a81f8a-78fa-456e-b521-ac0560e32338#id0ebh=windows_10">Windows Backup</a>, a relatively recent Windows 10 and Windows 11 app that backs up some settings and files using a Microsoft account. Users can also opt into ESU updates by spending <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/rewards/about">1,000 Microsoft Rewards points</a>, which are handed out for everything from making purchases with your Microsoft account to doing Bing searches.</p>
<p>These offers don't formally extend the end-of-support date for Windows 10. But for users who don't want to move to Windows 11 or who can't do so because their PC doesn't meet the requirements, they do effectively offer an additional year of free updates for the OS that's still installed on a slim majority of the world’s Windows PCs, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/">according to Statcounter data</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-extends-free-windows-10-security-updates-into-2026-with-strings-attached/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Media Matters for America sued the Federal Trade Commission yesterday, alleging that the FTC's ongoing investigation into the group "has violated Media Matters' First Amendment rights by retaliating against the organization for its reporting on Elon Musk and X."</p>
<p>"The investigation is the latest effort by Elon Musk and his allies in the Trump administration to retaliate against Media Matters for its reporting on X, the social media site Musk controls, and it's another example of the Trump administration weaponizing government authorities to target political opponents," Media Matters said in a <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/justice-civil-liberties/media-matters-files-suit-federal-court-block-retaliatory-ftc-investigation">press release</a>.
