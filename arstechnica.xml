                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent years, a curious hypothetical particle called the axion, invented to address challenging problems with the strong nuclear force, has emerged as a leading candidate to explain dark matter. Although the potential for axions to explain dark matter has been around for decades, cosmologists have only recently begun to seriously search for them. Not only might they be able to resolve some issues with older hypotheses about dark matter, but they also offer a dizzying array of promising avenues for finding them.</p>
<p>But before digging into what the axion could be and why it’s so useful, we have to explore why the vast majority of physicists, astronomers, and cosmologists accept the evidence that dark matter exists and that it’s some new kind of particle. While it’s easy to dismiss the dark matter hypothesis as some sort of modern-day epicycle, the reality is much more complex (to be fair to epicycles, it was an excellent idea that fit the data extremely well for many centuries).</p>
<p>The short version is that nothing in the Universe adds up.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/the-axion-may-help-clean-up-the-messy-business-of-dark-matter/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/has-shipwreck-of-hms-endeavour-finally-been-found-us-aussie-teams-at-odds/">we reported</a> on the Australian National Maritime Museum's (ANMM) <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wreck-ship-sailed-british-explorer-james-cook-found-rhode-island-rcna14687">announcement</a> that its researchers had confirmed that a shipwreck proposed as a likely candidate in 2018 is indeed the remains of the HMS <em>Endeavour</em>. However, the <a href="https://www.rimap.org/endeavour">Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project</a> (RIMAP)—the museum's research partner in the project—promptly <a href="https://www.rimap.org/endeavour-statement-feb-2-2022">released a statement</a> calling the announcement premature. RIMAP insisted that more evidence was needed.</p>
<p>The final report is now available, and both RIMAP and ANMM say they have confirmed that the wreck is indeed the <em>Endeavour</em>. (You can read the full report <a href="https://cms-web.seamuseum.net/sites/default/files/2025-05/australian-national-maritime-museum-locating-hmb-endeavour-final-report-2025_0.pdf">here</a>.) “The timbers are British timbers. The size of all the timber scantlings are almost identical to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/endeavour"><em>Endeavour</em></a>, and I’m talking within millimeters—not inches, but millimeters," Kieran Hosty, an ANMM archaeologist who co-wrote the report, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/captain-cook-missing-ship-found-hms-endeavour-b2771322.html">told The Independent</a>. “The stem scarf is identical, absolutely identical. This stem scarf is also a very unique feature—we’ve gone through a whole bunch of 18th-century ships' plans, and we can’t find anything else like it.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/has-shipwreck-of-hms-endeavour-finally-been-found-us-aussie-teams-at-odds/">previously reported</a>, <em>Endeavour</em> Captain James Cook's first voyage (1768–1771) was, in part, a mission to observe and record the 1769 <a title="Transit of Venus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus">transit of Venus</a> across the Sun. The observation was part of a combined global effort to determine the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Those observations proved less conclusive than had been hoped, but during the rest of the voyage, Cook was able to map the coastland of New Zealand before sailing west to the southeastern coast of Australia—the first record of Europeans on the continent's Eastern coastline.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/discovery-of-hms-endeavor-wreck-confirmed/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Philips started informing its customers via an <a href="https://m.news.philips-hue.com/rest/head/mirrorPage/@Md9FTvAtVg4CA6vCkffTyQDWFUrxsgjB-na8EyccRdCKEs81mM2K6SKa7212pWO-y3LucuTpA1YTCrwZLodS_ibQDvwvOtgBo_3gwlFcxLbIHgpn.html?origin=3_us_en_hue-phue-us-email-d2c-flashsale25off2-2506_acs-b2c_hue_us-en-pr-cn-all-flashsale25off2-email1_conversion_uc_ut">email marketing message</a> earlier this month that prices would go up and urged people to buy Hue lighting sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>The first-of-its-kind ruling that condones AI training as fair use will likely be viewed as a big win for AI companies, but it also notably put on notice all the AI companies that expect the same reasoning will apply to training on pirated copies of books—a question that remains unsettled.</p>
<p>In the specific case that Alsup is weighing—which pits book authors against Anthropic—Alsup found that "the purpose and character of using copyrighted works to train LLMs to generate new text was quintessentially transformative" and "necessary" to build world-class AI models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/key-fair-use-ruling-clarifies-when-books-can-be-used-for-ai-training/">Read full article</a></p>

Today, less than four months before that October 14, 2025, cutoff, Microsoft is announcing additional options for people who can't or don't want to pay that fee.</p>
<p>Individuals who want to pay $30 for the additional year of updates will still be able to do so. But Microsoft will also extend a year of additional Windows 10 security updates to any users who opt into <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/back-up-and-restore-with-windows-backup-87a81f8a-78fa-456e-b521-ac0560e32338#id0ebh=windows_10">Windows Backup</a>, a relatively recent Windows 10 and Windows 11 app that backs up some settings and files using a Microsoft account. Users can also opt into ESU updates by spending <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/rewards/about">1,000 Microsoft Rewards points</a>, which are handed out for everything from making purchases with your Microsoft account to doing Bing searches.</p>
<p>These offers don't formally extend the end-of-support date for Windows 10. But for users who don't want to move to Windows 11 or who can't do so because their PC doesn't meet the requirements, they do effectively offer an additional year of free updates for the OS that's still installed on a slim majority of the world’s Windows PCs, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/">according to Statcounter data</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-extends-free-windows-10-security-updates-into-2026-with-strings-attached/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Media Matters for America sued the Federal Trade Commission yesterday, alleging that the FTC's ongoing investigation into the group "has violated Media Matters' First Amendment rights by retaliating against the organization for its reporting on Elon Musk and X."</p>
<p>"The investigation is the latest effort by Elon Musk and his allies in the Trump administration to retaliate against Media Matters for its reporting on X, the social media site Musk controls, and it's another example of the Trump administration weaponizing government authorities to target political opponents," Media Matters said in a <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/justice-civil-liberties/media-matters-files-suit-federal-court-block-retaliatory-ftc-investigation">press release</a>. The group said it has suffered financially because of "the cascade of litigation launched by Musk and his allies."</p>
<p>The FTC's investigative demand "makes no secret of its connection to Musk's vindictive lawsuits," and "probes Media Matters' finances, editorial process, newsgathering activities, and affiliations with likeminded entities that monitor extremist content and other third parties," Media Matters said in the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.281859/gov.uscourts.dcd.281859.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed in US District Court for the District of Columbia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/media-matters-sues-ftc-says-agency-is-retaliating-on-behalf-of-elon-musk/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Fraudulent or misleading storage devices are, unfortunately, still easy to find <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/blatant-tech-frauds-run-amok-on-the-biggest-online-marketplaces/">via online marketplaces</a>. It's also a common story that someone buys a shockingly cheap storage device from an unknown brand and ends up with a product that doesn’t perform as expected—or at all.</p>
<p>With this in mind, data-recovery firm <a href="https://www.securedatarecovery.com/">Secure Data Recovery</a> recently bought a 500GB HDD from Amazon (the <a href="http://www.unionsine.com/en/product/DataStorage.html?id=241">UnionSine HD2510</a>) for $28 and tested it. The results were better than expected, but there are still reasons to avoid buying something like that.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Kirill Rymko, director of lab operations at Secure Data Recovery, told Ars Technica that his company decided to buy and test UnionSine’s 500GB external HDD due to its low price-per-GB. As of this writing, the 2.5-inch drive costs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UnionSine-Portable-External-Storage-Compatible/dp/B091FS79T8">$28.28 on Amazon</a>, or about $0.06 per GB.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/28-external-hdd-on-amazon-actually-does-what-it-claims-still-not-a-good-buy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Employers are drowning in AI-generated job applications, with LinkedIn now processing 11,000 submissions per minute—a 45 percent surge from last year, according to new data <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/21/business/dealbook/ai-job-applications.html">reported</a> by The New York Times.</p>
<p>Due to AI, the traditional hiring process has become overwhelmed with automated noise. It's the résumé equivalent of AI slop—call it "hiring slop," perhaps—that currently haunts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/reddit-mods-are-fighting-to-keep-ai-slop-off-subreddits-they-could-use-help/">social media</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/open-source-project-curl-is-sick-of-users-submitting-ai-slop-vulnerabilities/">the web</a> with sensational pictures and misleading information. The flood of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>-crafted résumés and bot-submitted applications has created an arms race between job seekers and employers, with both sides deploying increasingly sophisticated AI tools in a bot-versus-bot standoff that is quickly spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>The Times illustrates the scale of the problem with the story of an HR consultant named Katie Tanner, who was so inundated with over 1,200 applications for a single remote role that she had to remove the post entirely and was still sorting through the applications three months later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/the-resume-is-dying-and-ai-is-holding-the-smoking-gun/">Read full article</a></p>

Kennedy Jr. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/all-17-fired-vaccine-advisors-unite-to-blast-rfk-jr-s-destabilizing-decisions/">fired all 17 experts</a> who sat on a revered federal vaccine panel and restocked it with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/yep-rfk-jr-appoints-anti-vaccine-advocates-to-cdc-vaccine-panel/">eight dubious members</a>, a growing chorus of lawmakers, health experts, and public advocates are calling for a pivotal meeting scheduled for Wednesday to be scrapped and for the panel to be "dissolved" and remade with qualified members.</p>
<p>On June 9, Kennedy unilaterally cleaned out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP). Though vetting for the committee has historically taken up to two years, Kenney announced the eight new members two days later. Some of the members are clear anti-vaccine activists, others have espoused contrarian or anti-public health perspectives, and some also have little to no relevant expertise for being on ACIP.</p>
<p>"[T]he reconstituted ACIP is a farce," Robert Steinbrook, a director at consumer rights watchdog Public Citizen, said in a statement. "Rather than further sullying the ACIP and undermining public confidence in vaccines, this week’s meeting should be rescheduled after the Senate has confirmed a new CDC Director who can both appoint an authoritative and representative committee and be able to approve the panel’s recommendations."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/cdcs-once-revered-vaccine-panel-now-a-farce-calls-grow-to-scrap-meeting/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We sometimes call chatbots like Gemini and ChatGPT "robots," but generative AI is also playing a growing role in real, physical robots. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/googles-origami-folding-ai-brain-may-power-new-wave-of-humanoid-robots/">announcing Gemini Robotics</a> earlier this year, Google DeepMind has now revealed a new on-device VLA (vision language action) model to control robots. Unlike the previous release, there's <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-robotics-on-device-brings-ai-to-local-robotic-devices/">no cloud component</a>, allowing robots to operate with full autonomy.</p>
<p>Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind, says this approach to AI robotics could make robots more reliable in challenging situations. This is also the first version of Google's robotics model that developers can tune for their specific uses.</p>
<p>Robotics is a unique problem for AI because, not only does the robot exist in the physical world, but it also changes its environment. Whether you're having it move blocks around or tie your shoes, it's hard to predict every eventuality a robot might encounter. The traditional approach of training a robot on action with reinforcement was very slow, but generative AI allows for much greater generalization.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/06/google-releases-first-cloud-free-ai-robotics-model/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The UK’s competition regulator is proposing to loosen Google’s control of its search engine in the first application of Britain’s tough new digital market rules.</p>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority said on Tuesday that Google could be required to implement new “fair ranking” measures in its search results and give publishers more control over how it uses their content, including in output generated by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The CMA said it was minded to hand Google “strategic market status”—a label introduced under new digital market laws this year—in light of its dominant position in search and search advertising, which would require the tech giant to abide by a number of such conduct rules. A final decision will be made by October following a public consultation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/uk-looking-to-loosen-googles-control-of-its-search-engine/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After 20 years, being able to look at any corner of the planet in Google Earth doesn't seem that impressive, but it was a revolution in 2005. Google Earth has gone through a lot of changes in that time, and Google has some more lined up for the service's <a href="https://blog.google/products/earth/google-earth-20-years-timeline/">20th anniversary</a>. Soon, Google Earth will help you travel back in time with historic Street View integration, and pro users will get some new "AI-driven insights"—of course Google can't update a product without adding at least a <em>little</em> AI.</p>
<p>Google Earth began its life as a clunky desktop client, but that didn't stop it from being downloaded 100 million times in the first week. Today, Google Earth is available on the web, in mobile apps, and in the Google Earth Pro desktop app. However you access Earth, you'll find a blast from the past.</p>
<p>For the service's 20th anniversary, Google was inspired by a social media trend from last year in which people shared <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/google-brings-street-view-history-to-phones-introduces-street-view-studio/">historical images</a> of locations in Google Maps. Now, Google Earth is getting a "time travel" interface where you can see historical Street View images from almost any location.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/google-rolls-out-street-view-time-travel-to-celebrate-20-years-of-google-earth/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's primary mirror is 8.4 meters in diameter, which makes it one of the largest optical telescopes in the world.

<p>The festival was hosted by Runway, a company that produces models and tools for generating images and videos. In panels and press briefings, a curated list of industry professionals made the case for Hollywood to embrace AI tools. In private meetings with industry professionals, I gained a strong sense that there is already a widening philosophical divide within the film and television business.</p>
<p>I also interviewed Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela about the tightrope he walks as he pitches his products to an industry that has deeply divided feelings about what role AI will have in its future.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/curated-realities-an-ai-film-festival-and-the-future-of-human-expression/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For many species, producing an embryo is a bit of a contest between males and females. Males want as many offspring as possible and want the females to devote as many resources as possible to each of them. Females do better by keeping their options open and distributing resources in a way to maximize the number of offspring they can produce over the course of their lives.</p>
<p>In mammals, this plays out through the chemical modification of DNA, a process called imprinting. Males imprint their DNA by adding methyl modifications to it in a way that alters the activity of genes in order to promote the growth of embryos. Females do similar things chemically but focus on shutting down genes that promote embryonic growth. In a handful of key regions of the genome, having only the modifications specific to one sex is lethal, as the embryo can't grow to match its stage of development.</p>
<p>One consequence of this is that you normally can't produce embryos using only the DNA from eggs or from sperm. But over the last few years, researchers have gradually worked around the need for imprinted sites to have one copy from each parent. Now, in a very sophisticated demonstration, researchers have used targeted editing of methylation to produce mice from the DNA of two sperm.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/researchers-get-viable-mice-by-editing-dna-from-two-sperm/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It has been just over 130 days since <em>Civilization VII</em> launched to mostly positive reviews—but quite a bit of disappointment for series traditionalists. At first, developer Firaxis was releasing primarily bug, balance, and UI fixes, but today saw the release of version 1.2.2—possibly the biggest yet in terms of adding features to the game.</p>
<p>Available for all platforms except Switch and Switch 2—which will get it later—the update adds several tweaks that allow the game's players to customize games in a more granular way, with a particular emphasis on the ability to disable controversial new additions that a subset of players felt took things too far from the traditional Civ experience.</p>
<p>Many of the new options are available in the advanced settings menu during game setup, though one of the major additions is in the standard setup screen: large and huge map sizes. (Both of these new sizes have a default civilization/player count of 10.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/civilization-vii-patch-lets-you-turn-off-some-controversial-new-features/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Republican proposal to penalize states that regulate artificial intelligence can move forward without requiring approval from 60 senators, the Senate parliamentarian decided on Saturday. But the moratorium on state AI laws did not have unanimous Republican support and has reportedly been watered down in an effort to push it toward passage.</p>
<p>In early June, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/ted-cruz-bill-states-that-regulate-ai-will-be-cut-out-of-42b-broadband-fund/">proposed</a> enforcing a 10-year moratorium on AI regulation by making states ineligible for broadband funding if they try to impose any limits on development of artificial intelligence. While the House previously <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text">approved</a> a version of the so-called "One Big Beautiful Bill" with an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">outright 10-year ban on state AI regulation</a>, Cruz took a different approach because of the Senate rule that limits inclusion of "extraneous matter" in budget reconciliation legislation.</p>
<p>Under the Senate's <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RL30862">Byrd rule</a>, a senator can object to a potentially extraneous budget provision. A motion to waive the Byrd rule requires a vote of 60 percent of the Senate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/ted-cruz-cant-get-all-republicans-to-back-his-fight-against-state-ai-laws/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As with any operating system that ushers in a major new look and feel, this year's Apple operating systems and their new Liquid Glass aesthetic will likely merit some extra attention from power users who want to see all the new stuff and developers who suddenly need to acclimate to a new design language. Apple put out one early beta build of all of its new operating systems after its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote a couple of weeks ago—these updates are the first to standardize on year-based version numbering, making them all version 26—and today the company has formally released the second developer betas of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">iOS 26</a>, iPadOS 26, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-26-release-notes">macOS 26</a>, and most of its other updates.</p>
<p>For those who don't normally dabble in Apple's beta programs, the company offers two tracks: a developer beta and a public beta. The developer beta builds are offered earlier but tend to be buggier and less stable, and they change more from release to release. The public betas, which typically hit in mid- to late-July, are usually roughly the same code as the third or fourth developer beta and represent a nearer-to-final, more stable experience. Once the public betas begin, both developer and public beta builds are usually updated more or less in lockstep, though the developer betas are still usually available slightly earlier.</p>
<p>Apple used to gate its developer betas behind a $99-per-year developer program paywall. While app developers who want to distribute apps on Apple's App Stores still need to pay that fee, two years ago Apple began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/how-to-install-ios-17-and-macos-14-developer-betas-now-that-anyone-can-do-it/">making developer betas available</a> to anyone who signed up for a free <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">developer account</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apple-releases-new-beta-builds-of-all-its-flashy-new-liquid-glass-ified-os-updates/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“The Cyber Centre is aware of malicious cyber activities currently targeting Canadian telecommunications companies,” officials for the center, the Canadian government’s primary cybersecurity agency, said in a <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-threat-bulletin-prc-cyber-actors-target-telecommunications-companies-global-cyberespionage-campaign">statement</a>. “The responsible actors are almost certainly PRC state-sponsored actors, specifically Salt Typhoon.” The FBI issued its own nearly <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2025/250620.pdf">identical statement</a>.</p>
<h2>A major security lapse</h2>
<p>Salt Typhoon is the name researchers and government officials use to track one of several discreet groups known to hack nations all over the world on behalf of the People's Republic of China. In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/actively-exploited-cisco-0-day-with-maximum-10-severity-gives-full-network-control/">October 2023</a>, researchers disclosed that hackers had backdoored more than 10,000 Cisco devices by exploiting CVE-2023-20198, a vulnerability with a maximum severity rating of 10.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/suspected-china-state-hackers-exploited-patched-flaw-to-breach-canadian-telecom/">Read full article</a></p>
