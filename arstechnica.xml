                            <![CDATA[<p>AI tools are widely used by software developers, but those devs and their managers are still grappling with figuring out how exactly to best put the tools to use, with growing pains emerging along the way.</p>
<p>That's the takeaway from <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/07/29/developers-remain-willing-but-reluctant-to-use-ai-the-2025-developer-survey-results-are-here/?cb=1">the latest survey</a> of 49,000 professional developers by community and information hub StackOverflow, which itself has been heavily impacted by the addition of large language models (LLMs) to developer workflows.</p>
<p>The survey found that four in five developers use AI tools in their workflow in 2025—a portion that has been rapidly growing in recent years. That said, "trust in the accuracy of AI has fallen from 40 percent in previous years to just 29 percent this year."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/developer-survey-shows-trust-in-ai-coding-tools-is-falling-as-usage-rises/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old man in China may be anxiously reassessing his chances of eternal damnation after the cross he had tattooed on his neck inexplicably vanished after five months and was replaced by an aggressive necrotic ulcer and grave inflammation. The case is so strange that doctors say it "expands the spectrum of tattoo-associated pathology."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2837005#250471493">an uncanny case report</a> published Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology–Head &amp; Neck Surgery, the man's doctors noted the multiple ways in which his lesion was striking. First, they could find no trace of an infection. The pigment used for the tattoo, which was red, had disappeared from his skin, leaving just scarring behind in places not yet covered by the ulcer. This isn't entirely unusual; in normal cases of people having a bad reaction to a tattoo, pigment has been known to migrate into lesions or lymph nodes. But in this case, there was no sign of the red ink, even with deeper digging.</p>
<p>When people's bodies reject tattoos, the abnormal immune reactions usually stay in the upper layers of tissue, and they almost never cause tissue death. But the man's lesion went deep and was clearly an invasive, crusty, bleeding necrotic ulcer. Moreover, doctors could also see that his neck was swollen on either side of the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that large masses had formed on both sides of the ulcer and below it. The masses were all in the ballpark of 4 cm by 3 cm, and they were eclipsing his jugular veins. Subsequent scans with enhanced computed tomography showed the internal jugular veins on both sides of his neck had formed clots.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/mark-of-the-damned-necrotic-ulcer-replaces-mans-cross-tattoo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Russian-state hackers are targeting foreign embassies in Moscow with custom malware that gets installed using adversary-in-the-middle attacks that operate at the ISP level, Microsoft warned Thursday.</p>
<p>The campaign has been ongoing since last year. It leverages ISPs in that country, which are obligated to work on behalf of the Russian government. With the ability to control the ISP network, the threat group—which Microsoft tracks under the name Secret Blizzard—positions itself between a targeted embassy and the end points they connect to, a form of attack known as an <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/">adversary in the middle</a>, or AitM. The position allows Secret Blizzard to send targets to malicious websites that appear to be known and trusted.</p>
<h2>Objective: Install ApolloShadow</h2>
<p>“While we previously assessed with low confidence that the actor conducts cyberespionage activities within Russian borders against foreign and domestic entities, this is the first time we can confirm that they have the capability to do so at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level,” members of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/31/frozen-in-transit-secret-blizzards-aitm-campaign-against-diplomats/">wrote</a>. “This means that diplomatic personnel using local ISP or telecommunications services in Russia are highly likely targets of Secret Blizzard’s AiTM position within those services.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/microsoft-catches-russian-hackers-targeting-foreign-embassies/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has lost its appeal in the long-running app store antitrust case, which marks another major victory for Epic Games. Google lost the original case in 2023 when a jury found it abused its market position in smartphones to block competition from Epic and others. Google was able to get the penalties suspended while it pursued its appeal, but now it may need to make plans for a more open future on Android.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of the mobile app era, it was customary for both Apple and Google to take a sizable cut of developer revenue, but no one had the resources to challenge the status quo until Fortnite took off. The success of Epic's battle royale title gave it an opening to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/epic-gives-fortnite-players-discounts-for-skirting-apple-google-fees/">go after both Apple and Google in 2020</a>. The developer added external payment options to the free-to-play game, causing it to be pulled from both stores. The lawsuit followed soon after.</p>
<p>Epic was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/apples-ios-walled-garden-doesnt-break-antitrust-laws-appeals-court-affirms/">unable to secure a victory against Apple</a>, which has an undeniably more restrictive app store than Google. However, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/why-todays-epic-v-google-trial-is-and-isnt-a-repeat-of-epic-v-apple/">2023 trial</a> overseen by US District Judge James Donato revealed a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/google-allegedly-considered-buying-epic-games-to-silence-antitrust-complaints/">pattern of scheming</a> on Google's part to prevent the distribution of alternative app stores on Android phones. While Android devices do allow sideloading of apps, and the platform is open source, Google's scale and partnerships with OEMs made it a de facto monopoly. This led the court to impose extensive remedies that could remake the mobile app ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Formula E provided flights from Washington to London and accommodation so Ars could attend the London ePrix. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>LONDON, ENGLAND—Formula E’s 11th season came to a close in its now-traditional London home this past weekend. In its first two seasons, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/06/the-first-all-electric-formula-e-season-dramatically-concludes-in-london/">it tried to make a go of racing in Battersea Park</a>, a race that local residents rejected as too disruptive. After a five-year gap, the sport found a more receptive home at Excel London in the city’s Docklands, racing around and then through the cavernous exhibition center—something that’s only really possible with electric racing cars (or very fume-tolerant authorities).</p>
<p>As a location for an ePrix, Excel London is nigh-perfect. It’s fed by a pair of light rail stations just minutes from the center of town and comes preinstalled with concessions and restrooms and much of the other infrastructure that normally has to be brought in for a temporary circuit, with hotels literally walking distance. But like with most Formula E races, the few thousand fans in attendance, while not exactly an afterthought, aren’t really why the series shows up—this is a sport for an audience watching behind a screen.</p>
<p>It’s going to be the speed of the cars, rather than the size of the crowds, that causes Formula E to outgrow the 20-turn, 1.3-mile (2.09 km) circuit. Next year will be the final visit, before a possible Silverstone ePrix in 2027, once Gen 4 gets going.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/formula-e-wraps-up-season-11-where-does-the-all-ev-series-go-next/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Only a week has passed since two Oklahoma Board of Education members <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/oklahomas-new-scandal-nude-women-streamed-to-tv-during-state-board-meeting/">complained about seeing nude women appear on a TV set</a> during an official board meeting. And yet we've already reached the "just asking questions" stage of the scandal lifecycle, with the state's hard-right education boss wondering aloud if Oklahoma's governor might not be behind the whole thing.</p>
<p>On the surface, this appears an odd reaction. One might have expected Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters to agree with his outraged board members. You know, a sort of "Together we will unmask the degenerates who are making a mockery of our meetings with their streaming retro pornography!"</p>
<p>But no. Walters first put out a press release, titled "Response to the Most Absurd, False, and Gutter Political Attack from a Desperate, Failing Establishment," in which he said that "any suggestion that a device of mine was used to stream inappropriate content on the television set is categorically false."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/blame-the-governor-oklahomas-board-meeting-porn-scandal-goes-gonzo/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The FTC hoped to enforce the rule due to "increasing reports of consumers losing time and money from intentionally difficult subscription cancellation processes," lawmakers said. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/cable-companies-ask-5th-circuit-to-block-ftcs-click-to-cancel-rule/">cable companies sued</a> to block the FTC rule last year, arguing that the FTC failed to conduct an economic impact study before making it easier to cancel over a billion paid subscriptions in the US.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/us-court-cancels-ftc-rule-that-would-have-made-canceling-subscriptions-easier/">federal appeals court nullified the rule</a>, agreeing with an administrative law judge that the FTC skipped a regulatory analysis required to pass the rule since compliance costs would exceed $100 million. That study would have included cost-benefit analyses of alternatives to the rule, in addition to gauging the rule's effectiveness in comparison to those alternatives.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/click-to-cancel-rule-cable-companies-fought-to-nullify-could-be-revived/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>E-commerce giants everywhere felt the sting Wednesday when President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-is-protecting-the-united-states-national-security-and-economy-by-suspending-the-de-minimis-exemption-for-commercial-shipments-globally/">announced</a> that the US will be "suspending duty-free de minimis treatment for low-value shipments" worth $800 or less from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Americans will likely soon feel the crunch, with one recent <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32607">study</a> estimating that the cost of eliminating the trade loophole overall to US consumers could fall between $10.9 billion and $13 billion while "disproportionately" hurting "lower-income and minority consumers" who buy a higher percentage of cheap imports.</p>
<p>Price hikes will likely come this fall, as the trade loophole will be closed starting on August 29, with Amazon emerging as perhaps the biggest question mark for US consumers wondering how hard their wallets may be hit by the major trade policy change ahead of the holiday shopping season.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/trump-suspends-trade-loophole-for-cheap-online-retailers-globally/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>If you last updated your gaming PC in late 2016, Nvidia has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/mafia-the-old-country-geforce-game-ready-driver/">two pieces of bad news</a> to share with you today. First, it will no longer support the Maxwell, Pascal, or Volta GPU architectures with new Game Ready graphics driver updates after October 2025. That means GeForce GPUs from the GTX 900 and 10-series, including aging but enduringly popular cards like the GeForce GTX 1060, will no longer get optimized driver releases for new games starting this fall.</p>
<p>Second, Nvidia says it will wind down all driver support for Windows 10 in October of 2026. This is one year past Microsoft's officially announced end-of-support date for Windows 10, but it will cover users who choose to take advantage of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-extends-free-windows-10-security-updates-into-2026-with-strings-attached/">the year of free extended security updates</a> (ESUs) that Microsoft is offering to home users (we have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/how-to-get-another-free-year-of-updates-for-your-windows-10-pc/">a guide on how to get those updates</a> if you want them). After that, people who want to continue getting graphics drivers for their Nvidia GPUs, including newer models in the RTX 40- and 50-series, will need to upgrade to Windows 11.</p>
<p>The Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs won't be totally abandoned after 2025; Nvidia says it will release quarterly security updates for these cards through October 2028. These updates won't optimize performance or fix bugs in any new games, but if you still have an older or hand-me-down PC using one of these cards to play <em>Minecraft </em>or <em>Roblox</em>, you won't be leaving yourself open to GPU-related security exploits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/nvidia-announces-end-of-gpu-driver-updates-for-geforce-10-series-windows-10/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Beijing has summoned Nvidia over alleged security issues with its chips, in a blow to the US company’s push to revive sales in the country after Washington granted approval for the export of a made-for-China chip.</p>
<p>China’s cyber regulator on Thursday said it had held a meeting with Nvidia over what it called “serious security issues” with the company’s artificial intelligence chips. It said US AI experts had “revealed that Nvidia’s computing chips have location tracking and can remotely shut down the technology.”</p>
<p>The Cyberspace Administration of China requested that Nvidia explain the security problems associated with the H20 chip, which was designed for the Chinese market to comply with US export restrictions, and submit documentation to support their case. The announcement comes as Nvidia is rebuilding its China business after Washington this month lifted a ban on H20 sales to the country.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/china-claims-nvidia-built-backdoor-into-h20-chip-designed-for-chinese-market/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The first foldable phones hit the market six years ago, and they were rife with compromises and shortcomings. Many of those problems have persisted, but little by little, foldables have gotten better. With the release of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has made the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/samsungs-7th-gen-foldables-slim-down-may-finally-fit-in-your-pocket/">biggest leap yet</a>. This device solves some of the most glaring problems with Samsung's foldables, featuring a new, slimmer design and a big camera upgrade.</p>
<p>Samsung's seventh-generation foldable has finally crossed that hazy boundary between novelty and practicality, putting a tablet-sized screen in your pocket without as many compromises. There are still some drawbacks, of course, but for the first time, this feels like a foldable phone you'd want to carry around.</p>
<p>Whether or not you can justify the $1,999 price tag is another matter entirely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-the-foldable-we-deserve-but-not-the-one-we-can-afford/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hackers planted a Raspberry Pi equipped with a 4G modem in the network of an unnamed bank in an attempt to siphon money out of the financial institution's ATM system, researchers reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The researchers with security firm Group-IB said the “unprecedented tactic allowed the attackers to bypass perimeter defenses entirely.” The hackers combined the physical intrusion with remote access malware that used another novel technique to conceal itself, even from sophisticated forensic tools. The technique, known as a <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/198590/what-is-a-bind-mount">Linux bind mount</a>, is used in IT administration but had never been seen used by threat actors. The trick allowed the malware to operate similarly to a rootkit, which uses advanced techniques to hide itself from the operating system it runs on.</p>
<h2>End goal: Backdooring the ATM switching network</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi was connected to the same network switch used by the bank’s ATM system, a position that effectively put it inside the bank’s internal network. The goal was to compromise the ATM switching server and use that control to manipulate the bank’s hardware security module, a tamper-resistant physical device used to store secrets such as credentials and digital signatures and run encryption and decryption functions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/in-search-of-riches-hackers-plant-4g-enabled-raspberry-pi-in-bank-network/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As of yesterday, Susan Monarez is in and Vinay Prasad is out among top federal health officials.</p>
<p>In a 51–47 vote along party lines, the Senate confirmed Monarez as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She is the first nominee for CDC director to be required to get Senate confirmation, following a 2022 law requiring it. She is also the first person to serve in the role without a medical degree <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/history/pastdirectors.html">since 1953</a>.</p>
<p>Monarez has a PhD in microbiology and immunology and previously served as the deputy director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) under the Biden administration. Monarez quietly helmed the CDC as acting director from January to March of this year but stepped down as required when Donald Trump nominated her for the permanent role. Before that, Trump had nominated Dave Weldon, but the nomination was abandoned over concerns that his anti-vaccine views would torpedo his Senate confirmation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/cdc-finally-gets-a-director-fdas-top-vaccine-regulator-exits-under-pressure/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hacking attacks—many using ransomware—now hit US cities every few days. They are expensive to mitigate and extremely disruptive. Abilene, Texas, for instance, had 477 GB of data stolen this spring. The city <a href="https://www.abilenetx.gov/civicalerts.aspx?AID=2935">refused to pay the requested ransom</a> and instead decided to replace every server, desktop, laptop, desk telephone, and storage device. This has required a "temporary return to pen-and-paper systems" while the entire city network is rebuilt, but at least Abilene was insured against such an attack.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the hacks hit harder than usual. That was the case in St. Paul, Minnesota, which suffered a significant cyberattack last Friday that it has been unable to mitigate. Things have gotten so bad that the city has declared a state of emergency, while the governor activated the National Guard to assist.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.stpaul.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/20250729_Remarks.pdf">remarks by St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter</a>, the attack was first noticed early in the morning of Friday, July 25. It was, Carter said, "a deliberate, coordinated digital attack, carried out by a sophisticated external actor—intentionally and criminally targeting our city’s information infrastructure."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/st-paul-mn-was-hacked-so-badly-that-the-national-guard-has-been-deployed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After Substack shocked an unknown number of users by sending a push notification on Monday to check out a Nazi blog featuring a swastika icon, the company quickly apologized for the "error," tech columnist Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/substack-sent-a-push-alert-promoting-nazi-white-supremacist-blog">reported</a>.</p>
<p>"We discovered an error that caused some people to receive push notifications they should never have received," Substack's statement said. "In some cases, these notifications were extremely offensive or disturbing. This was a serious error, and we apologize for the distress it caused. We have taken the relevant system offline, diagnosed the issue, and are making changes to ensure it doesn’t happen again."</p>
<p>Substack has long faced backlash for allowing users to share their "extreme views" on the platform, previously claiming that "censorship (including through demonetizing publications)" doesn't make "the problem go away—in fact, it makes it worse," Lorenz noted. But critics who have slammed Substack's rationale revived their concerns this week, with some accusing Substack of promoting extreme content through features like their push alerts and "rising" lists, which flag popular newsletters and currently also include Nazi blogs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/substacks-nazi-problem-wont-go-away-after-push-notification-apology/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is fond of saying its mission is to "organize the world's information," but who gets to decide what information is worthy of organization? A San Francisco tech CEO has spent the past several years attempting to remove unflattering information about himself from Google's search index, and the nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation <a href="https://freedom.press/issues/censorship-whac-a-mole-google-search-exploited-to-scrub-articles-on-san-francisco-tech-exec/">says</a> he's still at it. Most recently, an unknown bad actor used a bug in one of Google's search tools to scrub the offending articles.</p>
<p>The saga began in 2023 when independent journalist Jack Poulson <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/the-covert-gig-work-surveillance">reported</a> on Maury Blackman's 2021 domestic violence arrest. Blackman, who was then the CEO of surveillance tech firm Premise Data Corp., took offense at the publication of his legal issues. The case did not lead to charges after Blackman's 25-year-old girlfriend recanted her claims against the 53-year-old CEO, but Poulson reported on some troubling details of the public arrest report.</p>
<p>Blackman has previously used tools like DMCA takedowns and lawsuits to stifle reporting on his indiscretion, but that campaign now appears to have co-opted part of Google's search apparatus. The Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) reported on Poulson's work and Blackman's attempts to combat it late last year. In June, Poulson contacted the Freedom of the Press Foundation to report that the article had mysteriously vanished from Google search results.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-tool-misused-to-scrub-tech-ceos-shady-past-from-search/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Peacock feathers are greatly admired for their bright iridescent colors, but it turns out they can also emit laser light when dyed multiple times, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8">a paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports. Per the authors, it's the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/peacock-feathers-can-be-lasers">first example</a> of a biolaser cavity within the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/rainbow-weevil-could-hold-the-secret-to-generating-natures-colors-in-the-lab/">previously reported</a>, the bright iridescent colors in things like peacock feathers and butterfly wings don't come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured. The scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects) in butterfly wings, for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5783709/the-colorful-story-of-diffraction-grating">diffraction grating</a>, except photonic crystals only produce certain colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism.</p>
<p>In the case of peacock feathers, it's the regular, periodic nanostructures of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Barbule" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbule">barbules</a>—fiber-like components composed of ordered melanin rods coated in keratin—that produce the iridescent colors. Different colors correspond to different spacing of the barbules.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/scientists-use-peacock-feathers-to-make-frickin-laser-beams/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amid the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to wrest the power of the purse from Congress, an estimated $15 billion allotted by lawmakers to fund life-saving biomedical research via the National Institutes of Health was temporarily frozen and then said to be released Tuesday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-puts-new-chokehold-on-billions-in-health-research-funding-19660215">According to reporting by The Wall Street Journal</a>, the initial decision to withhold the funding came from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget for the Trump administration and Project 2025 co-author. Vought has expansive views of presidential power, the Journal noted, and has said the NIH needs "fundamental reform."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russ-vought-office-of-management-and-budget-face-the-nation-07-27-2025/">an interview with CBS news</a> over the weekend, Vought defended already <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/27/despite-resumption-of-nih-grant-reviews-research-funding-gap-grew/">holding up billions in congressionally allocated funding for research</a> on things like cancer and cardiovascular disease by claiming that the NIH has been "weaponized against the American people." He made the comments after <a href="https://www.britt.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/07.24.25_Senate-Letter-to-OMB-re-FY25-NIH-Appropriations.pdf">14 Republican Senators sent him a letter</a> imploring that he release congressionally appropriated funding, including money marked for the NIH.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/15-billion-in-nih-funding-frozen-then-thawed-tuesday-in-ongoing-power-war/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, The Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-poll-229b665d10d057441a69f56648b973e1">released results</a> from a new <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/young-adults-leading-the-way-in-ai-adoption/">AP-NORC poll</a> showing that 60 percent of US adults have used AI to search for information, while only 37 percent of all Americans have used AI for work tasks. Meanwhile, younger Americans are adopting AI tools at much higher rates across multiple categories, including brainstorming, work tasks, and companionship.</p>
<p>The poll found AI companionship remains the least popular application overall, with just 16 percent of adults overall trying it—but the number jumps to a notable 25 percent among the under-30 crowd. AI companionship can have drawbacks that weren't reflected in the poll, such as excessive agreeability (called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/annoyed-chatgpt-users-complain-about-bots-relentlessly-positive-tone/">sycophancy</a>) and mental health risks, like encouraging <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/ai-therapy-bots-fuel-delusions-and-give-dangerous-advice-stanford-study-finds/">delusional thinking</a>.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,437 adults conducted July 10–14 reveals telling generational divides in AI adoption. While 74 percent of adults under 30 use AI for information searches at least some of the time, only the aforementioned 60 percent of all adults have done so. For brainstorming applications, 62 percent of adults under 30 have used AI to come up with ideas, compared with just 20 percent of those 60 or older.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/so-far-only-one-third-of-americans-have-ever-used-ai-for-work/">Read full article</a></p>
