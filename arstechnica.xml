              <![CDATA[<p>The onion supplier behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-one-dead-49-sickened-across-10-states-so-far/">a deadly <em>E. coli </em>outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders</a> this past fall had numerous health and sanitation violations, including employees with unwashed hands, dirty equipment, and puddles of <em>Listeria</em> bacteria. That's according to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/814225129/FDA-inspection-report-for-Taylor-Farms-Colorado-Inc#fullscreen&amp;from_embed">a Food and Drug Administration inspection report</a> that was obtained by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-report-e-coli-outbreak-onions-taylor-farms/">CBS News</a> via a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>
<p>On October 22, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the outbreak investigation, which at that time had only been linked to 48 illnesses across 10 states, including one death. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/slivered-onions-are-likely-cause-of-mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-cdc-says/">The slivered onions</a> on the fast-food giant's popular Quarter Pounder burgers were an immediate suspect. McDonald's temporarily pulled the burgers from the menu in affected states, and the supplier of the suspect onions, Taylor Farms of Colorado, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/taco-bell-kfc-pizza-hut-burger-king-pull-onions-amid-mcdonalds-outbreak/">swiftly recalled thousands of cases</a>. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/e-coli-O157.html">104 were sickened across 14 states</a>, with 34 people hospitalized and one dead.</p>
<p>On October 28, the FDA began a multi-day inspection of Taylor Farms' facility in Colorado Springs, in which inspectors found numerous violations. The facility processes "ready-to-eat" (RTE) produce, like the cut onions, that do not go through a lethal treatment step for any environmental pathogens before being sold to consumers. This makes any unsanitary conditions in the facility particularly risky for food safety.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/fda-noted-unsanitary-conditions-unwashed-hands-at-mcdonalds-ex-onion-supplier/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mastodon <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/01/the-people-should-own-the-town-square/">announced</a> Monday that it's shifting its structure over the next six months to become wholly owned by a European nonprofit organization—"affirming the intent that Mastodon should not be owned or controlled by a single individual."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This takes control of the social network away from its previous "ultimate decision-maker," Eugen Rochko. As founder, Rochko initially took the reins to ensure the decentralized platform would never be for sale and "would be free of the control of a single wealthy individual." His grand vision remains to leave Mastodon users in control of the social network, making their own decisions about what content is allowed or what appears in their timelines.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes after leaders of other social networks, like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, have sparked backlash over sudden changes to popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter). For years, Musk has drawn criticism for changing Twitter's hate speech policies through his X rebranding. And more recently, Zuckerberg this month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/meta-kills-diversity-programs-claiming-dei-has-become-too-charged/">defended Meta's decision to relax hate speech policies</a> (permitting women to be called "property" and gay people to be called "mentally ill") by calling bans on such speech "out of touch with mainstream discourse."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/mastodon-becomes-nonprofit-to-make-sure-its-never-ruined-by-billionaire-ceo/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>Neverwinter Nights</em> came out in 2002 and received an enhanced edition in 2018. In 2025, that should really be it, but there's something special about Bioware's second dip into the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> universe. The energy from the game's community is strong enough that, based largely on the work of "unpaid software engineers," the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/704450/view/511820969218671050">received a new patch last week</a>.</p>
<p><em>Neverwinter Nights (NN) Enhanced Edition</em> (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704450/Neverwinter_Nights_Enhanced_Edition/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/neverwinter_nights_enhanced_edition_pack">GOG</a>) now has anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering built in, major improvements to its networking code and performance, and <a href="https://nwn.beamdog.net/docs/">more than 100 other improvements</a>. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/23-year-old-d-and-d-rpg-neverwinter-nights-just-got-a-new-update-thanks-to-the-unpaid-software-engineers-of-its-unkillable-community/">noted by PC Gamer</a>, <em>NN</em> was originally built for single-core CPUs, so while it may seem odd to seek "major" improvements to performance for a 23-year-old RPG, it is far from optimized for modern systems.</p>
<p><em>NN </em>received a similar fan-led patch, described as "a year-long love effort" by community developers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/one-of-my-favorite-dandd-videogames-is-still-getting-beefy-updates-after-21-years/">in 2023</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/2002s-neverwinter-nights-gets-a-patch-in-2025-from-unpaid-software-engineers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When we first tested Super Cruise <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/02/the-cadillac-ct6-review-super-cruise-is-a-game-changer/">in 2018</a>, the partially automated driver's assist impressed us enough that we wanted to see it rolled out across as much of General Motors' lineup as possible. Seven years later, our attitude toward such driver assists is a little more sober. Drivers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/drivers-woefully-overestimate-hands-free-driver-tech-study-shows/">are often more confident</a> about such systems than they ought to be, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/from-rain-sensors-to-wireless-charging-the-10-tech-features-car-buyers-want/">and that's when they even care</a> about such features in the first place.</p>
<p>That said, Super Cruise remains one of the better implementations of what the industry has inelegantly labeled "level 2+" driver assists: in plain English, a system that lets the driver go hands-free for long stretches, as long as they're paying attention to the road. Which, in Super Cruise's case, is achieved via an infrared camera that faces the driver and follows their gaze, even if they're wearing sunglasses.</p>
<p>Better yet, it's also tightly geofenced, as it's only meant to be used on restricted access, divided-lane highways.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/how-gms-super-cruise-went-from-limo-driving-to-lane-changes-and-towing/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The New York law requiring Internet providers to offer cheap plans to people with low incomes will take effect on Wednesday this week following a multi-year court battle in which the state defeated broadband industry lobby groups.</p>
<p>A US appeals court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/court-upholds-new-york-law-that-says-isps-must-offer-15-broadband/">upheld the law</a> in April 2024, reversing the ruling of a district judge who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ny-cant-force-isps-to-offer-15-low-income-broadband-plans-judge-rules/">blocked it</a> in 2021. The Supreme Court last month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/big-loss-for-isps-as-supreme-court-wont-hear-challenge-to-15-broadband-law/">decided not to hear</a> the broadband industry's challenge, leaving the appeals court ruling in place. The state law requires Internet providers to offer $15- or $20-per-month service to people with low incomes.</p>
<p>As we've written, the battle between New York and ISPs was an important test case for how states can regulate broadband providers when the Federal Communications Commission isn't doing so. The Biden-era FCC's attempt to reinstate net neutrality rules and regulate broadband providers as common carriers was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/appeals-court-blocks-fccs-efforts-to-bring-back-net-neutrality-rules/">blocked in court</a>, but ISPs lost the fight against the New York affordability law and an earlier fight against <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/04/isps-cant-find-any-judges-who-will-block-california-net-neutrality-law/">California's net neutrality law</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/new-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Scientists have demonstrated that an ancient human skull excavated from a tomb at Ephesos was not that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsinoe_IV">Arsinoë IV</a>, half-sister to Cleopatra VII. Rather, it's the skull of a young male between the ages of 11 and 14 from Italy or Sardinia, who may have suffered from one or more developmental disorders, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83870-x">new paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports. Arsinoë IV's remains are thus still missing.</p>
<p>Arsinoë IV led quite an adventurous short life. She was either the third or fourth daughter of Ptolemy XII, who left the throne to Cleopatra and his son, Ptolemy XIII, to rule together. Ptolemy XIII didn't care for this decision and dethroned Cleopatra in a civil war—until Julius Caesar intervened to enforce their father's original plan of co-rulership. As for Arsinoë, Caesar returned Cyprus to Egyptian rule and named her and her youngest brother (Ptolemy XIV) co-rulers. This time, it was Arsinoë who rebelled, taking command of the Egyptian army and declaring herself queen.</p>
<p>She was fairly successful at first in battling the Romans, conducting a siege against Alexandria and Cleopatra, until her disillusioned officers decided they'd had enough and secretly negotiated with Caesar to turn her over to him. Caesar agreed, and after a bit of public humiliation, he granted Arsinoë sanctuary in the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. She lived in relative peace for a few years, until Cleopatra and Mark Antony ordered her execution on the steps of the temple—a scandalous violation of the temple as a place of sanctuary. Historians disagree about Arsinoë's age when she died: Estimates range from 22 to 27.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/nope-this-skull-is-not-cleopatras-half-sister/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo may be getting ready to make its Switch 2 console official. According to "industry whispers" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">collected by Eurogamer</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217">reporting</a> from The Verge's Tom Warren, the Switch 2 could be formally announced sometime this week. Eurogamer suggests the reveal is scheduled for this Thursday, January 16.</p>
<p>The reporting also suggests that the reveal will focus mostly on the console's hardware design, with another game-centered announcement coming later. Eurogamer reports that the console won't be ready to launch until April; this would be similar to Nintendo's strategy for the original Switch, which was announced in mid-January 2017 but not launched until March.</p>
<p>Many things about the Switch 2's physical hardware design have been thoroughly leaked at this point, thanks mostly to accessory makers who have been showing off their upcoming cases. Accessory maker Genki was at CES last week with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/our-best-look-yet-at-the-switch-2s-expanded-size-and-snap-on-joy-cons/">a 3D-printed replica of the console</a> based on the real thing, suggesting a much larger but still familiar-looking console with a design and button layout similar to the current Switch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/report-after-many-leaks-switch-2-announcement-could-come-this-week/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After an app update rollout that can best be described as disastrous, Sonos is seeking a new CEO. The company announced today that Patrick Spence, who had been CEO for eight years, is stepping down.</p>
<p>In its announcement, Sonos said its board of directors and Spence "agreed" on the decision while saying it was unrelated to the company's fiscal Q1 2025 earnings, which it will report next month.</p>
<p>Spence joined Sonos as chief commercial officer in 2012 after leaving Blackberry. Under his tenure, Sonos branched into new categories, including portable speakers and spatial audio. But in May, Sonos issued an app update that broke basic and critical features. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/it-was-the-wrong-decision-employees-discuss-sonos-rushed-app-debacle/">Sonos employees</a> said the update was built on outdated code and infrastructure, impacting users' ability to do things like access and manage local libraries, set sleep timers, and edit song queues and playlists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/sonos-ceo-behind-disastrous-app-exits-with-1-9-million-severance/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011325zor_5425.pdf">declined</a> to decide whether to block lawsuits that Honolulu filed to seek billions in damages from oil and gas companies over allegedly deceptive marketing campaigns that hid the effects of climate change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now those lawsuits can proceed, surely frustrating the fossil fuel industry, which felt that SCOTUS should have weighed in on this key "recurring question of extraordinary importance to the energy industry" raised in lawsuits seeking similarly high damages in several states, CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-climate-change-lawsuits-hawaii-energy-companies/">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Defendants Sunoco and Shell, along with 15 other energy companies, had asked the court to intervene and stop the Hawaii lawsuits from proceeding. They had hoped to move the cases out of Hawaii state courts by arguing that interstate pollution is governed by federal law and the Clean Air Act.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/supreme-court-lets-hawaii-sue-oil-companies-over-climate-change-effects/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the US government <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/13/fact-sheet-ensuring-u-s-security-and-economic-strength-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/">announced</a> a new round of regulations on global AI chip exports, dividing the world into roughly three tiers of access. The rules create quotas for about 120 countries and allow unrestricted access for 18 close US allies while maintaining existing bans on China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.</p>
<p>AI-accelerating GPU chips, like those <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/nvidia-thinks-ai-boom-is-far-from-over-as-gpu-sales-drive-big-earnings-win/">manufactured by Nvidia</a>, currently serve as the backbone for a wide variety of AI model deployments, such as chatbots like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, AI video generators, self-driving cars, weapons targeting systems, and much more. The Biden administration fears that those chips could be used to undermine US national security.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p><strong>MERRITT ISLAND, Fla.</strong>—Understandably, the main building of Blue Origin's sprawling campus in Florida buzzed with activity on Sunday evening as the final hours ticked down toward the company's historic first orbital launch. The time had come to celebrate a moment long-awaited.</p>
<p>On one side of the large foyer hung a multi-story print of the New Glenn rocket lit up on its launch pad. The striking image had been taken a day after Christmas and put up in the lobby two days earlier. On the other side, a massive replica of the company's "Mk. 1" lunar lander towered over caterers bustling through.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Plenty of computer monitors made debuts at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this year, but many of the updates at this year's event were pretty minor. Many could have easily been a part of 2024's show.</p>
<p>But some brought new and interesting features to the table for 2025—in this article, we'll tell you all about them.</p>
<h2>LG’s 6K monitor</h2>
<p>Pixel addicts are always right at home at CES, and the most interesting high-resolution computer monitor to come out of this year's show is the LG UltraFine 6K Monitor (model 32U990A).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/the-8-most-interesting-pc-monitors-from-ces-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Instead of sensing photons and processing the results, why not process the photons?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A standard digital camera used in a car for stuff like emergency braking has a perceptual latency of a hair above 20 milliseconds. That’s just the time needed for a camera to transform the photons hitting its aperture into electrical charges using either CMOS or CCD sensors. It doesn’t count the further milliseconds needed to send that information to an onboard computer or process it there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A team of MIT researchers figured that if you had a chip that could process photons directly, you could skip the entire digitization step and perform calculations with the photons themselves, which has the potential to be mind-bogglingly faster.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re focused on a very specific metric here, which is latency. We aim for applications where what matters the most is how fast you can produce a solution. That’s why we are interested in systems where we’re able to do all the computations optically,” says Saumil Bandyopadhyay, an MIT researcher. The team implemented a complete deep neural network on a photonic chip, achieving a latency of 410 picoseconds. To put that in perspective, Bandyopadhyay’s chip could process the entire neural net it had onboard around 58 times within a single tick of the 4 GHz clock on a standard CPU.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/getting-an-all-optical-ai-to-handle-non-linear-math/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><strong>COCOA BEACH, Fla.</strong>—As it so often does in the final days before the debut of a new rocket, it all comes down to weather. Accordingly, Blue Origin is only awaiting clear skies and fair seas for its massive New Glenn vehicle to lift off from Florida.</p>
<p>After the company completed integration of the rocket this week and rolled the super heavy lift rocket to its launch site at Cape Canaveral, the focus turned toward the weather. Conditions at Cape Canaveral Space Force Base have been favorable during the early morning launch windows available to the rocket, but there have been complications offshore.</p>
<p>That's because Blue Origin aims to recover the first stage of the New Glenn rocket, and sea states in the Atlantic Ocean have been unsuitable for an initial attempt to catch the first stage booster on a drone ship. The company has already waived one launch attempt set for 1 am ET (06:00 UTC) on Friday, January 10.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/new-glenn-rocket-is-at-the-launch-pad-waiting-for-calm-seas-to-land/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Every year, thousands of product vendors, journalists, and gadget enthusiasts gather in an unreasonable city to gawk at mostly unrealistic products.</p>
<p>To be of service to our readers, Ars has done the work of looking through hundreds of such items presented at the 2025 Consumer Electronic Show, pulling out the most bizarre, unnecessary, and head-scratching items. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/strange-unique-and-otherwise-noteworthy-pcs-and-pc-accessories-from-ces-2025/">Andrew Cunningham swept across PC and gaming accessories</a>. This writer stuck to goods related to the home.</p>
<p>It's a lie to say it's all a prank, so I snuck in a couple of actually good things announced during CES for human domiciles. But the stuff you'll want to tell your family and friends about in mock disbelief? Plenty of that, still.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/three-bizarre-home-devices-and-a-couple-good-things-at-ces-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>While worrying about AI takeover might seem like a modern idea that sprung from <em>War Games</em> or <em>The Terminator</em>, it turns out that a similar concern about machine dominance dates back to the time of the American Civil War, albeit from an English <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3235/pg3235-images.html">sheep farmer</a> living in New Zealand. Theoretically, Abraham Lincoln could have read about AI takeover during his lifetime.</p>
<p>On June 13, 1863, a letter <a href="https://diogenesii.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/darwin-among-the-machines.pdf">published</a> in The Press newspaper of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch">Christchurch</a> warned about the potential dangers of mechanical evolution and called for the destruction of machines, foreshadowing the development of what we now call artificial intelligence—and the backlash against it from people who fear it may threaten humanity with extinction. It presented what may be the first published argument for stopping technological progress to prevent machines from dominating humanity.</p>
<p>Titled "Darwin among the Machines," the letter recently <a href="https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1876982690508910917">popped up</a> again on social media thanks to Peter Wildeford of the <span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Institute for AI Policy and Strategy</span>. The author of the letter, Samuel Butler, submitted it under the pseudonym Cellarius, but later came to publicly embrace his position. The letter drew direct parallels between Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and the rapid development of machinery, suggesting that machines could evolve consciousness and eventually supplant humans as Earth's dominant species.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/161-years-ago-a-new-zealand-sheep-farmer-predicted-ai-doom/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In 2019, astronomer Britt Lundgren of the University of North Carolina Asheville visited the Guggenheim Museum in New York City to take in an exhibit of the works of Swedish painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilma_af_Klint">Hilma af Klint</a>. Lundgren noted a striking similarity between the abstract geometric shapes in af Klint's work and scientific diagrams in 19th century physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist)">Thomas Young</a>'s <em>Lectures</em> (1807). So began a four-year journey starting at the intersection of science and art that has culminated in a forthcoming paper in the journal Leonardo, making the case for the connection.</p>
<p>Af Klint was formally trained at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and initially focused on drawing, portraits, botanical drawings, and landscapes from her Stockholm studio after graduating with honors. This provided her with income, but her true life's work drew on af Klint's interest in spiritualism and mysticism. She was one of "The Five," a group of Swedish women artists who shared those interests. They regularly organized seances and were admirers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy">theosophical</a> teachings of the time.</p>
<p>It was through her work with The Five that af Klint began experimenting with automatic drawing, driving her to invent her own geometric visual language to conceptualize the invisible forces she believed influenced our world. She painted her first abstract series in 1906 at age 44. Yet she rarely exhibited this work because she believed the art world at the time wasn't ready to appreciate it. Her will requested that the paintings stay hidden for at least 20 years after her death.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/did-hilma-af-klint-draw-inspiration-from-19th-century-physics/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a "hacking-as-a-service" scheme that was designed to allow the creation of harmful and illicit content using the company’s platform for AI-generated content.</p>
<p>The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/10/taking-legal-action-to-protect-the-public-from-abusive-ai-generated-content/">said</a> Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit. They then compromised the legitimate accounts of paying customers. They combined those two things to create a fee-based platform people could use.</p>
<h2>A sophisticated scheme</h2>
<p>Microsoft is also suing seven individuals it says were customers of the service. All 10 defendants were named John Doe because Microsoft doesn’t know their identity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/microsoft-sues-service-for-creating-illicit-content-with-its-ai-platform/">Read full article</a></p>
