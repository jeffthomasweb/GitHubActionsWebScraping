              <![CDATA[<p>In an era of reusable rockets and near-daily access to space, NASA is still paying more than it did 30 years ago to launch missions into orbit, according to a study soon to be published in the scientific journal Acta Astronautica.</p>
<p>Launch is becoming more routine. Every few days, SpaceX is sending another batch of Starlink Internet satellites to orbit, and other kinds of missions fill up the rest of SpaceX's launch schedule. SpaceX, alone, has ample capacity to launch the handful of science missions NASA puts into space each year. If supply outpaces demand, shouldn't prices go down?</p>
<p>It's not so simple. NASA is one of many customers jockeying for a slot on SpaceX's launch manifest. The US military is launching more missions than ever before, and SpaceX is about to become the Pentagon's top launch provider. SpaceX already launches more missions for NASA than any other rocket company.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/reusable-rockets-are-here-so-why-is-nasa-paying-more-to-launch-stuff-to-space/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The buried roots and stumps of an ancient forest in southern China are the charred remains of an ancient war and the burning of a capital city, according to a recent study from researchers who carbon-dated the stumps and measured charcoal and pollen in the layers of peat surrounding them.</p>
<p>It may not be obvious today, but there’s an ancient forest hidden beneath the farmland of southern China’s Pearl River Delta. Spread across 2,000 square kilometers are thick layers of waterlogged peat, now covered by agriculture. It’s all that is left of what used to be a thriving wetland ecosystem, home to forests of Chinese swamp cypress along with elephants, tigers, crocodiles, and tropical birds. But the peat hides the buried, preserved stumps and roots of cypress trees; some of the largest stumps are almost 2 meters wide, and many have burn marks on their tops.</p>
<p>“These peat layers are locally known as ‘buried ancient forest,’ because many buried trees appear fresh and most stumps are found still standing,” writes Ning Wang of the Chinese Academy of Scientists, who along with colleagues, authored the recent paper. It turns out that the eerie buried forest is the last echo of the Han army’s invasion during a war about 2,100 years ago.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/an-ancient-battle-has-driven-a-wetland-species-almost-to-extinction/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Comcast executives apparently realized something that customers have known and complained about for years: The Internet provider's prices aren't transparent enough and rise too frequently.</p>
<p>This might not have mattered much to cable executives as long as the total number of subscribers met their targets. But after <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/static-files/7f0f826a-6462-426b-a767-cb3170d7cdf0">reporting a net loss</a> of 183,000 residential broadband customers in Q1 2025, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said the company isn't "winning in the marketplace" during an <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/xurtaib2/">earnings call</a> today. The Q1 2025 customer loss was over three times larger than the net loss in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>While customers often have few viable options for broadband and the availability of alternatives varies widely by location, Comcast faces competition from fiber and fixed wireless ISPs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/after-losing-customers-comcast-admits-prices-are-too-confusing-and-unpredictable/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On the one hand, his plans to promote early AI training in K–12 schools appear to be "critical," as Trump says, to "maintain America’s global dominance in this technological revolution for future generations." To that end, the order established an AI Presidential Challenge to highlight significant student and educator achievements and encourage innovative thinking.</p>
<p>"It is the policy of the United States to promote AI literacy and proficiency among Americans by promoting the appropriate integration of AI into education, providing comprehensive AI training for educators, and fostering early exposure to AI concepts and technology to develop an AI-ready workforce and the next generation of American AI innovators," Trump's order said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-orders-doe-to-make-ai-a-national-priority-while-plotting-agencys-death/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">antitrust remedy trial</a> started this week, and the Department of Justice has produced several witnesses to testify about how Google's stranglehold on search has slowed their innovation. On day three, Perplexity Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko told the court that Google blocked <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a> from being the default on Motorola phones, which is precisely the kind of anticompetitive behavior that got it in hot water. It would appear there is some room in the smartphone world, though, because Perplexity is included with Moto's newly announced flip phones.</p>
<p>During questioning on Wednesday, Shevelenko likened Google's mobile integration contracts to a "gun to your head." He claimed that both Motorola and Perplexity, which positions itself as an AI search engine, were interested in a partnership last year, but the phone maker was unable to get out of its Google distribution contract, which prevented it from using a non-Google assistant platform.</p>
<p>Google has long required Android device makers to use Assistant on their devices, but Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/google-launches-gemini-a-powerful-ai-model-it-says-can-surpass-gpt-4/">launch of Gemini</a> added a sense of urgency. Google is pushing Gemini into every corner of its ecosystem with the aim of catching up to ChatGPT, and it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/gemini-usage-is-exploding-but-google-is-a-long-way-from-catching-chatgpt/">might be working</a>. Motorola's 2024 phones were some of the first to prominently feature Gemini as the default assistant instead of Google Assistant. Apparently, the deal left no room for Perplexity as OEMs are unwilling to risk their Google revenue-sharing agreements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/perplexity-will-come-to-moto-phones-after-exec-testified-google-blocked-access/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Roku, owner of one of the most popular connected TV operating systems in the country, walks a fine line when it comes to advertising. Roku's OS lives on low-priced smart TVs, streaming sticks, and projectors. To make up the losses from cheaply priced hardware, Roku is dependent on selling advertisements throughout its OS, including screensavers and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/roku-ad-push-continues-with-plans-to-put-video-ads-in-os-home-screen/">its home screen</a>.</p>
<p>That business model has pushed Roku to experiment with new ways of showing ads that test users’ tolerance. The company claims that it doesn't want ads on its platform to be considered intrusive, but there are reasons to be skeptical about Roku's pledge.</p>
<h2>Non-“interruptive” ads</h2>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/654389/roku-2025-event-ads-interview">The Verge</a> this week, Jordan Rost, Roku’s head of ad marketing, emphasized that Roku tries to only deliver ads that don't interrupt viewers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/roku-tech-patents-prove-its-potential-for-delivering-interruptive-ads/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Russian military personnel are being targeted with recently discovered Android malware that steals their contacts and tracks their location.</p>
<p>The malware is hidden inside a modified app for Alpine Quest mapping software, which is used by, among others, hunters, athletes, and Russian personnel stationed in the war zone in Ukraine. The app displays various topographical maps for use online and offline. The trojanized Alpine Quest app is being pushed on a dedicated Telegram channel and in unofficial Android app repositories. The chief selling point of the trojanized app is that it provides a free version of Alpine Quest Pro, which is usually available only to paying users.</p>
<h2>Looks like the real thing</h2>
<p>The malicious module is named Android.Spy.1292.origin. In a <a href="https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=15006&amp;lng=en&amp;c=5">blog post</a>, researchers at Russia-based security firm Dr.Web wrote:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/russian-military-personnel-on-the-front-lines-targeted-with-new-android-spyware/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Director of the National Science Foundation Sethuraman Panchanathan abruptly resigned Thursday, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nsf-director-resign-amid-grant-terminations-job-cuts-and-controversy">Science Magazine</a> first reported.</p>
<p>Panchanathan, who goes by Panch, did not cite a reason for his departure, which comes as 16 months are left in his six-year term. However, like most other federal agencies, the scientific funding organization is awash in turmoil due to the Trump administration. Specifically, the NSF is facing a 55 percent cut to its $9 billion annual budget in the next fiscal year, as well as a mass layoff of half of its 1,700-person staff, according to Science.</p>
<p>A memo sent to staff on Thursday, April 24, and obtained by Ars Technica confirmed that the NSF is in for significant cuts. It offered staff a second chance at the deal offered in the earlier "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/copying-musk-trump-admin-offers-federal-workers-buyouts-to-resign/">fork in the road</a>" email, allowing them to go on paid leave in return for departing the foundation before October. Anyone who stays will face "future restructuring, staffing reductions, and constrained budget environments." The changes are expected to "constrain future opportunities" within the NSF.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/nsf-director-resigns-amid-55-budget-cut-mass-layoffs-from-trump-admin/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We think of moths and butterflies as relatively harmless creatures, but there are certain species with a darker side—for example, carnivorous caterpillars that eat aphids, butterflies <a href="https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2023/08/blood-suckers-and-tear-drinkers-the-secretion-lives-of-butterflies-and-moths/">that drink</a> alligator tears, or "vampire" moths that feed on livestock blood. Add to that list the newly discovered "bone collector" caterpillar, which conducts daring raids on spider webs for sustenance, camouflaging itself in the body parts of already-consumed insects to avoid being eaten. Not only that, but according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads4243">new paper</a> published in the journal Science, the caterpillars can tailor those insect parts, nibbling away at any excess material to ensure a proper fit.</p>
<p>Daniel Rubinoff, an entomologist at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, studies a genus of moths found in Hawaii called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyposmocoma">Hyposcoma</a>, or as he has dubbed their larval form, "Hawaiian Fancy Case" caterpillars, so named because they spin their own casings, adding to them as they grow, although the materials used can vary widely.  There are now more than 600 species within this genus, many of them not yet officially described, so it was a rich research area to explore.</p>
<p>The discovery of the bone collector species was serendipitous. "You never forget your first bone collector," Rubinoff told Ars. His team was on Oa'hu looking for <em>Hyposcoma</em> when they came across a little tree hollow and spotted something at the bottom that at first glance just looked like "a bag of bug bits." The caterpillar then stuck its head out, and the researchers realized it was a new kind of case. Rubinoff assumed that the spider web also found in the tree hollow was a coincidence; the caterpillar just used the materials readily available in the tree hollow to make its fancy case.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/bone-collector-caterpillar-adorns-itself-in-insect-body-parts/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Motorola's flip phone lineup has expanded to three models, including a $1,300 "Ultra."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>After a flurry of leaks, Motorola has unveiled its 2025 foldable lineup. This will be the first cycle with three Motorola Razr flip phones, ranging from the relatively inexpensive base model Razr to the lavishly expensive Razr Ultra. All three phones have a slick foldable design, a stronger hinge, and big screens—and they come in a collection of snazzy Pantone colorways.</p>
<h2>Pretty colors, stronger hinges</h2>
<p>The three models have similar overall designs, but the specs are notably different. The base model phone again relies on a MediaTek chip, while the Plus and Ultra are Snapdragon-based. The Ultra has the same processor seen in Samsung's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/samsungs-galaxy-s25-event-was-an-ai-presentation-with-occasional-phone-hardware/">latest flagship phones</a>, the Snapdragon 8 Elite. As Moto points out, it's the fastest chip available in a foldable.</p>

<p>Motorola's Pantone partnership, which was recently featured in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/the-2025-moto-g-stylus-has-a-sharper-display-and-enhanced-stylus-for-400/">2025 Moto G Stylus</a>, is used to great effect here. All three phones are available in some stunning colors with various materials and finishes. The Razr comes in Spring Bud (above), Gibraltar Sea, Parfait Pink, and Lightest Sky. The Razr+ gets Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink (below). The Ultra comes in Rio Red, Scarab, Cabaret, or Mountain Trail, with a wood body that harkens back to the days of Moto maker. It's refreshing to get so much choice when most phones are only available in a couple of boring tones.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/motorola-reveals-three-new-super-colorful-razr-foldables/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console went live at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart at midnight Eastern time last night (though the rush of orders caused problems and delays across all three retailers' websites). The console listings came with a wave of other retail listings for games and accessories, and those listings either fill small gaps in our knowledge about Switch 2 game packaging and pricing or confirm facts that were previously implied.</p>
<p>First, $80 Switch 2 games like <em>Mario Kart World </em>will not cost $90 as physical releases. This is worth repeating over and over again because of <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/no-switch-2-games-arent-90-the-internet-is-just-broken-beyond-belief/">how pernicious the rumors about $90 physical releases have been</a>; as recently as this morning, typing "Switch 2 $90" into Google would show you videos, Reddit threads, news posts, and even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">Google's own AI summaries</a> all confidently and incorrectly proclaiming that physical Switch 2 releases will cost $90 when they actually won't.</p>

The <em>Mario Kart World</em> website listed an $80 MSRP from the start, as did early retail listings that were published before preorders actually began, and this price didn't change when Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">increased accessory pricing</a> in response to import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Volkswagen provided accommodation so Ars could drive the Golf GTI. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Even in an alternate timeline in which the average new car didn't cost more than $50,000 and weigh well more than two tons, Volkswagen's Golf GTI would stand above the norm. Here on Earth Prime, nine years after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/lhc-back-from-weasel-induced-shutdown-starts-its-2016-run/">a weasel met a particle accelerator</a> and everything started to get weird, the GTI shines as almost the perfect blend of performance and everyday practicality while keeping the footprint small and the sticker price affordable.</p>
<p>The GTI has just had its midlife facelift, making this generation the Mk8.5 if you speak Golfnerd. Even if you don't, you're probably familiar with the idea. But to recap, in 1976, someone at VW had the bright idea of giving the Golf hatchback a more powerful engine and better handling. The original GTI wasn't the first hot hatch, but it was the most influential, giving VW's humble Golf a halo that shone brightly when seized upon by that most 1980s of species, the yuppie.</p>
<p>The GTI has been a constant in the Golf range ever since. Here in America, it <em>is</em> the Golf range, along with the all-wheel drive Golf R, but more on that car another day. Americans used to buy regular Golfs—I have not one but two neighbors with Golf Alltrack station wagons, in case anecdote will suffice in place of sales data—but no longer in numbers that make importing the other cars economical. On the other hand, the US is now one of the largest markets for the GTI, VW told me, and last year, it saw sales grow by almost 50 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-vw-golf-gti-buttons-are-back-on-the-menu-smiles-never-went-away/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-tariffs-response-trump-retaliation/">the trade war</a> between China and the United States continues to escalate, Beijing is responding by turning to one of its favorite retaliation tactics: limiting the export of critical minerals used in many <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/2-obscure-clean-energy-metals-are-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-the-us-china-trade-war/">high-tech electronics</a>, from fighter jets to wind turbines. While China’s mineral restrictions may sound scary, the reality is that they haven’t been very effective in the past and stand to become even less so if the US and other countries finally get their acts together.</p>
<p>It all started in July 2023, when the Chinese government announced it would restrict the export of gallium and germanium, two critical minerals that are mostly used in making <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tandem-solar-panel-cells-efficiency-energy/">solar panels</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/">semiconductors</a>. Over the following two years, China’s list of controlled products expanded to include antimony, graphite, and other materials. Earlier this month, the Chinese government escalated things even further, subjecting seven rare earth elements to a more comprehensive export licensing program that covers the whole world and is designed to further choke off American companies.</p>
<p>Rare earths are a subset of elements under the broader umbrella of critical minerals that China has long enjoyed monopoly control over. In the short term, companies that need these rare earths might be able to rely on existing stockpiles or even turn to recycled electronics to find them. But eventually, the US and other countries will be forced to either ramp up domestic mining or reduce their dependence on rare earths, both of which would make China’s policies sting less. “China has got one shot, and it knows it,” says Ian Lange, an associate professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/sadly-for-china-rare-earth-elements-arent-actually-all-that-rare/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At this point, the Framework Laptop 13 is a familiar face, an old friend. We have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/">reviewed</a> this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-framework-laptops-13th-gen-intel-upgrade-helps-fix-its-battery-problem/">laptop</a> five <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/framework-laptop-13-reviewed-again-meteor-lake-meh-linux-upgrades-good/">other times</a>, and in that time, the idea of a repairable and upgradeable laptop has gone from a "sounds great if they can pull it off" idea to one that's become pretty reliable and predictable. And nearly four years out from the original version—which shipped with an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/">11th-generation Intel Core processor</a>—we're at the point where an upgrade will get you significant boosts to CPU and GPU performance, plus some other things.</p>
<p>We're looking at <a href="https://frame.work/products/laptop13-diy-amd-ai300/configuration/new">the Ryzen AI 300 version</a> of the Framework Laptop today, currently available for preorder and shipping in Q2 for people who buy one now. The laptop starts at $1,099 for a pre-built version and $899 for a RAM-less, SSD-less, Windows-less DIY version, and we've tested the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 version that starts at $1,659 before you add RAM, an SSD, or an OS.</p>
<p>This board is a direct upgrade to Framework's Ryzen 7040-series board from mid-2023, with most of the same performance benefits we saw last year <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/ryzen-ai-300-performance-review-impressive-cpus-even-if-you-dont-care-about-ai/">when we first took a look at the Ryzen AI 300 series</a>. It's also, if this matters to you, the first Framework Laptop to meet Microsoft's requirements for its Copilot+ PC initiative, giving users access to some extra locally processed AI features (including but not limited to Recall) with the promise of more to come.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/review-ryzen-ai-cpu-makes-this-the-fastest-the-framework-laptop-13-has-ever-been/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>No matter how bad things might seem, at least you haven't accidentally eaten fox poop and developed an insidious tapeworm infection that masquerades as a cancerous liver tumor while it slowly destroys your organs and eventually kills you—or, you <em>probably</em> haven't done that.</p>
<p>What's more, according to <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/5/24-1608_article#suggestedcitation">a newly published study in Emerging Infectious Diseases</a>, even if you have somehow feasted on fox feces and acquired this nightmare parasite, it's looking less likely that doctors will need to hack out chunks of your organs to try to stop it.</p>
<p>That's the good news from the new study. The bad news is that, while this infection is fairly rare, it appears to be increasing. And, if you do get it, you might have a shorter lifespan than the uninfected and may be sicker in general.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/tapeworm-in-fox-poop-that-will-slowly-destroy-your-organs-is-on-the-rise/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's not every day you get a trailer for a new, live-action Predator movie, but today is one of those days. 20th Century Studios just released the first teaser for <em>Predator: Badlands</em>, a feature film that unconventionally makes the classic movie monster a protagonist.</p>
<p>The film follows Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), a young member of the predator species and society who has been banished. He'll work closely with a Weyland-Yutani Android named Thia (Elle Fanning) to take down "the ultimate adversary," which the trailer dubs a creature that "can't be killed." The adversary looks like a very large monster we haven't seen before, judging from a few shots in the trailer.</p>
<p>Some or all of the film is rumored to take place on the Predator home world, and the movie intends to greatly expand on the mythology around the Predators' culture, language, and customs. It's intended as a standalone movie in the Predator/Alien universe.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/elle-fanning-teams-up-with-a-predator-in-first-predator-badlands-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A few decades ago, it wasn't realistic to attribute individual events—even heat waves—to the general warming trend driven by human-caused climate change. Now, there are peer-reviewed methods of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/how-do-we-know-when-climate-change-makes-weather-disasters-worse/">rapidly detecting humanity's fingerprints</a> in the wake of weather disasters <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/climate-change-boosted-miltons-landfall-strength-from-category-2-to-3/">like hurricanes</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/climate-change-set-the-table-for-los-angeles-wildfires/">climate-driven wildfires</a>.</p>
<p>In today's issue of Nature, Dartmouth's Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin argue that we've reached a similar level of sophistication regarding another key question: What are the economic damages caused by individual climate events? They argue that we can now assign monetary values to the damage caused by emissions that can be traced back to individual companies. They found that "The global economy would be $28 trillion richer ... were it not for the extreme heat caused by the emissions from the 111 carbon majors."</p>
<p>They argue that this method might provide legal ammunition for those interested in seeking climate damages in court: "By revealing the human fingerprint on events previously thought to be ‘acts of God,’ attribution science has helped make climate change legally legible."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/can-the-legal-system-catch-up-with-climate-science/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Democratic member of the Federal Communications Commission plans what she calls a First Amendment tour to fight the Trump administration's "ongoing campaign of censorship and control."</p>
<p>"Since the founding of our country, the First Amendment has protected our fundamental right to speak freely and hold power to account. Today, the greatest threat to that freedom is coming from our own government," Commissioner Anna Gomez <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-410999A1.pdf">said yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Gomez plans to focus on FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's actions against news broadcasters and tech firms. Under Carr, "the FCC is being weaponized to attack freedom of speech in the media and telecommunications sector instead of focusing on its core mission—connecting the public, protecting consumers, and supporting competition," Gomez's announcement said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fcc-democrat-slams-chairman-for-aiding-trumps-campaign-of-censorship/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Bethesda <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672">isn't officially supporting mods</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/">the newly released <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a>. But that hasn't stopped some players from discovering that many mods created for the 2006 original seem to work just fine in the new game with a bare minimum of installation headaches.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivionmods/comments/1k5c77z/from_the_bethesda_discord/">noted on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364285658595852358">the Bethesda Game Studios Discord</a>, some .esp mod files designed years ago for the original <em>Oblivion</em> have the same effect when plugged into the new <em>Remastered</em> game. Ars confirmed this during some quick testing, using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/20947">a mod uploaded in 2008</a> to easily add high-end weapons and armor to the opening jail cell scene in the <em>Remastered</em> version.</p>
<p>While players of the original game could use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2097">the Oblivion Mod Manager</a> to easily install these mods, doing so in the <em>Remastered</em> version requires a bit more manual work. First, users have to download the applicable .esp mod files and put them in the "Content/Dev/ObvData/Data" folder (the same one that already houses DLC data files like "DLCHorseArmor.esp"). Then it's just a matter of opening "Plugins.txt" in the same folder and adding that full .esp file name to the plaintext list.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the State Bar of California <a href="https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/CBE-Recommends-Scoring-Adjustments-for-February-Bar-Exam">revealed</a> that it used AI to develop a portion of multiple-choice questions on its February 2025 bar exam, causing outrage among law school faculty and test takers. The admission comes after weeks of complaints about technical problems and irregularities during the exam administration, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-23/state-bar-of-california-used-ai-for-exam-questions">reports</a> the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>The State Bar disclosed that its psychometrician (a person or organization skilled in administrating psychological tests), <a href="https://acsventures.com/">ACS Ventures</a>, created 23 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions with AI assistance. Another 48 questions came from a first-year law student exam, while Kaplan Exam Services developed the remaining 100 questions.</p>
<p>The State Bar defended its practices, telling the LA Times that all questions underwent review by content validation panels and subject matter experts before the exam. "The ACS questions were developed with the assistance of AI and subsequently reviewed by content validation panels and a subject matter expert in advance of the exam," wrote State Bar Executive Director Leah Wilson in a press release.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/ai-secretly-helped-write-california-bar-exam-sparking-uproar/">Read full article</a></p>
