              <![CDATA[<p>Zombies never really go out of style, but they were an especially hot commodity on television in the 2010s, spawning the blockbuster series <em>The Walking Dead</em> (2010-2022) as well as quirkier fare like Netflix's comedy horror, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clarita_Diet"><em>The Santa Clarita Diet </em></a>(2017-2018).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IZombie_(TV_series)"><em>iZombie</em></a>, a supernatural procedural dramedy that ran for five seasons on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW">the CW</a>, falls into the latter category. It never achieved mega-hit status but nonetheless earned a hugely loyal following drawn to the show's wicked humor, well-drawn characters, and winning mix of cases-of-the-week and longer narrative arcs.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for all five seasons below.)</strong></p>
<p>The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IZombie_(comic_book)">Vertigo comic series</a> was created by writer Chris Roberson and artist Michael Allred. It featured a zombie in Eugene, Oregon, named Gwen Dylan, who worked as a gravedigger because she needed to consume brains every 30 days to keep her memories and cognitive faculties in working order. Her best friends were a ghost who died in the 1960s and a were-terrier named Scott, nicknamed "Spot," and together they took on challenges both personal and supernatural (vampires, mummies, etc.).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/revisiting-izombie-10-years-later/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>You wouldn't steal a car, right? So you shouldn't pirate a movie, either.</p>
<p>That was the gist of the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Wouldn%27t_Steal_a_Car">"You Wouldn't Steal a Car" anti-piracy campaign</a> from the Motion Picture Association of America during the mid-2000s. But questions are now being asked about just how carefully the MPAA followed its own anti-piracy principles when designing the campaign. Specifically: Did the MPAA rip off a key font?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is, like many matters involving typefaces, fonts, and copyright, somewhat complicated.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/you-wouldnt-steal-a-car-anti-piracy-campaign-may-have-used-pirated-fonts/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[How does a fresh coat of paint help this 19-year-old RPG against modern competition?]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>For many gamers, this week's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/">release of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a> has provided a good excuse to revisit a well-remembered RPG classic from years past. For others, it's provided a good excuse to catch up on a well-regarded game that they haven't gotten around to playing in the nearly two decades since its release.</p>
<p>I'm in that second group. While I've played a fair amount of <em>Skyrim</em> (on platforms ranging from the Xbox 360 to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/the-world-of-skyrim-is-thrilling-and-flawed-in-vr/">VR headsets</a>) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/starfield-impressions-putting-the-vast-back-in-vast-cosmos/"><em>Starfield</em></a>, I've never taken the time to go back to the earlier Bethesda Game Studios RPGs. As such, my impressions of <em>Oblivion</em> before this <em>Remaster</em> have been guided by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/03/oblivion/">old critical reactions</a> and the <a href="https://trismegistus.tech/apps/the-cheddar-scrolls/en.html">many</a> <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/this-beloved-oblivion-meme-got-remade-7-years-later-proving-oblivion-remastered-preserves-the-timeless-comedy-of-the-original">memes</a> calling attention to the game's somewhat janky engine.</p>
<p>Playing through the first few hours of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> this week, without the benefit of nostalgia, I can definitely see why <em>Oblivion</em> made such an impact on RPG fans in 2006. But I also see all the ways that the game can feel a bit dated after nearly two decades of advancements in genre design.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/is-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-still-fun-for-a-first-time-player-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US military launched a long-range hypersonic missile Friday morning from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on a test flight that, if successful, could pave the way for the weapon's operational deployment later this year.</p>
<p>The Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon fired out of a canister on a road-mobile trailer shortly after sunrise on Florida's Space Coast, then headed east over the Atlantic Ocean propelled by a solid-fueled rocket booster. Local residents shared images of the launch on social media.</p>
<p>Designed for conventional munitions, the new missile is poised to become the first ground-based hypersonic weapon fielded by the US military. Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat against Ukraine. China has "the world's leading hypersonic missile arsenal," according to a recent Pentagon report on Chinese military power. After a successful test flight from Cape Canaveral last year, the long-range hypersonic weapon (LRHW)<span class="s1">—officially named "Dark Eagle" by the Army earlier this week</span><span class="s1">—will give the United States the ability to strike targets with little or no warning.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/weapons-of-war-are-launching-from-cape-canaveral-for-the-first-time-since-1988/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As of Friday, April 25, the US has confirmed over 900 measles cases since the start of the year. The cases are across 29 states, but most are in or near Texas, where a massive outbreak continues to mushroom in close-knit, undervaccinated communities.</p>
<p>On April 24, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tallied <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html">884 cases across the country</a>. Today, the Texas health department updated its outbreak total, <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025">adding 22 cases</a> to its last count from Tuesday. That brings the national total to at least 906 confirmed cases. Most of the cases are in unvaccinated children and teens.</p>
<p>Overall, Texas has identified 664 cases since late January. Of those, 64 patients have been hospitalized, and two unvaccinated school-aged children with no underlying medical conditions have died of the disease. An unvaccinated adult in New Mexico also died from the infection, bringing this year's measles death toll to three.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/this-is-shaping-up-to-be-the-worst-year-for-us-measles-cases-since-the-1990s/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A lawyer representing MyPillow and its CEO Mike Lindell in a defamation case admitted using artificial intelligence in a brief that has nearly 30 defective citations, including misquotes and citations to fictional cases, a federal judge said.</p>
<p>"[T]he Court identified nearly thirty defective citations in the Opposition. These defects include but are not limited to misquotes of cited cases; misrepresentations of principles of law associated with cited cases, including discussions of legal principles that simply do not appear within such decisions; misstatements regarding whether case law originated from a binding authority such as the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; misattributions of case law to this District; and most egregiously, citation of cases that do not exist," US District Judge Nina Wang wrote in an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.215068/gov.uscourts.cod.215068.309.0.pdf">order to show cause</a> Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wang ordered attorneys Christopher Kachouroff and Jennifer DeMaster to show cause as to why the court should not sanction the defendants, law firm, and individual attorneys. Kachouroff and DeMaster also have to explain why they should not be referred to disciplinary proceedings for violations of the rules of professional conduct.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/mypillow-ceos-lawyers-used-ai-in-brief-citing-fictional-cases-judge-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's a curious contradiction at the heart of today's most capable AI models that purport to "reason": They can solve <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/sota/arithmetic-reasoning-on-gsm8k">routine math problems </a>with accuracy, yet when faced with formulating deeper mathematical proofs found in competition-level challenges, they often fail.</p>
<p>That's the finding of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21934">eye-opening preprint research</a> into simulated reasoning (SR) models, initially listed in March and updated in April, that mostly fell under the news radar. The research serves as an instructive case study on the mathematical limitations of SR models, despite sometimes grandiose marketing claims from AI vendors.</p>
<p>What sets <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">simulated reasoning models</a> apart from traditional large language models (LLMs) is that they have been trained to output a step-by-step "thinking" process (often called "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">chain-of-thought</a>") to solve problems. Note that "simulated" in this case doesn't mean that the models do not reason at all but rather that they do not necessarily reason using the same techniques as humans. That distinction is important because human reasoning itself is difficult to define.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If I knew how much I’d end up loving my Logitech mice, I would’ve taken better care of them from the start. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/logitech-mx-master-3s-review-the-best-wireless-mouse-gets-slightly-better/">MX Master 3S</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/04/logitechs-lift-is-a-vertical-mouse-thats-easier-to-grasp/">Lift</a> are my favorite mice for productivity, but their rubber coating can get grimy quickly. My white MX Master 3S looks especially shameful atop my desk, so I’ve been considering purchasing a replacement for a while.</p>
<p>Overturning my plans, though, Logitech recently raised prices across 51 percent of its portfolio, as detailed by YouTube channel <a href="1.%09https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4d__01u2mc">Cameron Doughterty Tech</a>. The firm has raised prices by as much as 25 percent.</p>
<p>The MX Master 3S I just mentioned is now $120, which is $20 more than before. That 20 percent increase makes it even harder to justify a new mouse, which I already considered a luxury purchase.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/looming-tariffs-are-making-it-extra-hard-to-be-a-tech-geek/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What does the "typical" exosolar system look like? We know it's not likely to look like our own Solar System, given that our familiar planets don't include entire classes of planets (Hot Jupiters! Mini-Neptunes!) that we've found elsewhere. And our discovery methods have been heavily biased toward planets that orbit close to their host star, so we don't really have a strong sense of what might be lurking in more distant orbits.</p>
<p>A new study released on Thursday describes a search for what are called "microlensing" events, where a planet acts as a gravitational lens that magnifies the star it's orbiting, causing it to brighten briefly. These events are difficult to capture, but can potentially indicate the presence of planets in more distant orbits. The researchers behind the new work find indications that there's a significant population of rocky super-Earths that are traveling in orbits similar to that of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<h2>Lenses go micro</h2>
<p>The two primary methods we've used to discover exoplanets are called transit and radial velocity. In the transit method, we simply watch the star for dips in the light it sends to Earth, which can be an indication of a planet orbiting in a way that it eclipses a small fraction of the star. For radial velocity, we look for red- or blue-shifts in the light received from the star, caused by a planet tugging the star in different directions as it orbits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/new-study-there-are-lots-of-icy-super-earths/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Multiple studies and investigations have found that about half of American households watch TV and movies with subtitles on, but only a relatively small portion of those include someone with a hearing disability. That's because of the trouble many people have understanding dialogue in modern viewing situations, and Netflix has now <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-a-new-way-to-experience-subtitles">introduced</a> a subtitles option to help.</p>
<p>The closed captioning we've all been using for years includes not only the words the people on-screen are saying, but additional information needed by the hard of hearing, including character names, music cues ("dramatic music intensifies") and sound effects ("loud explosion").</p>
<p>For those who just wanted to make sure they didn't miss a word here and there, the frequent descriptions of sound effects and music could be distracting. This new format omits those extras, just including the spoken words and nothing else—even in the same language as the spoken dialogue.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/cant-understand-dialogue-on-tv-shows-netflix-has-a-new-feature-for-you/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The FBI is offering $10 million for information about the China-state hacking group tracked as Salt Typhoon and its intrusion last year into sensitive networks belonging to multiple US telecommunications companies.</p>
<p>Salt Typhoon is one of a half-dozen or more hacking groups that work on behalf of the People’s Republic of China. Intelligence agencies and private security companies have concluded the group has been behind a string of espionage attacks designed to collect vital information, in part for use in any military conflicts that may arise in the future.</p>
<h2>A broad and significant cyber campaign</h2>
<p>The agency on Thursday published a <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250424-2">statement</a> offering up to $10 million, relocation assistance, and other compensation for information about Salt Typhoon.

              <![CDATA[<p>Google's oldest smart thermostats have an expiration date. The company has announced that the first and second generation Nest Learning Thermostats will lose support in October 2025, disabling most of the connected features. Google is offering some compensation for anyone still using these devices, but there's no Google upgrade for European users. Google is also discontinuing its only European model, and it's not planning to release another.</p>
<p>Both affected North American thermostats predate Google's ownership of the company, which it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/02/googles-3-2-billion-nest-deal-is-official/">acquired in 2014</a>. Nest released the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/">original Learning Thermostat</a> to almost universal praise in 2011, with the sequel arriving a year later. Google's second-gen Euro unit launched in 2014. Since launch, all these devices have been getting regular software updates and have migrated across multiple app redesigns. However, all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>As Google points out, these products have had a long life, and they're not being rendered totally inoperable. Come October 25, 2025, these devices will no longer receive software updates or connect to Google's cloud services. That means you won't be able to control them from the Google Home app or via Assistant (or more likely Gemini by that point). The devices will still work as a regular dumb thermostat to control temperature, and scheduling will remain accessible from the thermostat's screen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-ending-support-for-older-nest-thermostats-will-stop-selling-nests-in-europe/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Ars chats with physicist and science journalist Adam Becker about his new book, <em>More Everything Forever</em>.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's long been the stuff of science fiction: humans achieving immortality by uploading their consciousness into a silicon virtual paradise, ruled over by a benevolent super-intelligent AI. Or maybe one dreams of leaving a dying Earth to colonize Mars or other distant planets. It's a tantalizing visionary future that has been embraced by tech billionaires in particular. But is that future truly the utopian ideal, or something potentially darker? And are those goals even scientifically feasible?</p>
<p>These are the kinds of questions astrophysicist and science journalist Adam Becker poses in his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/More-Everything-Forever-Overlords-Humanity/dp/1541619595"><em>More Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley's Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanit</em></a>y. Becker's widely praised first book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Real-Unfinished-Meaning-Quantum/dp/0465096050"><em>What Is Real?</em></a>, focused on competing interpretations of quantum mechanics and questioned the long dominance of the so-called Copenhagen interpretation championed by Niels Bohr, among other luminaries. This time around, he's tackling Silicon Valley's far-reaching ideas about the future, which have moved out of online subcultures and into mainstream culture, including our political discourse.</p>
<p>"It seemed like it was only going to become more relevant and someone needed to speak out about it, and I didn't see enough people connecting the dots in a way that looked right to me," Becker told Ars. "One current critique of Silicon Valley is that they moved fast and broke democracy and institutional norms. That's true. Another is that they're contemptuous of government, and I think that's true, too. But there wasn't much critique of their visions of the future, maybe because not enough people realized they meant it. Even among Silicon Valley critics, there was this idea that at the very least, you could trust that the statements they made about science and technology were true because they were experts in science and technology. That's not the case."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/youre-not-going-to-mars-and-you-wont-live-forever-exploding-silicon-valleys-ideology/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nearly a year after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-new-recall-feature-will-record-everything-you-do-on-your-pc/">announcing the feature</a>, Microsoft is finally ready to roll the controversial Windows Recall feature out to the general public, the company announced today on <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=179689">its Windows Experience Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Only available on Copilot+ PCs, a subset of Windows 11 systems sold within the last year or so, Recall takes continuous screenshots of everything you do on your PC, saving them, scraping text from them, and saving it all in a searchable database. This obviously has major security and privacy implications—anyone who can get access to your Recall database can see nearly everything you've done on your PC—which is why Microsoft's initial rollout attempt was such a mess.</p>
<p>Recall's long road to release involved a rushed initial almost-launch, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned/">harsh criticism</a> of its (then mostly nonexistent) security protections, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/microsoft-delays-data-scraping-recall-feature-again-commits-to-public-beta-test/">multiple</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-delays-rollout-of-the-windows-11-recall-feature-yet-again/">delays</a>, a major under-the-hood <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/microsoft-details-security-privacy-overhaul-for-windows-recall-ahead-of-relaunch/">overhaul</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsofts-controversial-recall-scraper-is-finally-entering-public-preview/">five months of testing</a> in Microsoft's Windows Insider beta program. Microsoft signaled that Recall was nearly ready for release two weeks ago when it came to the near-final <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/04/10/releasing-windows-11-build-26100-3902-to-the-release-preview-channel/">Release Preview channel</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/microsoft-rolls-windows-recall-out-to-the-public-nearly-a-year-after-announcing-it/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Router maker TP-Link is facing a criminal antitrust investigation into whether it engaged in predatory pricing, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/router-maker-tp-link-faces-us-criminal-antitrust-investigation">Bloomberg reported</a> yesterday. TP-Link was already facing government scrutiny over its ties to China.</p>
<p>"The US is conducting a criminal antitrust investigation into pricing strategies by TP-Link Systems Inc., a California-based router maker with links to China whose equipment now dominates the American market, according to people familiar with the matter," Bloomberg wrote. "Beyond pricing, a focus of the inquiry is also whether the company's growing US market share represents a threat to national security... The scrutiny began in late 2024 under the Biden administration and has continued under President Donald Trump."</p>
<p>Justice Department prosecutors are investigating whether TP-Link engaged in a predatory pricing scheme that "involves selling goods below cost in order to gain market share before raising prices once competitors have either been hobbled or eliminated," the report said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/tp-links-low-router-prices-and-china-ties-reportedly-spark-us-investigation/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Transportation issued revised rules for autonomous and partially automated vehicles on Thursday. Despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/ev-subsidies-out-new-import-tariffs-in-how-trumps-win-affects-autos/">fears</a> that the Trump administration would roll back safety regulations as it has for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-trumps-epa-hopes-to-avoid-greenhouse-gas-regulations/">air</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/after-trump-killed-a-report-on-nature-researchers-push-ahead-with-release/">water</a> standards, crashes involving autonomous or partially automated vehicles must still be reported to the government. And now, domestic autonomous vehicle developers will be able to benefit from exemptions previously only offered to foreign companies.</p>
<p>"This administration understands that we're in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher," said US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement. "As part of DOT's innovation agenda, our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard that spurs innovation and prioritizes safety," Duffy said.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2025-04/third-amended-SGO-2021-01_2025.pdf">is keeping its Standing General Order</a>, which requires manufacturers of autonomous or partially automated vehicles to report crashes that occur with such systems on public roads. Crashes using either autonomous driving systems or a partially automated system like GM's Super Cruise or Tesla's Autopilot must be reported within 10 days if anyone involved was killed or taken to hospital, if a vulnerable road user was hit, if the airbags deployed, or if the vehicle had to be towed away from the crash.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/feds-ease-rules-for-autonomous-vehicle-testing-to-compete-with-china/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ironically, our present AI age has shone a bright spotlight on the immense value of human creativity as breakthroughs in technology threaten to undermine it. As tech giants rush to build newer AI models, their web crawlers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/">vacuum up</a> creative content, and those same models <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-slop-is-a-brute-force-attack-on-the-algorithms-that-control-reality/">spew floods</a> of synthetic media, risking drowning out the human creative spark in an ocean of pablum.</p>
<p>Given this trajectory, AI-generated content may soon exceed the entire corpus of historical human creative works, making the preservation of the human creative ecosystem not just an ethical concern but an urgent imperative. The alternative is nothing less than a gradual homogenization of our cultural landscape, where machine learning flattens the richness of human expression into a mediocre statistical average.</p>
<h2>A limited resource</h2>
<p>By ingesting billions of creations, chatbots learn to talk, and image synthesizers learn to draw. Along the way, the AI companies behind them treat our shared culture like an inexhaustible resource to be strip-mined, with little thought for the consequences.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/in-the-age-of-ai-we-must-protect-human-creativity-as-a-natural-resource/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.41 of the Rocket Report! NASA and its contractors at Kennedy Space Center in Florida continue building a new mobile launch tower for the Space Launch System Block 1B rocket, a taller, upgraded version of the SLS rocket being used for the agency's initial Artemis lunar missions. Workers <a href="https://x.com/NASAGroundSys/status/1913193375236338167">stacked another segment</a> of the tower a couple of weeks ago, and the structure is inching closer to its full height of 355 feet (108 meters). But this is just the start. Once the tower is fully assembled, it must be outfitted with miles of cabling, tubing, and piping and then be tested before it can support an SLS launch campaign. Last year, NASA's inspector general projected the tower won't be ready for a launch until the spring of 2029, and its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasas-second-large-launch-tower-has-gotten-stupidly-expensive/">costs could reach $2.7 billion</a>. The good news, if you can call it that, is that there probably won't be an SLS Block 1B rocket that needs to use it in 2029, whether it's due to delays or cancellation.</p>

<p><b>Fresh details on Astra's strategic pivot. </b>Astra, the once high-flying rocket startup that crashed back to Earth with investors before going private last year, has unveiled new details about its $44 million contract with the Department of Defense, <a href="https://spacenews.com/astra-targets-cargo-delivery-with-rocket-4-in-pentagon-backed-plan/">Space News reports</a>. The DOD contract announced last year supports the development of Rocket 4, a two-stage, mobile launch vehicle with ambitions to deliver cargo across the globe in under an hour. While Astra's ill-fated Rocket 3 focused on launching small satellites into low-Earth orbit, Astra wants to make Rocket 4 a military utility vehicle. Rocket 4 will still be able to loft conventional satellites, but Astra's most lucrative contract for the new launch vehicle involves using the rocket for precise point-to-point delivery of up to 1,300 pounds (590 kilograms) of supplies from orbit via specialized reentry vehicles. The military has shown interest in developing a rocket-based rapid global cargo delivery system for several years, and it has a contract with SpaceX to study how the much larger Starship rocket could do a similar job.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/rocket-report-the-pitfalls-of-rideshare-china-launches-next-tiangong-crew/">Read full article</a></p>
