                            <![CDATA[<p>The release of Google's Veo 3 video generator in May represented a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">disconcerting leap in AI video quality</a>. While many of the viral AI videos we've seen are harmless fun, the model's pixel-perfect output can also be used for nefarious purposes. On TikTok, which may or may not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/supreme-court-rules-tiktok-can-be-banned/">be banned</a> in the coming months, users have noticed a surplus of racist AI videos, courtesy of Google's Veo 3.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/tiktok/racist-ai-generated-videos-are-newest-slop-garnering-millions-views-tiktok">MediaMatters</a>, numerous TikTok accounts have started posting AI-generated videos that use racist and antisemitic tropes in recent weeks. Most of the AI vitriol is aimed at Black people, depicting them as "the usual suspects" in crimes, absent parents, and monkeys with an affinity for watermelon. The content also targets immigrants and Jewish people. The videos top out at eight seconds and bear the "Veo" watermark, confirming they came from Google's leading AI model.</p>
<p>The compilation video below has examples pulled from TikTok since the release of Veo 3, but be warned, it contains racist and antisemitic content. Some of the videos are shocking, which is likely the point—nothing drives engagement on social media like anger and drama. MediaMatters reports that the original posts have numerous comments echoing the stereotypes used in the video.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/racist-ai-videos-created-with-google-veo-3-are-proliferating-on-tiktok/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Type Ia supernovae are critical tools in astronomy, since they all appear to explode with the same intensity, allowing us to use their brightness as a measure of distance. The distance measures they've given us have been critical to tracking the expansion of the Universe, which led to the recognition that there's some sort of dark energy hastening the Universe's expansion. Yet there are ongoing arguments over exactly how these events are triggered.</p>
<p>There's widespread agreement that type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarf stars. Normally, these stars are composed primarily of moderately heavy elements like carbon and oxygen, and lack the mass to trigger additional fusion. But if some additional material is added, the white dwarf can reach a critical mass and reignite a runaway fusion reaction, blowing the star apart. But the source of the additional mass has been somewhat controversial.</p>
<p>But there's an additional hypothesis that doesn't require as much mass: a relatively small explosion on a white dwarf's surface can compress the interior enough to restart fusion in stars that haven't yet reached a critical mass. Now, observations of the remains of a supernova provide some evidence of the existence of these so-called "double detonation" supernovae.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/new-evidence-that-some-supernovae-may-be-a-double-detonation/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There is increasing consumer demand for low- or non-alcoholic beers, and science is helping improve both the brewing process and the flavor profiles of the final product. One promising approach to better non-alcoholic beer involves substituting barley malt with milled rice, according to two recent papers—<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10942912.2025.2520907">one published</a> in the International Journal of Food Properties and the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03610470.2025.2499768">other published</a> in the Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists.</p>
<p>The chemistry of brewing beer is a very active area of research. For instance, earlier this year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/pea-sugars-can-speed-up-sour-beer-brewing/">we reported</a> on Norwegian scientists who <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.4c06748">discovered that</a> sour beers made with the sugars found in peas, beans, and lentils had similar flavor profiles to your average Belgian-style sour beer, yet the brewing process was shorter, with simpler steps. The pea-sugar beers had more lactic acid, ethanol, and flavor compounds than those brewed without them, and they were rated as having fruitier flavors and higher acidity. And sensory panelists detected no trace of undesirable "bean-y" flavors that have limited the use of pea-based ingredients in the past.</p>
<p>But replacing barley malt with rice still might strike some beer aficionados as sacrilege. In Germany, "purity laws" dictate that any beverage classified as a beer—including non-alcoholic beers—must only be made from malted barley, hops, water, and yeast. This produces non-alcoholic beers that have more "worty" flavors (due to higher levels of aldehyde) than might ideally be desired. But not every country is as stringent as Germany. The US is much more flexible when it comes to selecting raw materials, including rice, for brewing beers. In fact, Arkansas <a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=hb1491&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R">just passed a bill</a> this spring creating incentives for using rice (grown in Arkansas, of course) in the production of sake and beer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/rice-could-be-key-to-brewing-better-non-alcoholic-beer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T is rolling out a protection that prevents unauthorized changes to mobile accounts as the carrier attempts to fight a costly form of account hijacking that occurs when a scammer swaps out the SIM card belonging to the account holder.</p>
<p>The technique, known as SIM swapping or port-out fraud, has been a scourge that has vexed wireless carriers and their millions of subscribers for years. An indictment filed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/sim-swapping-ring-stole-400m-in-crypto-from-a-us-company-officials-allege/">last year</a> by federal prosecutors alleged that a single SIM swap scheme netted $400 million in cryptocurrency.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It may not have escaped your attention that there's a new film about motorsport called <em>F1: The Movie</em>. It's a return-to-racing story with elements you'll have seen before, just maybe with other sports. A driver has been looking to slay his personal demons. There's a wise veteran, an impatient rookie, and an underdog team with its back to the wall. Except this time, the backdrop is the multicolored circus of Formula 1, seen close up at 200 mph.</p>
<p>Backed by Apple and made by people responsible for high-energy productions like the recent <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/top-gun-maverick-spoiler-free-review-a-worthy-return-to-the-danger-zone/">Top Gun: Maverick</a></em>, the film takes advantage of some of those same ingredients. For one, the filmmakers got an all-access pass from the powers that be, filming on the actual Formula 1 grid during 2023 and some of 2024. Having seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton as a producer helped with that. And the filmmakers were able to capture remarkable footage in the process thanks to <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/inside-f1-movie-prototype-camera-tech-director-kosinski-on-capturing-brad-pitt-damson-idris/10734623/">powerful cameras</a> that are now much smaller than the versions they strapped to some US Navy fighter jets.</p>
<p>The movie comes with a prebuilt audience, one that's grown enormously in recent years. The <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/netflixs-formula-1-drive-to-survive-finds-pressure-at-the-core-of-f1/">Drive to Survive</a></em> effect is real: Motorsport, particularly F1, hasn't been this popular in decades. More and more young people follow the sport, and it's not just among the guys, either.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/f1-the-movie-takes-motorsport-into-the-imax-age/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, OpenAI raised objections in court, hoping to overturn a court order requiring the AI company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-confronts-user-panic-over-court-ordered-retention-of-chatgpt-logs/">to retain all ChatGPT logs "indefinitely,"</a> including deleted and temporary chats.</p>
<p>But Sidney Stein, the US district judge reviewing OpenAI's request, immediately denied OpenAI's objections. He was seemingly unmoved by the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-confronts-user-panic-over-court-ordered-retention-of-chatgpt-logs/">company's claims</a> that the order forced OpenAI to abandon "long-standing privacy norms" and weaken privacy protections that users expect based on ChatGPT's terms of service. Rather, Stein suggested that OpenAI's user agreement specified that their data could be retained as part of a legal process, which Stein said is exactly what is happening now.</p>
<p>The order was issued by magistrate judge Ona Wang just days after news organizations, led by The New York Times, requested it. The news plaintiffs claimed the order was urgently needed to preserve potential evidence in their copyright case, alleging that ChatGPT users are likely to delete chats where they attempted to use the chatbot to skirt paywalls to access news content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/nyt-to-start-searching-deleted-chatgpt-logs-after-beating-openai-in-court/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CBS owner Paramount has reached a $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump over his claim that <em>60 Minutes</em> deceptively manipulated a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris. Trump's lawsuit has been widely described as frivolous, but Paramount <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/cbs-owner-ready-to-settle-trump-lawsuit-in-apparent-bid-to-get-merger-approved/">seemed motivated to settle</a> because its pending $8.4 billion merger with Skydance needed regulatory approval from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Ars today, Paramount said it "has reached an agreement in principle to resolve the lawsuit filed by President Trump and Representative [Ronny] Jackson in the Northern District of Texas and a threatened defamation action concerning a separate <em>60 Minutes</em> report."</p>
<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for a bribery investigation into Paramount. "With Paramount folding to Donald Trump at the same time the company needs his administration's approval for its billion-dollar merger, this could be bribery in plain sight," she said in a statement today. "Paramount has refused to provide answers to a congressional inquiry, so I'm calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/paramount-accused-of-bribery-as-it-settles-trump-lawsuit-for-16-million/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Medical organizations are blasting the Senate's budget bill in the wake of its narrow passage Tuesday, warning of the dystopian health care system that will arise from the $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other federal health programs if it is passed into law. The bill has moved back to the House for a vote on the Senate's changes.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/nearly-12-million-people-would-lose-health-insurance-under-senate-gop-bill/">11.8 million people would lose their health insurance</a> over the next decade due to the cuts to Medicaid and other programs. Those cuts, which are deeper than the House's version of the bill, were maintained in the Senate's final version of the bill after amendments, with few concessions.</p>
<p>Organizations representing physicians, pediatricians, medical schools, and hospitals were quick to highlight the damage the proposal could cause.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/doctors-blast-senate-bill-point-out-that-11-8m-losing-health-insurance-is-bad/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla sold 384,122 electric vehicles during the months of April, May, and June of this year.

<p>The automaker faces a number of problems that are getting in the way of that perpetual growth. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/tesla-shows-no-sign-of-improvement-in-may-sales-data/">In some regions</a>, CEO Elon Musk's right-wing politics have driven away customers in droves. Another issue is the company's small, infrequently updated model lineup, which is a problem even in parts of the world that care little about US politics.</p>
<p>Most Tesla sales are of the Model 3 midsize electric sedan and the Model Y, its electric crossover. For Q2 2025, Tesla sold 373,728 of the Models 3 and Y across North America, Europe, China, and its other markets. But that's an 11.5 percent decrease compared to the 422,405 Models 3 and Y that Tesla sold in Q2 2024, a quarter that itself saw a year-on-year decline.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-q2-2025-sales-dropped-more-than-13-year-over-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's been 23 years since the first Battlefield game, and the video game industry is nearly unrecognizable to anyone who was immersed in it then. Many people who loved the games of that era have since become frustrated with where AAA (big budget) games have ended up.</p>
<p>Today, publisher EA is in full production on the next Battlefield title—but sources close to the project say it has faced culture clashes, ballooning budgets, and major disruptions that have left many team members fearful that parts of the game will not be finished to players' satisfaction in time for launch during EA's fiscal year.</p>
<p>They also say the company has made major structural and cultural changes to how Battlefield games are created to ensure it can release titles of unprecedented scope and scale. This is all to compete with incumbents like the Call of Duty games and <em>Fortnite</em>, even though no prior Battlefield has achieved anywhere close to that level of popular and commercial success.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration plans to cancel a fleet of orbiting data relay satellites managed by the Space Development Agency and replace it with a secretive network that, so far, relies primarily on SpaceX's Starlink Internet constellation, according to budget documents.</p>
<p>The move prompted questions from lawmakers during a Senate hearing on the Space Force's budget last week. While details of the Pentagon's plan remain secret, the White House proposal would commit $277 million in funding to kick off a new program called "pLEO SATCOM" or "MILNET."</p>
<p>The funding line for a proliferated low-Earth orbit satellite communications network hasn't appeared in a Pentagon budget before, but plans for MILNET already exist in a different form. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/FY2026/FY2026_r1.pdf">budget proposal for fiscal year 2026</a> would eliminate funding for a new tranche of data relay satellites from the Space Development Agency. The pLEO SATCOM or MILNET program would replace them, providing crucial support for the Trump administration's proposed Golden Dome missile defense shield.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/pentagon-may-put-spacex-at-the-center-of-a-sensor-to-shooter-targeting-network/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has decided to let prisons and jails keep charging high prices for calling services until at least 2027, delaying implementation of rate caps approved last year when the FCC had a Democratic majority.</p>
<p>Carr's office <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/carr-acts-address-unintended-consequences-2024-ipcs-order">announced</a> the change yesterday, saying it was needed because of "negative, unintended consequences stemming from the Commission's 2024 decision on Incarcerated People's Communications Services (IPCS)... As a result of this waiver decision, the FCC's 2021 Order rate cap, site commission, and per-minute pricing rules will apply until April 1, 2027, unless the Commission sets an alternative date."</p>
<p>Commissioner Anna Gomez, the FCC's only Democrat, criticized the decision and pointed out that Congress mandated lower prices in the Martha Wright-Reed Act, which the FCC was tasked with implementing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/fcc-lets-prisons-keep-charging-high-phone-rates-delaying-new-caps-by-two-years/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine from Moderna was 27 percent more effective at preventing influenza infections than a standard flu shot, <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Positive-Phase-3-Results-for-Seasonal-Influenza-Vaccine/default.aspx">the company announced this week</a>.</p>
<p>Moderna noted that the new shot, dubbed mRNA-1010, hit the highest efficacy target that it set for the trial, which included nearly 41,000 people aged 50 and above. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either mRNA-1010 or a standard shot and were then followed for about six months during a flu season.</p>
<p>Compared to the standard shot, the mRNA vaccine had an overall vaccine efficacy that was 26.6 percent higher, and 27.4 percent higher in participants who were aged 65 years or older. Previous trial data showed that mRNA-1010 generated higher immune responses in participants than both regular standard flu shots and high-dose flu shots.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/moderna-says-its-mrna-seasonal-flu-shot-is-27-better-than-current-vaccine/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Clothoff—one of the leading apps used to quickly and cheaply make fake nudes from images of real people—reportedly is planning a global expansion to continue dominating deepfake porn online.</p>
<p>Also known as a nudify app, Clothoff has resisted attempts to unmask and confront its operators. Last August, the app was among those that San Francisco's city attorney, David Chiu, sued in hopes of forcing a shutdown. But recently, a whistleblower—who had "access to internal company information" as a former Clothoff employee—<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/using-ai-to-humiliate-women-the-men-behind-deepfake-pornography-a-0de338f9-9cec-4ae8-a5ef-9a356b0a5bd4">told the investigative outlet Der Spiegel</a> that the app's operators "seem unimpressed by the lawsuit" and instead of worrying about shutting down have "bought up an entire network of nudify apps."</p>
<p>Der Spiegel found evidence that Clothoff today owns at least 10 other nudify services, attracting "monthly views ranging between hundreds of thousands to several million." The outlet granted the whistleblower anonymity to discuss the expansion plans, which the whistleblower claimed was motivated by Clothoff employees growing "cynical" and "obsessed with money" over time as the app—which once felt like an "exciting startup"—gained momentum. Because generating convincing fake nudes can cost just a few bucks, chasing profits seemingly relies on attracting as many repeat users to as many destinations as possible.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/nudify-apps-plan-to-dominate-deepfake-porn-hinges-on-reddit-docs-show/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Nothing, a startup from OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, has announced its first flagship phone <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-hands-on-pro-repair-styling-without-the-functionality/">since 2023</a>. The company bills its new Nothing Phone 3 as a "true flagship" device, but it doesn't have the absolute best hardware you can get in a mobile device. Neither does it have the highest price, clocking in at a mere $799. That's shaping up to be a good value, but it's also the highest price yet for a Nothing phone.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, Nothing teased the end of its trademark Glyph interface. Indeed, the Nothing Phone 3 doesn't have the illuminated panels of the company's previous phones. Instead, it has a small dot "Glyph Matrix" LED screen. It's on the back in the upper right corner, opposite the camera modules. Nothing has a few quirky games and notification icons that will flash on the screen, and it can be used as a very low-fi selfie mirror. Nothing is committed to the new Glyph screen, going so far as adding a button on the back to control it.</p>
<p>The rest of the design maintains the Nothing aesthetic, featuring a clear glass panel with a visible mid-frame and screws. The phone will come in either black or white—Nothing isn't really into colors. However, the company does promise the Phone 3 will be a little more compact than the 2023 Phone 2. The new device is 18 percent thinner and has symmetrical 1.87-millimeter bezels around the 6.67-inch OLED screen. That panel supports 120 Hz refresh and has a peak brightness of 4,500 nits, which is competitive with the likes of Samsung and OnePlus.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/nothing-phone-3-arrives-july-15-with-a-tiny-dot-matrix-rear-display/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hackers working on behalf of the Iranian government are likely to target industrial control systems used at water treatment plants and other critical infrastructure to retaliate against recent military strikes by Israel and the US, federal government agencies are warning. One cybersecurity company says many US-based targets aren't adequately protected against the threat.</p>
<p>“Based on the current geopolitical environment, Iranian-affiliated cyber actors may target US devices and networks for near-term cyber operations,” an advisory jointly published by the The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, FBI, Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, and the National Security Agency stated. “Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies, particularly those possessing holdings or relationships with Israeli research and defense firms, are at increased risk.”</p>
<h2>Easy targets</h2>
<p>Of particular interest to the would-be hackers are control systems that automate industrial processes inside water treatment plants, dams, and other critical infrastructure, particularly when those systems are manufactured by Israel-based companies. Between November 2023 and January 2024, near the onset of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, federal agencies <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-335a">said</a> hackers affiliated with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps actively targeted and compromised Israeli-made programmable-logic controllers and human-machine interfaces used in multiple sectors, Including US Water and Wastewater Systems Facilities. At least 75 devices, including at least 34 in US-based water facilities, were compromised.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/feds-warn-of-possible-cyber-attacks-by-iran-on-us-critical-infrastructure/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In another sign that the Trump White House is aggressively moving to slash NASA’s science programs, dozens of mission leaders have been asked to prepare "closeout" plans by the end of next week.</p>
<p>The new directive came from NASA's senior leadership on Monday, which is acting on behalf of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Copies of these memos, which appear to vary a little by department, were reviewed by Ars. The detailed closeout plans called for must be prepared by as soon as July 9 for some missions, which has left principal investigators scrambling due to the tight deadline and the July 4 holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Projects should prepare their plans assuming closeout direction is given on October 1, 2025, one of the NASA memos states. Missions in operations—that is to say, spacecraft whizzing around the Solar System conducting science right now—should "assume closeout is complete within 3 months."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/trump-administration-moves-to-tighten-the-noose-around-nasa-science-missions/">Read full article</a></p>
