              <![CDATA[<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Last week, actor and director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck">Ben Affleck</a> shared his views on AI's role in filmmaking during the 2024 CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/delivering-alpha-2024-live-updates.html">Delivering Alpha</a> investor summit, arguing that AI models will transform visual effects but won't replace creative filmmaking anytime soon.

              <![CDATA[<p>Officials from NASA and Russia’s space agency don’t see eye to eye on the causes and risks of small but persistent air leaks on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>That was the word from the new chair of NASA's International Space Station Advisory Committee last week. The air leaks are located in the transfer tunnel of the space station's Russian Zvezda service module, one of the oldest elements of the complex.</p>
<p>US and Russian officials "don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks," said Bob Cabana, a retired NASA astronaut who took the helm of the advisory committee earlier this year. Cabana replaced former Apollo astronaut Tom Stafford, who chaired the committee before he died in March.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/nasa-roscosmos-disagree-on-risk-of-catastrophic-failure-from-iss-air-leak/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Scientists could win back trust lost during the COVID-19 pandemic if they just showed a little intellectual humility, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02060-x">study published Monday in Nature Human Behavior</a>.</p>
<p>It's no secret that scientists—and the science generally—took a hit during the health crisis. Public confidence in scientists fell from 87 percent in April 2000 to a low of 73 percent in October 2023, according to survey data from the Pew Research Center. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/">And the latest Pew data</a> released last week suggests it will be an uphill battle to regain what was lost, with confidence in scientists only rebounding three percentage points, to 76 percent in a poll from October.</p>
<h2>Building trust</h2>
<p>The new study in Nature Human Behavior may guide the way forward, though. The study encompasses five smaller studies probing the perceptions of scientists' trustworthiness, which previous research has linked to willingness to follow research-based recommendations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/nearly-half-of-us-thinks-scientists-are-smug-study-finds-humility-helps/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After Ars spent <em>Half-Life 2</em>'s 20th anniversary week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-valve-made-half-life-2-and-set-a-new-standard-for-future-games/">looking back</a> at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">game's</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/i-played-half-life-2-for-the-first-time-this-year-heres-how-it-went/">history</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/these-are-the-lasting-things-that-half-life-2-gave-us-besides-headcrabs-and-crowbars/">impact</a>, Valve marked the occasion with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">a meaty two-hour YouTube documentary</a> featuring insider memories from the team behind the game itself. Near the end of that documentary, longtime Valve watchers also get a chance to see footage of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">the long-promised but never-delivered <em>Half-Life 2: Episode 3</em></a> and hear more about what led the project to be abandoned.</p>
<p>The <em>Episode 3</em> footage included in the documentary focuses heavily on a new ice gun that would have served as the episode's main new feature. Players would have been able to use that gun to freeze enemies, set up ice walls as makeshift cover, or construct icy ledges to make their way down sheer cliff faces. The developers also describe a so-called "Silver Surfer mode" that would have let players extrude a line of ice in their path then slide along it at slippery speeds.</p>
<p>The <em>Episode 3</em> developers were also working on a new, blob-like enemy that could absorb other blobs to grow or split into segments to get around small barriers or pass through grates.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/newell-says-he-was-stumped-on-how-to-finish-half-life-2-episode-3/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Twelve-thousand years ago, people in a coastal village in the Levant used stone weights on their spindles to spin thread faster and more evenly—and, some archeologists are arguing, in the process they pioneered the basic mechanics that eventually made cart wheels possible.</p>
<p>Archaeologists found hundreds of perforated, roundish, flattish pebbles in the 12,000-year-old village of Nahal Ein-Gev II, all with neat holes drilled in their centers. Based on their uneven appearance and their varied sizes, it seemed that these weren’t beads, but spindle whorls: a flywheel-like piece that makes a drop spindle spin faster and more steadily. The find is the oldest known evidence of a newfangled textile production technology called the drop spindle. But it may also have been a distant precursor to the wheel. According to archaeologists Talia Yashuv and Leore Grosman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, drop spindles work on the same mechanical principle as the earliest wheels, which show up on carts around 6,000 years ago during the Bronze Age.</p>
<p>“Circular objects with a hollowed center connected to a bar make one of the most important inventions of all time,” write Yashuv and Grosman in their recent paper. “At the core of it all, the importance of the wheel and axle lies in a relatively simple rotational mechanism capable of transforming linear to rotary motion and vice versa.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/to-invent-the-wheel-did-people-first-have-to-invent-the-spindle/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Apple infamously ditched the headphone jack with the launch of the iPhone 7, it at least provided customers with a Lightning-to-3.5 mm adapter either right in the box or as a $9 standalone purchase in its online store. Now it looks like that adapter is being retired.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/17/lightning-to-headphone-jack-adapter-sold-out/">MacRumors</a> first noted, the adapter is showing as sold out in most regions, along with a few other Lightning accessories, like the even-more-archaic-seeming Lightning-to-VGA adapter. That includes the United States, where it is not possible to order the headphone adapter <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter?fnode=22abdf86aec87ad4299295d2f2f0204cb9d05c37dc6d76a23984321beed8a33397686a276767cbbaad263982412d5902a356939b5fbfda8b383b1f4b5347c838db921decff7658c2da1964557c8ac813ac09073be099b6e32d91e3795ff45329">from Apple's store</a>.</p>
<p>Inventory has run out, and it seems unlikely Apple will make more to refill it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/apples-headphone-adapter-for-older-iphones-sells-out-possibly-never-to-return/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I have been using the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/summarize-notifications-reduce-interruptions-mchldf5e4cb6/mac">Apple Intelligence notification summary feature</a> for a few months now, since pretty early in Apple’s beta testing process for the iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1 updates.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what that is—and the vast majority of iPhones won’t get Apple Intelligence, which only works on the iPhone 16 series and iPhone 15 Pro—these notification summaries attempt to read a stack of missed notifications from any given app and give you the gist of what they’re saying.</p>
<p>Summaries are denoted with a small icon, and when tapped, the summary notification expands into the stack of notifications you missed in the first place. They also work on iPadOS and macOS, where they're available on anything with an M1 chip or newer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-are-honestly-pretty-bad/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An AI-generated nude photo scandal has shut down a Pennsylvania private school. On Monday, classes were canceled after parents forced leaders to either resign or face a lawsuit potentially seeking criminal penalties and accusing the school of skipping mandatory reporting of the harmful images.</p>
<p>The outcry erupted after a single student created sexually explicit AI images of nearly 50 female classmates at Lancaster Country Day School, Lancaster Online <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/lancaster-country-day-parents-take-first-step-in-suing-school-leaders-over-deepfakes-of-students/article_bfb6066e-a2c7-11ef-af86-df31e3bc5b86.html">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Head of School Matt Micciche seemingly first learned of the problem in November 2023, when a student anonymously reported the explicit deepfakes through a school portal run by the state attorney’s general office called "Safe2Say Something." But Micciche allegedly did nothing, allowing more students to be targeted for months until police were tipped off in mid-2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/school-failed-to-report-ai-nudes-of-kids-for-months-now-parents-are-suing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113501214659806466">announced last night</a> that he will make Brendan Carr the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Carr, who wrote a chapter about the FCC for the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, is a longtime opponent of net neutrality rules and other regulations imposed on Internet service providers.</p>
<p>Although Carr wants to deregulate telecom companies that the FCC has historically regulated, he wants the FCC to start regulating Big Tech and social media firms. He has also echoed Trump's longtime complaints about the news media and proposed punishments for broadcast networks.</p>
<p>Trump's statement on Carr said that "because of his great work, I will now be designating him as permanent Chairman."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trumps-fcc-chair-is-brendan-carr-who-wants-to-regulate-everyone-except-isps/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Putting out a joke product on April Fools' Day can sometimes be a clever way to quietly gauge the reaction to a wild idea without having to really commit to it.</p>
<p>Nerdish purveyor ThinkGeek did this a few times with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/10/thinkgeek-8-bit-tie-ships/">the 8-bit tie</a> and the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/04/tauntaun-sleepi/">Tauntaun sleeping bag</a>. <em>Pokemon Go</em> crystallized in some ways from <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/googles-april-fools-prank-puts-pokemon-in-the-real-world/">a Google Maps joke</a>. And just recently, PC case-maker SilverStone has decided that so many people were into <a href="https://x.com/SilverStoneJP/status/1641817673616216065/photo/1">its beige-tastic FLP01 case idea</a>, tossed onto X (formerly Twitter) late on March 31 Tokyo time, that it will now release it in early 2025 in Japan for the USD equivalent of $130.</p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Over the past decade, spurred on by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/06/high-tech-hybrids-are-2014s-hottest-race-cars/">series like Formula 1 and the World Endurance Championship</a>, the world of motorsport began to embrace hybrid powertrains. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In addition to being a sport and entertainment, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/11/the-golden-age-tech-speeds-from-racetrack-to-road-faster-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racing also serves as a testbed for new vehicle technologies</a>, having pioneered innovations we now take for granted, like seat belts, windshield wipers, and rearview mirrors.</span> But that dalliance with electrification may be nearing its end as two high-profile series announce they're ditching batteries and electric motors starting next year in favor of sustainable fuels instead.</p>
<p>Formula 1 first officially allowed hybrid power in 2009, and by 2014, the series' rules required every car to sport a pair of complex and costly energy-recovery systems. The more road-relevant discipline of sports prototypes also began dabbling with electrified powertrains around the same time, with the first win for a hybrid car at Le Mans coming in 2012.</p>
<p>The budgets involved for those programs were extravagant, though. Until it instituted a cost cap, F1 team budgets stretched to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. In endurance racing, Audi and Porsche spent comparable amounts on their hybrid WEC campaigns, and while Toyota managed to make do with much less, even it was spending more than $80 million a year in the mid-2010s.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/racing-turns-its-back-on-heavy-expensive-hybrids-for-sustainable-fuel/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>So far, all of the cargo bikes we've tested have been what are called "long tails," which means the frame is extended out past the seat, moving the rear wheel back and creating a space for cargo or extra passengers. Based on my experience, they're the most common form of cargo bike on US roads. But they're not the only game in town. Bakfiets, or front-loaders, extend the other end, moving the front wheel forward to create space for a substantial cargo area.</p>
<p>For the last few weeks, we've been testing a front-loader <a href="https://urbanarrow.com/en-na/family/">called the Family</a> from Urban Arrow, a Dutch manufacturer that's a sister company to Gazelle. Everything Ars' Kevin Purdy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/gazelle-eclipse-c380-e-bike-review-a-smart-smooth-ride-at-a-halting-price/">wrote about the Gazelle</a> bike he tested applies here. The Urban Arrow is stylish and incredibly well thought out, and it uses some interesting tech extremely effectively. And it has the added bonus of being able to haul a surprising amount of cargo. If you can get used to the price (starting at $6,000) and the small front wheel being an appreciable distance from the handlebars you use to steer it, it's a fantastic choice.</p>
<h2>Taking a back seat</h2>
<p>There are a number of nice things about a front-loader design compared to a long tail. For one, the distance between the cranks and the rear wheel is typical of other bikes, meaning you don't need an extra-long chain. With no competition for space between the rear wheel and cargo, the rear wheel is also a normal size. This helps with the feel of the bike's handling and could theoretically allow the front-loader to use more standard parts for easier service. That's not entirely the case with the Family, however, as Urban Arrow went with a belt drive and internally geared hub (more on that below).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/urban-arrows-front-loader-is-a-stylish-functional-cargo-kid-hauler/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last year <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/ancient-egyptian-followers-of-a-deity-called-bes-may-have-used-hallucinogens/">we reported</a> on preliminary research suggesting that ancient Egyptians may have used hallucinogens in their religious rituals, based on the presence of a few key chemical signatures taken from a ceremonial mug. Now those researchers have extended their analysis and fully identified the chemical components of those samples, confirming those preliminary findings, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78721-8">new paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includes not just ancient Egypt but also ancient Greek, Vedic, Maya, Inca, and Aztec cultures. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urarina">Urarina</a> people who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca">ayahuasca</a> in their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have also been known to participate.</p>
<p>Last year, David Tanasi, of the University of South Florida, posted <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3000218/v1">a preprint</a> on his preliminary analysis of a ceremonial mug decorated with the head of Bes, a popular deity believed to confer protection on households, especially mothers and children. So unlike most other Egyptian deities, images of Bes were quite common in Egyptian homes. There were even special chambers built to honor Bes and his wife, Beset, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqqara">Saqqara</a> site near Cairo, which Egyptologists think could have been used for fertility or healing rituals, although their exact purpose is not certain (Bes was an ancient Egyptian deity of protection, fertility, healing, and purification). The mug is part of the collection of the Tampa Museum of Art.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/study-confirms-egyptians-likely-used-hallucinogens-in-rituals/">Read full article</a></p>

Based on the trilogy by novelist Hugh Howey, <em>Silo </em>was one of the more refreshing surprises on streaming television in 2023: a twist-filled combination of political thriller and police procedural set in a post-apocalyptic world. It looks like S2 will be leaning more heavily into sci-fi thriller territory, expanding its storytelling—and its striking cinematography—beyond the original silo.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below as well as first five minutes of S2 premiere.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/rebellion-brews-underground-in-silo-s2-trailer/">previously reported</a>, <em>Silo</em> is set in a self-sustaining underground city inhabited by a community whose recorded history only goes back 140 years, generations after the silo was built by the founders. Outside is a toxic hellscape that is only visible on big screens in the silo's topmost level. Inside, 10,000 people live together under a pact: Anyone who says they want to "go out" is immediately granted that wish—cast outside in an environment suit on a one-way trip to clean the cameras. But those who make that choice inevitably die soon after because of the toxic environment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/silo-s2-expands-its-dystopian-world/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>It's </em>Half-Life 2<em> week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of </em>Half-Life 2<em>—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>“Well, I just hate the idea that our games might waste people’s time. Why spend four years of your life building something that isn't innovative and is basically pointless?”</p>
<p>Valve software founder Gabe Newell is quoted by Geoff Keighley—yes, the Game Awards guy, back then a GameSpot writer—as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/"><span class="s2">saying this in June 1999</span></a>, six months after the original <i>Half-Life</i> launched. Newell gave his team no real budget or deadline, only the assignment to “follow up the best PC game of all time” and redefine the genre.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/these-are-the-lasting-things-that-half-life-2-gave-us-besides-headcrabs-and-crowbars/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX's Starlink Internet satellites are responsible for more and more public reports of unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAPs), but most recent cases remain unsolved, according to a US government report released Thursday.</p>
<p>Starlinks often move across the sky in "trains" that appear like gleaming gems in the blackness of space. They are particularly visible to the naked eye shortly after each Starlink launch.</p>
<p>In recent years, leaks and disclosures from government officials have revitalized open discussion about mysterious lights and objects, some of which move in, to put it bluntly, unquestionably weird ways. Some of these images, particularly those from sophisticated instruments on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tic-tac-ufo-sighting-uap-video-dave-fravor-alex-dietrich-navy-fighter-pilots-house-testimony/">military fighter jets</a>, have made their way into the national discourse. The New Yorker, Ars' sister publication, has a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/10/how-the-pentagon-started-taking-ufos-seriously">thorough report</a> on how UAPs—you might know them better as UFOs—became mainstream.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/a-lot-of-people-are-mistaking-elon-musks-starlink-satellites-for-uaps/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A 7-year-old launch company that has yet to have a rocket successfully lift off announced a radical pivot on Thursday. Its new plan? Focusing on missile defense.</p>
<p>The founder and president of ABL Space Systems, Dan Piemont, announced the decision <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7263027934611812352/">on LinkedIn</a>, adding, "We're consolidating our operational footprint and parting ways with some talented members of our team." He said companies interested in hiring great people in Los Angeles or Mojave, California, should reach out.</p>
<h2>A bright beginning</h2>
<p>With a background in economics and physics, Piemont founded ABL in 2017 with the aim of developing a ship-and-shoot rocket. The idea was to set up mobile ground systems in remote locations on short notice and launch on demand for the US military and other customers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/citing-decreasing-launch-opportunities-abl-space-will-pivot-to-missile-defense/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to launch an investigation into anti-competitive practices at Microsoft’s cloud computing business, as the US regulator continues to pursue Big Tech in the final weeks of Joe Biden’s presidency.</p>
<p>The FTC is examining allegations that Microsoft is abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to competitors’ platforms, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>Tactics being examined include substantially increasing subscription fees for those that leave, charging steep exit fees, and allegedly making its Office 365 products incompatible with rival clouds, they added.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ftc-to-launch-investigation-into-microsofts-cloud-business/">Read full article</a></p>
