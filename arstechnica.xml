<p>Welcome to Edition 7.07 of the Rocket Report! SpaceX has not missed a beat since the Federal Aviation Administration gave the company a green light to resume Falcon 9 launches after a failure last month. In 19 days, SpaceX has launched 10 flights of the Falcon 9 rocket, taking advantage of all three of its Falcon 9 launch pads. This is a remarkable cadence in its own right, but even though it's a small sample size, it is especially impressive right out of the gate after the rocket's grounding.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>A quick turnaround for Rocket Lab. </b>Rocket Lab launched its 52nd Electron rocket on August 11 from its private spaceport on Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand, <a href="https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-launches-capella-space-sar-satellite/">Space News reports</a>. The company's light-class Electron rocket deployed a small radar imaging satellite into a mid-inclination orbit for Capella Space. This was the shortest turnaround between two Rocket Lab missions from its primary launch base in New Zealand, coming less than nine days after an Electron rocket took off from the same pad with a radar imaging satellite for the Japanese company Synspective. Capella's Acadia 3 satellite was originally supposed to launch in July, but Capella requested a delay to perform more testing of its spacecraft. Rocket Lab swapped its place in the Electron launch sequence and launched the Synspective mission first.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043638#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043638&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In the first round of direct price negotiations between Medicare and drug manufacturers, prices for 10 expensive and commonly used drugs saw price cuts between 38 percent to 79 percent compared to their 2023 list prices, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-lower-prices-for-first-ten-drugs-selected-for-medicare-price-negotiation-to-lower-costs-for-millions-of-americans/">the White House</a> and the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/15/historic-first-biden-harris-administration-successfully-negotiates-medicare-drug-prices-delivers-promise-lower-prescription-drug-costs-american-seniors.html">US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a> announced Thursday. The new negotiated prices will take effect on January 1, 2026.</p>
<p>The 10 drugs that were up for negotiations are used to treat various conditions, from diabetes, psoriasis, blood clots, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease to blood cancers. About 9 million people with Medicare use at least one of the drugs on the list. In 2023, the 10 drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending, or about 20 percent of total gross spending by Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. But in 2018, spending on the 10 drugs was just about $20 billion, rising to 46 billion in 2022—a 134 percent rise. In 2022, Medicare enrollees collectively paid $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs for these drugs.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices.jpg"><img alt="The 10 drugs as well as their use, 2023 costs, negotiated prices, and savings." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices-640x309.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices-1280x617.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/negotiated-prices.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">The 10 drugs as well as their use, 2023 costs, negotiated prices, and savings.</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/3e8abec86039ac0ed674a8c5fac492e3/price-change-over-time-brief.pdf">HHS</a>)</p></div>
<p>For now, it's unclear how much the newly set prices will actually save those who have Medicare enrollees in 2026. Overall costs and out-of-pocket costs will depend on each member's coverage plans and other drug spending. Additionally, in 2025, Medicare Part D enrollees will have their out-of-pocket drug costs capped at $2,000, which alone could significantly lower costs for some beneficiaries before the negotiated prices take effect.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043687#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043687&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You can now play the original <em>Diablo</em> (and its expansion, <em>Hellfire</em>) in virtually any web browser on any computer with generally excellent performance and operating-as-expected controls. It's all thanks to an open source project published on GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb">Diabloweb</a> that's now being <a href="https://x.com/iequalshane/status/1823357647673868408">circulated</a> by game developers on X.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> in the project's GitHub repository, the project's developer (d07RiV) notes that it is based on <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX">DevilutionX</a>, another open source project that did a lot of legwork to make <em>Diablo</em> run well on modern operating systems.</p>
<p>"I've modified the code to remove all dependencies and exposed the minimal required interface with JS, allowing the game to be compiled into WebAssembly," writes d07RiV. "Event handling (especially in the menus) had to be modified significantly to fit the JS model."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043640#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043640&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here at Ars, we're always on the lookout for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">hints</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">actions</a> that suggest the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">long</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/10/half-life-2-episode-3-may-not-see-release-until-2010/">long wait</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/valves-newell-explains-continuing-silence-on-next-half-life/"><em>Half-Life 3</em></a> may eventually come to an end. So when users across the Internet started making note of the mysterious and intriguingly named <a href="https://blackmesa.com/">BlackMesa.com</a> recently, our ears perked up for signs of a new promotional <a href="https://arstechnica.com/technopaedia/2008/05/alternate-reality-game/">alternate reality game</a> (ARG).</p>
<p>Alas, this seems like yet another false alarm. BlackMesa.com is simply the website for Black Mesa, which <a href="https://blackmesa.com/resonance-cascades">confirmed in a public statement</a> that it is "actually a real company in the Boston area... working hard to assure and secure vaccine and other biological manufacturing production."</p>

<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon are urging telecom regulators to reject a key part of SpaceX's plan to offer cellular service with T-Mobile, claiming the satellite system will interfere with and degrade service for terrestrial mobile broadband networks.</p>
<p>Filings urging the Federal Communications Commission to deny SpaceX's request for a waiver were submitted by <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1081242986780/1">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1081205395437/1">Verizon</a> this week.

<p>SpaceX and T-Mobile plan to offer Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) for T-Mobile's cellular network using SpaceX satellites.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Kei cars are the antithesis of the big American SUV. Where EPA regulations effectively penalize automakers for building smaller, more efficient cars, Japan's Kei car regulations cap size, weight, and power to just fractions. Kei cars aren't just small, they're also pretty cheap, a fact that has made them a sales success in Japan and highly desirable as a gray-market import, particularly by people who think new cars have gotten too large, too complicated, and too expensive. A few years ago, Ars even wrote a guide on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/a-beginners-guide-to-the-world-of-weird-and-wonderful-japanese-import-cars/">how to go about importing one from Japan</a>.</p>
<p>But not everyone is a fan of the diminutive Kei import. As far as <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/importing-vehicle/importation-and-certification-faqs">the federal government</a> is concerned, as long as it's more than 25 years old, an imported car does not have to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards or fuel economy standards; just makes sure <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/importing-car">you pay all your import duties</a>.</p>
<p>That's because the federal government doesn't license vehicles to operate on public roads. That task belongs to the individual states, and increasingly, they are giving Kei cars the thumbs down—sometimes even in cases where previously those cars posed no problem.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043630#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043630&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google's Threat Analysis Group <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/iranian-backed-group-steps-up-phishing-campaigns-against-israel-us/">confirmed Wednesday</a> that they observed a threat actor backed by the Iranian government targeting Google accounts associated with US presidential campaigns, in addition to stepped-up attacks on Israeli targets.</p>
<p>APT42, associated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, "consistently targets high-profile users in Israel and the US," the Threat Analysis Group (TAG) writes. The Iranian group uses hosted malware, phishing pages, malicious redirects, and other tactics to gain access to Google, Dropbox, OneDrive, and other cloud-based accounts. Google's TAG writes that it reset accounts, sent warnings to users, and blacklisted domains associated with APT42's phishing attempts.</p>
<p>Among APT42's tools were Google Sites pages that appeared to be a petition from legitimate Jewish activists, calling on Israel to mediate its ongoing conflict with Hamas. The page was fashioned from image files, not HTML, and an ngrok redirect sent users to phishing pages when they moved to sign the petition.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043545#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043545&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Some 66 million years ago, an errant asteroid wiped out three-quarters of all plant and animal species on Earth, most notably taking down the dinosaurs. That has long been the scientific consensus. However, three years ago, Harvard astronomers offered an alternative hypothesis: The culprit may have been a fragment of a comet thrown off-course by Jupiter's gravity and ripped apart by the Sun.</p>
<p>Now an international team of scientists have reaffirmed the original hypothesis, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk4868">new paper</a> published in the journal Science. They analyzed ruthenium isotopes from the Chicxulub impact crater and concluded the impact was due to a carbonaceous-type asteroid, likely hailing from beyond Jupiter.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/astronomers-a-comet-fragment-not-an-asteroid-killed-off-the-dinosaurs/">previously reported</a>, the <a href="http://doc.rero.ch/record/210367/files/PAL_E4389.pdf">most widely accepted explanation</a> for what triggered that catastrophic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event">mass extinction</a> is known as the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis">Alvarez hypothesis</a>," after the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his geologist son, Walter. In 1980, they proposed that the extinction event may have been caused by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor">massive asteroid or comet</a> hitting the Earth. They based this conclusion on their analysis of sedimentary layers at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_boundary">Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary</a> (the K-Pg boundary, formerly known as the K-T boundary) found all over the world, which included unusually high concentrations of iridium—a metal more commonly found in asteroids than on Earth. (That same year, Dutch geophysicist Jan Smit independently arrived at a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/285198a0" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/285198a0" data-ml-id="1" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1723730874929ahj" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1723730874929ahj">similar conclusion</a>.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043481#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043481&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Progress cargo supply spacecraft launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan early on Thursday, local time. The mission was successful, and Russia has launched hundreds of these spacecraft before. So it wasn't all that big of a deal, except for one small detail: This was just Russia's ninth orbital launch of the year.</p>
<p>At this pace, it appears that the country's space program is on pace for the fewest number of Russian or Soviet space launches in a year since 1961. That was when Yuri Gagarin went to space at the dawn of the human spaceflight era.</p>
<p>There are myriad reasons for this, including a decision by Western space powers to distance themselves from the Russian space corporation, Roscosmos, after the invasion of Ukraine. This has had disastrous effects on the Russian space program, but only recently have we gotten any insight into how deep those impacts have cut.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043549#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043549&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Neural processing units (NPUs) are becoming commonplace in chips from Intel and AMD after several years of being something you'd find mostly in smartphones and tablets (and Macs). But as more companies push to do more generative AI processing, image editing, and chatbot-ing locally on-device instead of in the cloud, being able to measure NPU performance will become more important to people making purchasing decisions.</p>

<p>Enter Primate Labs, developers of <a href="https://www.geekbench.com/">Geekbench</a>. The main Geekbench app is designed to test CPU performance as well as GPU compute performance, but for the last few years, the company has been experimenting with a side project called <a href="https://www.geekbench.com/blog/2023/12/geekbench-ml-06/">Geekbench ML</a> (for "Machine Learning") to test the inference performance of NPUs. Now, as Microsoft's Copilot+ initiative gets off the ground and Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple all push to boost NPU performance, Primate Labs is bumping Geekbench ML to version 1.0 and renaming it "Geekbench AI," a change that will presumably help it ride the wave of AI-related buzz.</p>
<p>"Just as CPU-bound workloads vary in how they can take advantage of multiple cores or threads for performance scaling (necessitating both single-core and multi-core metrics in most related benchmarks), AI workloads cover a range of precision levels, depending on the task needed and the hardware available," wrote Primate Labs' John Poole in <a href="https://www.geekbench.com/blog/">a blog post about the update</a>. "Geekbench AI presents its summary for a range of workload tests accomplished with single-precision data, half-precision data, and quantized data, covering a variety used by developers in terms of both precision and purpose in AI systems."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043053#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043053&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kim Dotcom has lost yet another ruling in his attempt to avoid extradition from New Zealand to the United States, over a dozen years after the file-sharing site Megaupload was shut down. But he hasn't run out of appeal options yet.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a government spokesperson confirmed that New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith signed an extradition order for Dotcom, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/kim-dotcom-be-extradited-new-zealand-after-12-year-fight-with-us-2024-08-15/">according to Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>"I have received extensive advice from the Ministry of Justice on this matter," Goldsmith said in a statement quoted by numerous news organizations. "I considered all of the information carefully and have decided that Mr. Dotcom should be surrendered to the US to face trial. As is common practice, I have allowed Mr. Dotcom a short period of time to consider and take advice on my decision. I will not, therefore, be commenting further at this stage."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043563#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043563&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sonos is laying off about 100 people, the company confirmed on Wednesday. The news comes as Sonos is expecting to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/app-redesign-blowback-will-cost-sonos-up-to-30-million-ceo-says/">spend $20 million to $30 million</a> in the short term to repair the damage from its poorly received app update.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220357/sonos-layoffs-august-2024-app">The Verge</a>, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We made the difficult decision to say goodbye to approximately 100 team members representing 6 percent of the company. This action was a difficult, but necessary, measure to ensure continued, meaningful investment in Sonos’ product roadmap while setting Sonos up for long term success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sonos reported having 1,844 people in October 2022, per <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/sonos-layoffs-company-cuts-7percent-or-about-130-employees.html">CNBC</a>. The company also announced layoffs of about 130 people (or 7 percent of its workforce) in June 2023 due to “continued headwinds,” according to Spence. In 2020, Sonos <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1314727/000131472720000032/a8-kitem205filed6x24x2.htm">laid off</a> 12 percent of its employees, which was estimated to be about 174 people.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043533#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043533&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel is partnering with Karma Automotive to develop an all-new computing platform for vehicles. The new software-defined vehicle architecture should first appear in a high-end electric coupe from Karma in 2026. But the partners have bigger plans for this architecture, with talk of open standards and working with other automakers also looking to make the leap into the software-defined future.</p>
<h2>One function per box</h2>
<p>Electronics started showing up in vehicles in the 1970s, beginning originally with a little black box called an engine control unit. Soon, more black boxes started appearing, each with a discrete function. Some of these govern vehicle dynamics, like traction control, anti-lock brakes, stability control, and so on. Some take care of vehicle comfort—the air conditioning or electric windows, for example. And more powerful black boxes enable the infotainment system or any advanced driver assistance systems.</p>
<p>In a modern car, there <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/throw-out-all-those-black-boxes-and-say-hello-to-the-software-defined-car/">can be more than two hundred discrete control units</a>, each adding weight not just from itself but also from the copper cabling that connects it to the rest of the car's electronic network.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043501#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043501&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With no consensus on the safety of the Starliner crew capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday they need another week or two before deciding whether to bring two astronauts back to Earth on Boeing's spacecraft or extend their stay on the International Space Station until next year.</p>
<p>Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, stricken by suspect thrusters and helium leaks, is taking up a valuable parking spot at the space station. It needs to depart the orbiting research complex, with or without its two-person crew, before the launch of SpaceX's next Dragon crew mission to the station, scheduled for September 24.</p>
<p>"We can juggle things and make things work if we need to extend, but it’s getting a lot harder," said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of NASA's spaceflight operations directorate. "With the consumables we’re using, with the need for the use of the ports for cargo missions, those types of things, we’re reaching a point where that last week in August, we really should be making a call, if not sooner.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043356#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043356&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Nearly two years after the release of the first Ryzen 7000 CPUs, AMD has returned with a full-fledged follow-up. The new Ryzen 9000 chips—the 6-core 9600X, 8-core 9700X, 12-core 9900X, and 16-core 9950X—bring AMD's new Zen 5 architecture to the desktop a couple of weeks after it launched in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/ryzen-ai-300-performance-review-impressive-cpus-even-if-you-dont-care-about-ai/">the Ryzen AI chips for laptops</a>.</p>

<p>We came away from the cumbersomely named Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 impressed by both its performance and its power efficiency, and AMD is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/amd-makes-improved-efficiency-a-core-part-of-the-pitch-for-its-ryzen-9000-cpus/">also leaning into power efficiency</a> as a key selling point of the Ryzen 9000 series. Three of the chips have seen their power limits dropped significantly compared to last-gen chips while still bragging of low-double-digit performance increases. That's rare at a time when Intel has been pushing its chips to the edge to squeeze every last bit of performance out of high-end Core i9 and Core i7 chips.</p>
<p>The focus on power efficiency will give many users—particularly those who don't touch the default settings—less-power-hungry chips that run a bit cooler. And for people who want to tinker and trade in some of that efficiency for a performance boost, many of these chips (particularly the 9700X and 9900X) have a lot of additional performance headroom. It's also nice that all existing AM5 motherboards on the market should be compatible with the 9000 series once a BIOS update is installed, and the AM5 platform's mandatory BIOS Flashback support means you don't need to use weird, kludgy hacks <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/warranty/RMA-BKTC.html">like the "boot kit" CPU loaner program</a> for updating the BIOS when you buy a board with an older BIOS installed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041146#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041146&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, <a href="https://x.ai/blog/grok-2">announced</a> the beta release of two new language models, Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini, available to subscribers of his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter). The models are also linked to the recently released <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/">Flux</a> image-synthesis model, which allows X users to create <a href="https://x.com/Esqueer_/status/1823789104879800368">largely uncensored</a> photorealistic images that can be shared on the site.</p>

<p>"Flux, accessible through Grok, is an excellent text-to-image generator, but it is also really good at creating fake photographs of real locations and people, and sending them right to Twitter," <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1823702829133103287">wrote</a> frequent AI commentator Ethan Mollick on X. "Does anyone know if they are watermarking these in any way? It would be a good idea."</p>
<p>In a report posted earlier today, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220173/xai-grok-image-generator-misinformation-offensive-imges">noted</a> that Grok's image-generation capabilities appear to have minimal safeguards, allowing users to create potentially controversial content. According to their testing, when prompted, Grok produced images depicting political figures in compromising situations, copyrighted characters, and scenes of violence.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043070#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043070&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/new-mpox-outbreak-raises-alarm-who-considers-declaring-international-emergency/">an international health emergency</a> over a large and rapidly expanding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/the-ars-guide-to-the-monkeypox-outbreak-a-national-and-global-emergency/">outbreak of mpox</a> that is spilling out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is the second time in about two years that mpox's spread has spurred the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the highest level of alarm for the United Nations health agency. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/childs-monkeypox-case-raises-alarm-as-who-mulls-declaring-health-emergency/">In July 2022</a>, the WHO declared a PHEIC after mpox cases had spread across the globe, with the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, primarily in men who have sex with men. The outbreak was caused by clade II mpox viruses, which, between the two mpox clades that exist, is the relatively mild one, causing far fewer deaths. As awareness, precautions, and vaccination increased, the outbreak subsided and was <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox">declared over in May 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the 2022–2023 outbreak, the current mpox outbreak is driven by the clade I virus, the more dangerous version that causes more severe disease and more deaths. Also, while the clade II virus in the previous outbreak unexpectedly spread via sexual contact in adults, this clade I outbreak is spreading in more classic contact patterns, mostly through skin contact of household members and health care workers. A large proportion of those infected have been children.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043391#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043391&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony%27s_Spider-Man_Universe">Sony's Spider-Man Universe</a> (SSU) got off to a strong start with <em>Venom</em> (2018) and <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em> (2021), both of which racked up high box office earnings despite mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. But then the studio foundered badly with a couple of box office flops: 2022's <em>Morbius</em> and 2024's <em>Madame Web</em>.</p>
<p>Sony hopes to right the ship with a third Venom film in October (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom:_The_Last_Dance"><em>The Last Dance</em></a>) and the much-delayed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter_(film)"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em></a> this December. We've got a new trailer for the latter, leaning heavily into R-rated gore and set to Johnny Cash's moodily atmospheric "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiMXK9eDrMY">The Man Comes Around.</a>" It's an entirely different, darker vibe from prior offerings: a revenge narrative rife with violence and daddy issues. Color us intrigued.</p>
<p>Comic book fans are well acquainted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter">with Kraven</a> as one of Spider-Man's most formidable foes, a founding member of the Sinister Six. He's a Russian immigrant with an aristocratic background who fled his home country when Tsar Nicholas II's reign collapsed in 1917. He's a big-game hunter with enhanced abilities thanks to ingesting a mysterious potion made from jungle herbs. He's very hard to injure and has super-human strength and enhanced sight, hearing, and smell, as well as being a good tactician with excellent hand-to-hand combat skills.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043361#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043361&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Artists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/artists-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-ai-image-generator-companies/">defending a class-action lawsuit</a> are claiming a major win this week in their fight to stop the most sophisticated AI image generators from copying billions of artworks to train AI models and replicate their styles without compensating artists.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Andersen-v-Stability-AI-Order-on-Motions-to-Dismiss-8-12-2024.pdf">order</a> on Monday, US District Judge William Orrick denied key parts of motions to dismiss from Stability AI, Midjourney, Runway AI, and DeviantArt. The court will now allow artists to proceed with discovery on claims that AI image generators relying on Stable Diffusion violate both the Copyright Act and the Lanham Act, which protects artists from commercial misuse of their names and unique styles.</p>
<p>"We won BIG," an artist plaintiff, Karla Ortiz, <a href="https://x.com/kortizart/status/1823143565972869533?s=46">wrote</a> on X (formerly Twitter), celebrating the order. "Not only do we proceed on our copyright claims," but "this order also means companies who utilize" Stable Diffusion models and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/have-ai-image-generators-assimilated-your-art-new-tool-lets-you-check/">LAION-like datasets</a> that scrape artists' works for AI training without permission "could now be liable for copyright infringement violations, amongst other violations."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043380#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043380&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
