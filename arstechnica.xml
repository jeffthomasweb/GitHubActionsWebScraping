But even with the console officially "revealed," there's still a wide range of important unknown Switch 2 details that Nintendo has yet to address.</p>
<p>As we wait for the company to dribble out additional information in the coming weeks and months, we thought we'd take a quick look at the biggest outstanding questions and concerns we still have about Nintendo's next gaming platform, along with some analysis of what we know, what we can guess, and what we expect on each score.</p>
<h2>Launch date?</h2>
<p>The teaser trailer's promise of a "2025" Switch 2 release technically covers any launch date between "tomorrow" and December 31. But we can probably narrow that window down a bit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/all-the-things-nintendo-didnt-tell-us-about-the-switch-2/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://bambulab.com/en">Bambu Lab</a>, a major maker of 3D printers for home users and commercial "farms," is pushing an update to its devices that it claims will improve security while still offering third-party tools "authorized" access. Some in the user community—and 3D printing advocates broadly—are pushing back, suggesting the firm has other, more controlling motives.</p>
<p>As is perhaps appropriate for 3D printing, this matter has many layers, some long-standing arguments about freedom and rights baked in, and a good deal of heat.</p>

<h2>Printing more, tweaking less</h2>
<p>Bambu Lab, launched in 2022, has stood out in the burgeoning consumer 3D printing market because of its printers' capacity for printing at high speeds without excessive tinkering or maintenance. The <a href="https://bambulab.com/en-us/x1">product page for the X1 series</a>, the printer first targeted for new security, starts with the credo, "We hated 3D printing as much as we loved it." Bambu's faster, less fussy multicolor printers garnered attention—including an ongoing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/stratasys-sues-bambu-lab-over-patents-used-widely-by-consumer-3d-printers/">patent lawsuit from established commercial printer Stratasys</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/bambu-lab-pushes-a-control-system-for-3d-printers-and-boy-did-it-not-go-well/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a letter to investors [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">PDF</a>], Netflix announced price changes starting today in the US, Canada, Argentina, and Portugal.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After 14 years, EA will retire its controversial Origin game distribution app for Windows, the company<a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/"> announced</a>. Origin will stop working on April 17, 2025. Folks still using it will be directed to install the newer EA app, which launched in 2022.</p>
<p>The launch of Origin in 2011 was a flashpoint of controversy among gamers, as EA—already not a beloved company by this point—began pulling titles like<em> Crysis 2</em> from the popular Steam platform to drive players to its own launcher.</p>
<p>Frankly, it all made sense from EA's point of view. For a publisher that size, Valve had relatively little to offer in terms of services or tools, yet it was taking a big chunk of games' revenue. Why wouldn't EA want to get that money back?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/rip-eas-origin-launcher-we-knew-ye-all-too-well-unfortunately/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple has sent out release candidate builds of the upcoming iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS 15.3 updates to developers today. But they come with one tweak that hasn't been reported on, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/macos-sequoia-15-3-apple-intelligence-opt-out/">per MacRumors</a>: They enable all of the AI-powered Apple Intelligence features by default during setup. When Apple Intelligence was initially released in iOS 18.1, the features were off by default, unless users chose to opt-in and enable them.</p>
<p>Those who still wish to opt out of Apple Intelligence features will now have to do it after their devices are set up by navigating to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri section in the Settings app.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence will only be enabled by default for hardware that supports it. For the iPhone, that's just the iPhone 15 Pro series, iPhone 16 series, and iPhone 16 Pro series. It goes further back on the iPad and Mac—Apple Intelligence works on any model with an M1 processor or newer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/ios-18-3-macos-15-3-updates-switch-to-enabling-apple-intelligence-by-default/">Read full article</a></p>

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">OpenAI's o1</a> simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.</p>
<p>Alongside the release of the main <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero">DeepSeek-R1-Zero</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1">DeepSeek-R1</a> models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.</p>
<p>The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models—which can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware—have lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The demonstration mission from a California-based firm named K2 aims to "burn down" the risk of the technology that will fly on the company's first full-sized satellite. So far, so good, but it's early days for the demo flight.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Physicist Mathieu Souzy of the University Twente was enjoying an evening of pasta and board games with several colleagues when the conversation turned to how adding salt to a pasta pot to make it boil faster can leave a white ring on the bottom of the pot. Ever the curious scientists, they wondered about the various factors that would contribute to creating the perfect circular pattern for a salt ring.</p>
<p>“By the end of our meal, we’d sketched an experimental protocol and written a succession of experiments we wanted to try on my youngest son’s small whiteboard,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1070656?">said Souzy</a>. It all comes down to three factors: the diameter of the particles (grains of salt, in this case), the settling height, and the number of particles released simultaneously, according to a <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/37/1/013370/3331877/Salt-ring-in-your-pasta-pan-Morphology-of-particle?redirectedFrom=fulltext">new paper</a> published in the journal Physics of Fluids.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/adding-a-dash-of-alcohol-suppresses-coffee-ring-effect-in-2d-printing-inks/">previously reported</a> on physicists' longstanding interest in similar phenomena like the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_ring_effect">coffee ring effect</a>," when a single liquid evaporates and the solids that had been dissolved in the liquid (like coffee grounds) form a ring. It happens because the evaporation occurs faster at the edge than at the center. Any remaining liquid flows outward to the edge to fill in the gaps, dragging those solids with it. Mixing in solvents (water or alcohol) reduces the effect as long as the drops are very small. Large drops produce more uniform stains.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/how-to-get-a-perfect-salt-ring-deposit-in-your-pasta-pot/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump's flurry of day-one actions included a reprieve for TikTok, the creation of a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an order on social media "censorship," a declaration of an energy emergency, and reversal of a Biden order on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/application-of-protecting-americans-from-foreign-adversary-controlled-applications-act-to-tiktok/">TikTok executive order</a> attempts to delay enforcement of a US law that requires TikTok to be banned unless its Chinese owner ByteDance sells the platform. "I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans," Trump's order said.</p>
<p>TikTok <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/after-chaotic-weekend-tiktok-remains-in-limbo/">shut down</a> in the US for part of the weekend but re-emerged after Trump said on Sunday that he would issue an order to "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security." Trump also <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/19/donald-trump-tik-tok-ownership-united-states/77831835007/">suggested</a> that the US should own half of TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-day-one-orders-saving-tiktok-creating-doge-and-ending-censorship/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As fires spread with alarming speed through the Pacific Palisades region of Los Angeles Tuesday, Jan. 7, a local <a href="https://www.instagram.com/abc7la/reel/DEmxK6IM4Pq/">TV news crew</a> recorded a mountain lion trailed by two young cubs running through a neighborhood north of the fire. The three lions were about three-quarters of a mile from the nearest open space. Another TV crew <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j29vU6GUkz8">captured video</a> of a disoriented, seemingly orphaned fawn trotting down the middle of a street near the Eaton Fire in Altadena, her fur appearing singed, her gait unsteady.</p>
<p>Firefighters are still struggling to contain fires in Los Angeles County that have so far destroyed thousands of homes and other structures and left more than two dozen people dead. Fires and the notorious Santa Ana winds that fuel their spread are a natural part of this chaparral landscape.</p>
<p>But a warming world is supercharging these fires, <a href="https://sustainablela.ucla.edu/2025lawildfires">experts say.</a> Climate change is causing rapid shifts between very wet years that accelerate the growth of scrubland grasses and brush, leading to what’s known as “excessive fuel loading,” that hotter summers and drier falls and winters turn into easily ignited tinderbox conditions. The area where the fires are burning had “the singularly driest October through early January period we have on record,” said climate scientist Daniel Swain during an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeYxLjPXTao">online briefing</a> last week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2025/01/southern-california-wildfires-likely-outpace-ability-of-wildlife-to-adapt/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump swore his oath of office on Monday, ascending yet again to the head of the federal government. As widely expected, he signed a swath of executive orders on his first day, many aimed at upending existing policies and satisfying grievances, whether that's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-orders-us-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/">pulling the country out of membership of the World Health Organization</a> or reversing the nation's clean vehicle policies.</p>
<p>The Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 were signature pieces of former President Joe Biden's term of office. Among other things, the two bills contained many provisions meant to boost US competitiveness in EV manufacturing and build out publicly funded charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>Specifically, the IIJA included <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/heres-how-the-government-plans-to-make-ev-chargers-common-and-reliable/">$7.5 billion in funding for charging infrastructure</a>. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure programs were modeled on federal highway funding programs, where the funds are disbursed to state departments of transportation, which then award the money to successful applications. NEVI was meant to create corridors of fast chargers along federal highways and CFI was to build out charging infrastructure in underserved areas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/fuel-efficiency-evs-and-charger-funding-all-cut-by-trumps-orders/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Trump initially tried to extract the US from the United Nations health agency in July 2020, but the process did not come to completion before he was voted out of office.</p>
<p>At the time, Trump criticized the agency's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, claimed it was protecting China, and asserted that it was overcharging the US in dues. "China has total control over the World Health Organization despite only paying $40 million per year, compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year," Trump said in 2020 prior to issuing the first notice of withdrawal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-orders-us-withdrawal-from-the-world-health-organization/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-19/sonos-woes-spark-apple-deal-talk-mail-with-ai-coming-in-macos-15-4-iphone-se">Mark Gurman in Bloomberg</a> makes the very reasonable suggestion that automatic email categorization in Apple Mail, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/">already present since iOS 18 arrived on the iPhone</a>, is coming to Macs and iPads in a few months. The feature should arrive with macOS 15.4 and possibly iPadOS 18.4, both due in April.</p>
<p>Similar to Google's server-side Gmail sorting, which <a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html">debuted in May 2013</a>, Apple's Mail app on iOS sorts email into categories: "Primary," "Transactions," "Updates," and "Promotions." Moving an email manually from one category to another generally fixes the categorization for that sender from then on. You cannot create new categories, however, or alter how Apple's sorting functions.</p>
<p>Some may prefer the simplicity of a single scroll of messages, versus having to check four separate inboxes to ensure that nothing got missorted or is more important than the label implies. I've used sorting on iOS and generally found it helpful, though I also use the Filters button in the lower-left corner on iOS to do a double-check of all the mail addressed specifically to me. On a Mac desktop, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/mimestream-the-ars-pick-for-mac-gmail-client-hits-1-0-with-new-features/">I'm partial to Mimestream</a>, but that's because all my mail comes through Google/Workspace accounts. I'll be watching to see how Mail's sorting translates to macOS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/report-apple-mail-is-getting-automatic-categories-on-ipados-and-macos/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For decades, we have been imaging the surface of Mars with ever-finer resolution, cataloging a huge range of features on its surface, studying their composition, and, in a few cases, dispatching rovers to make on-the-ground readings. But a catalog of what's present on Mars doesn't give us answers to what's often the key question: how did a given feature get there? In fact, even with all the data we have available, there are a number of major bits of Martian geography that have produced major academic arguments that have yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>In Monday's issue of Nature Geoscience, a team of UK-based researchers tackle a big one: Mars' dichotomy, the somewhat nebulous boundary between its relatively elevated southern half, and the low basin that occupies its northern hemisphere, a feature that some have proposed also served as an ancient shoreline. The new work suggests that the edge of the dichotomy was eroded back by hundreds of kilometers during the time when an ocean might have occupied Mars' northern hemisphere.</p>
<h2>Close to the edge</h2>
<p>To view the Martian dichotomy, all you need to do is color-code a relief map of the Martian surface, something that NASA has <a href="https://attic.gsfc.nasa.gov/mola/images.html">conveniently done for us</a>. Barring a couple of enormous basins, the entire southern hemisphere of the red planet is elevated by a kilometer or more, and sits atop a far thicker crust. With the exception of the volcanic Tharsis region the boundary between these two areas runs roughly along the equator.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/field-of-mounds-on-mars-may-be-sign-of-erosion-at-the-edge-of-an-ocean/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a recent letter to Virginia veterinarians, the state health department requested assistance in the "enhanced surveillance," while noting that, currently, there is no report of threats or bioterrorism-related illnesses.</p>
<p>"As with any large-scale public event, there will be heightened security, and the region will be on alert or signs of bioterrorism or other potential threats," the letter read.

<p>When it comes to fine-tuned motor skills like playing the piano, practice, they say, makes perfect. But expert musicians often experience a "ceiling effect," in which their skill level plateaus after extensive training. Passive training using a robotic exoskeleton hand could help pianists overcome that ceiling effect, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adn3802">paper</a> published in the journal Science Robotics.</p>
<p>“I’m a pianist, but I [injured] my hand because of overpracticing,” coauthor Shinichi Furuya of Kabushiki Keisha Sony Computer Science Kenkyujo <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2464473-robotic-exoskeleton-can-train-expert-pianists-to-play-faster/">told New Scientist</a>. “I was suffering from this dilemma, between overpracticing and the prevention of the injury, so then I thought, I have to think about some way to improve my skills without practicing.” Recalling that his former teachers used to place their hands over his to show him how to play more advanced pieces, he wondered if he could achieve the same effect with a robotic hand.</p>
<p>So Furuya et al. used a custom-made exoskeleton robot hand capable of moving individual fingers on the right hand independently, flexing and extending the joints as needed. Per the authors, prior studies with robotic exoskeletons focused on simpler movements, such as assisting in the movement of limbs stabilizing body posture, or helping grasp objects. That sets the custom robotic hand used in these latest experiments apart from those used for haptics in virtual environments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/robotic-hand-helps-pianists-overcome-ceiling-effect/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I have one standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack">rack</a> appliance in my home: a Unifi Dream Machine Pro. It is mounted horizontally in a coat closet, putting it close to my home's fiber input and also incidentally keeping our jackets gently warm. I can fit juuuuuust about one more standard rack-size device in there (maybe a rack-mount UPS?) before I have to choose between outer-wear and overly ambitious networking. Were I starting over, I might think a bit more about scalability.</p>
<p>Along those lines, technologist and YouTube maker Jeff Geerling has launched the <a href="https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com/">Project Mini Rack</a> page for folks who have similarly server-sized ambitions, coupled with a lack of square footage. "I mean, if you want to cosplay as a sysadmin, you need a rack, right?" Geerling says in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GCIwLm3is">the announcement video</a>. It's a keen launching point for a new "homelab" or "minilab" project, also known as bringing the networking and hardware challenges of a commercial network deployment into your home for "fun."</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Our bodies rely on their lymphatic system to drain excessive fluids and remove waste from tissues, feeding those back into the blood stream. It’s a complex yet efficient cleaning mechanism that works in every organ except the brain. “When cells are active, they produce waste metabolites, and this also happens in the brain. Since there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain, the question was what was it that cleaned the brain,” Natalie Hauglund, a neuroscientist at Oxford University who led a recent study on the brain-clearing mechanism, told Ars.</p>
<p>Earlier studies done mostly on mice discovered that the brain had a system that flushed its tissues with cerebrospinal fluid, which carried away waste products in a process called glymphatic clearance. “Scientists noticed that this only happened during sleep, but it was unknown what it was about sleep that initiated this cleaning process,” Hauglund explains.</p>
<p>Her study found the glymphatic clearance was mediated by a hormone called norepinephrine and happened almost exclusively during the NREM sleep phase. But it only worked when sleep was natural. Anesthesia and sleeping pills shut this process down nearly completely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/how-sleeping-pills-interfere-with-the-brains-internal-cleaning-mechanism/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When ya gotta go, ya gotta go, and if it sometimes seems like the urge to pee seems more pressing when others nearby are letting loose—well, there's now a bit of science to back that up. It turns out that humans may not be the only species to experience "contagious urination," according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01594-X">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. Chimpanzees living at the Kumamoto Sanctuary in Japan are also more likely to relieve themselves when others are doing so nearby, and the behavior seems to be hierarchical, "flowing down" from dominant chimps to more passive ones.</p>
<p>“In humans, urinating together can be seen as a social phenomenon,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1069719?">said coauthor Ena Onishi</a> of Kyoto University. “An Italian proverb states, ‘Whoever doesn’t pee in company is either a thief or a spy’ (<em>Chi non piscia in compagnia o è un ladro o è una spia</em>), while in Japanese, the act of urinating with others is referred to as 'Tsureshon' (連れション). This behavior is represented in art across centuries and cultures and continues to appear in modern social contexts. Our research suggests that this phenomenon may have deep evolutionary roots.”</p>
<p>Onishi, et al decided to study the phenomenon after noticing that many chimps in the sanctuary seemed to synchronize when they peed, and they wondered whether the phenomenon might be similar to how one person yawning can trigger others to follow suit—another "semi-voluntary physiological behavior." There had been no prior research into contagious peeing. So they filmed the 20 captive chimps over 600 hours, documenting over 1,300 "urination events."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/peeing-is-contagious-among-chimps/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>From the flamboyant blossoms and birds of rainforests to the living rainbows of coral reefs, Earth’s surface is teeming with life. But some of its most diverse and fascinating biomes are thriving in the darkness below.</p>
<p>We used to think that the subsurface was a far-from-ideal place for living things. Habitats that can soak up light and warmth from the Sun have the energy to sustain many forms of life and so were viewed as the most diverse. That view is now changing.</p>
<p>Led by Emil Ruff of the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Mass., new research has unearthed communities of underground microbes that are almost as—and sometimes more—diverse than even reefs and rainforests. Ruff and his team found that subsurface bacteria and archaea are flourishing, even at depths where the energy supply is orders of magnitude lower than enjoyed by organisms in habitats that see the sun.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/life-is-thriving-in-the-subsurface-depths-of-earth/">Read full article</a></p>
