<p>Following weeks of speculation, NASA finally made it official on Saturday: two astronauts who flew to the International Space Station on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in June will not return home on that vehicle. Instead, the agency has asked SpaceX to use its Crew Dragon spacecraft to fly astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth.</p>
<p>"NASA has decided that Butch and Suni will return with Crew-9 next February," said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at the outset of a news conference on Saturday afternoon at Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p>In a sign of the gravity surrounding the agency's decision, both Nelson and NASA's deputy administrator, Pam Melroy, attended a Flight Readiness Review meeting held Saturday in Houston. During that gathering of the agency's senior officials, an informal "go/no go" poll was taken. Those present voted unanimously for Wilmore and Williams to return to Earth on Crew Dragon. The official recommendation of the Commercial Crew Program was the same, and Nelson accepted it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045133#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045133&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lithium-ion battery fires can be intense and frightening. As someone who used to repair second-hand <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/smartphones/">smartphones</a>, I’ve extinguished my fair share of flaming iPhones with punctured lithium-ion <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/batteries/">batteries</a>. And the type of smartphone battery in your pocket right now is similar to what’s inside of <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/electric-vehicles/">electric vehicles</a>. Except, the EV battery stores way more energy—so much energy that some firefighters are <a href="https://ktvz.com/cnn-regional/2024/08/20/a-look-at-sacramento-metro-fires-specialized-training-for-electric-vehicle-fires/">receiving special training</a> to extinguish the extra-intense EV flames that are emitted by burning EV batteries after road accidents.</p>
<p>If you’ve been reading the news about EVs, you’ve likely encountered plenty of <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/08/08/tech/korea-ev-explosion-safety-fears/">scary articles about battery fires</a> on the rise. Recently, the US National Transportation Safety Board and the California Highway Patrol <a href="https://x.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/1826430280220999771">announced</a> they are investigating a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkMSzmCqsRY">Tesla semi truck fire</a> that ignited after the vehicle struck a tree. The lithium-ion battery burned for around four hours.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft is stepping up its plans to make Windows more resilient to buggy software after a botched CrowdStrike update took down millions of PCs and servers in a global IT outage.</p>
<p>The tech giant has in the past month intensified talks with partners about adapting the security procedures around its operating system to better withstand the kind of software error that crashed 8.5 million Windows devices on July 19.</p>
<p>Critics say that any changes by Microsoft would amount to a concession of shortcomings in Windows’ handling of third-party security software that could have been addressed sooner.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045127#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045127&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/manos-antonakakis">Dr. Emmanouil "Manos" Antonakakis</a> runs a Georgia Tech <a href="https://astrolavos.gatech.edu">cybersecurity lab</a> and has attracted millions of dollars in the last few years from the US government for Department of Defense research projects like "Rhamnousia: Attributing Cyber Actors Through Tensor Decomposition and Novel Data Acquisition."</p>
<p>The government yesterday sued Georgia Tech in federal court, singling out Antonakakis and claiming that neither he nor Georgia Tech followed basic (and required) security protocols for years, knew they were not in compliance with such protocols, and then submitted invoices for their DoD projects anyway. (Read the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1364901/dl?inline">complaint</a>.) The government claims this is fraud:</p>
<blockquote><p>At bottom, DoD paid for military technology that Defendants stored in an environment that was not secure from unauthorized disclosure, and Defendants failed to even monitor for breaches so that they and DoD could be alerted if information was compromised. What DoD received for its funds was of diminished or no value, not the benefit of its bargain.</p></blockquote>
<h2>AV hate</h2>
<p>Given the nature of his work for DoD, Antonakakis and his lab are required to abide by many sets of security rules, including those outlined in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r3.pdf">NIST Special Publication 800–171</a>, "Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045111#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045111&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>With the impending arrival of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/08/fda-green-lights-fall-covid-19-boosters/">2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines approved yesterday</a>, some Americans are now gaming out when to get their dose—right away while the summer wave is peaking, a bit later in the fall to maximize protection for the coming winter wave, or maybe a few weeks before a big family event at the end of the year? Of course, the group pondering such a question is just a small portion of the US.</p>
<p>Only <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/vaccination-dashboard.html">22.5 percent of adults and 14 percent of children</a> in the country are estimated to have gotten the 2023–2024 vaccine. In contrast, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html">48.5 percent of adults and 54 percent of children</a> were estimated to have gotten a flu shot. The stark difference is despite the fact that COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving faster than seasonal influenza viruses.</p>
<p>In a press briefing Friday, federal health officials were quick to redirect focus when reporters raised questions about the timing of COVID-19 vaccination in the coming months and the possibility of updating the vaccines twice a year, instead of just once, to keep up with an evolving virus that has been producing both summer and winter waves.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045105#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045105&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Newly discovered Android malware steals payment card data using an infected device’s NFC reader and relays it to attackers, a novel technique that effectively clones the card so it can be used at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals, security firm ESET said.</p>
<p>ESET researchers have named the malware NGate because it incorporates <a href="https://github.com/nfcgate/nfcgate/blob/v2/doc/Compatibility.md">NFCGate</a>, an open source tool for capturing, analyzing, or altering NFC traffic. Short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">Near-Field Communication</a>, NFC is a protocol that allows two devices to wirelessly communicate over short distances.</p>
<h2>New Android attack scenario</h2>
<p>“This is a new Android attack scenario, and it is the first time we have seen Android malware with this capability being used in the wild,” ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch">video</a> demonstrating the discovery. “NGate malware can relay NFC data from a victim’s card through a compromised device to an attacker’s smartphone, which is then able to emulate the card and withdraw money from an ATM.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045086#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045086&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As I write this article on the <a href="https://acemagic.com/products/acemagic-360-horizontal-dual-screen-laptop?utm_source=YouTube&amp;utm_medium=ACEMAGIC+X1&amp;utm_campaign=Magic+Brand">AceMagic X1</a>, two things stand out most. The first is its convenience—being able to write on one screen and view specs and information about the laptop and a chat window on a second integrated screen. The second is that with each aggressive keypress, that convenient secondary screen is jiggling just enough to distract me and rattle my nerves.</p>
<p>I often use sleek, small-screened ultralight laptops, so I find dual-screen laptops intriguing. The dual-screen laptops I've used up until this point have come with a huge caveat, though: no integrated keyboard. That's what makes AceMagic's X1 stand out to me. Not only does its secondary screen swing out from the system horizontally (instead of vertically), but the laptop manages to include two 13-inch screens <em>and </em>a traditional keyboard and touchpad.</p>
<p>But the somewhat precarious way that Screen B hangs off the left side of Screen A, floating above my tabletop, proves that even an integrated keyboard can't resolve all the limitations of dual-screen laptop designs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044163#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044163&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With an operating system as old as Windows, what Microsoft decides to remove is often just as (if not more) newsworthy as what it is trying to add. You may or may not care about new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-utilities-like-paint-and-snipping-tool-could-get-an-ai-infusion-soon/">AI-themed MS Paint additions</a> or the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/microsoft-will-try-the-data-scraping-windows-recall-feature-again-in-october/">soon-to-be-reborn Recall feature</a>, but you've almost certainly interacted with one of Windows' Control Panel applets at some point in the last 39 years. And according to a note <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-configuration-tools-in-windows-f8a49657-b038-43b8-82d3-28bea0c5666b">buried on Microsoft's support site</a>, those Control Panels' days may be numbered (emphasis ours):</p>
<p>"The Control Panel is a feature that's been part of Windows for a long time. It provides a centralized location to view and manipulate system settings and controls," the support page explains. "Through a series of applets, you can adjust various options ranging from system time and date to hardware settings, network configurations, and more. <strong>The Control Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience.</strong>"</p>

<p>This won't be news to anyone who has followed Windows' development over the last decade. The Settings app was initially introduced in Windows 8 in 2012 as a touchscreen-friendly alternative for some of the Control Panel applets, but during the Windows 10 era it began picking up more and more Control Panel settings, and by the time Windows 11 rolled around it was full-featured enough to serve as a complete Control Panel replacement most of the time, with a handful of exceptions made for especially obscure changes (and those who simply prefer the Old Ways).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045029#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045029&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The United States today sued RealPage, alleging that the software maker distorts competition in rental housing by helping landlords collectively set prices.</p>
<p>"To ensure they secure the greatest value for their needs, renters rely on robust and fierce competition between landlords. RealPage distorts that competition," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ncmd.99417/gov.uscourts.ncmd.99417.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by the US government and eight state attorneys general. In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-realpage-algorithmic-pricing-scheme-harms-millions-american-renters">press release</a>, the Justice Department said that "RealPage's pricing algorithm violates antitrust laws."</p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-justice-departments-lawsuit-against">delivered remarks</a> on the lawsuit. "When the Sherman Act was passed, an anticompetitive scheme might have looked like robber barons shaking hands at a secret meeting," he said. "Today, it looks like landlords using mathematical algorithms to align their rents. But antitrust law does not become obsolete simply because competitors find new ways to unlawfully act in concert."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045044#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045044&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon may be forced to meet some unionized delivery drivers at the bargaining table after a regional National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) director determined Thursday that Amazon is a joint employer of contractors hired to ensure the e-commerce giant delivers its packages when promised.</p>
<p>This seems like a potentially big loss for Amazon, which had long argued that delivery service partners (DSPs) exclusively employed the delivery drivers, not Amazon. By rejecting its employer status, Amazon had previously argued that it had no duty to bargain with driver unions and no responsibility for alleged union busting, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/22/amazon-teamsters-delivery-drivers/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>But now, after a yearlong investigation, the NLRB has issued what Amazon delivery drivers' union has <a href="https://teamster.org/2024/08/teamsters-win-groundbreaking-joint-employer-decision-against-amazon/">claimed</a> was "a groundbreaking decision that sets the stage for Amazon delivery drivers across the country to organize with the Teamsters."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045030#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045030&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In September of 2023, Amazon announced the Echo Show 8 Photos Edition. It looked just like the regular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hands-on-with-amazons-brand-new-echo-show-8/">Echo Show 8</a> smart display/speaker but cost $10 more. Why? Because of its ability to show photos on the home screen for as long as you want—if you signed up for a $2 monthly subscription to Amazon's PhotosPlus. Now, about a year after releasing the Echo Show 8 Photos Edition, Amazon is announcing that it's discontinuing PhotosPlus. That means Echo Show 8 Photos Edition users will be forced to see ads instead of their beloved pics.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225149/amazon-end-photosplus-subscription-echo-show-8-photos-edition">The Verge</a> yesterday, Amazon started sending PhotosPlus subscribers <a href="https://www.threads.net/@wheelsee/post/C-58LrqSbYW/?xmt=AQGzmRGWYiKIzr_fGPGVQubpJi9x1DpmWUSiz6H0hf9pOA">emails</a> saying that it will automatically cancel all PhotosPlus subscriptions on September 12 and will stop supporting PhotosPlus as of September 23. PhotosPlus, per Amazon's message, "makes photos the primary home screen content you see on your Echo Show 8 and includes 25 GB of storage with Amazon Photos," <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-prime/how-to-use-amazon-photos-storage">Amazon’s online photo storage</a> offering. Users can continue using the 25GB of Amazon Photos storage after September.</p>
<p>However, users will no longer be able to make photos the indefinite home screen on the Alexa gadget. After September, their devices will no longer have the "photo-forward mode" that Amazon advertised for the Echo Show 8 Photos Edition. The photo-forward mode, per Amazon, let people make "selected personal photos the primary rotating content on the ambient screen" (photos rotated every 30 seconds). Now, Echo Show 8 Photo Editions will work like a regular Echo Show 8 and default to showing ads and promotions after three hours.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045012#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045012&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been five years now since the PC version of <em>Borderlands 3</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/borderlands-3-is-the-next-big-epic-game-store-exclusive/">launched as a high-profile timed exclusive on the Epic Games Store</a>. At the time, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/gearboxs-pitchford-steam-may-be-a-dying-store-in-5-to-10-years/">memorably mused</a> that Steam "may look like a dying store" in "five or ten years" thanks to increased competition from Epic and others.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week's announcement of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Borderlands 4,</em></a> and despite Pitchford's old comments, the sequel will not follow its predecessor's example of EGS exclusivity. The new game plans to launch on Steam and EGS simultaneously sometime in 2025 (alongside PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions).</p>
<p>When one social media user <a href="https://x.com/ShitpostRock/status/1826109975594414283">noticed that change</a> this week, Pitchford responded with <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826607833145651458">another lengthy message</a> explaining why his early hopes for the Epic Games Store's rise to dominance were "misplaced or overly optimistic."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044999#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044999&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Volkswagen will wait to see what electric car demand is like before building out all six of its <a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/auto-verkehr/vw-vorstand-schmall-die-zukunft-gehoert-der-e-mobilitaet-19936676.html">previously planned battery factories</a>. Thomas Schmall, VW's board member in charge of technology, told <a href="https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/auto-verkehr/vw-vorstand-schmall-die-zukunft-gehoert-der-e-mobilitaet-19936676.html">a German newspaper</a> that "building battery cell factories is not an end to itself" and that a goal of 200 GWh of lithium-ion cells by 2030 was not set in stone.</p>
<p>It's a bit too simplistic to say that all new technologies conform to the now-infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">Gartner hype cycle</a>, but it's hard not to think of that squiggly line when discussing EVs. After years of hearing lofty goals of all-electric lineups and an end to internal combustion engines from OEMs, Tesla's skyrocketing valuation got investors interested in electrification, and for a while, things <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/meet-the-lordstown-endurance-a-new-52500-electric-work-truck/">just went mad</a>.</p>
<p>But the promised <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/general-motors-announces-new-battery-platform-claims-100kwh-soon/">fall in battery costs</a> never really materialized, and in the US, EVs still command a price premium, at least for the first owner. The initial hype, coupled with the limited availability of new models, saw dealers load the cars and trucks they could get with hefty markups, further alienating potential customers. And now, when those markups and inventory shortages are mostly a thing of the past, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS">interest rates</a> have soared.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044998#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044998&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2019, an agency within the US Department of Defense released <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-08-07a">a call</a> for research projects to help the military deal with the copious amount of plastic waste generated when troops are sent to work in remote locations or disaster zones. The agency wanted a system that could convert food wrappers and water bottles, among other things, into usable products, such as fuel and rations. The system needed to be small enough to fit in a Humvee and capable of running on little energy. It also needed to harness the power of plastic-eating microbes.</p>
<p>“When we started this project four years ago, the ideas were there. And in theory, it made sense,” said Stephen Techtmann, a microbiologist at Michigan Technological University, who leads one of the three research groups receiving funding. Nevertheless, he said, in the beginning, the effort “felt a lot more science-fiction than really something that would work.”</p>
<p>That uncertainty was key. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, supports high-risk, high-reward projects. This means there’s a good chance that any individual effort will end in failure. But when a project does succeed, it has the potential to be a true scientific breakthrough. “Our goal is to go from disbelief, like, ‘You're kidding me. You want to do what?’ to ‘You know, that might be actually feasible,’” said Leonard Tender, a program manager at DARPA who is overseeing the plastic waste projects.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044986#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044986&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After months of consideration, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasa-expects-to-decide-this-weekend-how-to-bring-starliner-astronauts-home/">NASA said Thursday</a> that it will finally decide the fate of two astronauts on board the International Space Station, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, by this weekend. As soon as Saturday, the two crew members will learn whether they'll return on a Starliner spacecraft in early September or a Crew Dragon vehicle next February.</p>
<p>On the eve of this fateful decision, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasa-is-about-to-make-its-most-important-safety-decision-in-nearly-a-generation/">most consequential human spaceflight safety determination</a> NASA has had to make in more than two decades, Ars has put together a summary of what we know, what we believe to be true, and what remains yet unknown.</p>
<h2>Why has NASA taken so long?</h2>
<p>Wilmore and Williams arrived at the International Space Station 11 weeks ago. Their mission was supposed to last eight days, but there was some expectation that they might stay a little longer. However, no one envisioned the crew remaining this long. That changed when, during Starliner's flight to the space station, five of the 28 small thrusters that guide Starliner failed. After some touch-and-go operations, the astronauts and flight controllers at Johnson Space Center coaxed the spacecraft to a safe docking at the station.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044954#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044954&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 7.08 of the Rocket Report!  Lots of news as always, but what I'm most interested in is the launch of the Polaris Dawn mission. If all goes as planned, the flight will break all sorts of ground for commercial spaceflight, including the first-ever private spacewalk. Best of luck to Jared Isaacman and his crew on their adventurous mission.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

<p>Senior NASA leaders, including the agency's administrator, Bill Nelson, will meet Saturday in Houston to decide whether Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is safe enough to ferry astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth from the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The Flight Readiness Review (FRR) is expected to conclude with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasa-is-about-to-make-its-most-important-safety-decision-in-nearly-a-generation/">NASA's most consequential safety decision in nearly a generation</a>. One option is to clear the Starliner spacecraft to undock from the space station in early September with Wilmore and Williams onboard, as their flight plan initially laid out, or to bring the capsule home without its crew.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, the two veteran astronauts have been on the space station for 77 days, nearly 10 times longer than their planned stay of eight days. Wilmore and Williams were the first people to launch and dock at the space station aboard a Starliner spacecraft, but multiple thrusters failed and the capsule leaked helium from its propulsion system as it approached the orbiting complex on June 6.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044910#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044910&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Owners of the $1,695 Snoo "smart" bassinet like to gather in forums like Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SnooLife/">r/snoolife</a> to swap tracking graphs of their children's sleep patterns. But they also like to complain about <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com">Happiest Baby</a>, the company behind the Snoo. That's because Happiest Baby this summer added a $20 monthly subscription fee to several of the Snoo's "premium features," which are controlled by a smartphone app.</p>
<p>Those who bought their Snoo from an "authorized" retailer before July 15, 2024, get the premium features free for nine months. No problem!</p>
<p>But those who bought their Snoo from an unauthorized retailer—that is, got it used—can "enjoy all the fun and benefits of our premium App features—for FREE—until July 15, 2024," the company <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/pages/shipping-returns">announced in its fine print</a>. After that date, premium features went away; the only option for premium feature access on used Snoos now is to cough up $20 each month, atop the $600–$1,000 already spent on the device.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044924#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044924&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A federal judge sentenced a 53-year-old Kansas man to more than 24 years in prison after the former bank CEO abused his trusted position to embezzle $47 million after falling for a cryptocurrency scam that he believed would make him wildly rich.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/former-ceo-failed-bank-sentenced-prison">press release,</a> the US Attorney's Office said that Shan Hanes was driven by "greed" when directing bank employees to transfer millions in funds to a sketchy crypto wallet managed by still-unknown third parties behind the so-called <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-a-pig-butchering-scam-heres-how-to-avoid-falling-victim-to-one">"pig butchering" scheme</a>.</p>
<p>Hanes was first targeted by scammers in late 2022, apparently when he got a message from an unidentified co-conspirator on WhatsApp, prosecutors said. After blowing through his own funds seeking promised profits, Hanes stole tens of thousands from a local church, then a local investor club, and finally his daughter's college fund, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/cryptocurrency-pig-butchering-scam-wrecks-kansas-bank-sends-ex-ceo-pri-rcna167642">reported</a>. Then when all those wells dried up, he started stealing bank funds—all in the false hopes that sending more and more money to the scammers would somehow "unlock the supposed returns" on his crypto investments.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044890#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044890&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
