<p>NASA is looking for ways to get rock samples back from Mars for less than the $11 billion the agency would need under its own plan, so last month, officials put out a call to industry to propose ideas.</p>
<p>Boeing is the first company to release details about how it would attempt a Mars Sample Return mission. Its study involves a single flight of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the super heavy-lift launcher designed to send astronauts to the Moon on NASA's Artemis missions.</p>
<p>Jim Green, NASA's former chief scientist and longtime head of the agency's planetary science division, presented Boeing's concept Wednesday at the Humans to Mars summit, an annual event sponsored primarily by traditional space companies. Boeing is the lead contractor for the SLS core stage and upper stage and has pitched the SLS, primarily a crew launch vehicle, as a rocket for military satellites and deep space probes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023687#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023687&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are few things more heartwarming than videos of children with deafness gaining the ability to hear, showing them happily turning their heads at the sound of their parents' voices and joyfully bobbing to newly discovered music. Thanks to recent advances in gene therapy, more kids are getting those sweet and triumphant moments—with no hearing aids or cochlear implants needed.</p>
<p>At the annual conference of the American Society for Gene &amp; Cell Therapy held in Baltimore this week, researchers showed many of those videos to their audiences of experts. On Wednesday, Larry Lustig, an otolaryngologist at Columbia University, presented clinical trial data of two children with profound deafness—the most severe type of deafness—who are now able to hear at normal levels after receiving an experimental gene therapy. One of the children was 11 months old at the time of the treatment, marking her as the youngest child in the world to date to receive gene therapy for genetic deafness.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Yilai Shu, an otolaryngologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, provided a one-year progress report on six children who were treated in the first in-human trial of gene therapy for genetic therapy. Five of the six had their hearing restored.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023657#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023657&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

(credit: University of New South Wales, Sydney)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Diehard fans of cold-brew coffee put in a lot of time and effort for their preferred caffeinated beverage. But engineers at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, figured out <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2024/05/Ultrasonic_cold_brew_coffee_ready_under_three_minutes">a nifty hack</a>. They rejiggered an existing espresso machine to accommodate an ultrasonic transducer to administer ultrasonic pulses, thereby reducing the brewing time from 12 to 24 hours to just under three minutes, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350417724001330">new paper</a> published in the journal Ultrasonics Sonochemistry.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/the-chemistry-of-cold-brew-coffee-is-so-hot-right-now/">previously reported</a>, rather than pouring boiling or near-boiling water over coffee grounds and steeping for a few minutes, <a href="https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/">the cold-brew method</a> involves mixing coffee grounds with room-temperature water and letting the mixture steep for anywhere from several hours to two days. Then it is strained through a sieve to filter out all the sludge-like solids, followed by filtering. This can be done at home in a Mason jar, or you can get fancy and use a French press or a more elaborate Toddy system. It's not necessarily served cold (although it can be)—just brewed cold.</p>
<p>The result is coffee that tastes less bitter than traditionally brewed coffee. “There’s nothing like it,” co-author Francisco Trujillo of UNSW Sydney <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2430111-ultrasonic-coffee-maker-produces-the-perfect-cold-brew-in-minutes/">told New Scientist.</a> “The flavor is nice, the aroma is nice and the mouthfeel is more viscous and there’s less bitterness than a regular espresso shot. And it has a level of acidity that people seem to like. It’s now my favorite way to drink coffee.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023421#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;T will pay a combined $10.2 million in a settlement with US states that alleged the carriers falsely advertised wireless plans as "unlimited" and phones as "free." The deal was <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-secures-more-10-million-att-t-mobile-and-verizon-wireless">announced yesterday</a> by New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>
<p>"A multistate investigation found that the companies made false claims in advertisements in New York and across the nation, including misrepresentations about 'unlimited' data plans that were in fact limited and had reduced quality and speed after a certain limit was reached by the user," the announcement said.</p>
<p>T-Mobile and Verizon agreed to pay $4.1 million each while AT&amp;T agreed to pay a little over $2 million.

<p>Reinforcement-learning algorithms in systems like ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini can work wonders, but they usually need hundreds of thousands of shots at a task before they get good at it. That’s why it’s always been hard to transfer this performance to robots. You can’t let a self-driving car crash 3,000 times just so it can learn crashing is bad.</p>
<p>But now a team of researchers at Northwestern University may have found a way around it. “That is what we think is going to be transformative in the development of the embodied AI in the real world,” says Thomas Berrueta who led the development of the Maximum Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (MaxDiff RL), an algorithm tailored specifically for robots.</p>
<h2>Introducing chaos</h2>
<p>The problem with deploying most reinforcement-learning algorithms in robots starts with the built-in assumption that the data they learn from is independent and identically distributed. The independence, in this context, means the value of one variable does not depend on the value of another variable in the dataset—when you flip a coin two times, getting tails on the second attempt does not depend on the result of your first flip. Identical distribution means that the probability of seeing any specific outcome is the same. In the coin-flipping example, the probability of getting heads is the same as getting tails: 50 percent for each.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023543#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023543&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI is eventually coming for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites">most popular website</a> on the Internet: Google Search. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-announce-google-search-competitor-monday-sources-say-2024-05-09/">Reuters</a> report claimed that the company behind ChatGPT is planning to launch a search engine as early as <em>this Monday, </em>but OpenAI denied that Monday would be the day.</p>
<p>The company recently confirmed it's holding a <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1788987793613725786">livestream event</a> on Monday, though, but an OpenAI rep told Ars that "Despite reports, we’re not launching a search product or GPT-5 on Monday." Either way, Monday is an interesting time for an OpenAI livestream. That's the day before Google's biggest show of the year, Google I/O, where Google will primarily want to show off its AI prowess and convince people that it is not being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/fearing-chatgpt-google-enlists-founders-brin-and-page-in-ai-fight/">left in the dust</a> by OpenAI. Google seeing its biggest search competition in years and suddenly having to face down "OpenAI's Google Killer" would have definitely cast a shadow over the show.</p>
<p>OpenAI has been inching toward a search engine for a while now. It has been working with Microsoft with a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/ai-powered-chat-helps-bing-make-a-small-dent-in-googles-search-hegemony/">Bing Chat</a>" generative-AI search engine in Microsoft's search engine.

<p>A day after announcing that the tentatively titled <em>Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum </em>was scheduled for a 2026 release, Warner Bros. immediately moved to block a beloved 2009 unauthorized fan film with the exact same name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H09xnhlCQU&amp;t=38s">on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Less than 12 hours later, though, the studio appeared to back down from this copyright fight, reinstating the fan film on YouTube amid fan backlash protesting the copyright strike <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1coloxc/the_hunt_for_gollum_a_high_quality_fanmade_short/">on Reddit</a> as a "dick move."</p>
<p>In 2009, director Chris Bouchard—who most recently directed Netflix's <em>The Little Mermaid</em>—released <em>The Hunt for Gollum</em> through Independent Online Cinema after he claimed to have "reached an understanding" with the rightsholder of The Lord of the Rings books, then called Tolkien Enterprises (now called Middle-earth Enterprises).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023504#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023504&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google has updated its Chrome browser to patch a high-severity zero-day vulnerability that allows attackers to execute malicious code on end user devices. The fix marks the fifth time this year the company has updated the browser to protect users from an existing malicious exploit.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as <a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4671">CVE-2024-4671</a>, is a “use after free,” a class of bug that occurs in C-based programming languages. In these languages, developers must allocate memory space needed to run certain applications or operations. They do this by using “pointers” that store the memory addresses where the required data will reside. Because this space is finite, memory locations should be deallocated once the application or operation no longer needs it.</p>
<p>Use-after-free bugs occur when the app or process fails to clear the pointer after freeing the memory location. In some cases, the pointer to the freed memory is used again and points to a new memory location storing malicious shellcode planted by an attacker’s exploit, a condition that will result in the execution of this code.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023505#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023505&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Do you ever look around at modern civilization and boggle at the sheer complexity of it all? Do you ever think about the generations of backbreaking labor needed to turn acres and acres of untamed wilderness into the layers of interconnected systems needed to provide basic necessities—much less luxuries—to both early settlers and their generations of descendants?</p>
<p>All that infrastructure work is much harder to take for granted after playing <em>Manor Lords</em>. The Early Access version of the game—which netted a million Steam sales in its first 24 hours last month—forces you to do a lot of the heavy lifting that many other city builders tend to gloss over. And while there are still a lot of Early Access rough spots, what's already there can make you appreciate just how hard it is to build a functioning society from nothing but raw materials and hard labor.</p>
<h2>Let go of my hand</h2>
<p>In many other city builders, you act as something of a detached, bureaucratic god. Lay down some roads, set aside some zoning, and watch as the microscopic masses automatically fill in the details of the housing, commerce, and industry needed to create a functional society.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023437#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023437&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is becoming increasingly accepted that classic psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, and mescaline can act as antidepressants and anti-anxiety treatments in addition to causing hallucinations. They act by binding to a serotonin receptor. But there are 14 known types of serotonin receptors, and most of the research into these compounds has focused on only one of them—the one these molecules like, called 5-HT2A. (5-HT, short for 5-hydroxytryptamine, is the chemical name for serotonin.)</p>
<p>The Colorado River toad (<i>Incilius alvarius</i>), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad, secretes a psychedelic compound that likes to bind to a different serotonin receptor subtype called 5-HT1A. And that difference may be the key to developing an entirely distinct class of antidepressants.</p>
<h2>Uncovering novel biology</h2>
<p>Like other psychedelics, the one the toad produces decreases depression and anxiety and induces meaningful and spiritually significant experiences. It has been used clinically to treat vets with post-traumatic stress disorder and is being developed as a treatment for other neurological disorders and drug abuse. 5-HT1A is a validated therapeutic target, as approved drugs, including the antidepressant Viibryd and the anti-anxiety med Buspar, bind to it. But little is known about how psychedelics engage with this receptor and which effects it mediates, so <a href="https://wackerlab.com/">Daniel Wacker’s lab</a> decided to look into it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023435#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023435&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Global carmakers are stepping up their investment in hybrid technologies as consumers’ growing wariness over fully electric vehicles forces the industry to rapidly shift gear, according to top executives.</p>
<p>A combination of still high interest rates and concern over inadequate charging infrastructure has chilled buyers’ enthusiasm for fully electric cars, prompting a rebound in sales of hybrid vehicles that most of the industry had long regarded as nothing more than a stop-gap.</p>
<p>Tapping the resurgent demand for hybrids was a priority, executives from General Motors, Nissan, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Ford told the Financial Times’ Future of the Car Summit this week.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023477#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023477&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>T-Mobile is reportedly close to buying a portion of the regional carrier US Cellular, while Verizon has also held talks about buying some of US Cellular's assets. "T-Mobile is closing in on a deal to buy a chunk of the regional carrier for more than $2 billion, taking over some operations and wireless spectrum licenses, according to people familiar with the matter," The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/telecom/t-mobile-verizon-in-talks-to-carve-up-u-s-cellular-46d1e5e6">reported yesterday</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Apple took the wraps off of a thoroughly leaked iPad Pro refresh with a 1 minute and 8 second ad spot wherein a gigantic hydraulic press comprehensively smushes a trumpet, an arcade cabinet, a record player, paint cans, a piano, a TV, sculptures, a bunch of emoji, and plenty of other tools that one might loosely categorize as "artistic implements."</p>

<p>At the end of the ad, the press lifts away to reveal a somewhat thinner, somewhat faster version of Apple's iPad Pro.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The federal government is looking at a phantom braking problem that appears to be affecting the Fisker Ocean electric crossover. Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2024/INOA-PE24013-12241.pdf">opened a safety probe into the electric vehicle</a>—its fourth so far. Open investigations are also examining whether the doors can fail to open, in addition to problems with shifting into or out of park and issues with partial braking loss over low-grip surfaces.</p>
<p>The newest preliminary investigation was opened by NHTSA's ODI after the regulator received eight complaints of alleged inappropriate automatic emergency braking. AEB is one of the more effective new active driver safety systems. NHTSA added it to its list of recommended safety features <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/01/us-recommends-emergency-braking-tech-on-all-new-cars/">almost a decade ago</a>, and last month, it<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-04/final-rule-automatic-emergency-braking-systems-light-vehicles_web-version.pdf"> published industry standards</a> that will make the feature mandatory on all new cars and trucks, although not until September 2029.</p>
<p>But not every AEB implementation is equal. Both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/teslas-radar-less-cars-investigated-by-nhtsa-after-complaints-spike/">Tesla</a>'s and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/nhtsa-to-investigate-honda-accords-and-cr-vs-over-phantom-braking/">Honda</a>'s systems have suffered from too many false positives, also known as phantom braking, triggering the feature inappropriately, sometimes resulting in that car being crashed into from behind.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023409#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023409&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you puncture the ovary of a wasp called <em>Microplitis demolitor</em>, viruses squirt out in vast quantities, shimmering like iridescent blue toothpaste. “It’s very beautiful, and just amazing that there’s so much virus made in there,” says Gaelen Burke, an entomologist at the University of Georgia.</p>
<p><em>M. demolitor</em>  is a parasite that lays its eggs in caterpillars, and the particles in its ovaries are “domesticated” viruses that have been tuned to persist harmlessly in wasps and serve their purposes. The virus particles are injected into the caterpillar through the wasp’s stinger, along with the wasp’s own eggs. The viruses then dump their contents into the caterpillar’s cells, delivering <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2020/what-do-genes-do-things-know">genes</a> that are unlike those in a normal virus. Those genes suppress the caterpillar’s immune system and control its development, turning it into a harmless nursery for the wasp’s young.</p>
<p>The insect world is full of species of parasitic wasps that spend their infancy eating other insects alive. And for reasons that scientists don’t fully understand, they have repeatedly adopted and tamed wild, disease-causing viruses and turned them into biological weapons. Half a dozen examples already are described, and new research hints at many more.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023393#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023393&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to the research firm Quilty Space, SpaceX's Starlink satellite Internet business is now profitable.</p>
<p>During a webinar on Thursday, analysts from the firm outlined the reasons why they think SpaceX has been able to achieve a positive cash flow in its space Internet business just five years after the first batch of 60 satellites were launched.</p>
<p>The co-founder of the firm, Chris Quilty, said the rapidity of Starlink's rise surprised a lot of people, including himself. "A lot of industry veterans kind of scoffed at the idea," he said. "We'd seen this before."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023380#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023380&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2005, the United States Congress laid out a clear mandate: To protect our civilization and perhaps our very species, by 2020, the nation should be able to detect, track, catalog, and characterize no less than 90 percent of all near-Earth objects at least 140 meters across.</p>
<p>As of today, four years after that deadline, we have identified less than half and characterized only a small percentage of those possible threats. Even if we did have a full census of all threatening space rocks, we do not have the capabilities to rapidly respond to an Earth-intersecting asteroid (despite the success of NASA’s Double-Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission).</p>
<p>Some day in the finite future, an object will pose a threat to us—it’s an inevitability of life in our Solar System. The good news is that it’s not too late to do something about it. But it will take some work.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021515#p3">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021515&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.43 of the Rocket Report! This week saw the debut of two new rockets, a suborbital lifter from a German startup, and a new variant of the Long March 6 from China's state-owned launch provider. We also got within two hours of the debut of a crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner vehicle, but a rocket issue forced a 10-day delay. Soon, hopefully.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Orbital launch tally running ahead of 2023</strong>. There were 63 orbital launch attempts worldwide in the first quarter of 2024, which is 10 more than the same time last year, <a href="https://payloadspace.com/2024-q1-orbital-launches-by-country/?oly_enc_id=9796C0398467A4S">Payload reports</a>. SpaceX accounted for 32 of the 34 US orbital launch attempts in Q1. One ULA Vulcan launch and one Rocket Lab Electron launch out of Wallops rounded out the remaining total. (Rocket Lab flights out of New Zealand are not counted in US launch totals.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023055#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023055&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There is still some work to do to prepare Sierra Space's Dream Chaser spaceplane for its first mission, but the company says the winged resupply craft for the International Space Station will soon ship to its launch site in Florida.</p>
<p>The Dream Chaser will take off on top of a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket to head for the space station. A spokesperson for Sierra Space told Ars the spaceplane's launch is scheduled for the third or fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>But Sierra Space will transport the Dream Chaser to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida with a to-do list. There are two more significant tests the spacecraft must complete at the launch site. Technicians must also finish work on Dream Chaser's heat shield before it is ready to go on top of its Vulcan launcher. It's unclear how long these activities will take to complete.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023334#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023334&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
