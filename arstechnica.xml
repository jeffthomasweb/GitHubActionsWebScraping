<p>After years of lobbying, protests and bidding, Jeff Bezos's space company is now a military launch contractor.</p>
<p>The US Space Force announced Thursday that Blue Origin will compete with United Launch Alliance and SpaceX for at least 30 military launch contracts over the next five years. These launch contracts have a combined value of up to $5.6 billion.</p>
<p>This is the first of two major contract decisions the Space Force will make this year as the military seeks to foster more competition among its roster of launch providers, and reduce its reliance on just one or two companies.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031872#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031872&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ransomware criminals have quickly weaponized an easy-to-exploit vulnerability in the PHP programming language that executes malicious code on web servers, security researchers said.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Internet scans performed by security firm Censys had detected 1,000 servers infected by a ransomware strain known as TellYouThePass, down from 1,800 detected on Monday. The servers, primarily located in China, no longer display their usual content; instead, many list the site’s file directory, which shows all files have been given a .locked extension, indicating they have been encrypted. An accompanying ransom note demands roughly $6,500 in exchange for the decryption key.</p>

<h2>When opportunity knocks</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/06/php-vulnerability-allows-attackers-to-run-malicious-code-on-windows-servers/">vulnerability</a>, tracked as CVE-2024-4577 and carrying a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, stems from errors in the way PHP converts Unicode characters into ASCII. A feature built into Windows known as Best Fit allows attackers to use a technique known as argument injection to convert user-supplied input into characters that pass malicious commands to the main PHP application. Exploits allow attackers to bypass CVE-2012-1823, a critical code execution vulnerability patched in PHP in 2012.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031861#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031861&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Meta has apparently paused plans to process mounds of user data to bring new AI experiences to Europe.</p>
<p>The decision comes after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/meta-to-train-undefined-ai-tech-on-facebook-users-posts-pics-in-eu/">data regulators rebuffed</a> the tech giant's <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/h/bringing-generative-ai-experiences-to-people-in-europe/">claims</a> that it had "legitimate interests" in processing European Union- and European Economic Area (EEA)-based Facebook and Instagram users' data—including personal posts and pictures—to train future AI tools.</p>
<p>There's not much information available yet on Meta's decision. But Meta's EU regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), posted a <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/dpcs-engagement-meta-ai">statement</a> confirming that Meta made the move after ongoing discussions with the DPC about compliance with the EU's strict data privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031851#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031851&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Friday, a retired software engineer named Martin C. Martin <a href="https://martincmartin.com/2024/06/14/how-i-found-a-55-year-old-bug-in-the-first-lunar-lander-game/">announced</a> that he recently discovered a bug in the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> computer game's physics code while tinkering with the software. Created by a <a href="https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html">17-year-old high school student named Jim Storer</a> in 1969, this primordial game rendered the action only as text status updates on a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-forgotten-world-of-teletype-computer-games">teletype</a>, but it set the stage for future versions to come.</p>

<p>The legendary game—which Storer developed on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8">PDP-8</a> minicomputer in a programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language)">FOCAL</a> just months after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic moonwalks—allows players to control a lunar module's descent onto the Moon's surface. Players must carefully manage their fuel usage to achieve a gentle landing, making critical decisions every ten seconds to burn the right amount of fuel.</p>
<p>In 2009, just short of the 40th anniversary of the first Moon landing, I set out to find the author of the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> game, which was then primarily known as a graphical game, thanks to the <a href="http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/retrocomputing/dec/gt40/">graphical version</a> from 1974 and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(1979_video_game)">1979 Atari arcade title</a>. When I discovered that Storer created the oldest known version as a teletype game, I interviewed him and wrote up <a href="https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html">a history of the game</a>. Storer later <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander.html">released the source code</a> to the original game, written in FOCAL, on his website.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031700#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031700&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has spent years "intentionally, knowingly, and deliberately paying women less than men for substantially similar work," a proposed class action <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jong-v-Apple-Complaint-6-13-2024.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed in California on Thursday alleged.</p>
<p>A victory for women suing could mean that more than 12,000 current and former female employees in California could collectively claw back potentially millions in lost wages from an apparently ever-widening wage gap allegedly perpetuated by Apple policies.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by two employees who have each been with Apple for more than a decade, Justina Jong and Amina Salgado. They claimed that Apple violated California employment laws between 2020 and 2024 by unfairly discriminating against California-based female employees in Apple’s engineering, marketing, and AppleCare divisions and "systematically" paying women "lower compensation than men with similar education and experience."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031799#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031799&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A group of Tesla investors yesterday sued Elon Musk, the company, and its board members, alleging that Tesla was harmed by Musk's diversion of resources to his xAI venture. The diversion of resources includes hiring AI employees away from Tesla, diverting microchips from Tesla to X (formerly Twitter) and xAI, and "xAI's use of Tesla's data to develop xAI's own software/hardware, all without compensation to Tesla," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24747977/2024-06-13-e-filed-verified-stockholder-derivative-complaint-tesla-xai.pdf">lawsuit</a> in Delaware Court of Chancery was filed by three Tesla shareholders: the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, Daniel Hazen, and Michael Giampietro. It seeks financial damages for Tesla and the disgorging of Musk's equity stake in xAI to Tesla.</p>
<p>"Could the CEO of Coca-Cola loyally start a competing soft-drink company on the side, then divert scarce ingredients from Coca-Cola to the startup? Could the CEO of Goldman Sachs loyally start a competing financial advisory company on the side, then hire away key bankers from Goldman Sachs to the startup? Could the board of either company loyally permit such conduct without doing <em>anything</em> about it? Of course not," the lawsuit says.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031780#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031780&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday warned that a federal indictment of an allegedly fraudulent telehealth company may lead to a massive, nationwide disruption in access to ADHD medications—namely Adderall, but also other stimulants—and could possibly increase the risk of injuries and overdoses.</p>
<p>"A disruption involving this large telehealth company could impact as many as 30,000 to 50,000 patients ages 18 years and older across all 50 US states," <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00510.asp">the CDC wrote in its health alert</a>.</p>
<p>The CDC warning came on the heels of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/founderceo-and-clinical-president-digital-health-company-arrested-100m-adderall-distribution">an announcement from the Justice Department</a> Thursday that federal agents had arrested two people in connection with an alleged scheme to illegally distribute Adderall and other stimulants through a subscription-based online telehealth company called Done Global.  The company's CEO and founder, Ruthia He, was arrested in Los Angeles, and its clinical president, David Brody, was arrested in San Rafael, California.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031787#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031787&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Long before humans became interested in killing bacteria, viruses were on the job. Viruses that attack bacteria, termed "phages" (short for bacteriophage), were first identified by their ability to create bare patches on the surface of culture plates that were otherwise covered by a lawn of bacteria. After playing critical roles in the early development of molecular biology, a number of phages have been developed as potential therapies to be used when antibiotic resistance limits the effectiveness of traditional medicines.</p>
<p>But we're relative latecomers in terms of turning phages into tools. Researchers have described a number of cases where bacteria have maintained pieces of disabled viruses in their genomes and converted them into weapons that can be used to kill other bacteria that might otherwise compete for resources. I only just became aware of that weaponization, thanks to a new study showing that this process has helped maintain diverse bacterial populations for centuries.</p>
<h2>Evolving a killer</h2>
<p>The new work started when researchers were studying the population of bacteria associated with a plant growing wild in Germany. The population included diverse members of the genus <em>Pseudomonas</em>, which can include plant pathogens. Normally, when bacteria infect a new victim, a single strain expands dramatically as it successfully exploits its host. In this case, though, the <em>Pseudomonas</em> population contained a variety of different strains that appeared to maintain a stable competition.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031745#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031745&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The whole world mourned <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/65669653">the passing</a> of music legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Turner">Tina Turner</a> last year, perhaps none more so than Australians, who have always had a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/26/from-nutbush-to-the-nrl-australias-unique-love-for-tina-turner">special fondness</a> for her. That's not just because of her star turn as Aunty Entity in 1985's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome"><em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em></a> or her stint as the face of Australia's rugby league.</p>
<p>Australians of all ages have also been performing a line dance called the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutbush_(dance)">Nutbush</a>" at weddings and social events to Turner's hit single (with then-husband Ike Turner) "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutbush_City_Limits">Nutbush City Limits</a>." Turner herself never performed the dance, but when she died, there was a flood of viral TikTok videos of people performing the Nutbush in her honor—including members of the US Embassy in Canberra, who had clearly just learned it for the occasion. Dancers at the 2023 Mundi Mundi Bash in a remote corner of New South Wales set a world record with 6,594 dancers performing the Nutbush at the same time.</p>
<p>The exact origin of the dance remains unknown, but researchers at the University of South Australia think they understand how the Nutbush became so ubiquitous in Australia, according to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10304312.2024.2331796">a paper</a> published in the journal Continuum. “What we seem to know is that there was a committee in the New South Wales education department that devised the idea of the Nutbush,” co-author Jon Stratton <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/may/05/origins-of-the-nutbush-line-dance-australia-schools">told the Guardian</a>. “Whether they devised the dance itself, we don’t really know. But what’s interesting is that nobody has come forward.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030863#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030863&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brussels is set to charge Apple over allegedly stifling competition on its mobile app store, the first time EU regulators have used new digital rules to target a Big Tech group.</p>
<p>The European Commission has determined that the iPhone maker is not complying with obligations to allow app developers to “steer” users to offers outside its App Store without imposing fees on them, according to three people with close knowledge of its investigation.</p>
<p>The charges would be the first brought against a tech company under the Digital Markets Act, landmark legislation designed to force powerful “online gatekeepers” to open up their businesses to competition in the EU.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031767#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031767&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Longtime fans of <em>Diablo II</em> are deeply familiar with the extreme timesink that is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">the late-game grind for the very best loot</a>. But when the creators of <em>Diablo IV</em> tried to re-create that style of grinding for the latest game in the series, they found that their players' tastes had changed quite a bit in the intervening years.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/is-there-a-paladin-in-diablo-4">a wide-ranging interview with Windows Central</a>, Blizzard's general manager of <em>Diablo</em>, Rod Fergusson, said that they launched <em>Diablo IV</em> under "the assumption that <em>D4</em> was meant to be more <em>D2</em>-like." That meant, in part, increasing the length of time required to discover the game's most valuable items after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/diablo-3-says-goodbye-and-good-riddance-to-the-auction-house/">post-Auction-House <em>Diablo 3</em> made rare item drops much more common</a>.</p>
<p>"One of the assumptions was that people were going to be okay with the long grind for the Unique or an Uber Unique in particular, because in <em>Diablo II</em>, it can go years," Fergusson said. "You can go three years before you find the Uber you're looking for... and so we were like, okay, this is what people love about the progression of <em>D2</em>, that idea of that very long chase."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031708#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031708&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>We're heading into summer, a time when some people get a few half or whole days off from work. These can't all be vacations, and there's only so much shopping, golfing, or streaming one can do. A few of these times off are even unexpected, such that people with kids might even have some rare time to themselves.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion for some part of one of these days: Declare a Tech Guilt Absolution Day. Sit down, gather up the little computer and phone stuff you love that more people should know about, or free things totally worth a few bucks, and blitz through ratings, reviews, and donations.</p>

<p>Note that I am using the term "guilt," not "<a href="https://brenebrown.com/articles/2013/01/15/shame-v-guilt/">shame</a>." I do not believe any modern human should feel bad about themselves for all the things they have failed to like, rate, <em>and</em> subscribe to. The modern ecosystems of useful little applications, games, podcasts, YouTube videos, newsletters, and the like demand far more secondary engagement than anyone can manage. Even if you purchase something or subscribe, the creators you appreciate, swimming upstream in the torrential rapids of the attention economy, can always use some attention. So I suggest we triage as best we can.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031661#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031661&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.48 of the Rocket Report! Fresh off last week's dramatic test flight of SpaceX's Starship, teams in Texas are wasting no time gearing up for the next launch. Ground crews are replacing the entire heat shield on the next Starship spacecraft to overcome deficiencies identified on last week's flight. SpaceX has a whole lot to accomplish with Starship in the next several months if NASA is going to land astronauts on the Moon by the end of 2026.</p>

<p><b>Virgin Galactic won't be flying again any time soon. </b>After an impressive but brief flurry of spaceflight activity—seven human spaceflights in a year, even to suborbital space, is unprecedented for a private company—Virgin Galactic will now be grounded again for at least two years, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/virgin-galactic-has-ceased-flying-its-only-space-plane-now-what/">Ars reports</a>. That's because Colglazier and Virgin Galactic are betting it all on the development of a future "Delta class" of spaceships modeled on VSS<em> Unity, </em>which made its last flight to suborbital space Saturday. Virgin Galactic, founded by Richard Branson, now finds itself at a crossroads as it chases profitability, which VSS<em> Unity </em>had no hope of helping it achieve despite two decades of development and billions of dollars spent.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031555#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031555&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As some Ars readers may recall, I reviewed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/a-cycling-newb-tries-a-cargo-e-bike-the-user-friendly-maven/">The Maven Cargo e-bike</a> earlier this year as a complete newb to e-bikes. For my second foray into the world of e-bikes, I took an entirely different path.</p>
<p>The stylish Maven was designed with utility in mind—it's safe, user-friendly, and practical for accomplishing all the daily transportation needs of a busy family. The second bike, <a href="https://mod-bikes.com/products/mod-easy-electric-cruiser-bike-and-sidecar">the $4,299 Mod Easy Sidecar 3</a>, is on the other end of the spectrum. Just a cursory glance makes it clear: This bike is built for pure, head-turning fun.</p>
<p>The Mod Easy 3 is a retro-style Class 2 bike—complete with a sidecar that looks like it's straight out of <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>. Nailing this look wasn't the initial goal of Mod Bike founder Dor Korngold. In an interview with Ars, Korngold said the Mod Easy was the first bike he designed for himself. "It started with me wanting to have this classic cruiser," he said, but he didn't have a sketch or final design in mind at the outset. Instead, the design was based on what parts he had in his garage.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031239#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031239&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft will be delaying its controversial Recall feature again, according to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/">an updated blog post</a> by Windows and Devices VP Pavan Davuluri. And when the feature does return "in the coming weeks," Davuluri writes, it will be as a preview available to PCs in the Windows Insider Program, the same public testing and validation pipeline that all other Windows features usually go through before being released to the general populace.</p>

<p>Recall is a new Windows 11 AI feature that will be available on PCs that meet the company's requirements for its "Copilot+ PC" program. Copilot+ PCs need at least 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a neural processing unit (NPU) capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS). The first (and for a few months, only) PCs that will meet this requirement are all using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/">Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite Arm chips</a>, with compatible <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/intels-new-lunar-lake-chips-promise-big-gpu-and-npu-upgrades-minor-cpu-boosts/">Intel</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/amds-ryzen-ai-300-series-laptop-cpus-are-its-first-for-new-copilot-pcs/#:~:text=AMD-,AMD%27s%20Ryzen%20AI%20300%20series%20is%20its%20next%2Dgen%20laptop,to%20support%20Copilot%2B%20PC%20features.&amp;text=Ryzen%20AI%20300%20uses%20a,hasn%27t%20said%20much%20about.&amp;text=Only%20two%20high%2Dend%20processors,though%20others%20will%20surely%20follow.">AMD</a> processors following later this year. Copilot+ PCs ship with other generative AI features, too, but Recall's widely publicized security problems have sucked most of the oxygen out of the room so far.</p>
<p>The Windows Insider preview of Recall will still require a PC that meets the Copilot+ requirements, though <a href="https://github.com/thebookisclosed/AmperageKit">third-party scripts</a> may be able to turn on Recall for PCs without the necessary hardware. We'll know more when Recall makes its reappearance.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031624#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031624&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A juried photography contest has disqualified one of the images that was originally picked as a top three finisher in its new AI art category. The reason for the disqualification? The photo was actually taken by a human and <em>not</em> generated by an AI model.</p>
<p>The 1839 Awards <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1839awards/videos/677508984231701/">launched last year</a> as a way to "honor photography as an art form," with <a href="https://1839awards.com/judges">a panel of experienced judges</a> who work with photos at The New York Times, Christie's, and Getty Images, among others. The <a href="https://1839awards.com/faq/details?section=rules">contest rules</a> sought to segregate AI images into their own category as a way to separate out the work of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">increasingly impressive image generators</a> from "those who use the camera as their artistic medium," as <a href="https://1839awards.com/">the 1839 Awards site puts it</a>.</p>
<p>For the non-AI categories, the 1839 Awards rules note that they "reserve the right to request proof of the image not being generated by AI as well as for proof of ownership of the original files." Apparently, though, the awards did not request any corresponding proof that submissions in the AI category <em>were</em> generated by AI.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031577#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031577&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Famed polar explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a> famously defied the odds to survive the sinking of his ship, <em>Endurance</em>, which became trapped in sea ice in 1914. His luck ran out on his follow-up expedition; he died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1922 on board a ship called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(ship)">Quest</a>.</em> The ship survived that expedition and sailed for another 40 years, eventually sinking in 1962 after its hull was pierced by ice on a seal-hunting run. Shipwreck hunters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/world/canada/ernest-shackleton-quest-ship-found.html">have now located</a> the remains of the converted Norwegian sealer in the Labrador Sea, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The wreckage of <em>Endurance</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/long-lost-endurance-shipwreck-found-off-coast-of-antarctica/">was found</a> in pristine condition in 2022 at the bottom of the Weddell Sea.</p>
<p>The <em>Quest</em> expedition's relatively minor accomplishments might lack the nail-biting drama of the <em>Endurance</em> saga, but the wreck is nonetheless historically significant. "His final voyage kind of ended that Heroic Age of Exploration, of polar exploration, certainly in the south," renowned shipwreck hunter David Mearns <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvv2w2e69go">told the BBC</a>. "Afterwards, it was what you would call the scientific age. In the pantheon of polar ships, <em>Quest</em> is definitely an icon."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/long-lost-endurance-shipwreck-found-off-coast-of-antarctica/">previously reported</a>, <em>Endurance</em> set sail from Plymouth, Massachusetts, on August 6, 1914, with Shackleton joining his crew in Buenos Aires, Argentina. By January 1915, the ship had become hopelessly locked in sea ice, unable to continue its voyage. For 10 months, the crew endured the freezing conditions, waiting for the ice to break up. The ship's structure remained intact, but by October 25, Shackleton realized <em>Endurance</em> was doomed. He and his men opted to camp out on the ice some two miles (3.2 km) away, taking as many supplies as they could with them.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031103#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031103&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The development of gene editing tools, which enable the specific targeting and correction of mutations, hold the promise of allowing us to correct those mutations that cause genetic diseases. However, the technology has been around for a while now—two researchers were critical to its development in 2020—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/gene-editing-tool-gets-its-inevitable-nobel/">and there have been only a few cases</a> where gene editing has been used to target diseases.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is the challenge of targeting specific cells in a living organism. Many genetic diseases affect only a specific cell type, such as red blood cells in sickle-cell anemia, or specific tissue. Ideally, to limit potential side effects, we'd like to ensure that enough of the editing takes place in the affected tissue to have an impact, while minimizing editing elsewhere to limit side effects. But our ability to do so has been limited. Plus, a lot of the cells affected by genetic diseases are mature and have stopped dividing. So, we either need to repeat the gene editing treatments indefinitely or find a way to target the stem cell population that produces the mature cells.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a US-based research team said that they've done gene editing experiments that targeted a high-profile genetic disease: cystic fibrosis. Their technique largely targets the tissue most affected by the disease (the lung), and occurs in the stem cell populations that produce mature lung cells, ensuring that the effect is stable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031527#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031527&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla shareholders have re-approved CEO Elon Musk's $44.9 billion pay package, the company announced today. "Our stockholders have approved the ratification of the 100 percent performance-based stock option award to Elon Musk that was approved by stockholders in 2018," Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla's general counsel and corporate secretary, announced at Tesla's annual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=remZ1KMR_Z4">shareholder meeting</a>.</p>
<p>Ehrhart also said that shareholders approved a corporate move from Delaware to Texas, and the re-election of board members James Murdoch and Kimbal Musk (Elon Musk's brother). While the official announcement was made at the shareholder meeting late in the day on Thursday, Musk revealed that the yes votes were winning in a social media post last night.</p>
<p>"Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!" <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1801084780035154058">Musk wrote</a>, referring to the pay vote and the move from Delaware to Texas. His post included charts indicating that both shareholder resolutions had more than enough yes votes to surpass the "guaranteed win" threshold.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031288#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031288&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            Much of the time, the game looks a lot like <em>Civilization</em>, like in this city view.                          [credit:

<p>We haven't written much about <em>Ara: History Untold</em>, a new historical turn-based strategy PC game that's been in the works for a few years now. Part of that's because its publisher, Xbox Game Studios, hasn't put much fanfare behind it; it wasn't even mentioned in Microsoft's not-E3 extravaganza last week.</p>
<p>But perhaps both we and Microsoft should be putting more of a spotlight on it, given that it now has a release date: September 24, 2024. The game will be released on Steam and Xbox Game Pass for PC simultaneously.</p>
<p>The date was announced during an Official Xbox Podcast interview (and accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/">blog post</a>) with Marc Meyer, president of Oxide Games, the studio developing <em>Ara</em>. The podcast covered more than just the release date, though, with Meyer offering up some new gameplay details—particularly about how multiplayer will work.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031511#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031511&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
