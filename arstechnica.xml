              <![CDATA[<p>There are a remarkable number of commercial fusion power startups, considering that it's a technology that's built a reputation for being perpetually beyond the horizon. Many of them focus on radically new technologies for heating and compressing plasmas, or fusing unusual combinations of isotopes. These technologies are often difficult to evaluate—they can clearly generate hot plasmas, but it's tough to determine whether they can get hot enough, often enough to produce usable amounts of power.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum are a handful of companies that are trying to commercialize designs that have been extensively studied in the academic world. And there have been some interesting signs of progress here. Recently, Commonwealth Fusion, which is building a demonstration tokamak in Massachussets, started construction of the cooling system that will keep its magnets superconducting. And two companies that are hoping to build a stellarator did some important validation of their concepts.</p>
<h2>Doing donuts</h2>
<p>A tokamak is a donut-shaped fusion chamber that relies on intense magnetic fields to compress and control the plasma within it. A number of tokamaks have been built over the years, but the big one that is expected to produce more energy than required to run it, <a href="https://www.iter.org/">ITER</a>, has faced many delays and now isn't expected to achieve its potential <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/iters-timeline-for-fusion-stretched-out-even-further/">until the 2040s</a>. Back in 2015, however, some physicists calculated that high-temperature superconductors would allow ITER-style performance in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/small-modular-nuke-plant-proposed-this-time-for-fusion/">far smaller and easier-to-build</a> package. That idea was commercialized as <a href="https://cfs.energy">Commonwealth Fusion</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/commercial-fusion-power-companies-moving-toward-test-systems/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nearly half of US states sued the federal government and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. today in a bid to halt the termination of $11 billion in public health grants. The lawsuit was filed by 23 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>"The grant terminations, which came with no warning or legally valid explanation, have quickly caused chaos for state health agencies that continue to rely on these critical funds for a wide range of urgent public health needs such as infectious disease management, fortifying emergency preparedness, providing mental health and substance abuse services, and modernizing public health infrastructure," said a <a href="https://coag.gov/press-releases/weiser-sues-hhs-kennedy-public-health-grant-cuts-4-1-25/">press release</a> issued by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.</p>
<p>The litigation is led by Colorado, California, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Washington. The other plaintiffs are Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/rfk-jr-illegally-rescinded-11b-in-public-health-grants-states-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Apple only supported RCS on the big three carriers in the first iOS18 releases. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Apple spent years ignoring RCS, allowing iPhones to offer a degraded messaging experience with Android users. This made Android folks unwelcome in many a group chat, but Apple finally started rectifying this issue last year with the addition of RCS support in iOS. It has been a slow rollout, though, with Google's mobile service only now getting support.</p>
<p>While Apple supports RCS messaging on iPhones now, it has not exactly been enthusiastic about it. Anyone using Google Fi on an iPhone was left in the lurch even after Apple changed course. The first RCS update rolled out in iOS 18 last fall, but it only supported postpaid plans on the big three carriers. Everyone else was left waiting, including Google Fi, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/ios-18-brings-rcs-to-major-carrier-iphones-but-prepaid-plans-are-still-waiting/">confirmed to Ars</a> last year. It was a suitably amusing outcome, considering Google is largely responsible for reviving the RCS standard and runs the Jibe back-end servers through which many iPhone RCS messages flow.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, Apple is making good on its promises to enable RCS. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/apple-updates-all-its-operating-systems-brings-apple-intelligence-to-vision-pro/">released iOS 18.4 this week</a>, and hiding amid the control center tweaks and priority notifications is support for RCS on Google Fi and other T-Mobile MVNOs. Some users spotted this feature in the recent beta releases, but the servers that handle RCS for Google's mobile service were not yet connectable. With the final release, <a href="https://support.google.com/fi/thread/335006509/rcs-messages-is-now-available-for-ios">Google has confirmed</a> that RCS is ready at last.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-fi-users-on-iphone-finally-get-rcs-messaging/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>With its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html?srsltid=AfmBOorIl03zKaY5sGkFnn4_Sn4YjULJcbtWvy7G6aAO62NZFYbLWfbJ">planned Switch 2 Direct presentation scheduled for Wednesday morning</a>, Nintendo is set to finally fully pull back the curtain on a console we've been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/report-nintendos-next-console-ships-late-2024-still-supports-cartridges/">speculating about</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/the-thing-after-the-switch-how-overheard-chatter-led-to-a-nintendo-goose-chase/"> years now</a>. We'll have plenty of reporting and analysis of whatever Nintendo announces in the days to come. In the meantime, though, we thought it would be fun to put down a marker on some of the key announcements we expect Nintendo to make tomorrow.</p>
<p>Rather than limiting ourselves to a single prediction, though, we've broken things down into increasingly outlandish categories of "Likely," "Possible," and "Implausible." Consider this an exercise in expectation-setting for one of the most important moments in Nintendo's recent history, and be sure to let us know what you think will happen in the comments section below.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 1982, while most game developers were busy with space invaders and maze ghosts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Williams_(game_designer)">Bill Williams</a> created something far more profound: a game about swimming upstream against impossible odds. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_Run_(video_game)">Salmon Run</a></em> for the Atari 800 served as a powerful metaphor for life itself, one that resonates even more deeply when you learn about the creator's own struggles with cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>As a kid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/why-i-hope-the-atari-400-mini-will-bring-respect-to-ataris-most-underrated-platform/">growing up</a> in the 1980s with an <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432140/how-atari-took-on-apple-in-the-1980s-home-pc-wars">Atari 800 home computer</a>, I discovered this hidden gem in our family's game collection, and it soon became a favorite. What struck me most—and what still amazes me today—was its incredible audio design, creating water sounds that seemed impossible for 8-bit hardware. But <em>Salmon Run</em> was about far more than impressive audio.</p>
<p>In the game, you play as Sam the Salmon, swimming upriver to spawn with a female salmon waiting upstream. You control your speed while dodging obstacles like rocks, waterfalls, and riverbanks, moving left to right and leaping from the water. And predators—bears, fishermen, and birds—are constantly trying to eat you.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/how-a-1980s-atari-creator-with-cystic-fibrosis-crafted-a-story-of-salmon-survival/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/"><em>Satisfactory</em></a> starts out as a game you play, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/satisfactory-hits-1-0-removing-your-last-excuse-to-avoid-falling-in-deep">becomes a way you think</a>. The only way I have been able to keep the ridiculous factory simulation from eating an even-more-unhealthy amount of my time was the game's keyboard-and-mouse dependency. But the work, it has found me—on my couch, on a trip, wherever one might game, really.</p>
<p>In a 1.1 release on <em>Satisfactory</em>'s Experimental branch, there are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/520835140699555676">lots of new things</a>, but the biggest new thing is a controller scheme. Xbox and DualSense are officially supported, though anyone playing on Steam can likely tweak their way to something that works on other pads. With this, the game becomes far more playable for those playing on a couch, on a portable gaming PC like the Steam Deck, or over household or remote streaming. It also paves the way for the game's console release, which is currently slated for sometime in 2025.</p>

<p><em>Satisfactory</em> seems like an unlikely candidate for controller support, let alone consoles. It's a game where you do a lot of three-dimensional thinking, putting machines and conveyer belts and power lines in just the right places, either because you need to or it just feels proper. How would it feel to select, rotate, place, and connect everything using a controller? Have I just forgotten that <em>Minecraft, </em>and first-person games as a whole, probably seemed similarly desk-bound at one time? I grabbed an Xbox Wireless controller, strapped on my biofuel-powered jetpack, and gave a reduced number of inputs a shot.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/satisfactory-now-has-controller-support-so-theres-no-excuse-for-your-bad-lines/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>TVs offer us an escape from the real world. After a long day, sometimes there’s nothing more relaxing than turning on your TV, tuning into your favorite program, and unplugging from the realities around you.</p>
<p>But what happens when divisive, potentially offensive messaging infiltrates that escape? Even with streaming services making it easy to watch TV commercial-free, it can still be difficult for TV viewers to avoid ads with these sorts of messages.</p>
<p>That’s especially the case with budget brands, which may even force controversial ads onto TVs when they’re idle, making users pay for low-priced TVs in unexpected, and sometimes troubling, ways.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/cheap-tvs-incessant-advertising-reaches-troubling-new-lows/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson said he's keeping an eye on 23andMe's bankruptcy proceeding and the company's planned sale because of privacy concerns related to genetic testing data. 23andMe and its future owner must uphold the company's privacy promises, Ferguson said in a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/23andme-letter-ferguson.pdf">letter</a> sent yesterday to representatives of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ust">US Trustee Program</a>, a Justice Department division that oversees administration of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>"As Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, I write to express the FTC's interests and concerns relating to the potential sale or transfer of millions of American consumers' sensitive personal information," Ferguson wrote. He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you may know, 23andMe collects and holds sensitive, immutable, identifiable personal information about millions of American consumers who have used the Company's genetic testing and telehealth services. This includes genetic information, biological DNA samples, health information, ancestry and genealogy information, personal contact information, payment and billing information, and other information, such as messages that genetic relatives can send each other through the platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>23andMe's recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/genetic-testing-company-23andme-declares-bankruptcy/">bankruptcy announcement</a> set off a wave of concern about the fate of genetic data for its 15 million customers. The company <a href="https://blog.23andme.com/articles/open-letter">said</a> that "any buyer of 23andMe will be required to comply with our privacy policy and with all applicable law with respect to the treatment of customer data." Many users reacted to the news by <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-urgently-issues-consumer-alert-23andme-customers">deleting their data</a>, though <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/23andme-delete-data-bankruptcy-5778341f">tech problems apparently related to increased website traffic</a> made that process difficult.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/ftc-watching-23andme-bankruptcy-sale-for-impact-on-users-genetic-data/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As it flew up toward the International Space Station last summer, the Starliner spacecraft lost four thrusters. A NASA astronaut, Butch Wilmore, had to take manual control of the vehicle. But as Starliner's thrusters failed, Wilmore lost the ability to move the spacecraft in the direction he wanted to go.</p>
<p>He and his fellow astronaut, Suni Williams, knew where they wanted to go. Starliner had flown to within a stone's throw of the space station, a safe harbor, if only they could reach it. But already, the failure of so many thrusters violated the mission's flight rules. In such an instance, they were supposed to turn around and come back to Earth. Approaching the station was deemed too risky for Wilmore and Williams, aboard Starliner, as well as for the astronauts on the $100 billion space station.</p>
<p>But what if it was not safe to come home, either?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/the-harrowing-story-of-what-flying-starliner-was-like-when-its-thrusters-failed/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It has been a bumpy start for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P">Amazon's $280 Kindle Colorsoft</a>, the company's first E-Ink book reader with a color screen. The company delayed shipments for a few weeks to correct a problem where a faint yellow band would appear across the bottom of the screen, something that has apparently been fixed for current versions of the reader (Amazon says it has made "the appropriate adjustments" to fix the problem but hasn't been specific about what those adjustments are).</p>
<p>Amazon didn't send us a Colorsoft for review at the time, maybe in part because of this problem early reviewers had, but we finally got one a few weeks ago and have been using it since then.</p>
<p>My main takeaway is that I don't <em>mind</em> the Colorsoft, but it also doesn't solve any problems I was having with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/review-amazons-2024-kindle-paperwhite-makes-the-best-e-reader-a-little-better/">the monochrome Kindle Paperwhite</a>, and it doesn't meaningfully solve the big problems with color E-Ink. It also makes the experience of reading regular text subtly worse, which accounts for the vast majority of my Kindle activity. I'm curious to see future riffs on the idea, but this initial implementation leaves me cold.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/for-regular-books-amazons-280-kindle-colorsoft-falls-short-of-the-paperwhite/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Op-ed: Google's generative AI is not ready to serve as your virtual assistant. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Google announced its intention to unify its generative AI efforts under the Gemini brand at the tail end of 2023, and it has been full steam ahead ever since. In 2025, Google Assistant is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/why-wait-google-is-already-dismantling-assistant-as-it-switches-to-gemini/">being phased out and replaced with Gemini</a>. As Google, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/">Amazon</a>, and others move toward a world in which all virtual assistants are based on generative AI, it's reasonable to consider if this is actually a good idea. Despite promises of "smarter" AI and ever-increasing token limits, these robots still have a fundamental flaw that may make them bad assistants: They lie.</p>
<p>They don't set out to lie, of course, because they don't know what a "lie" is. These systems attempt to generate the most plausible next token to build an output. Because of this, generative AI is non-deterministic—you can't predict the output, and even running the same prompt multiple times will offer varying responses.</p>
<p>This can look impressively like thinking sometimes, but it also leads to frequent hallucinations. That's why the iPhone <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/apple-plans-software-update-after-ai-summaries-get-news-headlines-wrong/">said Luigi Mangione was dead</a> and Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">told people to put glue on pizza</a>. GenAI proponents like Google and Apple have been trying to curb the chaos of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">confabulations</a>, but this may always be a problem because of the nature of the underlying technology.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/gemini-is-an-increasingly-good-chatbot-but-its-still-a-bad-assistant/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Four adventurers suited up and embarked on a first-of-a-kind trip to space Monday night, becoming the first humans to fly in polar orbit aboard a SpaceX crew capsule chartered by a Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire.</p>
<p>The private astronauts rocketed into orbit atop a Falcon 9 booster from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 9:46 pm EDT Monday (01:46 UTC Tuesday). Instead of heading to the northeast in pursuit of the International Space Station, the Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft departed Launch Complex 39A and arced to the southeast, then turned south on a flight path hugging Florida's east coast.</p>
<p>The unusual trajectory aligned the Falcon 9 with a perfectly polar orbit at an inclination of 90 degrees to the equator, bringing the four-person crew directly over the North or South Pole every 45 minutes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/four-private-astronauts-launch-on-first-human-mission-to-fly-over-the-poles/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google’s artificial intelligence arm DeepMind has been holding back the release of its world-renowned research, as it seeks to retain a competitive edge in the race to dominate the burgeoning AI industry.</p>
<p>The group, led by Nobel Prize-winner Sir Demis Hassabis, has introduced a tougher vetting process and more bureaucracy that made it harder to publish studies about its work on AI, according to seven current and former research scientists at Google DeepMind.</p>
<p>Three former researchers said the group was most reluctant to share papers that reveal innovations that could be exploited by competitors, or cast Google’s own Gemini AI model in a negative light compared with others.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/deepmind-is-holding-back-release-of-ai-research-to-give-google-an-edge/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>We're back! A long-time reader and subscriber <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/kind-of-missing-the-daily-telescope.1506437/">recently mentioned</a> in the Ars Forums that they "kind of" missed the Daily Telescope posts that I used to write in 2023 and 2024. Although I would have preferred that everyone <em>desperately</em> missed the Daily Telescope, I appreciate the sentiment. I really do.</p>
<p>I initially stopped writing these posts about a year ago because it just became too much to commit to writing one thing every day. I mean, I could have done it. But doing so on the daily crossed over the line from enjoyable to drudgery, and one of the best things about working for Ars is that it tends very much toward the enjoyable side. Anyway, writing one of these posts on a weekly basis feels more sustainable. I guess we'll find out!</p>
<p>Today's image comes to you all the way from Mars. One of the most powerful tools on NASA's Perseverance rover is the WATSON camera attached to the end of the rover's robotic arm. In the fine tradition of tortured acronyms at the space agency, WATSON stands for Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering. And because of course it is, WATSON is located on the SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals) instrument. Seriously, NASA must stand for Not Another Screwball Acronym.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/tuesday-telescope-on-mars-the-rovers-take-pictures-of-robotic-arms-and-rocks/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What does it take to get OpenAI and Anthropic—two competitors in the AI assistant market—to get along? Despite a fundamental difference in direction that led Anthropic's founders to <a href="https://openai.com/index/organizational-update/">quit OpenAI</a> in 2020 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/anthropic-introduces-claude-a-more-steerable-ai-competitor-to-chatgpt/">later create</a> the Claude AI assistant, a shared technical hurdle has now brought them together: How to easily connect their AI models to external data sources.</p>
<p>The solution comes from Anthropic, which developed and released an open specification called <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) in November 2024. MCP establishes a royalty-free protocol that allows AI models to connect with outside data sources and services without requiring unique integrations for each service.</p>
<p>"Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications," <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">wrote</a> Anthropic in MCP's documentation. The analogy is imperfect, but it represents the idea that, similar to how USB-C unified various cables and ports (with admittedly a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/understanding-usb-type-c-cable-types-pitfalls-and-more/cable-types-and-differences">debatable level</a> of success), MCP aims to standardize how AI models connect to the infoscape around them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AI video startup Runway announced the availability of its newest video synthesis model today. Dubbed Gen-4, the model <a href="https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-runway-gen-4">purports to solve</a> several key problems with AI video generation.</p>
<p>Chief among those is the notion of consistent characters and objects across shots. If you've watched any short films made with AI, you've likely noticed that they're either dream-like sequences or thematically but not realistically connected images—mood pieces more than consistent narratives.</p>
<p>Runway claims Gen-4 can maintain consistent characters and objects, provided it's given a single reference image of the character or object in question as part of the project in Runway's interface.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/with-new-gen-4-model-runway-claims-to-have-finally-achieved-consistency-in-ai-videos/">Read full article</a></p>

The iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, tvOS 18.4, and visionOS 2.4 updates are all currently available to download, and each adds a small handful of new features for their respective platforms.</p>
<p>A watchOS 11.4 update was also published briefly, but it's currently unavailable.</p>
<p>For iPhones and iPads that support Apple Intelligence, the flagship feature in 18.4 is Priority Notifications, which attempts to separate time-sensitive or potentially important notifications from the rest of them so you can see them more easily.

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has gained access "to a payroll system that processes salaries for about 276,000 federal employees across dozens of agencies," despite "objections from senior IT staff who feared it could compromise highly sensitive government personnel information" and lead to cyberattacks, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/politics/doge-musk-federal-payroll.html">reported today</a>.</p>
<p>The system at the Interior Department gives DOGE "visibility into sensitive employee information, such as Social Security numbers, and the ability to more easily hire and fire workers," the NYT wrote, citing people familiar with the matter. DOGE workers had been trying to get access to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System for about two weeks and succeeded over the weekend, the report said.</p>
<p>"The dispute came to a head on Saturday, as the DOGE workers obtained the access and then placed two of the IT officials who had resisted them on administrative leave and under investigation, the people said," according to the NYT report. The agency's CIO and CISO are reportedly under investigation for their "workplace behavior."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/doge-accesses-federal-payroll-system-and-punishes-employees-who-objected/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's a regrettable reality that there is never time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection of such stories. March's list includes fascinating papers on such topics as how the brain responds to speaking Klingon (or Dothraki, or Navi), the discovery of creepy preclassic Salvadoran puppets, the effectiveness of "dazzle camouflage," and how male blue-lined octopuses manage not to be cannibalized by their chosen mates.</p>
<h2>Wind Cave’s rocks fluoresce under black light</h2>

<p>South Dakota's Wind Cave gets its name from the flow of air moving continually through its many passages and equalizing the atmospheric pressure between the air inside and outside—almost like the cave is "breathing." Its rock and mineral formations also boast a unique chemistry that fluoresces when exposed to black light, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RMhmcEpZnGc">talks presented</a> at the <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076978">spring meeting</a> of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. That fluorescence could shed light on how life can thrive in extreme environments, including that of Jupiter's moon, Europa.</p>
<p>University of Northern Iowa astrobiologist Joshua Sebree and several students have been mapping new areas of Wind Cave (as well as other caves in the US), recording the passages, rock formations, minerals, and lifeforms they encounter in the process. They noticed that under UV light, certain parts of Wind Cave took on otherworldly hues, thanks to different concentrations of organic and inorganic fossilized chemical compounds. Those areas seem to indicate where water once flowed, carrying minerals into the cave from the surface 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, according to their analysis of the fluorescent spectra. Sebree et al. found that Wind Cave was likely carved out by waters rich in manganese, producing zebra stripes that glow pink under UV light, revealing the calcites that grew within as a result of those waters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/research-roundup-2400-year-old-clay-puppets-this-is-your-brain-on-klingon/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>2024 was "a year of growth," according to fire-suppression company <a href="https://firerover.com/">Fire Rover</a>, but that's not an entirely good thing.</p>
<p>The company, which offers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXoMCVFiCwo">fire detection and suppression systems</a> based on thermal and optical imaging, smoke analytics, and human verification, releases annual reports on waste and recycling facility fires in the US and Canada to select industry and media. In 2024, Fire Rover, based on its fire identifications, saw 2,910 incidents, a 60 percent increase from the 1,809 in 2023, and more than double the 1,409 fires confirmed in 2022.</p>
<p>Publicly reported fire incidents at waste and recycling facilities also hit 398, a new high since Fire Rover began compiling its report eight years ago, when that number was closer to 275.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/lithium-ion-battery-waste-fires-are-increasing-and-vapes-are-a-big-part-of-it/">Read full article</a></p>
