<p>Among <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/amd-explains-promises-partial-fixes-for-ryzen-9000-performance-problems/">AMD’s explanations</a> for the somewhat underwhelming Ryzen 9000 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/amd-ryzen-9000-review-impressive-efficiency-with-bugs-and-so-so-speed-boosts/">performance reports from reviewers</a> earlier this month: that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/">upcoming Windows 11 24H2 update</a> would bring some improvements to the CPU scheduler that would boost the performance of the new CPUs and their Zen 5-based architecture.</p>
<p>But rather than make Ryzen owners wait for the 24H2 update to come out later this fall (or make them install a beta version of a major OS update), AMD and Microsoft have backported the scheduler improvements to Windows 11 23H2.

<p>Indian IT firm Infosys has been accused of being “exploitative” after allegedly sending job offers to thousands of engineering graduates but still not onboarding any of them after as long as two years. The recent graduates have reportedly been told they must do repeated, unpaid training in order to remain eligible to work at Infosys.</p>
<p>Last week, the Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (<a href="https://nites.co.in/about-us/">NITES</a>), an Indian advocacy group for IT workers, sent a letter [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Infosys.pdf">PDF</a>], shared by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/27/infosys_freshers_wait/">The Register</a>, to Mansukh Mandaviya, India’s Minster of Labor and Employment. It requested that the Indian government intervene “to prevent exploitation of young IT graduates by Infosys." The letter signed by NITES president Harpreet Singh Saluja claimed that NITES received “multiple” complaints from recent engineering graduates “who have been subjected to unprofessional and exploitative practices” from Infosys after being hired for system engineer and digital specialist engineer roles.</p>
<p>According to NITES, Infosys sent these people offer letters as early as April 22, 2022, after engaging in a college recruitment effort from 2022–2023 but never onboarded the graduates. NITES has previously <a href="https://nites.co.in/infosys-delays-onboarding-for-over-2-years-nites-demands-government-action/">said</a> that “over 2,000 recruits” are affected.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045697#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045697&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's X platform made a change to its AI assistant, Grok, that may prevent it from giving users false information on election ballot deadlines and other election-related matters. From now on, X says that Grok will direct users to Vote.gov when asked election-related questions.</p>
<p>X, formerly Twitter, made the change about two weeks after five secretaries of state complained to the company. "On August 21, 2024, X's Head of US and Canada Global Government Affairs informed the Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State [Steve Simon] that the platform has made changes to its AI search assistant, Grok, after a request from several Secretaries of State," Simon's office said in a <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-the-office/news-room/secretaries-of-state-welcome-changes-to-x-s-ai-search-assistant/">press release</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Grok is developed by xAI, one of Musk's other companies, and is available on X to paying subscribers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045662#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045662&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The members of PleasrDAO are, well, pretty <em>dis</em>pleased with Martin Shkreli.</p>
<p>The "digital autonomous organization" spent $4.75 million to buy the fabled Wu-Tang Clan album <em>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</em>, which had only been produced as a single copy. The album had once belonged to Shkreli, who purchased it directly from Wu-Tang Clan for $2 million in 2015. But after Shkreli became the "pharma bro" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/shkrelis-infamous-4000-price-hike-gets-him-a-lifetime-pharma-ban/">poster boy for price gouging in the drug sector</a>, he ended up in severe legal trouble and served a seven-year prison sentence for securities fraud.</p>
<p>He also had to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/shkreli-will-lose-his-wu-tang-album-judge-orders-forfeiture-of-7-36-million/">pay a $7.4 million penalty</a> in that case, and the government seized and then sold <em>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</em> to help pay the bill.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045671#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045671&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>NASA's problems with the mobile launch tower that will support a larger version of its Space Launch System rocket are getting worse rather than better.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/office-of-inspector-general-oig/audit-reports/nasas-management-of-the-mobile-launcher-2-project/">a new report</a> from NASA's inspector general, the estimated cost of the tower, which is a little bit taller than the length of a US football field with its end zones, is now $2.7 billion. Such a cost is nearly twice the funding it took to build the largest structure in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is seven times taller.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable explosion in costs as, only five years ago, NASA awarded a contract to the Bechtel engineering firm to build and deliver a second mobile launcher (ML-2) for $383 million, with a due date of March 2023. That deadline came and went with Bechtel barely beginning to cut metal.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045558#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045558&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) recently unveiled its latest <a href="https://opensource.org/deepdive/drafts/open-source-ai-definition-draft-v-0-0-9">draft definition</a> for "open source AI," aiming to clarify the ambiguous use of the term in the fast-moving field. The move comes as some companies like Meta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/the-first-gpt-4-class-ai-model-anyone-can-download-has-arrived-llama-405b/">release</a> trained AI language model weights and code with usage restrictions while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/the-first-gpt-4-class-ai-model-anyone-can-download-has-arrived-llama-405b/">using</a> the "open source" label. This has sparked intense <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/">debates</a> among free-software advocates about what truly constitutes "open source" in the context of AI.</p>

<p>For instance, Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/meta-releases-chatgpt-like-ai-site-and-open-weights-llama-3-model/">Llama 3</a> model, while freely available, doesn't meet the traditional open source criteria as <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">defined</a> by the OSI for software because it <a href="https://llama.meta.com/llama3/license/">imposes license restrictions</a> on usage due to company size or what type of content is produced with the model. The AI image generator <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/">Flux</a> is another "open" model that is not truly open source. Because of this type of ambiguity, we've typically described AI models that include code or weights with restrictions or lack accompanying training data with alternative terms like "open-weights" or "source-available."</p>
<p>To address the issue formally, the OSI—which is well-known for its advocacy for open software standards—has assembled a group of about 70 participants, including researchers, lawyers, policymakers, and activists. Representatives from major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon also joined the effort. The group's <a href="https://opensource.org/deepdive/drafts/open-source-ai-definition-draft-v-0-0-9">current draft</a> (version 0.0.9) definition of open source AI emphasizes "four fundamental freedoms" reminiscent of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition">defining free software</a>: giving users of the AI system permission to use it for any purpose without permission, study how it works, modify it for any purpose, and share with or without modifications.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045225#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045225&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration has been warning for years that some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/caveat-emptor-90-of-tattoo-inks-have-unlabeled-or-mislabeled-ingredients/">tattoo inks</a> are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-recalls-alerts/fda-advises-consumers-tattoo-artists-and-retailers-avoid-using-or-selling-certain-tattoo-inks">brimming with bacteria</a>—a large assortment that, when injected into your skin, can cause inflammatory reactions, allergic hypersensitivity, toxic responses, and, of course, straight-up infections. And, worse yet, the labels that say the inks are sterile are not reliable.</p>
<p>But, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/sierra-stain-recalls-tattoo-pigments-because-possible-health-risk">a recent recall of three tattoo pigments</a> from the same manufacturer does a good job of illustrating the FDA's concerns. The water-based inks, all from Sierra Stain, had a bizarre array of bacteria, which were found at high levels, according to FDA testing.</p>
<p>One ink product—described as "Carolina Blue"—offered a microbial menagerie, with six odd species identified. They included a bacterium that often dwells in the gastrointestinal system and can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10909985/">inflame the mucosal lining of the intestines</a> (<em>Citrobacter braakii</em>), a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897476/'">water-borne bacterium</a> (<em>Cupriavidus pauculus</em>), and several that cause opportunistic infections (<em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849549/">Citrobacter farmer</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6166261/">Achromobacter xylosoxidans</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9499045/">Ochrobactrum anthropi</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187640/">Pseudomonas fluorescens</a></em>). These are bacteria that don't typically go about attacking humans but will if the conditions are right, including when they find themselves inside a human with a compromised immune system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045628#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045628&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The dwarves of J.R.R. Tolkien's writing are, according to the author himself, "a tough, thrawn race for the most part, secretive, retentive of the memory of injuries (and of benefits)," and "lovers… of things that take shape under the hands of the craftsmen rather than things that live by their own life."</p>
<p>Is it secrecy and avarice that explains why <em>The Lord of the Rings: </em><em>Return to Moria</em> spent its first year of existence as an exclusive to the Epic Games Store? None can say for certain. But the survival crafting game has today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/">arrived on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/9n96t1s3l9sb">Xbox</a>, adding to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDBaYWE2Nm9NNkRWM2lVVUQ4NXJ5ZW5WS3ZRQXxBQ3Jtc0tscEd2RVI1UnRkdTFEN2dLT3gxUUExQklCUEhuYVJWSHpST0xTeEpWeGtTbGR3TE1VMXpUZmtUVlczYnkwVlJEUm9pTzJSMkZqNUxDbWdwMGItaHlUSS1YckQ5ejlHdVBzMERaZVZEdXEwczJUc256bw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.playstation.com%2Fconcept..&amp;v=cnt7N3H49IE">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-f01344">EGS</a> platforms and bringing a 1.3 "Golden Update" to them all.

<p>The Golden Update grants new and existing players a procedurally generated sandbox mode to complement the game's (also generated) campaign, new weapons and armor, crossplay between all platforms with up to eight players, specific sliders for difficulty settings, and… a pause function in offline single-player, which seemingly was not there before.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045509#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045509&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The federal government awarded another $521 million in EV charger funding today. It's the latest tranche of money to be awarded <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/heres-how-the-government-plans-to-make-ev-chargers-common-and-reliable/">from a $7.5 billion program</a> authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to build out <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/four-fast-chargers-every-50-miles-us-unveils-ev-infrastructure-plan/">fast chargers along interstate highways</a> as well as bringing charging infrastructure to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/govt-opens-2-5-billion-for-ev-chargers-in-rural-and-underserved-areas/">underserved communities</a>.</p>
<p>$321 million from today's announcement will be spent on 41 different projects across the country—these projects are a mix of level 2 AC chargers as well as DC fast chargers. The remaining $200 million will continue funding DC fast chargers along designated highway corridors.</p>
<p>The Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, which administers the federal funding, called out a $15 million project to install chargers at 53 sites in Milwaukee and a $3.9 million project to install publicly accessible chargers on the Sioux Reservation in North Dakota as examples of the latest awards.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045600#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045600&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A combination documentary and classic game compilation called <em>Tetris Forever</em> is headed to PC, Nintendo Switch, and other platforms later this year, according to an announcement.</p>
<p>The game will include 15 Tetris games, from an "accurate" version of the first <em>Tetris</em> for the Electronika 60 to an NES version of the game and more, including <em>Tetris 2 + Bombliss</em>, <em>Super Tetris 3</em>, and <em>Tetris Battle Gaiden</em>, among others.</p>
<p>In addition to that, it will feature a new take called <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, which will see players jumping "between gameplay styles from across the series" in real time as they complete each board. The game will support up to four players.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045569#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045569&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Beloved American children's author and illustrator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Sendak">Maurice Sendak</a> probably needs no introduction. His 1963 book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are"><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em></a>, is an all-time classic in the picture genre that has delighted generations of kids. It has sold over 19 million copies worldwide, won countless awards, and inspired a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are_(opera)">children's opera</a> and a critically acclaimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are_(film)">2009 feature film adaptation</a>, as well as being spoofed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Slept_Too_Little">an episode</a> of <em>The Simpsons. </em></p>
<p>But one might be surprised to learn (as we were) that a teenage Sendak published his first professional illustrations in a 1947 popular science book about nuclear physics, co-authored by his high school physics teacher: <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3375910&amp;seq=7"><em>Atomics for the Millions</em></a>. Science historian Ryan Dahn came across a copy in the Niels Bohr Library &amp; Archives at the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Maryland, and wrote <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/online/43498">a short online article</a> about the book for Physics Today, complete with scans of Sendak's most striking illustrations.</p>
<p>Born in Brooklyn to Polish-Jewish parents, Sendak acknowledged that his childhood had been a sad one, overshadowed by losing many extended family members during the Holocaust. That, combined with health issues that confined him to his bed, compelled the young Sendak to find solace in books. When Sendak was 12, he watched Walt Disney's <em>Fantasia</em>, which inspired him to become an illustrator.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044722#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044722&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has announced a major change on its leadership team: Longtime Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri will step down from his role on January 1, 2025.</p>
<p>Maestri has, by all appearances, had a resoundingly successful run since he took on the CFO role a decade ago in 2014. In his tenure, Apple had its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/26/apple-to-replace-cfo-luca-maestri-on-jan-1.html">strongest fiscal decade ever</a>, as the company's net income more than doubled.</p>
<p>Apple stock is worth nine times what it was when he stepped into the job. Certainly, that can't be attributed exclusively to the company's CFO, but it appears Maestri navigated both the popularity of the iPhone and the company's shift to services (which make five times more money than they did earlier in his time as CFO) well.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045523#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045523&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T agreed to pay a $950,000 fine for an August 2023 outage in four states in which the carrier failed to deliver 911 calls and did not make timely notifications of the outage to eight 911 call centers. "As part of the settlement, AT&amp;T will implement a three-year compliance plan designed to ensure future compliance with the FCC's 911 and outage notification rules," the Federal Communications Commission said in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-405007A1.pdf">press release</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>The 2023 outage lasted 1 hour and 14 minutes, affecting users in Illinois, Kansas, Texas, and Wisconsin. It resulted in over 400 failed 911 calls.</p>
<p>"The 911 outage occurred during testing of portions of AT&amp;T's 911 network," the FCC said. "During the testing, an AT&amp;T contractor's technician inadvertently disabled a portion of the network, and AT&amp;T's system did not automatically adjust to accommodate the disabled portion of the network, resulting in the outage. The testing was not associated with any planned maintenance activities and, thus, did not undergo the stringent technical review that would have otherwise been conducted."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045525#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045525&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After years of bickering with the Biden administration about vaccine misinformation, Mark Zuckerberg has now accused the White House of "repeatedly" pressuring Facebook for months "to censor certain COVID-19 content" in 2021 that Facebook supposedly would not have taken down without pressure.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Zuckerberg-letter-3.pdf">letter</a> to the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Monday, the Meta CEO claimed that senior officials from the Biden administration "expressed a lot of frustration" when Facebook pushed back on certain content removal requests. According to Zuckerberg, the Biden administration didn't just want misinformation taken down, but also "humor and satire."</p>
<p>"Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take the content down, and we own our decisions, including COVID-19 related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure," Zuckerberg wrote, taking accountability for his platform's actions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045489#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045489&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malicious hackers likely working on behalf of the Chinese government have been exploiting a high-severity zero-day vulnerability that allowed them to infect at least four US-based ISPs with malware that steals credentials used by downstream customers, researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The vulnerability resides in the <a href="https://versa-networks.com/documents/datasheets/versa-director.pdf">Versa Director</a>, a virtualization platform that allows ISPs and managed service providers to manage complex networking infrastructures from a single dashboard, researchers from Black Lotus Labs, the research arm of security firm Lumen, <a href="https://blog.lumen.com/taking-the-crossroads-the-versa-director-zero-day-exploitation">said</a>. The attacks, which began no later than June 12 and are likely ongoing, allow the threat actors to install "VersaMem,” the name Lumen gave to a custom web shell that gives remote administrative control of Versa Director systems.</p>
<h2>Getting admin control of ISP infrastructure</h2>
<p>The administrative control allows VersaMem to run with the necessary privileges to hook the Versa authentication methods, meaning the web shell can hijack the execution flow to make it introduce new functions. One of the functions VersaMem added includes capturing credentials at the moment an ISP customer enters them and before they are cryptographically hashed. Once in possession of the credentials, the threat actors work to compromise the customers. Black Lotus didn’t identify any of the affected ISPs, MSPs, or downstream customers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045401#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045401&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="text-align: left;">Since around 2013, Jonathan Mann’s sole job has been writing and posting a song online each day. With titles ranging from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnHIS1AJu5I">Yeah, I’m Rocking a Headband</a>” to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7__L9VhZ6o">Joe Biden, Retire</a>” (posted July 1), his pop tunes are at turns whimsical and topical. Some go viral.</p>
<p>Still, says the Connecticut-based Mann (aka “Song a Day Mann”), monetization was a “slog.” Sales from distribution platform Bandcamp and advertising revenue from YouTube “never amounted to much.” Conference performances and jingle contests filled the gaps. Then came NFTs, which let Mann attach one-of-a-kind blockchain-based tokens to his songs so buyers could easily purchase unique copies online. The tech transformed his music-selling game.</p>

<p>In 2017, the Des Moines, Iowa, lawyer Philip Colt Moss was facing felony drug charges after a raid on his townhome turned up marijuana, hash, OxyContin, Klonopin, Xanax, zolpidem (the active ingredient in Ambien), and "four pills that contained methylphenidate" (the active ingredient in Ritalin).</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last week, a hobbyist experimenting with the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/">Flux</a> AI image synthesis model <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ex0yg1/now_that_we_have_flux_it_is_possible_to_train/">discovered</a> that it's unexpectedly good at rendering custom-trained reproductions of typefaces. While far more efficient methods of displaying computer fonts have existed for decades, the new technique is useful for AI image hobbyists because Flux is capable of rendering depictions of accurate text, and users can now directly insert words rendered in custom fonts into AI image generations.</p>

<p>We've had the technology to accurately produce smooth computer-rendered fonts in custom shapes since the 1980s (1970s in the research space), so creating an AI-replicated font isn't big news by itself. But a new technique means you could see a particular font appear in AI-generated images, say, of a chalkboard menu at a photorealistic restaurant or a printed business card being held by a cyborg fox.</p>
<p>Shortly after the emergence of mainstream AI image synthesis models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a> in 2022, some people began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/10iixwp/anyway_to_create_an_image_of_a_person_wearing/">wondering</a>: How can I insert my own product, clothing item, character, or style into an AI-generated image? One answer that emerged came in the form of LoRA (low-rank adaptation), a technique <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">discovered</a> in 2021 that allows users to augment knowledge in an AI base model with modular add-ons that have been custom-trained.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045327#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045327&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's more bad news for the company behind an experimental MDMA therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, which the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/mdma-for-ptsd-three-studies-retracted-on-heels-of-fda-rejection/">roundly rejected earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/fda-widens-probe-of-ecstasy-based-drug-studies-510307b0">a report from The Wall Street Journal</a>, the FDA is now expanding an investigation into clinical trials behind the experimental psychedelic therapy—even though the agency has already rejected it. Agency investigators reportedly interviewed four additional people last week, asking questions regarding whether the trials underreported side effects.</p>
<p>People involved in the trial have previously alleged, among other things, that ill effects, such as suicidal thoughts, went undocumented, and trial participants were discouraged from reporting them to bolster the chances of FDA approval. Overall, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/">the MDMA trials faced crushing criticism</a> amid the FDA's review, with outside experts and agency advisers calling out allegations of sexual misconduct at one trial site, as well as flaws in overall trial designs, multiple sources of biases, and claims that the company behind the therapy, Lykos, fostered a cult-like belief in psychedelics.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045406#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045406&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Samsung will provide operating system updates for its newer TVs for at least seven years, the company announced last week. The updates will first apply to some TVs released in 2023 and TVs released in March 2024.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=223535">Business Korea</a>, Samsung made the announcement regarding the Tizen OS at the Digital Research Lab of Samsung Electronics' Suwon Campus in Gyeonggi Province. As spotted by <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1724665225">FlatPanelsHD</a>, the announcement follows previously announced plans from Samsung to provide <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/the-galaxy-s24-gets-seven-years-of-updates-1300-titanium-ultra-model/">seven years of software updates for the Galaxy S24</a> smartphone series.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/electronics/newsView/ked202408230003">Korea Economic Daily</a>, speaking at last week's event, Samsung Electronics' president of the Visual Display Business Division, Yoon Seok-woo, said: "With the seven-year free upgrade of Tizen applied to AI TVs, we will widen the gap in market share with Chinese companies."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045367#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045367&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
