                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>At this point, anyone who has been following AI research is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-can-now-generate-cd-quality-music-from-text-and-its-only-getting-better/">long familiar</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/googles-new-ai-model-creates-songs-from-text-descriptions-of-moods-sounds/">generative models</a> that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">synthesize speech</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">melodic music</a> from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/mit-license-text-becomes-viral-sad-girl-piano-ballad-generated-by-ai/">nothing but text prompting</a>. Nvidia's <a href="https://d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net/publications/FUGATTO.pdf">newly revealed "Fugatto" model</a> looks to go a step further, using new synthetic training methods and inference-level combination techniques to "transform any mix of music, voices, and sounds," including the synthesis of sounds that have never existed.</p>
<p>While Fugatto isn't available for public testing yet, <a href="https://fugatto.github.io/">a sample-filled website</a> showcases how Fugatto can be used to dial a number of distinct audio traits and descriptions up or down, resulting in everything from the sound of saxophones barking to people speaking underwater to ambulance sirens singing in a kind of choir. While the results on display can be a bit hit or miss, the vast array of capabilities on display here helps support Nvidia's description of Fugatto as "a Swiss Army knife for sound."</p>
<h2>You’re only as good as your data</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net/publications/FUGATTO.pdf">an explanatory research paper</a>, over a dozen Nvidia researchers explain the difficulty in crafting a training dataset that can "reveal meaningful relationships between audio and language." While standard language models can often infer how to handle various instructions from the text-based data itself, it can be hard to generalize descriptions and traits from audio without more explicit guidance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/nvidias-new-ai-audio-model-can-synthesize-sounds-that-have-never-existed/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court signaled it may take up a case that could determine whether Internet service providers must terminate users who are accused of copyright infringement. In an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112524zor_8m58.pdf">order</a> issued today, the court invited the Department of Justice's solicitor general to file a brief "expressing the views of the United States."</p>
<p>In <em>Sony Music Entertainment v. Cox Communications</em>, the major record labels argue that cable provider Cox should be held liable for failing to terminate users who were repeatedly flagged for infringement based on their IP addresses being connected to torrent downloads. There was a mixed ruling at the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit as the appeals court affirmed a jury's finding that Cox was guilty of willful contributory infringement but reversed a verdict on vicarious infringement "because Cox did not profit from its subscribers' acts of infringement."</p>
<p>That ruling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/court-blocks-1-billion-copyright-ruling-that-punished-isp-for-its-users-piracy/">vacated</a> a $1 billion damages award and ordered a new damages trial. Cox and Sony are both seeking a Supreme Court review. Cox wants to overturn the finding of willful contributory infringement, while Sony wants to reinstate the $1 billion verdict.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/supreme-court-may-decide-whether-isps-must-terminate-users-accused-of-piracy/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Department of Justice lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum kicked things off by telling Brinkema that Google "rigged" ad auctions, allegedly controlling "multiple parts" of services used to place ads all over the Internet, unfairly advantaging itself in three markets, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/technology/google-advertising-monopoly.html">reported</a>.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI keeps deleting data that could allegedly prove the AI company violated copyright laws by training ChatGPT on authors' works. Apparently largely unintentional, the sloppy practice is seemingly dragging out early court battles that could determine whether AI training is fair use.</p>
<p>Most recently, The New York Times <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NYT-v-OpenAI-Data-Deletion-11-20-24.pdf">accused</a> OpenAI of unintentionally erasing programs and search results that the newspaper believed could be used as evidence of copyright abuse.</p>
<p>The NYT apparently spent more than 150 hours extracting training data, while following a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/openai-accused-of-trying-to-profit-off-ai-model-inspection-in-court/">model inspection protocol that OpenAI set up</a> precisely to avoid conducting potentially damning searches of its own database. This process began in October, but by mid-November, the NYT discovered that some of the data gathered had been erased due to what OpenAI called a "glitch."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/tech-problems-plague-openai-court-battles-judge-rejects-a-key-fair-use-defense/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court will hear appeals of a 5th Circuit ruling that called Universal Service fees on phone bills an illegal tax.</p>
<p>The US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/5th-circuit-court-upends-fcc-universal-service-fund-ruling-it-an-illegal-tax/">ruled in July</a> that the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund is unconstitutional and that the fees on phone bills are a "misbegotten tax." The FCC and several non-government groups challenged the ruling, and the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112224zr1_7l48.pdf">agreed to take up the case</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>The Universal Service Fund is an <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/027-5183">$8 billion-a-year</a> system that subsidizes the expansion of telecom networks with grants to Internet service providers and makes access more affordable through programs such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/poor-americans-will-get-9-a-month-to-buy-broadband-or-mobile-data/">Lifeline</a> discounts.

      Ben Schwartz voices the titular character in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>.

<p>Some lucky folks got a heads-up last week that a trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3_(film)"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a> was about to drop when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paramount-made-a-sega-genesis-cartridge-just-to-tease-a-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-next-week">Paramount Pictures released</a> a playable Sega Genesis gaming cartridge to select individuals. Hidden among a mini-game and character posters and accessible by entering a cheat code was the trailer release date. True to its word, Paramount just dropped the final trailer for the third film in the successful franchise. All our favorite characters are back, as well as a couple of new ones, most notably a new villain familiar to fans of the games: Shadow, voiced by Keanu Reeves.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first two films below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/our-fave-speedy-blue-hedgehog-proves-his-worthiness-in-sonic-2-final-trailer/">previously reported</a>, in the first film, Sonic (Ben Schwartz) teamed up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) to stop the sinister mad scientist <a title="Doctor Eggman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Eggman">Dr. Robotnik</a> (Jim Carrey). Robotnik wanted to catch and experiment on the hedgehog, and if he could also frame Tom as a domestic terrorist, even better.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/keanu-reeves-voices-arch-villain-shadow-in-sonic-3-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch">Bloomberg reports</a> that Sony is "in the early stages" of work on a fully portable console that can play PlayStation 5 software. The device is still "likely years away from launch," according to "people familiar with its development" that spoke to Bloomberg anonymously.</p>
<p>The report comes less than a year after the launch of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">the PlayStation Portal</a>, a Sony portable device designed to stream PS5 games running on a console on the same local network. Recently, Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">updated the Portal firmware</a> to let PlayStation Plus subscribers also stream PS5 games from Sony's centralized servers at up to 1080p and 60 fps.</p>
<p>Sony's reported PS5 portable plans also come after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">months of rumors</a> that Microsoft has also been working on a new Xbox console with a portable form factor. In June, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer added fuel to those rumors by directly saying, "I think we should have a handheld, too... I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck... I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/sony-is-reportedly-working-on-a-ps5-portable/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Neutrinos are some of nature’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/neutrinos-are-infuriating-but-we-still-have-to-study-them/">most elusive particles</a>. One hundred trillion fly through your body every second, but each one has only a tiny chance of jostling one of your atoms, a consequence of the incredible weakness of the weak nuclear force that governs neutrino interactions. That tiny chance means that reliably detecting neutrinos takes many more atoms than are in your body. To spot neutrinos colliding with atoms in the atmosphere, experiments have buried <a href="https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/">1,000 tons</a> of heavy water, woven cameras through a <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/about-us/overview/">cubic kilometer</a> of Antarctic ice, and planned to deploy <a href="https://grand.cnrs.fr/">200,000 antennas</a>.</p>
<p>In a field full of ambitious plans, a recent proposal by <a href="https://physics.ku.edu/people/prohira-steven">Steven Prohira</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Kansas, is especially strange. Prohira suggests that instead of using antennas, we could detect the tell-tale signs of atmospheric neutrinos <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14454">by wiring up a forest of trees</a>. His suggestion may turn out to be impossible, but it could also be an important breakthrough. To find out which it is, he'll need to walk a long path, refining prototypes and demonstrating his idea’s merits.</p>
<p>Prohira’s goal is to detect so-called ultra-high-energy neutrinos. Each one of these tiny particles carries more than fifty million times the energy released by uranium during nuclear fission. Their origins are not fully understood, but they are expected to be produced by some of the most powerful events in the Universe, from collapsing stars and pulsars to the volatile environments around the massive black holes at the centers of galaxies. If we could detect these particles more reliably, we could learn more about these extreme astronomical events.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/how-physics-moves-from-wild-ideas-to-actual-experiments/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the wee hours of December 26, 2004, a massive 9.2 earthquake occurred in the Indian Ocean, generating an equally massive tsunami that caused unprecedented devastation to 14 countries and killed more than 230,000 people. Twenty years later, National Geographic has revisited one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history with a new documentary: <a href="https://www.natgeotv.com/za/special/tsunami-race-against-time"><em>Tsunami: Race Against Time</em></a>. The four-part series offers an in-depth account of the tsunami's destructive path, told from the perspectives of those who survived, as well as the scientists, journalists, doctors, nurses, and everyday heroes who worked to save as many as possible.</p>
<p>Geophysicist Barry Hirshorn—now with Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego—was on duty at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii that day (3 pm on Christmas Day local time). His pager went off, indicating that seismic waves had set off a seismometer in Australia, and Hirshorn rushed to the control room to locate the quake's epicenter with his colleague, Stuart Weinstein.</p>
<p>They initially pegged the quake at 8.5 magnitude. (It was later upgraded to 8.9 and subsequently to a whopping 9.2 to 9.3 magnitude.) But despite its strength, they initially did not think the quake would generate a tsunami, at least in the Pacific. And such events were incredibly rare in the Indian Ocean.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/survivors-mark-20th-anniversary-of-deadly-2004-tsunami/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Congressman Jerry Nadler of New York have called on government bodies to investigate what they allege is the “predatory pricing” of .com web addresses, the Internet’s prime real estate.</p>
<p>In a letter delivered today to the Department of Justice and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a branch of the Department of Commerce that advises the president, the two Democrats accuse VeriSign, the company that administers the .com top-level domain, of abusing its market dominance to overcharge customers.</p>
<p>In 2018, under the Donald Trump administration, the NTIA <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/biden-administration-should-end-verisign-monopoly-over-com-domain-groups-say" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/biden-administration-should-end-verisign-monopoly-over-com-domain-groups-say" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/biden-administration-should-end-verisign-monopoly-over-com-domain-groups-say"}'>modified the terms on</a> how much VeriSign could charge for .com domains.

              <![CDATA[<p>“If we go back to the early 1900s, this is when the idea was first proposed that memories are physically stored in some location within the brain,” says Michael R. Williamson, a researcher at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. For a long time, neuroscientists thought that the storage of memory in the brain was the job of engrams, ensembles of neurons that activate during a learning event. But it turned out this wasn’t the whole picture.</p>
<p>Williamson’s research investigated the role astrocytes, non-neuron brain cells, play in the read-and-write operations that go on in our heads. “Over the last 20 years the role of astrocytes has been understood better. We’ve learned that they can activate neurons. The addition we have made to that is showing that there are subsets of astrocytes that are active and involved in storing specific memories,” Williamson says in describing a new study his lab has published.</p>
<p>One consequence of this finding: Astrocytes could be artificially manipulated to suppress or enhance a specific memory, leaving all other memories intact.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/tweaking-non-neural-brain-cells-can-cause-memories-to-fade/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[“Nearest Neighbor Attack” finally lets Russia’s Fancy Bear into target’s Wi-Fi network.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>One of 2024's coolest hacking tales occurred two years ago, but it wasn't revealed to the public until Friday at the Cyberwarcon conference in Arlington, Virginia. Hackers with ties to Fancy Bear—the spy agency operated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRU_(Russian_Federation)">Russia’s GRU</a>—broke into the network of a high-value target after first compromising a Wi-Fi-enabled device in a nearby building and using it to exploit compromised accounts on the target’s Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>The attack, from a group security firm Volexity calls GruesomeLarch, shows the boundless lengths well-resourced hackers will go to hack high-value targets, presumably only after earlier hack attempts haven’t worked. When the GruesomeLarch cabal couldn’t get into the target network using easier methods, they hacked a Wi-Fi-enabled device in a nearby building and used it to breach the target’s network next door. After the first neighbor’s network was disinfected, the hackers successfully performed the same attack on a device of a second neighbor.</p>
<h2>Too close for comfort</h2>
<p>“This is a fascinating attack where a foreign adversary essentially conducted a close access operation while being physically quite far away,” Steven Adair, a researcher and the president of Volexity, wrote in an email. “They were able to launch an attack that historically had required being in close proximity to the target but found a way to conduct it in a way which completely eliminated the risk of them being caught in the real world.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/spies-hack-wi-fi-networks-in-far-off-land-to-launch-attack-on-target-next-door/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a couple of years without much happening, smart displays are in the news again. Aside from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/">smart TVs</a>, consumer screens that connect to the Internet have never reached a mainstream audience. However, there seems to be a resurgence in efforts to make smart displays more popular. The approaches that some companies are taking are better than those of others, revealing the good, the bad, and the ugly behind the push.</p>
<p>Of note here, smart TVs are not smart displays. Unlike the majority of smart displays, smart TVs are mainstream tech. So, we will mostly focus on devices like the Google Nest Hub Max or Amazon Echo Show (as pictured above).</p>
<h2><strong>The good</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to emerging technology, a great indication of innovation is the degree to which a product addresses a real user problem.

              <![CDATA[<p>Emboldened by Donald Trump's election win, Republicans are seeking big changes to a $42.45 billion broadband deployment program. Their plan could delay distribution of government funding and remove or relax a requirement that ISPs accepting subsidies must offer low-cost Internet plans.</p>
<p>US Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today issued a <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2024/11/sen-cruz-warns-biden-harris-ntia-big-changes-ahead-for-multi-billion-dollar-broadband-boondoggle">press release</a> titled, "Sen. Cruz Warns Biden-Harris NTIA: Big Changes Ahead for Multi-Billion-Dollar Broadband Boondoggle." Cruz, who will soon be chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, is angry about how the National Telecommunications and Information Administration has implemented the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program that was created by Congress in November 2021.</p>
<p>The NTIA <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/blog/2024/every-state-and-territory-ready-implement-internet-all">announced this week</a> that it has approved the funding plans submitted by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five US territories, which are slated to receive federal money and dole it out to broadband providers for network expansions. Texas was the <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2024/biden-harris-administration-approves-texas-internet-all-initial-proposal">last state to gain approval</a> in what the NTIA called "a major milestone on the road to connecting everyone in America to affordable, reliable high-speed Internet service."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/ted-cruz-wants-to-overhaul-42b-broadband-program-nix-low-cost-requirement/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-amazon-trainium">announced</a> that Amazon has increased its investment in the AI startup by $4 billion, bringing its total stake to $8 billion while maintaining its minority investor position. Anthropic makes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">Claude</a>, an AI assistant rival to OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>One reason behind the deal involves chips. The computing demands of training large AI models have made access to specialized processors a requirement for AI companies. While <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/nvidias-dominance-puts-ai-industry-in-dire-danger-groups-warn-doj/">Nvidia currently dominates</a> the AI chip market with customers that include most major tech companies, some cloud providers like Amazon have begun developing their own AI-specific processors.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Anthropic will train and deploy its foundation models using Amazon's custom-built <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/">Trainium</a> (for training AI models) and its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/">Inferentia</a> chips (for AI inference, the term for running trained models). The company will also work with Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/annapurna-labs">Annapurna Labs</a> division to advance processor development for AI applications.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/amazon-pours-another-4b-into-anthropic-openais-biggest-rival/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On the eve of the rise of the Maya civilization, people living in what’s now Belize turned a whole wetland into a giant network of fish traps big enough to feed thousands of people.</p>
<p>We already know that the Maya turned swamps into breadbaskets by draining and building raised blocks of land for maize fields. However, a recent survey of a wetland in what’s now Belize suggests that the rise of the Maya civilization was fueled not just by maize but by tons of fish every year. University of New Hampshire archaeologist Eleanor Harrison-Buck and her colleagues recently mapped a network of channels and ponds for trapping fish, built just before the Maya civilization rose to prominence.</p>
<h2>Fish in a barrel</h2>
<p>Harrison-Buck and her fellow archeologists used drones and Google Earth data to map 108 kilometers of ancient channels that zigzag across 42 square kilometers of wetland in Belize’s Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary. The result is a network of channels and ponds that looks remarkably like the fish traps found farther south in Bolivia, built several centuries after the ones at Crooked Tree. Radiocarbon dating of material buried in the bottom of one channel suggests that the network has been around for at least 4,000 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/ancient-fish-trapping-network-supported-the-rise-of-maya-civilization/">Read full article</a></p>
