            This is Google's new streaming box, the Google TV Streamer. It's meant to sit on your media console instead of hanging from your TV's USB port like the Chromecast.                          [credit:

<p>Google is discontinuing the Chromecast brand and pulling its Chromecast hardware off the market after 11 years, but it's not leaving the streaming device business.</p>
<p>Rather, it's launching a new product called the Google TV Streamer that competes with high-end streaming boxes like the Apple TV or the Roku Ultra.</p>
<p>The new device is not a direct replacement for the Chromecast dongles, though, as it has a different design and is substantially more expensive. Google is replacing 2020's $50 4K Chromecast with Google TV USB dongle with an HDMI set-top box that costs $100.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041337#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041337&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA on Tuesday <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/08/06/nasa-adjusts-crew-9-launch-date-for-operational-flexibility/">confirmed</a> that it is delaying the launch of its next astronaut mission to the International Space Station, Crew 9, until at least September 24. This is a significant slip from the previous date of August 18.</p>
<p>The space agency said the delay was necessary for "operational flexibility" as it continues to deliberate on the viability of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. In the release, NASA stated, "This adjustment allows more time for mission managers to finalize return planning for the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test currently docked to the orbiting laboratory."</p>
<p>NASA also cited other reasons for the delay, including a deconfliction of traffic at the space station, such as a Soyuz launch scheduled for mid-September.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041400#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041400&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Students in Singapore are scrambling after a security breach wiped notes and all other data from school-issued iPads and Chromebooks running the mobile device management app Mobile Guardian.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mobile-guardian-application-remove-cybersecurity-incident-moe-4526676">news reports</a>, the mass wiping came as a shock to multiple students in Singapore, where the Mobile Guardian app has been the country’s official mobile device management provider for public schools <a href="https://www.mobileguardian.com/mobile-guardian-appointed-official-singapore-moe-vendor/">since 2020</a>. Singapore’s Ministry of Education <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20240805-mobile-guardian-device-management-application-to-be-removed-from-personal-learning-devices">said Monday</a> that roughly 13,000 students from 26 secondary schools had their devices wiped remotely in the incident. The agency said it will remove the Mobile Guardian from all iPads and Chromebooks it issues.</p>
<h2>Second breach in 4 months</h2>
<p>Also on Monday, Mobile Guardian revealed its platform had been breached in a “security incident that affected users globally, including on the North America, European, and Singapore instances. This resulted in a small percentage of devices to be unenrolled from Mobile Guardian and their devices wiped remotely. There is no evidence to suggest that the perpetrator had access to users’ data.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041407#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041407&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A Colorado judge has ordered a couple to pay more than $950 million for allegedly giving grieving families urns full of fake ashes and running a bug-infested funeral home facility where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/horrifying-funeral-home-ordered-to-pay-950m-over-fake-ashes-rotting-bodies/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1">190 improperly stored bodies</a> were found in various states of decay.</p>
<p>The judgment was issued in a civil class-action lawsuit against Jon and Carie Hallford, who owned the Return to Nature Funeral Home in Penrose, Colorado. It is the first high-profile case against the couple to return a ruling.</p>
<p>The bodies and the extent of the couple's alleged fraud were discovered late last year after area residents reported a<a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/10/stench-leads-officials-to-189-rotting-corpses-at-taxidermists-funeral-home/"> putrid stench emanating from the Penrose facility</a>. The discovery sparked a massive investigation that came to include local, state, and federal investigators and responders. The FBI deployed a team of agents trained to respond to mass casualty events, such as airline crashes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041392#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041392&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's X Corp. today sued the World Federation of Advertisers and several large corporations, claiming they "conspired, along with dozens of non-defendant co-conspirators, to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue" from the social network formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>"We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war," Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1820849880283107725">wrote</a> today, a little over eight months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/elon-musk-on-x-antisemitism-controversy-dont-advertise-go-f-yourself/">telling boycotting advertisers</a> to "go fuck yourself."</p>

The other defendants are Unilever PLC; Unilever United States; Mars, Incorporated; CVS Health Corporation; and Ørsted A/S. Those companies are all members of GARM. X itself is still <a href="https://wfanet.org/leadership/garm/members-governance">listed</a> as one of the group's members.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041383#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041383&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the parent of a younger child, I can tell you that getting a kid to respond the way you want can require careful expectation-setting. Especially when we’re trying something new for the first time, I find that the more detail I can provide, the better he is able to anticipate events and roll with the punches.</p>
<p>I bring this up because testers of the new Apple Intelligence AI features in the recently released macOS Sequoia beta have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/1ehivcp/comment/lfzi379/">discovered plaintext JSON files</a> that list a whole bunch of conditions meant to keep the generative AI tech from being unhelpful or inaccurate. I don’t mean to humanize generative AI algorithms, because they don’t deserve to be, but the carefully phrased lists of instructions remind me of what it’s like to try to give basic instructions to (or explain morality to) an entity that isn’t quite prepared to understand it.</p>
<p>The files in question are stored in the <code>/System/Library/AssetsV2/com_apple_MobileAsset_UAF_FM_GenerativeModels/purpose_auto</code> folder on Macs running the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta that have also opted into the Apple Intelligence beta. That folder contains 29 <code>metadata.json</code> files, several of which include a few sentences of what appear to be plain-English <a href="https://promptengineering.org/system-prompts-in-large-language-models/">system prompts</a> to set behavior for an AI chatbot powered by a large-language model (LLM).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041307#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041307&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>WordStar's most recent claim to fame might be that it's the word processing application on which George R.R. Martin is still not finishing <em>A</em> <em>Song of Ice and Fire.</em></p>
<p>But many writers loved and still love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar">WordStar</a>, a word processor notably good for actual writing. As computers moved on from DOS to Windows, and word programs grew to encompass features that strayed far from organizing words on a page, WordStar hung back, whether in DOS emulation or in the hearts of its die-hard fans.</p>
<p>One of those fans is Robert J. Sawyer, an award-winning science fiction author still using the program last updated in 1992. Deciding that the app is now "abandonware," Sawyer recently put together as complete a version of WordStar 7 as might exist. He bundled together over 1,000 pages of scanned manuals that came with WordStar, related utilities, his own README guidance, ready-to-run versions of DOSBox-X and VDosPlus, and WordStar 7 Rev. D and posted them on his website as the "<a href="https://sfwriter.com/ws7.htm">Complete WordStar 7.0 Archive</a>."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041325#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041325&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The discovery of <em>Homo floresiensis</em>, often termed a hobbit, confused a lot of people. Not only was it tiny in stature, but it shared some features with both <em>Homo erectus</em> and earlier <em>Australopithecus</em> species and lived well after the origin of modern humans. So, its precise position within the hominin family tree has been the subject of ongoing debate—one that hasn't been clarified by the discovery of the similarly diminutive <em>Homo luzonensis</em> in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Today, researchers are releasing a paper that describes bones from a diminutive hominin that occupied the island of Flores much earlier than the hobbits. And they argue that, while it still shares an odd mix of features, it is most closely related to <em>Homo erectus</em>, the first hominin species to spread across the globe.</p>
<h2>Remarkably small</h2>
<p>The bones come from a site on Flores called Mata Menge, where the bones were found in a large layer of sediment. Slight wear suggests that many of them were probably brought to the site by a gentle flood. Dating from layers above and below where the fossils were found limits their age to somewhere between 650,000 and 775,000 years ago. Most of the remains are teeth and fragments of jaw bone, which can be suggestive of body size, but not definitive. But the new finds include a fragment of the upper arm bone, the humerus, which is more directly proportional to body size.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041345#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041345&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Illinois has changed its Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) to dramatically limit the financial penalties faced by companies that illegally obtain or sell biometric identifiers such as eye scans, face scans, fingerprints, and voiceprints.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004&amp;ChapterID=57">2008 law</a> required companies to obtain written consent for the collection or use of biometric data and allowed victims to sue for damages of $1,000 for each negligent violation and $5,000 for each intentional or reckless violation. But an amendment <a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=2979&amp;GAID=17&amp;GA=103&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;LegID=152094&amp;SessionID=112">enacted on Friday</a> states that multiple violations related to a single person's biometric data will be counted as only one violation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://legiscan.com/IL/text/SB2979/2023">amendment</a>, approved by the Illinois Legislature in May and signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker on August 2, provides "that a private entity that more than once collects or discloses a person's biometric identifier or biometric information from the same person in violation of the Act has committed a single violation for which the aggrieved person is entitled to, at most, one recovery."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041322#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041322&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>US workers who work remotely are 27 percent more likely to look forward to doing their job, according to a survey of over 4,400 employees aged 18 and older.</p>
<p>The survey from Great Place to Work took place in July 2023, which was "the third year of an ongoing market study of US workplaces," according to the report entitled "Return-to-Office Mandates and the Future of Work" (<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-Future-of-Work.pdf">PDF</a>). Of the participants, 51 percent were female, 49 percent were male, and less than 1 percent were "non-binary or other gender," according to Great Place to Work. In terms of roles, half were "individual contributors," 25 percent were "frontline managers," 20 percent were mid-level managers, and 5 percent were executives. Eighty-eight percent were full-time workers versus part-time.</p>
<p>The survey also found that remote workers were 23 percent more likely to say they have "a psychologically and emotionally healthy workplace," 19 percent were more likely to cite "high levels of cooperation," and 18 percent were more likely to say that people avoid office politics and backstabbing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041221#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041221&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Robots have been working in car factories for decades now, starting with machines performing some welds on a General Motors production line back in 1961. Now, robots work alongside people on production lines, excelling at tasks like manipulating parts too heavy for humans to easily lift or welding or bonding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/misaligned-factory-robot-may-have-sparked-chevy-bolt-battery-fires/">with more precision than we can manage</a>.</p>
<p>Those robots <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/small-batch-evs-and-plenty-of-robots-hyundais-new-innovation-center/">mostly look like big multi-axis arms</a>, but a new breed of two-armed, two-legged robots is being tested in car factories. BMW is the latest automaker to try them at its factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google's story over the last two decades has been a tale as old as time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> for growth. The once-beloved startup—with its unofficial "Don't Be Evil" motto—has instead become a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">major Internet monopolist</a>, as a federal judge ruled on Monday, dominating the market for online search. Google is also well-known for its data-harvesting practices, for constantly killing off products, and for facilitating the rise of brain-cell-destroying YouTubers who make me Fear for Today's Youth. (Maybe that last one is just me?)</p>
<p>Google's rapid rise from "scrappy search engine with doodles" to "dystopic mega-corporation" has been remarkable in many ways, especially when you consider just how much goodwill the company squandered so quickly. Along the way, though, Google has achieved one unexpected result: In a divided America, it offers just about everyone something to hate.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the players hating Google today.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041185#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041185&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For all the noise about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/02/your-current-pc-probably-doesnt-have-an-ai-processor-but-your-next-one-might/">neural processing units</a> (NPUs) and the generative AI capabilities of new and upcoming chips, NPUs don't yet do all that much in terms of day-to-day, bread-and-butter computing.</p>

<p>So when I'm evaluating new processors that make a big deal about their AI processing capabilities, my unofficial rule of thumb has been to <em>mostly</em> ignore the AI stuff and focus on more traditional metrics: If the AI bubble popped tomorrow and the hype wave dissipated, would these still be worthwhile chips? Qualcomm's Snapdragon X SoCs were launched alongside <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">a pile of AI-related software announcements</a>, but they're impressive mostly because they're very good at basic computer-y things: They feel fast, and they enable good battery life.</p>
<p>Despite the "AI" that AMD has added to the name, I'm looking at the new Ryzen AI 300-series pretty much the same way. The test system AMD provided—a 16-inch <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606/">Asus ZenBook UM5606W</a> with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and an integrated Radeon 890M GPU in it—shows that the chip is a small but significant bump over the older Ryzen 7000- and 8000-series laptop CPUs. For various reasons, those chips were already a bit easier to recommend than Intel's 13th-generation Core processors and both Ultra and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/intel-freshens-up-its-old-laptop-and-desktop-cpus-with-speed-bumps-new-names/">non-Ultra</a> Intel Core CPUs, and the Ryzen AI upgrade provides solid boosts to CPU performance and graphics while still maintaining good power efficiency and battery life.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040553#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040553&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Lamborghini has now launched its second plug-in hybrid. The first was the V-12-powered Revuelto, a $600,000 supercar with 1,001 hp (746 kW), all-wheel drive, and three electric motors, which debuted last year. It can hit 60 mph (98 km/h) in about two seconds and can achieve a top speed of 217 mph (350 km/h). But if we’re relying on Lamborghini’s hybridization to save the planet from melting, we’re burying our heads in oil-soaked sand. True, its newest hybrid, the Urus SE, can travel 37 miles (60 km) on EV power alone, and hybridizing it cuts emissions by 80 percent. Since the non-hybrid Urus V8 gets a combined 16 mpg (14.7 L/100 km), this shouldn’t be considered a major triumph.</p>
<p>A far bigger deal would be if brands like Lamborghini could crack the code on passion—making what they already do but with electric vehicles, somehow without sanding away the sex appeal.</p>
<p>Lamborghini has committed to having at least two EVs on the road by 2030, and it has already shown the Lanzador EV concept, a kind of hypercar crossover. But Lamborghini Chief Technology Officer Rouven Mohr, who sat down with us to discuss the Urus SE, says that technically, there’s still an issue with EVs retaining the bombast that makes the Italian super sports car brand what it is. Counterintuitively, Mohr argued that AI might enable this next leap.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041226#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041226&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Back in the 1950s, when color TV was invented, everything was simple. TVs were either color or black-and-white, and you could tell at a glance which was which. Today, you can find TVs and monitors that somehow promise <i>more</i> colors, but what does that mean? And why do manufacturers use confusing jargon like color spaces and color gamuts to explain it? Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>Most likely, you've seen the terms “color space” or “color gamut” while <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/01/what-is-hdr-tv/">shopping for a high-dynamic-range TV</a>, but you’ll also see them pop up around certain <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-computer-monitors/">computer monitors</a>, especially ones designed for gaming. Sometimes a manufacturer will say that a display covers some percentage of a particular color space, like DCI-P3 or Rec. 2020.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Intel will be releasing a microcode update to prevent further damage to crashing 13th- and 14th-generation desktop processors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/intel-has-finally-tracked-down-the-problem-making-13th-and-14th-gen-cpus-crash/">sometime this month</a> if it can stick to its previously announced schedule. This fix should be available via BIOS updates from PC and motherboard makers and from Microsoft as a Windows update. But it will take time for those updates to roll out to users, and Intel has said that processors that are already exhibiting crashes have been permanently damaged and won't be fixed by the microcode update.</p>

<p>In an effort to provide peace of mind to buyers and cover anyone whose CPU is subtly damaged but not showing explicit signs of instability, Intel is extending the warranty on all affected 13th- and 14th-generation CPUs by an additional two years, Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-an-extra-two-years-of-warranty-for-its-chips-amid-crashing-and-instability-issues-longer-warranty-applies-to-13th-and-14th-gen-core-processors">reports</a>. This raises the warranty on a new boxed Intel CPU from three years to five, and it applies to both previously purchased processors and new ones that are bought from today onward. For processors that came installed in pre-built PCs, Intel says users are covered, but that they should reach out to their PC's manufacturer for support. Those customers should only contact Intel directly if they have a problem getting a new CPU from the PC company.</p>
<p>Though owners of high-end chips like the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K were the most frequently affected by the crashing issue, Intel says that any 13th- or 14th-generation desktop CPU with a base power of 65 W or higher could ultimately be affected. Intel's <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1620853#M75727">list of affected CPUs</a> includes K- and KF-series CPUs from the 13th- and 14th-generation Core i9, Core i7, and Core i5 families, and also non-K CPUs in the Core i9 and Core i7 families. But slower, more budget-oriented chips like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/intels-core-i5-is-the-best-bargain-in-cpus-right-now-but-which-should-you-get/">Core i5-13400</a> aren't listed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040742#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040742&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Howdy, Arsians! Last year, we partnered with IBM to host <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2023/10/are-you-near-houston-come-to-our-it-event-at-space-center-houston-on-november-1/">an in-person event in the Houston area</a> where we all gathered together, had some cocktails, and talked about resiliency and the future of IT. Location always matters for things like this, and so we hosted it at Space Center Houston and had our cocktails amidst cool space artifacts. In addition to learning a bunch of neat stuff, it was awesome to hang out with all the amazing folks who turned up at the event. Much fun was had!</p>
<p>This year, we're back partnering with IBM again and we're looking to repeat that success with not one, but <em>two</em> in-person gatherings—each featuring a series of panel discussions with experts and capping off with a happy hour for hanging out and mingling. Where last time we went central, this time we're going to the coasts—both east and west. Read on for details!</p>
<h2>September: San Jose, California</h2>
<p>Our first event will be in <a href="https://events.arstechnica.com/ibm_beyond-the-buzz-sanjose/home?ref=ArsEditApplicant">San Jose on September 18</a>, and it's titled "Beyond the Buzz: An Infrastructure Future with GenAI and What Comes Next." The idea will be to explore what generative AI means for the future of data management. The topics we'll be discussing include:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037812#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037812&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Tesla recorded <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/tesla-reports-its-first-annual-profit/">its first annual profit in 2020</a>, it had done something fairly remarkable. Starting a new car company has never been easy. It's harder still when those cars are electric and outside your average buyer's comfort zone; <a href="https://jalopnik.com/15-failed-electric-vehicle-startups-that-never-made-it-1850510650/">more than a dozen</a> have tried <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/18/why-so-many-electric-vehicle-startups-fail.html">and failed</a> since Tesla was founded in 2003. Even mighty Apple, with all its billions in the bank, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/after-a-decade-of-stops-and-starts-apple-kills-its-electric-car-project/">thought better of it</a>. So why, after all that hard work, would Tesla's CEO now tell everyone that Tesla is an AI company?</p>
<p>The company's greatest successes have come when it innovates, like when it realized that laptop cells were about energy-dense enough to power a sports car if you just had enough of them. Building out a reliable fast-charging network was another such innovation. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also never been afraid to chase a trend, and the hype du jour is artificial intelligence, a field that attracted more than $67 billion in investment last year.</p>
<p>"We are an AI, robotics company; if you value us otherwise, the right answer is impossible to the questions being asked," Musk told investors and journalists in April.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040824#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040824&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
