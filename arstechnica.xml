              <![CDATA[<p>One of the new Trump administration's first national security directives aims to defend against missile and drone attacks targeting the United States, and several elements of the plan require an expansion of the US military's presence in space, the White House announced Monday.</p>
<p>For more than 60 years, the military has launched reconnaissance, communications, and missile warning satellites into orbit. Trump's executive order calls for the Pentagon to come up with a design architecture, requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield within 60 days.</p>
<p>A key tenet of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/">Trump's order</a> is to develop and deploy space-based interceptors capable of destroying enemy missiles during their initial boost phase shortly after launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/trump-directs-the-pentagon-to-come-up-with-a-plan-for-space-based-weapons/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For reasons that were not immediately clear, SpaceX founder Elon Musk took to his social media site X on Tuesday evening to make a perplexing space-based pronouncement.</p>
<p>"The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so," <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884365928038563880">Musk wrote</a>. "Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long."</p>
<p>Now generally, at Ars Technica, it is not our policy to write stories strictly based on things Elon Musk says on X. However, this statement was so declarative, and so consternation-inducing for NASA, it bears a bit of explication.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/why-did-elon-musk-just-say-trump-wants-to-bring-two-stranded-astronauts-home/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's only been a week since Chinese company DeepSeek <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">launched its open-weights R1 reasoning model</a>, which is reportedly competitive with OpenAI's state-of-the-art o1 models despite being <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/chinas-deepseek-sparks-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/">trained for a fraction of the cost</a>. Already, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/deepseek-spooks-american-tech-industry-as-it-tops-the-apple-app-store/">American AI companies are in a panic</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/why-the-markets-are-freaking-out-about-chinese-ai-newcomer-deepseek/">markets are freaking out</a> over what could be a breakthrough in the status quo for large language models.</p>
<p>While DeepSeek can point to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/">common benchmark results</a> and <a href="https://lmarena.ai/">Chatbot Arena leaderboard</a> to prove the competitiveness of its model, there's nothing like direct use cases to get a feel for just how useful a new model is. To that end, we decided to put DeepSeek's R1 model up against OpenAI's ChatGPT models in the style of our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">previous showdowns</a> between <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/clash-of-the-ai-titans-chatgpt-vs-bard-in-a-showdown-of-wits-and-wisdom/">ChatGPT and Google Bard/Gemini</a>.</p>
<p>This was not designed to be a test of the hardest problems possible; it's more of a sample of everyday questions these models might get asked by users.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205943/anthropic-ai-web-crawler-claudebot-ifixit-scraping-training-data">Anthropic inspired backlash</a> when its ClaudeBot AI crawler was accused of hammering websites a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/30/taming_ai_content_crawlers/">million or more</a> times a day.</p>
<p>And it wasn't the only artificial intelligence company making headlines for supposedly ignoring instructions in robots.txt files to avoid scraping web content on certain sites. Around the same time, Reddit's CEO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/reddit-ceo-stands-by-change-that-blocks-most-non-google-search-engines/">called out all AI companies</a> whose crawlers he said were "a pain in the ass to block," despite the tech industry otherwise agreeing to respect "no scraping" robots.txt rules.</p>
<p>Watching the controversy unfold was a software developer whom Ars has granted anonymity to discuss his development of malware (we'll call him Aaron). Shortly after he noticed Facebook's crawler exceeding 30 million hits on his site, Aaron began plotting a new kind of attack on crawlers "clobbering" websites that he told Ars he hoped would give "teeth" to robots.txt.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/ai-haters-build-tarpits-to-trap-and-trick-ai-scrapers-that-ignore-robots-txt/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Cruz: Hotspot lending could "censor kids' exposure to conservative viewpoints."]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>US Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is trying to block a plan to distribute Wi-Fi hotspots to schoolchildren, claiming it will lead to unsupervised Internet usage, endanger kids, and possibly restrict kids' exposure to conservative viewpoints. "The government shouldn't be complicit in harming students or impeding parents' ability to decide what their kids see by subsidizing unsupervised access to inappropriate content," Cruz said.</p>
<p>Cruz, chairman of the Commerce Committee, yesterday <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/1/chairman-cruz-leads-senate-commerce-gop-in-effort-to-stop-biden-fcc-from-subsidizing-kids-unsupervised-internet-access">announced</a> a Congressional Review Act (CRA) <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hotspot-cra-resolution.pdf">resolution</a> that would nullify the hotspot rule issued by the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-approves-rules-support-wi-fi-hotspots-through-e-rate-program-0">voted to adopt the rule</a> in July 2024 under then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, saying it was needed to help kids without reliable Internet access complete their homework.</p>
<p>Cruz's press release said the FCC action "violates federal law, creates major risks for kids' online safety, [and] harms parental rights." While Rosenworcel said last year that the hotspot lending could be implemented under the Universal Service Fund's existing budget, Cruz alleged that it "will increase taxes on working families."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/senator-ted-cruz-is-trying-to-block-wi-fi-hotspots-for-schoolchildren/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amid the Trump administration's abrupt, wide-scale freeze on federal funding, states are reporting that they've lost access to Medicaid, a program jointly funded by the federal government and states to provide comprehensive health coverage and care to tens of millions of low-income adults and children in the US.</p>
<p>The funding freeze was announced in a memo dated January 27 from Matthew Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, and was first reported Monday evening by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3lgr2gf5uzk27">independent journalist Marisa Kabas</a>. The freeze is intended to prevent "use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies," Vaeth wrote. The memo ordered federal agencies to complete a comprehensive analysis of all federal financial assistance programs to ensure they align with the president's policies and requirements.</p>
<p>"In the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders..."

<p>Piloted by a former US Navy aviator, Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenburg, the XB-1 vehicle broke the supersonic barrier on three separate occasions before safely landing back at Mojave Air &amp; Space Port, where it had taken off half an hour earlier.

            <![CDATA[A house in England is most likely the site of a lost residence of Harold II, the last Anglo-Saxon King of England.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a> famously depicts the events leading up to the 1066 Norman Conquest of England, in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> defeated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson">Harold II</a>, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>. Two scenes in particular show King Harold feasting in an extravagant hall in a village called Bosham. Archaeologists think they have now located the site of that feast, concluding that it was the king's own home, according to a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquaries-journal/article/where-power-lies-lordly-power-centres-in-the-english-landscape-c-8001200/7FFE73EFCD219699F9632D4F3589096B">new paper</a> published in The Antiquaries Journal.</p>
<p>“The Norman Conquest saw a new ruling class supplant an English aristocracy that has left little in the way of physical remains, which makes the discovery at Bosham hugely significant," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1071614">said co-author Oliver Creighton</a> of the University of Exeter. "We have found an Anglo-Saxon show-home.” The findings are part of an ongoing project called "Where Power Lies," intended to assess archaeological evidence for aristocratic centers across England from the pre-Norman period.</p>
<p>Scholars believe the Bayeux Tapestry dates back to the 11th century and was likely created just a few years after the Battle of Hastings, mostly likely commissioned by Bishop Odo of Bayeux (although there is still considerable debate over alternative theories). It's technically not a tapestry, since it's not woven but embroidered on linen using wool yarn of various colors. There are 58 individual scenes spanning 230 feet (nearly 70 meters) in length and 20 inches (50 cm) in height. Latin text provides context for the imagery. Among the historical events depicted is the appearance of what is now known as Halley's Comet, used here as a harbinger of the coming Norman invasion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/a-telltale-toilet-reveals-lost-site-shown-in-bayeux-tapestry/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>First floated as a part of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>'s Dominion War arc, the concept of "Section 31" has been divisive among Star Trek fans. Here's the idea: Buried deep within Starfleet exists an anonymous, ruthless intelligence agency that operates out of sight of most Federation citizens and Starfleet officers. Section 31 exists outside of typical Federation safeguards and restrictions, getting its hands dirty so that others in the Federation can pretend that dirt doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Subsequent Trek series would sometimes make a nod toward Section 31 or do contained Section 31-adjacent episodes or story arcs. But the inherent conflict between "post-scarcity utopian future where diplomacy and compromise are always the answer" and "autocratic future where shadowy extralegal spy agencies secretly pull all the strings" kept Section 31 from really feeling like a fully integrated part of the universe.</p>
<p>Surely a Section 31-themed direct-to-streaming feature film called <em>Star Trek: Section 31</em> would be interested in exploring these contradictions? Surely it would have something thoughtful to say about our current age of misinformation and paranoia—the future reflecting and commenting on the present, as the best Star Trek media always has?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/theres-not-much-for-anyone-to-like-in-the-star-trek-section-31-movie/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Chinese company’s claim of a $5.6 million artificial intelligence breakthrough wiped almost $600 billion from Nvidia’s market value on Monday, shattering Wall Street’s confidence that tech companies’ AI spending spree will continue and dealing an apparent blow to US tech leadership.</p>
<p>Yet many in Silicon Valley believe the broad sell-off is an overreaction to DeepSeek’s latest model, which they argue could spur wider adoption and utility of AI by radically lowering the technology’s cost, sustaining demand for Nvidia’s chips.</p>
<p>Pat Gelsinger, recently forced out as chief executive of Intel, was among those buying his former rival Nvidia’s stock on Monday. “The market reaction is wrong: lowering the cost of AI will expand the market,” he said in a LinkedIn post. “DeepSeek is an incredible piece of engineering that will usher in greater adoption of AI.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/why-the-markets-are-freaking-out-about-chinese-ai-newcomer-deepseek/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"We're making new Pebble watches," writes original Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky on <a href="https://repebble.com/">the "rePebble" launch page</a>.</p>
<p>Eight years after Pebble's time as an upstart watchmaker <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/pebble-confirms-fitbit-sale-hardware-is-dead-software-in-maintenance-mode/">came to an end</a>, Migicovsky says that he's working with a small team on "a Pebble-like smartwatch that runs open source PebbleOS." There should be some new features, but new watches would stay "true to the core Pebble vision." With enough signups, the site claims, that watch gets built.</p>
<p>Pebble, launched in 2012, was one of the first smartphone-era smartwatches, selling 2 million models and serving as an early <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/pebble-bumps-its-week-old-kickstarter-with-the-pebble-time-steel/">success story for hardware crowdfunding</a>. After the relatively <a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/why-pebble-failed-d7be937c6232">inexperienced hardware firm</a> ran into funding gaps and stiff competition from the Apple Watch, Pebble stopped making its own watches after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pebble-a-2013-smartwatch-updated-to-work-with-2022-pixel-7/#:~:text=acquired%20in%20a%20fire%20sale%20by%20Fitbit%20in%20December%202016">an IP-only sale to Fitbit in 2016</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/google-closes-the-fitbit-acquisition-pledges-to-not-use-data-for-ads/">Google acquired Fitbit in 2021</a>, gaining some original Pebble workers as well, who then helped <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/33398/rebble-with-a-cause-how-pebble-watches-got-their-amazing-afterlife">the Rebble project</a> launch replacement web services for the watch and kept the watch working on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pebble-a-2013-smartwatch-updated-to-work-with-2022-pixel-7/">the newest Android phones</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/pebble-smartwatch-founder-is-launching-a-smaller-scale-open-source-reboot/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Retro game enthusiasts may already be acquainted with Analogue, a company that designs and manufactures updated versions of classic consoles that can play original games but also be hooked up to modern televisions and monitors. The most recent of its announcements is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/250-analogue-3d-will-play-all-your-n64-cartridges-in-4k-early-next-year/">the Analogue 3D</a>, a console designed to play Nintendo 64 cartridges.</p>
<p>Now, a company called Retro Remake is reigniting the console wars of the 1990s with its <a href="https://retroremake.co/pages/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89">SuperStation one</a>, a new-old game console designed to play original Sony PlayStation games and work with original accessories like controllers and memory cards. Currently available <a href="https://retroremake.co/products/superstation%E1%B5%92%E2%81%BF%E1%B5%89">as a $180 pre-order</a>, Retro Remake expects the consoles to ship no later than Q4 of 2025.</p>
<p>The base console is modeled on the redesigned PS One console from mid-2000, released late in the console's lifecycle to appeal to buyers on a budget who couldn't afford a then-new PlayStation 2. The SuperStation one includes two PlayStation controller ports and memory card slots on the front, plus a USB-A port. But there are lots of modern amenities on the back, including a USB-C port for power, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port for new TVs, DIN10 and VGA ports that support analog video output, and an Ethernet port. Other analog video outputs, including component and RCA outputs, are located on the sides behind small covers. The console also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-fpga-powered-retro-console-re-creates-the-playstation-one-cd-rom-drive-optional/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As federal lawmakers prepare to decide whether anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. should be the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, pediatricians from around the country are making emotional pleas to protect and support lifesaving immunizations.</p>
<p><a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31170/AAP-using-member-stories-to-educate-federal?autologincheck=redirected">The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has assembled nearly 200 stories</a> and dozens of testimonials on the horrors of vaccine-preventable deaths and illnesses that pediatricians have encountered over their careers. The testimonials have been shared with two Senate committees that will hold hearings later this week: the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP).</p>

Some have recalled stories of patients who became ill with devastating diseases before vaccines were available to prevent them, while others shared more recent experiences as vaccine misinformation spread and vaccination rates slipped.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/dead-babies-critically-ill-kids-pediatricians-make-moving-plea-for-vaccines/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As is custom, Apple rolled out software updates to all its platforms at once today. All users should now have access to the public releases of iOS 18.3, macOS Sequoia 15.3, watchOS 11.3, iPadOS 15.3, tvOS 15.3, and visionOS 2.3.</p>
<p>Also, as usual, the iOS update is the meatiest of the bunch. Most of the changes relate to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/despite-unforced-errors-the-future-of-apple-intelligence-could-be-bright/">Apple Intelligence</a>, a suite of features built on deep learning models. The first Apple Intelligence features were introduced in iOS 18, with additional ones added in iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2</p>
<p>iOS 18.3 doesn't add any significant new features to Apple Intelligence—instead, it tweaks what's already there. Whereas Apple Intelligence was opt-in in previous OS versions, it is now on by default in iOS 18.3 on supported devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/ios-18-3-disables-controversial-ai-generated-news-app-notifications/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has dropped the previous administration's proposal to ban bulk billing deals that require tenants to pay for a specific provider's Internet service.</p>
<p>In March 2024, then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400915A1.pdf">proposed</a> a ban on arrangements in which "tenants are required to pay for broadband, cable, and satellite service provided by a specific communications provider, even if they do not wish to take the service or would prefer to use another provider."</p>
<p>Rosenworcel's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was opposed by Internet providers and sat on the FCC's list of items on circulation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241227161434/https://www.fcc.gov/items-on-circulation">throughout 2024</a> without any final vote, despite the commission having a 3–2 Democratic majority at the time. Carr, who was elevated to the chairmanship by President Trump, emptied the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/items-on-circulation">list of items</a> under consideration by commissioners on Friday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/fcc-chair-nixes-plan-to-boost-broadband-competition-in-apartment-buildings/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Utility-scale solar generation is up by over 30% amid future uncertainties.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The Energy Information Agency has now <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/">released data</a> on the performance of the US's electric grid over the first 11 months of 2024 and will be adding the final month soon (and a month is very little time for anything to change significantly in the data). The biggest story in the data is the dramatic growth of solar energy, with a 30 percent increase in generation in a single year, which will allow solar and wind combined to overtake coal in 2024.</p>
<p>But the US energy demand saw an increase of nearly 3 percent, which is roughly double the amount of additional solar generation. Should electric use continue to grow at a similar pace, renewable production will have to continue to grow dramatically for a few years before it can simply cover the added demand.</p>
<h2>Going for the Sun</h2>
<p>In the first 11 months of 2024, the US saw its electrical use grow by 2.8 percent, or roughly 100 Terawatt-hours. While there's typically year-to-year variation in use due to weather-driven demand, the US's consumption has largely been flat since the early 2000s. There are plenty of reasons to expect increased demand, including the growth of data centers and the electrification of heating and transit, but so far, there's been no clear sign of it in the data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/us-solar-boom-continues-but-its-offset-by-rising-power-use/">Read full article</a></p>

      <em>Alien: Earth</em>, an all-new original series, premieres this summer on Hulu and with Hulu On Disney+.

<p>FX/Hulu dropped a surprise short teaser for its upcoming spinoff series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Earth"><em>Alien: Earth</em></a>, during the AFC Championship game last night. What makes it intriguing is the way it's shot entirely from a Xenomorph's point of view as the creature races through a spaceship's corridor while a "containment breached!" warning repeats. The final shot said the spaceship is headed on a crash course toward Earth.</p>
<p>The official premise is short and sweet: "When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat." We know very little yet about the specifics of the series other than that it is set two years before the events of the first film, <em>Alien</em> (1979).</p>
<p>It's promising that showrunner Noah Hawley <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/noah-hawley-alien-series-prometheus-backstory-not-useful-1235871454/">has said</a> that the style and mythology will be closer to that film, rather than <em>Prometheus</em> (2012) or <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, both of which were also prequels. “In the prequels, Ridley [Scott] made the technology thousands of years more advanced than the technology of <em>Alien</em>, which is supposed to take place in those movies’ future," <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/noah-hawley-alien-series-prometheus-backstory-not-useful-1235871454/">he said last January</a>. "There’s something about that that doesn’t really compute for me. I prefer the retro-futurism of the first two films, and so that’s the choice I’ve made—there’s no holograms. The convenience of that beautiful Apple Store technology is not available to me.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/alien-earth-teaser-gives-us-xenomorphs-pov/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was apparently a busy weekend for key players involved in Donald Trump's efforts to make a deal to save TikTok.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most appealing option for ByteDance could be if Trump blessed a merger between TikTok and Perplexity AI—a San Francisco-based AI search company worth about $9 billion that appears to view a TikTok video content acquisition as a path to compete with major players like Google and OpenAI.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, Perplexity AI submitted a revised merger proposal to TikTok-owner ByteDance, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/26/perplexity-tiktok-revised-merger-proposal.html">reviewed</a> by CNBC, which sources <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-trump-perplexity-87988733973760927bb5681f7de9b9af">told AP News</a> included feedback from the Trump administration.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-may-leave-tiktoks-algorithm-under-bytedances-control/">Read full article</a></p>
