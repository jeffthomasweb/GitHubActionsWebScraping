                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>On Dec. 21, 2015, SpaceX launched the Orbcomm-2 mission on an upgraded version of its Falcon 9 rocket. That night, just days before Christmas, the company successfully landed the first stage for the first time. The story behind this remarkable achievement is nowhere more fully told than <a href="https://benbellabooks.com/shop/reentry/">in the book Reentry</a>, authored by Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and published in 2024. To mark the tenth anniversary, Ars is reprinting a slightly condensed chapter from the book that tells the inside story of this landing. The chapter begins in June 2015 with a tragedy, the disintegration of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the CRS-7 cargo supply mission for NASA. It was the first time a Falcon 9 had been lost in flight.</em></p>
<p>Seconds after the Dragon-bearing Falcon 9 rocket broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, David Giger shouted into his headset, “Dragon is alive!”</p>
<p>In the decade since he joined the company straight out of graduate school, Giger had taken on management of the entire Dragon program, reporting directly to Elon Musk. He watched the CRS-7 launch from mission control in Hawthorne not with a particular role, but rather providing a leadership presence. Giger could sense the Dragon mission team, mostly younger engineers, freeze up as video showed debris from the rocket showering back to Earth. A lot of the people involved in the hairy early flights of Dragon, including the C2 mission in 2012, had moved on to other positions at SpaceX or departed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/ten-years-ago-spacex-turned-tragedy-into-triumph-with-a-historic-rocket-landing/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Luwz1dzw-I?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Physicists at the University of Amsterdam came up with a really cool bit of Christmas decor: a miniature 3D-printed Christmas tree, a mere 8 centimeters tall, made of ice, without any refrigeration equipment or other freezing technology, and at minimal cost. The secret is evaporative cooling, according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14580">a preprint</a> posted to the physics arXiv.</p>
<p>Evaporative cooling is a well-known phenomenon; mammals use it to regulate body temperature. You can see it in your morning cup of hot coffee: the hotter atoms rise to the top of the magnetic trap and “jump out” as steam. It also plays a role (along with shock wave dynamics and various other factors) in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep16162">the formation</a> of “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/why-is-your-wine-crying-scientists-say-shock-waves-likely-play-a-role/">wine tears.</a>” It’s a key step in creating Bose-Einstein condensates.</p>
<p>And evaporative cooling is also the main culprit behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/let-science-be-your-guide-for-the-perfect-labor-day-bbq/">the infamous “stall”</a> that so frequently plagues aspiring BBQ pit masters eager to make a successful pork butt. The meat sweats as it cooks, releasing the moisture within, and that moisture evaporates and cools the meat, effectively canceling out the heat from the BBQ. That’s why a growing number of competitive pit masters wrap their meat in tinfoil after the first few hours (usually when the internal temperature hits 170<em>° </em>F).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/physicists-3d-printed-a-christmas-tree-of-ice/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For most of photography’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras">roughly 200-year</a> history, altering a photo convincingly required either a darkroom, some Photoshop expertise, or, at minimum, a steady hand with scissors and glue. On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/">released a tool</a> that reduces the process to typing a sentence.</p>
<p>It’s not the first company to do so. While OpenAI had a conversational image-editing model in the works since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a> in 2024, Google beat OpenAI to market <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">in March</a> with a public prototype, then refined it to a popular model called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/google-improves-gemini-ai-image-editing-with-nano-banana-model/">Nano Banana</a> image model (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-launches-nano-banana-pro-image-model-adds-ai-image-detection-in-gemini-app/">Nano Banana Pro</a>). The enthusiastic response to Google’s image-editing model in the AI community <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/openai-ceo-declares-code-red-as-gemini-gains-200-million-users-in-3-months/">got OpenAI’s attention</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s new <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/">GPT Image 1.5</a> is an AI image synthesis model that reportedly generates images up to four times faster than its predecessor and costs about 20 percent less through the API. The model rolled out to all ChatGPT users on Tuesday and represents <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">another step</a> toward making photorealistic image manipulation a casual process that requires no particular visual skills.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/openais-new-chatgpt-image-generator-makes-faking-photos-easy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Larry Bushart, a man who was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/man-finally-released-a-month-after-absurd-arrest-for-reposting-trump-meme/">jailed for 37 days for reposting a Trump meme</a>, has now <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bushart-v.-Perry-County-Complaint-12-17-25.pdf">sued</a> the cops who allegedly schemed to keep him imprisoned for as long as possible simply because they disagreed with his point of view.</p>
<p>Bushart is a former cop who lost his post-retirement job after a seemingly vengeful sheriff jailed him for trolling a Charlie Kirk vigil post in a Facebook group. Upset that Kirk’s death commanded more attention than other victims of gun violence, Bushart posted a string of memes, among which was an image of Trump with an actual quote saying “We have to get over it” about a 2024 school shooting.</p>
<p>Perry County sheriff Nick Weems has since acknowledged that he “knew” that the meme referenced a prior school shooting. However, the entire time that Bushart was detained, Weems maintained that Bushart’s post incited “mass hysteria” from parents concerned that he was threatening violence at a local high school. Painting Bushart as indifferent to the supposed hysteria, Weems justified his arrest, as well as the $2 million bond ensuring Bushart couldn’t afford bail and remained behind bars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/man-sues-cops-who-jailed-him-for-37-days-for-trolling-a-charlie-kirk-vigil/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr today faced blistering criticism in a Senate hearing for his September threats to revoke ABC station licenses over comments made by Jimmy Kimmel. While Democrats provided nearly all the criticism, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that Congress should act to restrict the FCC’s power to intimidate news broadcasters.</p>
<p>As an immediate result of today’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHY0dP5nY6w">hearing</a>, the FCC removed a statement from its website that said it is an independent agency. Carr, who has embraced President <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/trump-declares-sweeping-power-over-independent-agencies-such-as-fcc-and-sec/">Trump’s declaration</a> that independent agencies may no longer operate independently from the White House, apparently didn’t realize that the website still called the FCC an independent agency.</p>
<p>“Yes or no, is the FCC an independent agency?” Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) asked. Carr answered that the FCC is not independent, prompting Luján to point to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251020212205/https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/what-we-do">statement on the FCC website</a> calling the FCC “an independent US government agency overseen by Congress.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/fcc-deletes-independent-agency-from-website-as-carr-defends-allegiance-to-trump/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One of the big stories of last year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was the debut of Donut Lab’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/these-compact-electric-motors-could-revolutionize-ev-design/">diminutive but powerful electric motors</a>. When I spoke with Donut earlier this year, the company told me that it was looking at applications ranging from drones to large automotive motors, but also things like wind turbines and even washing machines. Now, almost a year later, we have our first look at an electric vehicle that uses the technology, thanks to a new collaboration between Donut Lab and WATT Electric Vehicle Company.</p>
<p>WATT had previously developed the Passenger and Commercial EV <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboard_(automotive_platform)">Skateboard</a> (PACES), a lightweight aluminum platform for low-volume EVs. Now, it’s integrating Donut’s motors, first with one for each rear wheel, although there will eventually be an all-wheel-drive variant, too.</p>
<p>The small EV chassis is rather intriguing—with the motors in the rear wheel hubs, the layout is even more space-efficient than a more conventional EV, which still needs to find a few cubic feet to package its drive unit(s). The two companies see plenty of potential for the platform, which they say could give rise to “multiple vehicle configurations from beach buggies to high-performance sports cars to commercial delivery vehicles.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/donut-labs-hub-motor-meets-watts-battery-to-create-new-ev-skateboard/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, announced that a major climate research center will be “broken up.” The National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, is a significant contributor to research on the weather, climate, and other atmospheric phenomena. The move will be a crippling blow to climate research in the US and is being widely decried by scientists.</p>
<p>Vought initially <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/16/trump-dismantle-national-center-atmospheric-research-climate/87798771007/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=6942047625625600014c41b7&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">gave a statement</a> regarding NCAR to USA Today and later <a href="https://x.com/russvought/status/2001099488774033692">confirmed the outlet’s reporting</a> on social media. Calling it “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” Vought also decried what he termed “woke” activities at NCAR. These appear to be fairly typical efforts made to attract underrepresented groups to the sciences—efforts that were uncontroversial prior to the current administration.</p>
<p>NCAR is primarily based in a complex on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado, and maintains a supercomputing center in Wyoming. Much of its funding comes from the National Science Foundation, but the day-to-day management is handled by the <a href="https://www.ucar.edu">University Corporation for Atmospheric Research</a> (UCAR), a nonprofit that represents 130 individual educational institutions. In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans. NCAR hosts a <a href="https://researchworks.ucar.edu">series of webpages</a> that explain its research and all the ways it helps society.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trump-admin-threatens-to-break-up-major-climate-research-center/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google began its transition to Gemini 3 a few weeks ago with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/">launch of the Pro model</a>, and the arrival of Gemini 3 Flash kicks it into high gear. The new, faster Gemini 3 model is coming to the Gemini app and search, and developers will be able to access it immediately via the Gemini API, Vertex AI, AI Studio, and Antigravity. Google’s bigger gen AI model is also picking up steam, with both Gemini 3 Pro and its image component (Nano Banana Pro) expanding in search.</p>
<p>This may come as a shock, but <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash">Google says</a> Gemini 3 Flash is faster and more capable than its previous base model. As usual, Google has a raft of benchmark numbers that show modest improvements for the new model. It bests the old 2.5 Flash in basic academic and reasoning tests like GPQA Diamond and MMMU Pro (where it even beats 3 Pro). It gets a larger boost in Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), which tests advanced domain-specific knowledge. Gemini 3 Flash has tripled the old models’ score in HLE, landing at 33.7 percent without tool use. That’s just a few points behind the Gemini 3 Pro model.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Browser extensions with more than 8 million installs are harvesting complete and extended conversations from users’ AI conversations and selling them for marketing purposes, according to data collected from the Google and Microsoft pages hosting them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection">Security firm Koi discovered</a> the eight extensions, which as of late Tuesday night remained available in both Google’s and Microsoft’s extension stores. Seven of them carry “Featured” badges, which are endorsements meant to signal that the companies have determined the extensions meet their quality standards. The free extensions provide functions such as VPN routing to safeguard online privacy and ad blocking for ad-free browsing. All provide assurances that user data remains anonymous and isn’t shared for purposes other than their described use.</p>
<h2>A gold mine for marketers and data brokers</h2>
<p>An examination of the extensions’ underlying code tells a much more complicated story. Each contains eight of what Koi calls “executor” scripts, with each being unique for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and five other leading AI chat platforms. The scripts are injected into webpages anytime the user visits one of these platforms. From there, the scripts override browsers’ built-in functions for making network requests and receiving responses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/12/browser-extensions-with-8-million-users-collect-extended-ai-conversations/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After federal clean vehicle tax credits ended in September, the electric vehicle industry reached a crossroads. Well, technically, it has been there since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/gop-intensifies-war-against-evs-and-efficient-cars/">Trump took office</a>. This is a weird period in automotive history; A chunk of the industry is full-steam ahead with EV development, another is cutting back, and the consumer is left wondering what the electrification landscape will look like next year, let alone in three, during the next administration.</p>
<p>But what about the automotive aftermarket? Typically, this corner benefits from whatever progress is made on the OEM front—have Trump’s policies expanded or contracted its EV technological development? I recently spent some time chatting with personnel of the <a href="https://www.sema.org/">Specialty Equipment Market Association</a> (SEMA) at its yearly tradeshow in Las Vegas to find out. I also hit the bricks (or, rather, bright carpeting) of the massive show itself, seeking out some new, unique developments in the space that behoove EV tech’s inherent benefits.</p>
<p>Above one of the show’s several sprawling halls, I met with Mike Spagnola, SEMA’s CEO, and Karen Bailey-Chapman, senior vice president, public and government affairs, to learn what the organization’s official stance is. First and foremost: It doesn’t want to be told what to do.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/how-is-ev-technology-being-accepted-by-the-aftermarket/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Some high-profile oil and gas industry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/business/energy-environment/exxon-mobil-baku-climate-cop29.html">leaders</a> and <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194-0869">organizations</a> have objected to changes to long-standing government policy positions that give companies firm ground on which to make their plans.</p>

<p>Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.</p>
<p>This mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/trump-spent-2025-attacking-science-that-could-set-back-his-genesis-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued five large TV manufacturers yesterday, alleging that their smart TVs spy on viewers without consent. Paxton sued Samsung, the longtime TV market share leader, along with LG, Sony, Hisense, and TCL.</p>
<p>“These companies have been unlawfully collecting personal data through Automated Content Recognition (‘ACR’) technology,” Paxton’s office alleged in a <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-paxton-sues-five-major-tv-companies-including-some-ties-ccp-spying-texans">press release</a> that contains links to all five lawsuits. “ACR in its simplest terms is an uninvited, invisible digital invader. This software can capture screenshots of a user’s television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time, and transmit that information back to the company without the user’s knowledge or consent. The companies then sell that consumer information to target ads across platforms for a profit. This technology puts users’ privacy and sensitive information, such as passwords, bank information, and other personal information at risk.”</p>
<p>The lawsuits allege violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, seeking damages of up to $10,000 for each violation and up to $250,000 for each violation affecting people 65 years or older. Texas also wants restraining orders prohibiting the collection, sharing, and selling of ACR data while the lawsuits are pending.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/texas-sues-biggest-tv-makers-alleging-smart-tvs-spy-on-users-without-consent/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Parts of this new observatory, named for NASA’s first chief astronomer, recently completed a spate of tests to ensure it can survive the shaking and intense sound of a rocket launch. Engineers placed the core of the telescope inside a thermal vacuum chamber, where it withstood the airless conditions and extreme temperature swings it will see in space.</p>
<p>Then, on November 25, teams at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, joined the inner and outer portions of the Roman Space Telescope. With this milestone, NASA declared the observatory complete and on track for launch as soon as fall 2026.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/the-4-3-billion-space-telescope-trump-tried-to-cancel-is-now-complete/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Senators launched a probe Tuesday demanding that tech companies explain exactly how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills in communities where prices are already skyrocketing.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letters_to_data_center_companies_reutilitycosts.pdf">letters</a> to seven AI firms, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) cited a study estimating that “electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years” in “areas located near significant data center activity.”</p>
<p>Prices increase, senators noted, when utility companies build out extra infrastructure to meet data centers’ energy demands—which can amount to one customer suddenly consuming as much power as an entire city. They also increase when demand for local power outweighs supply. In some cases, residents are blindsided by higher bills, not even realizing a data center project was approved, because tech companies seem intent on dodging backlash and frequently do not allow terms of deals to be publicly disclosed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/shady-data-center-deals-doom-americans-to-higher-energy-bills-senators-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple doesn’t like to talk about its upcoming products before it’s ready, but sometimes the company’s software does the talking for it. So far this week we’ve had a couple of software-related leaks that have outed products Apple is currently testing—one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/apple-leak-unreleased-devices-codenames/">a pre-release build of iOS 26</a>, and the other some leaked files from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/apple-developing-imac-with-m5-max/">a kernel debug kit</a> (both via MacRumors).</p>
<p>Most of the new devices referenced in these leaks are straightforward updates to products that already exist: a new Apple TV, a HomePod mini 2, new AirTags and AirPods, an M4 iPad Air, a 12th-generation iPad to replace the current A16 version, next-generation iPhones (including the 17e, 18, and the rumored foldable model), a new Studio Display model, some new smart home products <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/report-apples-smart-home-ambitions-include-tabletop-robot-cameras-and-more/">we’ve already heard about elsewhere</a>, and M5 updates for the MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and the other MacBook Pros. There’s also yet another reference to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/07/what-would-a-cheap-apple-a18-powered-macbook-actually-be-good-at/">the lower-cost MacBook</a> that Apple is apparently planning to replace the M1 MacBook Air it still sells via Walmart for $599.</p>
<p>For power users, though, the most interesting revelation might be that Apple is working on a higher-end Apple Silicon iMac powered by an M5 Max chip. The kernel debug kit references an iMac with the internal identifier J833c, based on a platform identified as H17C—and H17C is apparently based on the M5 Max, rather than a lower-end M5 chip. (For those who don’t have Apple’s branding memorized, “Max” is associated with Apple’s second-fastest chips; the M5 Max would be faster than the M5 or M5 Pro, but slower than the rumored M5 Ultra.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/leaked-debug-kit-suggests-apple-is-testing-a-new-imac-pro-among-many-other-macs/">Read full article</a></p>
