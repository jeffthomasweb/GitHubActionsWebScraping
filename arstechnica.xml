                            <![CDATA[<p>The University of Pennsylvania has a somewhat unusual distinction: It is the <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/11/penn-trump-elon-musk-administration-government-efficiency"><em>alma mater</em> of two of the planet’s most polarizing figures</a>, Elon Musk and Donald Trump. As the political power of both men rose over the last year, the US government began to pressure Penn, first by pulling its research funding and then by targeting the school for past actions related to a transgender swimmer.</p>
<p>After the “sticks” were deployed, a “carrot” was offered. Penn became one of just nine schools nationally to be offered a special “compact” with the federal government, which would give the feds broad control over the school and its speech in return for preferential access to federal funds. Penn <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/with-deadline-looming-4-of-9-universities-reject-trumps-compact-to-remake-higher-ed/">declined to sign the deal</a>. (Making the whole surreal situation stranger was the fact that one of Penn’s own wealthy boosters apparently <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/10/penn-marc-rowan-questions-trustees-compact">helped the Trump administration write the compact</a>.)</p>
<p>In other words, Penn has become an obvious target of the Trump administration; now it has been targeted by a hacker claiming to share Trump and Musk’s grievances over affirmative action and “wokeness.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/musk-and-trump-both-went-to-penn-now-hacked-by-someone-sympathetic-to-their-cause/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Syphilis can be a tricky disease to diagnose—especially when a patient may not be sharing the whole story.</p>
<p>Doctors in Belgium met with a real head-scratcher when an 83-year-old married man came in with a rare form of secondary syphilis—the second of four stages of the sexually transmitted bacterial infection that has been called a “master of disguise.”</p>
<p>The man told doctors up front that he was in a monogamous 50-year-long marriage and had been sexually inactive in recent years following treatment for cancer. In <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcps2507868">a Clinical Problem-Solving report</a> published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors laid out the step-by-step tests and reasoning they used to get to the right diagnosis, which still didn’t answer all their questions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/rare-form-of-syphilis-in-married-elderly-man-nearly-stumps-doctors/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google on Wednesday revealed five recent malware samples that were built using generative AI. The end results of each one were far below par with professional malware development, a finding that shows that vibe coding of malicious wares lags behind more traditional forms of development, which means it still has a long way to go before it poses a real-world threat.</p>
<p>One of the samples, for instance, tracked under the name PromptLock, was part of an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20444v1">academic study</a> analyzing how effective the use of large language models can be “to autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle.” The researchers, however, reported the malware had “clear limitations: it omits persistence, lateral movement, and advanced evasion tactics” and served as little more than a demonstration of the feasibility of AI for such purposes. Prior to the paper’s release, security firm ESET said it had discovered the sample and <a href="https://www.eset.com/us/about/newsroom/research/eset-discovers-promptlock-the-first-ai-powered-ransomware/">hailed</a> it as “the first AI-powered ransomware.”</p>
<h2>Don’t believe the hype</h2>
<p>Like the other four samples Google analyzed—FruitShell, PromptFlux, PromptSteal, and QuietVault—PromptLock was easy to detect, even by less-sophisticated endpoint protections that rely on static signatures. All samples also employed previously seen methods in malware samples, making them easy to counteract. They also had no operational impact, meaning they didn’t require defenders to adopt new defenses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/11/ai-generated-malware-poses-little-real-world-threat-contrary-to-hype/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Civil and digital rights experts are horrified by a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/11/03/2025-19747/collection-and-use-of-biometrics-by-us-citizenship-and-immigration-services">proposed rule change</a> that would allow the Department of Homeland Security to collect a wide range of sensitive biometric data on all immigrants, without age restrictions, and store that data throughout each person’s “lifecycle” in the immigration system.</p>
<p>If adopted, the rule change would allow DHS agencies, including <span id="_XLwLaa67Jr_O0PEPrYuW8Q0_46" class="wtBS9">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</span> (ICE), to broadly collect facial imagery, finger and palm prints, iris scans, and voice prints. They may also request DNA, which DHS claimed “would only be collected in limited circumstances,” like to verify family relations. These updates would cost taxpayers $288.7 million annually, DHS estimated, including $57.1 million for DNA collection alone. Annual individual charges to immigrants submitting data will likely be similarly high, estimated at around $231.5 million.</p>
<p>Costs could be higher, DHS admitted, especially if DNA testing is conducted more widely than projected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/dhs-wants-to-use-biometrics-to-track-immigrant-kids-throughout-their-lives/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Quantum computers based on ions or atoms have one major advantage: The hardware itself isn’t manufactured, so there’s no device-to-device variability. Every atom is the same and should perform similarly every time. And since the qubits themselves can be moved around, it’s theoretically possible to entangle any atom or ion with any other in the system, allowing for a lot of flexibility in how algorithms and error correction are performed.</p>
<p>This combination of consistent, high-fidelity performance with all-to-all connectivity has led many key <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/microsoft-performs-operations-with-multiple-error-corrected-qubits/">demonstrations of quantum computing</a> to be done on trapped-ion hardware. Unfortunately, the hardware has been held back a bit by relatively low qubit counts—a few dozen compared to the hundred or more seen in other technologies. But on Wednesday, a company called Quantinuum announced a new version of its trapped-ion hardware that significantly boosts the qubit count and uses some interesting technology to manage their operation.</p>
<h2>Trapped-ion computing</h2>
<p>Both neutral atom and trapped-ion computers store their qubits in the spin of the nucleus. That spin is somewhat shielded from the environment by the cloud of electrons around the nucleus, giving these qubits a relatively long coherence time. While neutral atoms are held in place by a network of lasers, trapped ions are manipulated via electromagnetic control based on the ion’s charge. This means that key components of the hardware can be built using standard electronic manufacturing, although lasers are still needed for manipulations and readout.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/new-quantum-computing-hardware-sorts-ions-for-computation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google and Disney have been in a contract dispute since October 30 that has resulted in YouTube TV subscribers losing access to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/16654675?visit_id=638968431803573294-3963843398&amp;p=disney&amp;rd=1">21 Disney-owned TV channels</a>, including ABC, ESPN, and The Disney Channel.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing access to popular live content, the corporate conflict is highlighting another frustration in the streaming era. As Google and Disney continue duking it out, their customers have lost some access to content they thought was permanent: DVR files and digital movie purchases.</p>
<p>A perk of subscribing to YouTube TV, per <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/">Google’s marketing</a>, is the ability to “record it all with unlimited DVR space.” A footnote on the YouTube TV homepage notes that unlimited DVR is subject to “device, regional, and Internet restrictions” but overlooks an additional restriction in the form of multi-conglomerate spats.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/youtube-tvs-disney-blackout-reminds-users-that-they-dont-own-what-they-stream/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Flock Safety—the surveillance company behind the country’s largest network of automated license plate readers (ALPRs)—currently faces attacks on multiple fronts seeking to tear down the invasive and error-prone cameras across the US.</p>
<p>This week, two lawmakers, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-krishnamoorthi-urge-ftc-to-investigate-surveillance-tech-company-on-negligently-handling-americans-personal-data">called</a> for a federal investigation, alleging that Flock has been “negligently handling Americans’ personal data” by failing to use cybersecurity best practices. The month prior, Wyden wrote a <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_flock.pdf">letter</a> to Flock CEO Garrett Langley, alleging that Flock’s security failures mean that “abuse of Flock cameras is inevitable” and that they threaten to expose billions of people’s harvested data should a catastrophic breach occur.</p>
<p>“In my view, local elected officials can best protect their constituents from the inevitable abuses of Flock cameras by removing Flock from their communities,” Wyden wrote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/flock-haters-cross-political-divides-to-remove-error-prone-cameras/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Google announced Tuesday a new initiative, named Project Suncatcher, to examine the feasibility of bringing artificial intelligence to space. The idea is to deploy swarms of satellites in low-Earth orbit, each carrying Google’s AI accelerator chips designed for training, content generation, synthetic speech and vision, and predictive modeling. Google calls these chips Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.</p>
<p>“Project Suncatcher is a moonshot exploring a new frontier: equipping solar-powered satellite constellations with TPUs and free-space optical links to one day scale machine learning compute in space,” Google <a href="https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/">wrote in a blog post.</a></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/if-you-want-to-satiate-ais-hunger-for-power-google-suggests-going-to-space/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has spent the last few years waging a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">losing battle against Epic Games</a>, which accused the Android maker of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/epic-gives-fortnite-players-discounts-for-skirting-apple-google-fees/">illegally stifling competition in mobile apps</a>. Losses in court left Google to make sweeping changes to the Play Store, but Google appeared poised to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court. That is unlikely now that Epic and Google have reached a settlement in the case. It still needs to be approved by the judge, but the agreement provides a framework for long-term changes to Android app distribution that would apply globally.</p>
<p>Late last month, Google was forced to make the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-begins-loosening-developer-restrictions-in-play-store-against-its-will/">first round of mandated changes</a> to the Play Store to comply with the court’s ruling. It grudgingly began allowing developers to direct users to alternative payment options and app downloads outside of Google’s ecosystem. By next summer, Google was supposed to open up Android to third-party app stores in a big way.</p>
<p>These changes were only mandated for three years and in the United States. The new agreement includes a different vision for third-party stores on Android—one that Google finds more palatable and that still gives Epic what it wants. If approved, the settlement will lower Google’s standard fee for developers. There will also be new support in Android for third-party app stores that will reduce the friction of leaving the Google bubble. Under the terms of the settlement, Google will support these changes through at least June 2032.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/google-settlement-with-epic-caps-play-store-fees-boosts-other-android-app-stores/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Windows 11 25H2 update is relatively minor compared to last year’s 24H2 update (the “25” here is a reference to the year the update was released, while the “H2” denotes that it was released in the second half of the year, a vestigial suffix from when Microsoft would release two major Windows updates per year). The 24H2 update came with some major under-the-hood overhauls of core Windows components and significant performance improvements for the Arm version; 25H2 is largely 24H2, but with a rolled-over version number to keep it in line with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-11-home-and-pro">Microsoft’s timeline for security updates and tech support</a>.</p>
<p>But Microsoft’s continuous update cadence for Windows 11 means that even the 24H2 version as it currently exists isn’t the same one Microsoft released a year ago.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla’s shareholders are ready to vote tomorrow on whether to give Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/musks-1-trillion-pay-plan-doesnt-force-him-to-keep-focus-on-tesla-critics-say/">an even more vast slice</a> of the company in an effort to keep him <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/tesla-awards-elon-musk-29-billion-after-much-larger-pay-plan-blocked-in-court/">focused on selling electric vehicles</a>. Currently, the trolling tycoon appears a little obsessed with the UK, <a href="https://www.thecanary.co/trending/2025/11/04/elon-musk-hobbits/">a place he appears to conflate with Middle Earth</a>, which investors may or may not take into account when making their decision. What they ought to take into account is how many cars Tesla sold last month.</p>
<p>Although Tesla only publishes quarterly sales figures and does not divide those up by region, slightly more granular data is available from some countries via monthly new car registrations. And the numbers for October, when compared year on year to the same month in 2024, should be alarming.</p>
<p>Sales fell by double-digit margins in Sweden (89 percent), Denmark (86 percent), Belgium (69 percent), Finland (68 percent), Austria (65 percent), Switzerland (60 percent), Portugal (59 percent), Germany (54 percent), Norway (50 percent), the Netherlands (48 percent), the UK (47 percent), Italy (47 percent), and Spain (31 percent).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/after-a-great-q3-tesla-sees-double-digit-declines-all-over-europe/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>“Sex sells” has been a mantra in marketing <a href="https://aef.com/classroom-resources/book-excerpts/erotic-history-advertising/">for decades</a>. As <a href="https://www.andrewedelblum.com/research">researchers who study</a> <a href="https://business.uoregon.edu/directory/phd_students/all/afrank3">consumer behavior</a>, we’ve seen plenty of evidence to support it: Attractive models and spokespeople have been shown to reliably <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2021/05/03/fashion-ads-and-sex-why-it-sells/">grab attention</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2983323.2983349">boost clicks,</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/209029">make products seem more desirable</a>.</p>
<p>But our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.70023">new research</a> suggests that in a digital world full of influencers—trusted tastemakers with large online followings—being too attractive can actually backfire, particularly in the fitness space.</p>
<p>We call this the “beauty backfire effect,” and we put it to the test in a series of laboratory experiments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/why-being-too-attractive-can-hurt-fitness-influencers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is in the process of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/end-of-life-gemini-will-completely-replace-google-assistant-later-this-year/">purging Assistant</a> across its products, and the next target is Google Maps. Starting today, Gemini will begin rolling out in Maps, powering new experiences for navigation, location info, and more. This update will eventually completely usurp Google Assistant’s hands-free role in Maps, but the rollout will take time. So for now, the smart assistant in Google Maps will still depend on how you’re running the app.</p>
<p>Across all Gemini’s incarnations, Google stresses its conversational abilities. Whereas Assistant was hard-pressed to keep one or two balls in the air, you can theoretically give Gemini much more complex instructions. Google’s demo includes someone asking for nearby restaurants with cheap vegan food, but instead of just providing a list, it suggests something based on the user’s input. Gemini can also offer more information about the location.</p>
<p>Maps will also get its own Gemini-infused version of Lens for after you park. You will be able to point the camera at a landmark, restaurant, or other business to get instant answers to your questions. This experience will be distinct from the version of Lens available in the Google app, focused on giving you location-based information. Maybe you want to know about the menu at a restaurant or what it’s like inside. Sure, you could open the door… but AI!</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/so-long-assistant-gemini-is-taking-over-google-maps/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Formula E officially revealed its next electric racing car today. At first glance, the Gen4 machine looks similar to machinery of seasons past, but looks are deceiving—it’s “so much more menacing,” according to Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds. The new car is not only longer and wider, it’s far more powerful. The wings and bodywork now generate meaningful aerodynamic downforce. There will be a new tire supplier as Bridgestone returns to single-seat racing. The car is even completely recyclable.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that everyone <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/03/racing-goes-electric-at-the-track-with-formula-e-the-first-e-racing-series/">who attended a Formula E race</a> in its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/06/the-first-all-electric-formula-e-season-dramatically-concludes-in-london/">first season</a> would have bet on the sport’s continued existence more than a decade down the line. When the cars took their green flag for the first time in Beijing in 2014, as many people derided it for being too slow or for the mid-race car swaps as praised it for trying something new in the world of motorsport.</p>
<p>Despite that, the racing was mostly entertaining, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/formula-e-five-years-on-cars-technica-grades-the-electric-racing-series/">it got better</a> with the introduction of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/formula-es-new-electric-car-looks-like-nothing-else-in-racing/">Gen2 car</a>, which made car swapping a thing of the past. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/formula-es-new-electric-race-car-is-lighter-more-powerful-more-nimble/">Gen3 added more power</a>, then temporary all-wheel drive with the advent of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/formula-e-wraps-up-season-11-where-does-the-all-ev-series-go-next/">the Gen3 Evo days</a>. That car will continue to race in season 12, which kicks off in Brazil on December 6 and ends in mid-August in London. When season 13 picks up in late 2026, we might see a pretty different kind of Formula E racing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/11/formula-e-gets-2x-the-power-and-awd-with-new-gen4-car/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>“The Shenzhou 20 manned spacecraft is suspected of being impacted by small space debris,” the statement said. “Impact analysis and risk assessment are underway.

                            <![CDATA[<p>An alleged extortion attempt, a petty yearslong grudge, shocking social media posts, and ominous text messages make up the latest scandal at the Food and Drug Administration, an agency that industry outsiders are calling a “clown show” and “soap opera” amid the Trump administration’s leadership, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/04/fda-in-disarray-expert-analysis-george-tidmarsh-scandal/">reporting by Stat News.</a></p>
<p>Federal health agencies, in general, have taken heavy blows in Trump’s second term. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in particular, has seen the abrupt dismantling of whole programs and divisions—teams that provide critical health services to Americans. CDC staff regularly describe being demoralized over the last year. Their Senate-confirmed director didn’t make it a full month before being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/ousted-cdc-director-to-testify-before-senate-after-rfk-jr-called-her-a-liar/">dramatically ousted</a> after allegedly refusing to rubber-stamp vaccine recommendations from a panel filled with vaccine skeptics by anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert. F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>While the CDC is in shambles, the FDA has turned into something of a sideshow, with concern mounting that it remains a serious enough regulator to keep America’s medicines and treatments modern and safe. Many of the scandals are tied to Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration’s top vaccine regulator, who also has the titles of chief medical officer and chief scientific officer. Prasad made a name for himself on social media during the pandemic as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/trump-admin-picks-covid-critic-to-be-top-fda-vaccine-regulator/">a COVID-19 response skeptic</a> and, since joining the FDA, has been known for overruling agency scientists and sowing distrust, unrest, and paranoia among staff. He <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/cdc-finally-gets-a-director-fdas-top-vaccine-regulator-exits-under-pressure/">was pushed out of the agency in July</a> only to be reinstated about two weeks later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/fda-described-as-clown-show-amid-latest-scandal-top-drug-regulator-is-out/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Atlantic hurricane season is drawing to a close, and with the tropics quieting down for a winter slumber, the focus of forecasters turns to evaluating what worked and what did not during the preceding season.</p>
<p>This year, the answers are clear. Although Google DeepMind’s Weather Lab <a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/how-were-supporting-better-tropical-cyclone-prediction-with-ai/">only started releasing cyclone track forecasts</a> in June, the company’s AI forecasting service performed exceptionally well. By contrast, the Global Forecast System model, which is operated by the US National Weather Service, is based on traditional physics, and runs on powerful supercomputers, performed abysmally.</p>
<p>The official data comparing forecast model performance will not be published by the National Hurricane Center for a few months. However, Brian McNoldy, a senior researcher at the University of Miami, has already done some <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bmcnoldy.bsky.social/post/3m4iu4atjgc2q">preliminary number crunching</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/googles-new-weather-model-impressed-during-its-first-hurricane-season/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Motion smoothing has a bad reputation among most cinephiles, as well as many home theater enthusiasts and content creators. Also known as motion or video interpolation, motion smoothing is available in virtually every modern TV today. It’s supposed to remove judder from films and TV shows that are shot with 24p (24 frames per second) or 25p film and displayed on 60Hz or 120Hz TVs. But motion smoothing often results in the dreaded soap opera effect and unwanted visual artifacts.</p>
<p>Two upcoming HDR standards, HDR10+ Advanced and Dolby Vision 2, are looking to change how we perceive motion smoothing and more closely align motion interpolation with a creator’s vision. However, it’s unclear if these standards can pull that off.</p>
<h2>HDR10+ Advanced’s Intelligent FRC</h2>
<p>Today, Samsung provided details about the next version of the HDR10 format, which introduces six new features. Among HDR10+ Advanced’s most interesting features is HDR10+ Intelligent FRC (frame rate conversion), which is supposed to improve motion smoothing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/hdr10-advanced-joins-dolby-vision-2-in-trying-to-make-you-like-motion-smoothing/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) launched a face-scanning app for local law enforcement agencies that assist the federal government with immigration-enforcement operations. The Mobile Identify app was released on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.dhs.cbp.mobile.identify.global&amp;ref=404media.co&amp;pli=1">Google Play store</a> on October 30.</p>
<p>“This app facilitates functions authorized by Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),” a US law that lets Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) <a href="https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g">delegate immigration-officer duties</a> to state and local law enforcement, according to the Mobile Identify app’s description on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.dhs.cbp.mobile.identify.global&amp;ref=404media.co&amp;pli=1">Google Play store</a>. “Through a formal agreement, or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), with DHS [Department of Homeland Security], participating agencies like your Sheriff’s Department can have designated officers who are trained, certified, and authorized to perform certain immigration enforcement functions, helping to identify and process individuals who may be in the country unlawfully. This tool is built to streamline those responsibilities securely and efficiently, directly in the field.”</p>
<p>A screenshot of the app on the Google Play listing shows it requires camera access “to take photos of subjects.” More information on how it works was <a href="https://www.404media.co/cbp-quietly-launches-face-scanning-app-for-local-cops-to-do-immigration-enforcement/">reported today by 404 Media</a>. “A source with knowledge of the app told 404 Media the app doesn’t return names after a face search. Instead it tells users to contact ICE and provides a reference number, or to not detain the person depending on the result,” the news report said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/us-gives-local-police-a-face-scanning-app-similar-to-one-used-by-ice-agents/">Read full article</a></p>
