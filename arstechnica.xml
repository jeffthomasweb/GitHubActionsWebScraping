                            <![CDATA[<p>Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat in his 11th year on Capitol Hill, had some things to say when the House Armed Services Committee met last month to write President Trump's Golden Dome missile defense shield into law.</p>
<p>The Republican-led committee debated and voted on an annual defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a sprawling piece of catch-all legislation that does everything from setting pay raises for service members to determining how many airplanes and ships the Pentagon should buy.</p>
<p>Moulton is the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, a panel that oversees the military's nuclear and space programs. In this role, the congressman representing Massachusetts' North Shore is using his voice to counter the Trump administration's signature initiative in the military space arena. Ars recently spoke with Moulton, and we present the interview in its entirety below.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/lawmaker-trumps-golden-dome-will-end-the-madness-and-thats-not-a-good-thing/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Authors are celebrating a "historic" settlement expected to be reached soon in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/ai-industry-horrified-to-face-largest-copyright-class-action-ever-certified/">class-action lawsuit over Anthropic's AI training data</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, US District Judge William Alsup confirmed that Anthropic and the authors "believe they have a settlement in principle" and will file a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by September 5.</p>
<p>The settlement announcement comes after Alsup certified what <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/ai-industry-horrified-to-face-largest-copyright-class-action-ever-certified/">AI industry advocates criticized</a> as the largest copyright class action of all time. Although the lawsuit was raised by three authors—Andrea Bartz, Kirk Wallace Johnson, and Charles Graeber—Alsup allowed up to 7 million claimants to join based on the large number of books that Anthropic may have illegally downloaded to train its AI models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/authors-celebrate-historic-settlement-coming-soon-in-anthropic-class-action/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/">published</a> a blog post on Tuesday titled "Helping people when they need it most" that addresses how its ChatGPT AI assistant handles mental health crises, following what the company calls "recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises."</p>
<p>The post arrives after The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html">reported</a> on a lawsuit filed by Matt and Maria Raine, whose 16-year-old son Adam died by suicide in April after extensive interactions with ChatGPT, which Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">covered extensively</a> in a previous post. According to the lawsuit, ChatGPT provided detailed instructions, romanticized suicide methods, and discouraged the teen from seeking help from his family while OpenAI's system tracked 377 messages flagged for self-harm content without intervening.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is a system of multiple models interacting as an application. In addition to a main AI model like GPT-4o or GPT-5 providing the bulk of the outputs, the application includes components that are typically invisible to the user, including a <a href="https://openai.com/index/using-gpt-4-for-content-moderation/">moderation layer</a> (another AI model) or classifier that reads the text of the ongoing chat sessions. That layer detects potentially harmful outputs and can cut off the conversation if it veers into unhelpful territory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/after-teen-suicide-openai-claims-it-is-helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the US Energy Information Agency <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/">released its latest data</a> on how the US generated electricity during the first six months of 2025. The data suggests the notable surge in power use is flattening out a bit compared to earlier in the year, with the growth in coal use falling along with it. And despite the best efforts of the Trump Administration, the boom in solar power continues, with solar looking poised to pass hydroelectric before the year is out.</p>
<h2>Growing, but moderating</h2>
<p>For the last few decades, the US has largely seen its use of electricity remain flat. That's changed over the last year or so, with energy use ramping up, likely due in part to increased data center use. Earlier in the year, data indicated that demand for electricity was up roughly five percent year-over-year. But that seems to be tailing off over the course of the spring, leaving total electricity demand up by three percent for the January-through-June period.</p>
<p>The somewhat lower demand has had a positive effect on coal use. Earlier this year, coal was up by about 20 percent compared to the same period the year before. Now, it's only up by a bit under 17 percent. That's still terrible given coal's environmental and health impacts, not to mention its cost. But it's not as bad as it has been, and it could have been even better had the Trump Administration not forced a coal plant that was slated for closure <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-admin-orders-dirty-expensive-140000886.html">to stay open</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/us-electricity-2025-solar-continues-growth-coal-still-up/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Social Security Administration (SSA) official alleged in a whistleblower disclosure that DOGE officials created "a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight."</p>
<p>Chuck Borges, the SSA's Chief Data Officer (CDO), "has become aware through reports to him of serious data security lapses, evidently orchestrated by DOGE officials, currently employed as SSA employees, that risk the security of over 300 million Americans' Social Security data," the Government Accountability Project said in a <a href="https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08-26-2025-Borges-Disclosure-Sanitized.pdf">letter</a> sent today to members of Congress and the US Office of Special Counsel.

<p>(It's worth noting that the "26" for this release represents a new versioning scheme meant to map closely to how Apple is now labeling its own operating system releases.)</p>
<p>With this release, the Parallels teams touts built-in support for the upcoming major OS releases from Apple and Microsoft: macOS 26 Tahoe and Windows 11 25H2. That includes changes to make Parallels play nice with macOS 26's new background process restrictions, particularly for Coherence mode.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/parallels-desktop-26-offers-a-lot-to-enterprise-users-a-little-to-consumers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The one-hour launch window opens at 6:30 pm CDT (7:30 pm EDT; 23:30 UTC) at SpaceX's sprawling rocket development site in South Texas, just a couple of miles north of the mouth of the Rio Grande River at the US-Mexico border.</p>
<p>SpaceX called off a launch attempt Sunday after detecting a leak in the plumbing that flows super-cold liquid oxygen propellant into the rocket. Technicians fixed the problem in time for another countdown 24 hours later, but the risk of lightning in the area prevented Starship from lifting off Monday evening.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/with-starship-spacex-encounters-an-obstacle-that-haunted-nasas-space-shuttles/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Raine-v-OpenAI-Complaint-8-26-25.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed Tuesday, mourning parents Matt and Maria Raine alleged that the chatbot offered to draft their 16-year-old son Adam a suicide note after teaching the teen how to subvert safety features and generate technical instructions to help Adam follow through on what ChatGPT claimed would be a "beautiful suicide."</p>
<p>Adam's family was shocked by his death last April, unaware the chatbot was romanticizing suicide while allegedly isolating the teen and discouraging interventions. They've accused OpenAI of deliberately designing the version Adam used, ChatGPT 4o, to encourage and validate the teen's suicidal ideation in its quest to build the world's most engaging chatbot. That includes making a reckless choice to never halt conversations even when the teen shared photos from multiple suicide attempts, the lawsuit alleged.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>EchoStar has agreed to sell $23 billion worth of spectrum licenses to AT&amp;T in a deal spurred by threats made by the Federal Communications Commission to revoke EchoStar's rights to use the spectrum. AT&amp;T said it will use the spectrum to boost its 5G mobile network and expand its fixed wireless home Internet service.</p>
<p>The AT&amp;T/EchoStar deal, which is expected to be completed in mid-2026, could mark the beginning of EchoStar's spectrum portfolio being carved up and sold to other carriers. Starlink operator SpaceX has sought access to some of EchoStar's spectrum, alleging that the company isn't putting it to good use.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://ir.echostar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/echostar-announces-spectrum-sale-and-hybrid-mobile-network">EchoStar announcement</a> today said, "EchoStar has entered into a definitive agreement with AT&amp;T to sell the company's 3.45 GHz and 600 MHz spectrum licenses—a total of 50 MHz of nationwide spectrum—for approximately $23 billion, subject to regulatory approval. In addition, the companies have amended their network services agreement to create a hybrid mobile network operator (MNO) relationship. This transaction is part of EchoStar's ongoing efforts to resolve the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) inquiries."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/att-to-buy-echostar-spectrum-for-23b-further-entrenching-big-3-oligopoly/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple is hosting its next product event on Tuesday, September 9, at 10 am Pacific and 1 pm Eastern, the company announced today. Though Apple's event announcements rarely indicate what the company plans to talk about, the company's September events for well over a decade have all revolved around the iPhone.</p>
<p>The event will be available to stream from YouTube or from <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple's events website</a>.</p>
<p>Rumors about this year's iPhones point to a more significant redesign than in recent years, though Apple isn't (yet?) ready to jump into the world of foldable phones. In addition to new, wider camera areas that span the backs of the devices, the most reliable rumors suggest we'll be getting a new "iPhone Air" that prioritizes thinness and lightness. We're also expecting a standard iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max; the non-Pro Max version of the iPhone may be going away, following in the footsteps of the iPhone mini design from a few years ago.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/08/apples-next-iphone-event-is-happening-september-9-at-1-pm-eastern/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In the golden days of the Internet, before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2019/01/ars-technica-turns-20-years-old-and-we-couldnt-have-done-it-without-the-community/">dysfunctional social media</a>, when forums ruled the roost and people <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2019/01/ars-technica-turns-20-years-old-and-we-couldnt-have-done-it-without-the-community/">formed communities</a>, someone looking for car advice would invariably be told, more than once, "Just get a Miata." For 35 years, the Miata, or MX-5 as it's better known globally, has stuck to the same simple recipe: two seats and a four-cylinder engine in front that drives the rear wheels behind, wrapped in about as small of a body as is possible while still meeting international crash regulations.</p>
<p>Mazda cribbed the recipe from British sports cars of the 1960s but crucially added something those cars lacked—bulletproof reliability and economy-car running costs. Factor in that MX-5s are a joy to drive, and you can see why people online were so quick to recommend what must be the most accessible sports car of all time.</p>
<p>Today, I am going to buck that trend. Well, sort of. Because the take-home from this review is: Buy the 2025 MX-5 Miata, just not the RF.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/2025-mazda-mx-5-rf-review-why-this-folding-hardtop-isnt-the-one-to-get/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Something unusual happened in the world of AI image editing recently. A new model, known as "nano banana," started making the rounds with impressive abilities that landed it at the top of the LMArena leaderboard. Now, Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/updated-image-editing-model/">revealed</a> that nano banana is an innovation from Google DeepMind, and it's being rolled out to the Gemini app today.</p>
<p>AI image editing allows you to modify images with a prompt rather than mucking around in Photoshop. Google first provided editing capabilities in Gemini earlier this year, and the model was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">more than competent out of the gate</a>. But like all generative systems, the non-deterministic nature meant that elements of the image would often change in unpredictable ways. Google says nano banana (technically Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) has unrivaled consistency across edits—it can actually remember the details instead of rolling the dice every time you make a change.</p>
<figure class="video ars-wp-video">
  <div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative" style="aspect-ratio: 1.7777777777778;">

<p>This unlocks several interesting uses for AI image editing. Google suggests uploading a photo of a person and changing their style or attire. For example, you can reimagine someone as a matador or a '90s sitcom character. Because the nano banana model can maintain consistency through edits, the results should still look like the person in the original source image. This is also the case when you make multiple edits in a row. Google says that even down the line, the results should look like the original source material.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/google-improves-gemini-ai-image-editing-with-nano-banana-model/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's been a busy year for Framework, the company behind the now well-established series of repairable, upgradeable, modular laptops (and one paradoxically less-upgradeable desktop). The company has launched a version of the Framework Laptop 13 with Ryzen AI processors, the new Framework Laptop 12, and the aforementioned desktop in the last six months, and last week, Framework <a href="https://frame.work/blog/we-have-something-big-coming">teased</a> that it still had "something big coming."</p>
<p>That "something big" turns out to be the first-ever update to the Framework Laptop 16, Framework's more powerful gaming-laptop-slash-mobile-workstation. Framework is updating the laptop with Ryzen AI processors and new integrated Radeon GPUs and is introducing a new graphics module with the mobile version of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070—one that's also fully compatible with the original Laptop 16, for upgraders.</p>
<p>Preorders for the new laptop open today, and pricing starts at $1,499 for a DIY Edition without RAM, storage, an OS, or Expansion Cards, a $100 increase from the price of the first Framework Laptop 16. The first units will begin shipping in November.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/framework-laptop-16-update-brings-nvidia-geforce-to-the-modular-gaming-laptop/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>For many beer lovers, a nice thick head of foam is one of life's pure pleasures, and the longer that foam lasts, the better the beer-drinking experience. A team of Swiss researchers spent seven years studying why some beer foams last longer than others and found that the degree of fermentation—i.e., whether a given beer has been singly, doubly, or triply fermented—is crucial, according to a new paper published in the journal Physics of Fluids.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/two-new-papers-explore-the-complicated-physics-behind-bubbles-and-foams/">previously reported</a>, foams are ubiquitous in everyday life, found in foods (whipped cream), beverages (beer, cappuccino), shaving cream and hair-styling mousse, packing peanuts, building insulation, flame-retardant materials, and so forth. All foams are the result of air being beaten into a liquid formula that contains some kind of surfactant (active surface agent), usually fats or proteins in edible foams, or chemical additives in non-edible products. That surfactant strengthens the liquid film walls of the bubbles to keep them from collapsing.</p>
<p>Individual bubbles typically form a sphere because that's the shape with the minimum surface area for any volume and hence is the most energy-efficient. One reason for the minimizing principle when it comes to a bubble's shape is that many bubbles can then tightly pack together to form a foam. But bubbles "coarsen" over time, the result of gravity pulling down on the liquid and thinning out the walls. Eventually, they start to look more like soccer balls (polyhedrons). In a coarsening foam, smaller bubbles are gradually absorbed by larger ones. There is less and less liquid to separate the individual bubbles, so they press together to fill the space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/physics-of-why-belgian-beer-foam-is-so-stable/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Part of the Google DeepMind suite of AI-based weather research models, <a href="https://deepmind.google.com/science/weatherlab">the "Weather Lab" model</a> for cyclones was a bit of an unknown for meteorologists at its launch. <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/weather-lab-cyclone-predictions-with-ai/">In a blog post</a> at the time, Google said its new model, trained on a vast dataset that reconstructed past weather and a specialized database containing key information about hurricanes tracks, intensity, and size, had performed well during pre-launch testing.</p>
<p>"Internal testing shows that our model's predictions for cyclone track and intensity are as accurate as, and often more accurate than, current physics-based methods," the company said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/googles-ai-model-just-nailed-the-forecast-for-the-strongest-atlantic-storm-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>To shed light on this struggle, we invite you to join us for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/k0dGDVbeedc">Ars Live talk at 3 pm ET </a>on Tuesday, September 2, with Consumer Technology Association (CTA) Vice President of International Trade Edward Brzytwa. We'll be discussing how tech firms are responding to tariffs so far and how looming chip tariffs could pose the biggest hurdle yet in sourcing alternative supply chains. And anyone joining will have an opportunity to ask their biggest questions about how tariffs could impact consumer tech.</p>
<p>Before Trump even took office, experts had warned that his global trade war—imposing tariffs on imports of various goods from various countries in a bid to strike more favorable trade deals for the US—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/laptop-smartphone-and-game-console-prices-could-soar-after-the-election/">risked spiking prices of popular tech products</a> like laptops, game consoles, and smartphones.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/ars-live-consumer-tech-firms-stuck-scrambling-ahead-of-looming-chip-tariffs/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Android's open nature set it apart from the iPhone as the era of touchscreen smartphones began nearly two decades ago. Little by little, Google has traded some of that openness for security, and its next security initiative could make the biggest concessions yet in the name of blocking bad apps. Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all Android app developers, and not just those publishing on the Play Store. Google intends to <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html?m=1">verify developer identities no matter where they offer their content</a>, and apps without verification won't work on most Android devices in the coming years.</p>
<p>Google used to do very little curation of the Play Store (or Android Market, if you go back far enough), but it has long sought to improve the platform's reputation as being less secure than the Apple App Store. Years ago, you could publish actual exploits in the official store to gain root access on phones, but now there are multiple reviews and detection mechanisms to reduce the prevalence of malware and banned content. While the Play Store is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/researchers-find-north-korean-spy-apps-hosted-in-google-play/">still not perfect</a>, Google claims apps sideloaded from outside its store are 50 times more likely to contain malware.</p>
<p>This, we are led to believe, is the impetus for Google's new developer verification system. The company describes it like an "ID check at the airport." Since requiring all Google Play app developers to verify their identities in 2023, it has seen a precipitous drop in malware and fraud. Bad actors in Google Play leveraged anonymity to distribute malicious apps, so it stands to reason that verifying app developers outside of Google Play could also enhance security.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-will-block-sideloading-of-unverified-android-apps-starting-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>US Senator Ron Wyden accused the federal judiciary of “negligence and incompetence” following a recent hack, reportedly by hackers with ties to the Russian government, that exposed confidential court documents.</p>
<p>The breach of the judiciary’s electronic case filing system first <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/06/federal-court-filing-system-pacer-hack-00496916">came to light</a> in a report by Politico three weeks ago, which went on to say that the vulnerabilities exploited in the hack were known <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/12/federal-courts-hack-security-flaw-00506392">since 2020</a>. The New York Times, citing people familiar with the intrusion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/us/politics/russia-hack-federal-court-system.html">said</a> that Russia was "at least partly responsible" for the hack.</p>
<h2>A “severe threat” to national security</h2>
<p>Two overlapping filing platforms—one known as the CM/ECF (Case Management/Electronic Case Files) and the other PACER—were breached in 2020 in an attack that closely resembled the most recently reported one. The second compromise was first detected around July 5, Politico reported, citing two unnamed sources who weren’t authorized to speak to reporters. Discovery of the hack came a month after Michael Scudder, a judge chairing the Committee on Information Technology for the federal courts’ national policymaking body, <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/judge-scudder-testimony.pdf">told</a> members of the House Judiciary Committee that the federal court system is under constant attack by increasingly sophisticated hackers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/senator-to-supreme-court-justice-federal-court-hacks-threaten-us-security/">Read full article</a></p>
