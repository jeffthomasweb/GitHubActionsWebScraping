              <![CDATA[<p>A jury has awarded WhatsApp $167 million in punitive damages in a case the company brought against Israel-based NSO Group for exploiting a software vulnerability that hijacked the phones of thousands of users.</p>
<p>The verdict, reached Tuesday, comes as a major victory not just for Meta-owned WhatsApp but also for privacy- and security-rights advocates who have long criticized the practices of NSO and other exploit sellers. The jury also awarded WhatsApp $444 million in compensatory damages.</p>
<h2>Clickless exploit</h2>
<p>WhatsApp sued NSO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">in 2019</a> for an attack that targeted roughly 1,400 mobile phones belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials. NSO, which works on behalf of governments and law enforcement authorities in various countries, exploited a critical WhatsApp vulnerability that allowed it to install NSO’s proprietary spyware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/found-quite-possibly-the-most-sophisticated-android-espionage-app-ever/">Pegasus</a> on iOS and Android devices. The clickless exploit worked by placing a call to a target's app. A target did not have to answer the call to be infected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/jury-orders-nso-to-pay-167-million-for-hacking-whatsapp-users/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump is demanding the release of Tina Peters, a former election official who parroted Trump's 2020 election conspiracy theories and is serving nine years in prison for compromising the security of election equipment.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114457992767716636">post</a> on Truth Social last night, Trump wrote that "Radical Left Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser ignores Illegals committing Violent Crimes like Rape and Murder in his State and, instead, jailed Tina Peters, a 69-year-old Gold Star mother who worked to expose and document Democrat Election Fraud. Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment."</p>
<p>Trump said he is "directing the Department of Justice to take all necessary action to help secure the release of this 'hostage' being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats, for political reasons."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/trump-demands-release-of-county-clerk-imprisoned-for-voting-system-breach/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Although we are still waiting for SpaceX to signal when it will fly the Starship rocket again, the company got some good news from the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After a lengthy review, the federal agency agreed to allow SpaceX to substantially increase the number of annual launches from its Starbase launch site in South Texas. Previously, the company was limited to five launches, but now it will be able to conduct up to 25 Starship launches and landings during a calendar year.</p>
<p>"The FAA has determined that modifying SpaceX’s vehicle operator license supporting the increased launch and landing cadence of the Starship/Super Heavy launch vehicle would not significantly impact the quality of the human environment," states the document, known as a <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/94336">Mitigated Finding of No Significant Impact</a>. This finding was signed by Daniel P. Murray, executive director of the FAA's Office of Operational Safety.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/faa-clears-spacex-for-25-launches-a-year-from-its-texas-launch-site/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[<em>Epic v. Apple</em> litigation ushers in minor but user-friendly changes. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last week, a federal judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-after-court-slams-apples-obvious-cover-up/">ruled</a> that Apple was in "willful violation" of a court injunction that required the company to refrain from "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing" in its tightly controlled iOS App Store. Part of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/epic-vs-apple-google/">ongoing litigation</a> between Epic Games and Apple, the injunction specifically forbade Apple from "denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct purchasers to, other purchasing mechanisms."</p>
<p>Following the ruling, Apple said it would comply with the court's injunction while the company continued to appeal the decision. The day after the ruling was handed down, Apple altered several of its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Review Guidelines</a> to grant developers permission to do things they hadn't been allowed to do before. As summarized in an email to developers, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-epic/">reported by MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>3.1.1: Apps on the United States storefront are not prohibited from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others.</p>
<p>3.1.1(a): On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so.</p>
<p>3.1.3: The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront.</p>
<p>3.1.3(a): The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action.</p></blockquote>
<p>We're already beginning to see new versions of apps that take advantage of these changes. Case in point: Amazon's Kindle app for iPhones and iPads, which from its original launch in 2009 up until yesterday wouldn't actually let anyone buy books in the app. Users instead needed to navigate on their own to Amazon's store in Safari or on their PC and Mac and buy the books they wanted, at which point the books would be available in the Kindle app.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/05/for-the-first-time-ever-amazon-kindle-users-on-ios-can-tap-a-button-to-buy-books/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>They say that with age comes wisdom, so it should come as no surprise that on the eve of Alfa Romeo’s 115th anniversary, the company that originally made its name competing in endurance races like the Targa Florio and Mille Miglia with flame-spitting sportscars is currently looking to increase its market share with a sensible, high-riding crossover.</p>
<p>Produced in Stellantis’ Pomigliano d'Arco assembly plant near Naples, Italy, alongside its mechanical twin, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/an-alfa-romeo-bar-the-badge-we-drive-the-2024-dodge-hornet-rt-plug-in/">the Dodge Hornet</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/the-2024-alfa-romeo-tonale-is-a-confoundingly-charming-plug-in-hybrid/">Tonale plug-in hybrid</a> introduced last year helped the Italian automaker find a foothold at a time when many of the auto conglomerate’s brands have been struggling. Now, a non-hybrid version of Alfa’s answer to models like the BMW X1 and Audi Q3 has joined the fray, sporting turbocharged power, standard all-wheel drive, and the same sharp styling at a significantly lower base price. But old habits die hard, and as I discovered over the course of a few days with the latest iteration of the Tonale, even Alfa Romeo’s most pragmatic offerings have their fair share of quirks.</p>
<p>The new base model comes with a double overhead-cam 2.0 L inline four-cylinder engine producing 268 hp (200 kW) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque. The turbocharged mill is paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and an all-wheel drive system that can send up to 50 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels. While those numbers are down a bit compared to the Tonale Hybrid, at 3,715 lbs (1,685 kg), the 2.0 L Turbo is more than 400 lbs (181 kg) lighter than the PHEV model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/2025-alfa-romeo-tonale-turbo-review-italian-charm-that-cuts-both-ways/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia will release the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/even-more-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-and-updates-released/">GeForce RTX 5060</a> on May 19 starting at $299, the company announced via press release today. The new card, a successor to popular past GPUs like the GTX 1060 and RTX 3060, will bring Nvidia's DLSS 4 and Multi Frame-Generation technology to budget-to-mainstream gaming builds—at least, it <em>would</em> if every single GPU launched by any company at any price wasn't instantly selling out these days.</p>
<p>Nvidia announced a May release for the 5060 last month when it released the RTX 5060 Ti for $379 (8GB) and $429 (16GB). Prices for that card so far haven't been <em>as </em>inflated as they have been for the RTX 5070 on up, but the cheapest ones you can currently get are still between $50 and $100 over that MSRP. Unless Nvidia and its partners have made dramatically more RTX 5060 cards than they've made of any other model so far, expect this card to carry a similar pricing premium for a while.</p>

<p>Compared to the RTX 4060, the RTX 5060 adds a few hundred extra CUDA cores and gets a big memory bandwidth increase thanks to the move from GDDR6 to GDDR7. But its utility at higher resolutions will continue to be limited by its 8GB of RAM, which is already becoming a problem for a handful of high-end games at 1440p and 4K.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/nvidias-rtx-5060-arrives-on-may-19-with-a-hypothetical-299-price-tag/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Nintendo's history suggests we can look forward to decades of support.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last month, Nintendo and its third-party partners revealed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">many</a> of the "physical" games on the Switch 2 would be made available <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">only as "Digital Key Cards."</a> Unlike traditional physical Switch games—which contain flash memory with the necessary data to play the game on the card itself—these key cards will simply enable the holder to download a copy of the game to their system and play that copy if and when the transferable key card is inserted in the system.</p>
<p>Already, many players are thinking ahead to what this means for their ability to play Game Key Card releases well into the future. It's not hard to find potential Switch 2 owners publicly worrying about games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendo%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cgame-key-cards%E2%80%9D-for-the-switch-2.1506662/#post-43644552">"disappear[ing] into the void"</a> or becoming "effectively a worthless piece of plastic/e-waste" when Nintendo eventually disables its Switch 2 game download servers. Some go even farther, calling a Game Key Card <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jtpjiy/comment/mlvyf6h/">an "eighty dollar rental"</a> rather than a real game purchase.</p>
<p>While these are valid long-term concerns, I think some players are underestimating the likely timeline for when Game Key Cards will become "useless e-waste." As it stands, we already have an example of Nintendo supporting continued downloads of games purchased nearly two decades ago and counting.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/when-will-switch-2s-data-free-game-key-cards-become-useless-e-waste/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/harvard-sues-to-block-government-funding-cuts/">ongoing war</a> between the Trump administration and Harvard University has taken a new twist, with the government sending Harvard a letter that, amid what appears to be a stream-of-consciousness culture war rant, announces that the university will not be receiving any further research grants. The letter potentially suggests that Harvard could see funding restored by "complying with long-settled Federal Law," but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/harvard-says-feds-research-funding-demands-amount-to-a-takeover/">earlier demands</a> from the administration included conditions that went well beyond those required by law.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/edsecmcmahon/status/1919517481313427594?s=12&amp;t=B249_tKxjEY9hASKEpvqLw">The letter</a>, sent by Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, makes it somewhat difficult to tell exactly what the government wants, because most of the text is a borderline deranged rant written in florid MAGA-ese. You don't have to go beyond the first paragraph to get a sense that this is less a setting of funding conditions than an airing of grievances:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of using these funds to advance the education of its students, Harvard is engaging in a systemic pattern of violating federal law. Where do many of these "students" come from, who are they, how do they get into Harvard, or even into our country—and why is there so much HATE? These are questions that must be answered, among many more, but the biggest question of all is, why will Harvard not give straightforward answers to the American public?</p></blockquote>
<p>Does Harvard have to answer these questions to get funding restored? It's unclear.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trump-administration-cuts-off-all-future-federal-funding-to-harvard/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Knog's Scout gives bikes a motion-sensitive alarm and Bluetooth tracking.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>We've reviewed some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/the-trek-madone-slr-9-gen-8-tears-up-the-roads-and-conquers-climbs/">pretty expensive bikes</a> here at Ars, and one of the consistent concerns we see in the comments is the fear of theft. That's a widely shared fear, based on a whole bunch of videos that describe how to hide an AirTag tracker where a potential bike thief won't notice it. There are also a number of products available that will hold a hidden AirTag in a reflector, a bike bell, or the head tube.</p>
<p>But Apple has also made it possible for third parties to plug their devices into its "Find My" system, and a company called Knog has made a <a href="https://us.knog.com/products/scout?srsltid=AfmBOoplAT2RYBkqr2j_AFsevWZV4gV3dcRuobAiBjYdqtod9vj2LHgX">Bluetooth bike tracker called the Scout</a> that does just that. The Scout goes well beyond tracking, though, providing a motion-sensitive alarm system that will alert you if anybody tries to move your bike.</p>
<h2>Meet the Scout</h2>
<p>The Scout can be attached to the frame using the screw holes normally used for a water bottle holder. Security screws make it considerably more difficult to remove. Once there, it uses Apple's Find My network to keep the owner apprised of the bike's location (Android users need not apply at the moment). If you're leaving your bike in a high-risk location, you can also use Knog's phone application to set an alarm that will be triggered if the bike is moved.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/reviews/2025/05/find-my-bicycle/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Tesla is in deep trouble in Europe. The electric vehicle maker, which once dominated EV sales in the region, is facing sales declines of more than 50 percent in France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and the UK. Sales in Germany weren't quite as bad—they fell by 46 percent in April, with slightly smaller decreases in Portugal and Spain. Only Italy and Norway saw any kind of sales growth.</p>
<p>The headwinds were already looking unfavorable for Tesla even before CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/after-two-court-losses-doge-asks-supreme-court-for-social-security-data-access/">threw his lot in</a> with Donald Trump and his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/in-his-first-100-days-trump-launched-an-all-out-assault-on-the-environment/">authoritarian makeover</a> of the US government. A small and outdated product portfolio was already looking stale compared to the influx of EVs from Chinese brands and European automakers, but Musk's hard-right turn and the US government's ongoing antagonism toward the rest of the world has soured the brand entirely. And a recent styling refresh for the Model Y has failed to arrest the slide.</p>
<p>The UK has been one of Tesla's biggest markets in Europe, and it's seeing something of an EV boom, with 8.1 percent more BEVs registered in April 2025 than the year before, even as overall car sales have dropped by 10.4 percent year on year. But Tesla's sales fell by 62 percent—the automaker registered just 512 cars all month. For context, 120,331 new cars were registered in the UK <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/vehicle-data/car-registrations/">last month</a>, of which 24,558 were BEVs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-sales-fall-by-62-in-the-uk-46-in-germany/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US data center industry has warned that the Trump administration’s crackdown on renewable energy could slow its growth and undermine Washington’s goal to win the global artificial intelligence race.</p>
<p>Renewables have become a flashpoint since Donald Trump re-entered the White House, with his administration suspending clean energy developments on federal land, pausing federal loans, and last month canceling high-profile projects such as Equinor’s $5 billion Empire Wind site.</p>
<p>For tech companies struggling to secure reliable energy supplies to power and train AI, a clampdown on renewables could create power bottlenecks, drive up costs, and push operators towards dirtier energy, experts said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/trumps-attacks-on-green-energy-are-big-trouble-for-data-centers-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is releasing a pair of new Surface devices today, both models that undercut last year's Surface Laptop and Surface Pro on price but also take a pretty big step down in specs. One of the devices is a new 12-inch Surface Pro tablet, which we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsofts-12-inch-surface-pro-is-cheaper-but-unfixes-a-decade-old-design-problem">covered in more detail here</a>. The other is a new 13-inch Surface Laptop, whose specs and price straddle the narrow gap between the current seventh-generation Surface Laptop and the original price of the aging Surface Laptop Go 3.</p>
<p>The new Surface Laptop starts at $899, and preorders open today. It will be available on May 20.</p>
<p>The new laptop shares many specs in common with last year’s entry-level seventh-generation Surface Laptop, including an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM, and support for Windows 11’s expanded Copilot+ capabilities. It’s also smaller and lighter than the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop. But the CPU has eight cores instead of 10 or 12, the screen is smaller and lower resolution, and you’re more limited in your upgrade options; we’ve outlined the key differences in the table below.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/lighter-cheaper-surface-laptop-saves-a-little-money-but-gives-up-a-lot/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is introducing a pair of new Surface devices today, both aimed slightly down-market from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/surface-pro-11-and-laptop-7-review-an-apple-silicon-moment-for-windows/">11th-generation Surface Pro tablet and 7th-generation Surface Laptop</a> that the company released last spring. One is a 13-inch Surface Laptop, which we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/lighter-cheaper-surface-laptop-saves-a-little-money-but-gives-up-a-lot">covered in more detail here</a>. The second (and more notably changed) device is a new 12-inch Surface Pro tablet, which is the first significant design change we've seen in the Surface Pro lineup since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/hands-on-with-microsofts-barrage-of-new-surface-devices/">first ARM-based Surface Pro X</a> was released in 2019.</p>
<p>Preorders for both new Surface devices begin today, and they begin shipping on May 20. The 12-inch Surface Pro starts at $799, and the keyboard cover remains a separate purchase, available for $149.</p>
<p>The 12-inch Surface Pro is a cheaper alternative to the $939-and-up 13-inch Surface Pro (which Microsoft is continuing to sell), and the smallest Surface Microsoft has tried since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/surface-go-3-is-a-processor-bump-for-microsofts-smallest-tablet/">10.5-inch underspecced Surface Go series</a>. In addition to the smaller screen, the base model includes a bunch of other minor downgrades from the flagship 13-inch tablet, as outlined in the table below. But it's also nearly half a pound lighter, and its 8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor should still deliver solid performance and compatibility with the extra Windows 11 features available on Copilot+ PCs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsofts-12-inch-surface-pro-is-cheaper-but-unfixes-a-decade-old-design-problem/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Most astronauts these days are fairly anonymous, and chances are you have never heard of Nichole Ayers. And that's OK.</p>
<p>But sometimes it's worth pausing for a moment to reflect on just how accomplished these people are. Ayers, 36, flew the supersonic F-22 stealth aircraft in the international war against the Islamic State and rose to become a major in the US Air Force before being selected as a NASA astronaut in 2021. Oh, yeah, she also completed a master's degree in computational and applied mathematics at Rice University.</p>
<p>For her first spaceflight, Ayers launched on the Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station in March. This flight got a fair amount of media attention, but that was largely because the arrival of Crew-10 allowed the Crew Dragon spacecraft to which Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were assigned to return home. Since then, Ayers has spent 50 days in space, astronauting. This included a spacewalk last week, her first, alongside veteran astronaut Anne McClain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/tuesday-telescope-its-not-space-weather-but-weather-from-space/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A California man has pleaded guilty to hacking an employee of The Walt Disney Company by tricking the person into running a malicious version of a widely used open source AI image-generation tool.</p>
<p>Ryan Mitchell Kramer, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, the US Attorney for the Central District of California <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/santa-clarita-man-agrees-plead-guilty-hacking-disney-employees-computer-downloading">said Monday</a>. In a plea agreement, Kramer said he published an app on GitHub for creating AI-generated art. The program contained malicious code that gave access to computers that installed it. Kramer operated using the moniker NullBulge.</p>
<h2>Not the ComfyUI you’re looking for</h2>
<p>According to researchers at <a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/news/comfyui-malicious-custom-node/">VPNMentor</a>, the program Kramer used was ComfyUI_LLMVISION, which purported to be an extension for the legitimate <a href="https://comfy.icu/">ComfyUI</a> image generator and had functions added to it for copying passwords, payment card data, and other sensitive information from machines that installed it. The fake extension then sent the data to a Discord server that Kramer operated. To better disguise the malicious code, it was folded into files that used the names OpenAI and Anthropic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/man-pleads-guilty-to-using-malicious-ai-software-to-hack-disney-employee/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In a hard-to-watch video, a healthy-looking 4-year-old boy lies on a bed as doctors lift his eyelids to watch his big brown eyes erratically swirl and roll backward. His head jerks, and his little limbs weakly twitch and spasm. A small bit of foam pushes past his lips.</p>
<p>The video, captured by neurologists in India and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2833454">published today in JAMA Neurology</a>, shows what it looks like when the measles virus is allowed to ravage a child's brain. (The video can be viewed <a href="https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18967853">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The boy was never vaccinated and developed a rare complication from measles called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The condition occurs when the measles virus quietly sneaks into the central nervous system. It often lurks for years after an initial infection before it begins wreaking havoc, triggering damaging inflammation, destroying neurons, and causing brain lesions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/heartbreaking-video-shows-deadly-risk-of-skipping-measles-vaccine/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A messaging service used by former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has temporarily shut down while the company investigates an apparent hack. The messaging app is used to access and archive Signal messages but is not made by Signal itself.</p>
<p>404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/">reported</a> yesterday that a hacker stole data "from TeleMessage, an obscure Israeli company that sells modified versions of Signal and other messaging apps to the US government to archive messages." 404 Media interviewed the hacker and reported that the data stolen "contains the contents of some direct messages and group chats sent using [TeleMessage's] Signal clone, as well as modified versions of WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat."</p>
<p>TeleMessage is based in Israel and was <a href="https://www.smarsh.com/press-release/smarsh-completes-acquisition-of-telemessage-extends-communications-compliance-leadership">acquired in February 2024</a> by Smarsh, a company headquartered in Portland, Oregon. Smarsh provided a statement to Ars today saying it has temporarily shut down all TeleMessage services.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/signal-clone-used-by-trump-official-stops-operations-after-report-it-was-hacked/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/evolving-our-structure/">announced</a> it will remain under the control of its founding nonprofit board, scrapping its controversial plan to split off its commercial operations as a for-profit company after mounting pressure from critics.</p>
<p>In an official OpenAI blog post announcing the latest restructuring decision, CEO Sam Altman wrote: "We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware."</p>
<p>The move represents a significant shift in OpenAI's proposed restructuring. While the most recent previous version of the company's plan (which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/openai-defends-for-profit-shift-as-critical-to-sustain-humanitarian-mission/">we covered</a> in December) would have established OpenAI as a Public Benefit Corporation with the nonprofit merely holding shares and having limited influence, the revised approach keeps the nonprofit firmly in control of operations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-scraps-controversial-plan-to-become-for-profit-after-mounting-pressure/">Read full article</a></p>
