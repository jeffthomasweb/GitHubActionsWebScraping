            <![CDATA[The core stage of NASA's Space Launch System is now integrated with the rocket's twin boosters.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Late Saturday night, technicians at Kennedy Space Center in Florida moved the core stage for NASA's second Space Launch System rocket into position between the vehicle's two solid-fueled boosters.</p>
<p>Working inside the iconic 52-story-tall Vehicle Assembly Building, ground teams used heavy-duty cranes to first lift the butterscotch orange core stage from its cradle in the VAB's cavernous transfer aisle, the central passageway between the building's four rocket assembly bays. The cranes then rotated the structure vertically, allowing workers to disconnect one of the cranes from the bottom of the rocket.</p>
<p>That left the rocket hanging on a 325-ton overhead crane, which would lift it over the transom into the building's northeast high bay. The Boeing-built core stage weighs about 94 tons (85 metric tons), measures about 212 feet (65 meters) tall, and will contain 730,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant at liftoff. It is the single largest element for NASA's Artemis II mission, slated to ferry a crew of astronauts around the far side of the Moon as soon as next year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/as-preps-continue-its-looking-more-likely-nasa-will-fly-the-artemis-ii-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The H5N1 bird flu has spilled over to a sheep for the first time, infecting a domesticated ruminant in the United Kingdom much like it has in US dairy cows, according to UK officials.</p>
<p>The single sheep—a ewe—in Yorkshire, England, was confirmed infected after captive birds on the same property had tested positive for the virus, according to an announcement Monday. The ewe's milk was found to be positive for the virus through a PCR test, which detected genetic signatures of the virus. The ewe also had H5 antibodies in its blood. At the time of the confirmation, the ewe had symptoms of the infection in the way of mastitis, inflammation of the mammary glands.</p>
<p>This mirrors what US dairy farmers have been seeing in cows. An outbreak of H5N1 in dairy cows erupted a year ago, on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html">March 25, 2024</a>. Since then, at least <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">989 herds across 17 states</a> have been infected with bird flu. In previous reports, farmers and researchers have noted that the virus appears <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39387556/">to attack the animal's mammary glands</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08166-6">their milk is teeming with the virus</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/uk-on-alert-after-h5n1-bird-flu-spills-over-to-sheep-in-world-first/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Google and the Computer History Museum (CHM) <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/chm-releases-alexnet-source-code/">jointly released</a> the source code for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a>, the convolutional neural network (CNN) that many credit with transforming the AI field in 2012 by proving that "deep learning" could achieve things conventional AI techniques could not.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/12/how-neural-networks-work-and-why-theyve-become-a-big-business/">Deep learning</a>, which uses multi-layered neural networks that can learn from data without explicit programming, represented a significant departure from traditional AI approaches that relied on hand-crafted rules and features.</p>
<p>The Python code, now available on CHM's <a href="https://github.com/computerhistory/AlexNet-Source-Code">GitHub page</a> as open source software, offers AI enthusiasts and researchers a glimpse into a key moment of computing history. AlexNet served as a watershed moment in AI because it could accurately identify objects in photographs with unprecedented accuracy—correctly classifying images into one of 1,000 categories like "strawberry," "school bus," or "golden retriever" with significantly fewer errors than previous systems.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/you-can-now-download-the-source-code-that-sparked-the-ai-boom/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It is an immutable law of nature that when you receive a corporate email with a subject line like "Changes coming to your Pixel 4a," the changes won't be the sort you like. Indeed, a more honest subject line would usually be: "You're about to get hosed."</p>
<p>So I wasn't surprised, as I read further into this January missive from Google, that an "upcoming software update for your Pixel 4a" would "affect the overall performance and stability of its battery."</p>
<p>How would my battery be affected? Negatively, of course. "This update will reduce your battery’s runtime and charging performance," the email said.

              <![CDATA[<p>A prominent journalist knew the US military would start <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-yemen-houthis-rebels-attack-airstrike-11b0e080b3982542dd621338a7b18afd">bombing Houthi targets</a> in Yemen two hours before it happened on March 15 because top Trump administration officials accidentally included the reporter on a Signal text chain in which they discussed the war plan.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, described the surprising leak of sensitive military information in an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">article today</a>. The National Security Council confirmed that the messages were real and said it is investigating how Goldberg was added to a thread in which the war information was discussed.</p>
<p>"The world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen," Goldberg wrote. "I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-secret-bombing-plans-to-a-reporter/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Due to staff reductions, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, the National Weather Service has announced a series of suspensions involving weather balloon launches in recent weeks. The question is, will this significantly degrade forecasts in the United States and around the world?</p>
<p>On February 27, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2025/pns25-08_kotzebue_ak_upper_air_suspension.pdf">it was announced</a> that balloon launches would be suspended entirely at Kotzebue, Alaska, due to staffing shortages. In early March, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2025/pns25-11_intermittent_suspension_of_raob_Launches-aly_gyx.pdf">Albany, N.Y., and Gray, Maine, announced</a> periodic disruptions in launches. Since March 7, it appears that <a href="https://weather.uwyo.edu/cgi-bin/sounding?region=naconf&amp;TYPE=TEXT%3ALIST&amp;YEAR=2025&amp;MONTH=03&amp;FROM=0700&amp;TO=2212&amp;STNM=74389">Gray has not missed</a> any balloon launches through Saturday. Albany, however, <a href="https://weather.uwyo.edu/cgi-bin/sounding?region=naconf&amp;TYPE=TEXT%3ALIST&amp;YEAR=2025&amp;MONTH=03&amp;FROM=0700&amp;TO=2212&amp;STNM=72518">has missed 14 of them</a>, all during the morning launch cycle (12z).</p>
<p>The kicker came on Thursday afternoon when it was announced that <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2025/pns25-17_Suspension_RAOB_Launches_OAX-UNR.pdf">all balloon launches would be suspended</a> in Omaha, Neb., and Rapid City, S.D., due to staffing shortages. Additionally, the balloon launches in Aberdeen, S.D.; Grand Junction, Colo.; Green Bay, Wis.; Gaylord, Mich.; North Platte, Neb.; and Riverton, Wyo., <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2025/pns25-18_Reduction_RAOB_Launches_ABR_GJT_GRB_APX_LBF_RIW.pdf">would be reduced to once a day from twice a day</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/should-we-be-concerned-about-the-loss-of-weather-balloons/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A new report says that when the Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/sec-sues-elon-musk-says-he-cheated-twitter-investors-out-of-150-million/">sued Elon Musk</a> less than a week before President Trump's inauguration, only one member—the current chairman—voted against filing the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The vote behind closed doors was 4–1, with three Democrats and Republican Hester Peirce joining to support the lawsuit over Musk's late disclosure of a Twitter stock purchase in early 2022, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/interim-sec-chief-cast-sole-vote-against-suing-musk-2025-03-24/">Reuters reported today</a>. The one dissent reportedly came from Republican Mark Uyeda, who was subsequently named acting SEC chairman by Trump.</p>
<p>Uyeda also asked SEC enforcement staff "to declare that a case they wanted to bring against Elon Musk was not motivated by politics, an unusual request that the staffers refused," Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/sec-official-sought-staff-s-no-politics-pledge-on-musk-lawsuit">reported last month</a>. Reuters said its sources confirmed that "staff refused to sign the pledge, as it is not typical SEC practice."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/current-sec-chair-cast-only-vote-against-suing-elon-musk-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Valve's Harrington: Unchecked CD duplication "put our entire business model at risk."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Back in 2004, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">the launch of <em>Half-Life 2</em> would help launch Steam</a> on the path to eventually becoming the de facto digital rights management (DRM) system for the vast majority of PC games. But years before that, with the 1998 launch of the original <em>Half-Life</em>, Valve cofounder and then-CMO Monica Harrington said she was inspired to take DRM more seriously by her nephew's reaction to the purchase of a new CD-ROM burner.</p>
<p>PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-drm-was-inspired-by-the-cmos-nephew-who-used-a-usd500-check-id-sent-him-for-school-expenses-and-bought-himself-a-cd-rom-replicator-he-sent-me-a-lovely-thank-you-note/">pulled that interesting tidbit</a> from <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/how-valve-became-valve-an-insiders-account/911257">a talk Harrington gave at last week's Game Developers Conference</a>. In her remembering, Harrington's nephew had used funds she had sent for school supplies on a CD replicator, then sent her "a lovely thank you note essentially saying how happy he was to copy and share games with his friends."</p>
<p>That was the moment Harrington said she realized this new technology was leading to a "generational shift" in both the availability and acceptability of PC game piracy. While game piracy and DRM definitely existed prior to CD burners (anyone else remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Tz0YpDa6o">large codewheels</a> that cluttered many early PC game boxes?), Harrington said the new technology—and the blasé attitude her nephew showed toward using it for piracy—could "put our entire business model at risk."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/how-a-nephews-cd-burner-inspired-early-valve-to-embrace-drm/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Author, journalist, and long-time Internet freedom advocate Doc Searls wants us to stop asking for privacy from websites, services, and AI and start telling these things what we will and will not accept.</p>
<p>Draft standard <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">IEEE P7012</a>, which Searls has nicknamed "MyTerms" (akin to "Wi-Fi"), is a Draft Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms. <a href="https://doc.searls.com/">Searls writes on his blog</a> that MyTerms has been in the works since 2017, and a fully readable version should be ready later this year, following conference presentations at VRM Day and the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW).</p>
<p>The big concept is that you are the first party to each contract you have with online things. The websites, apps, or services you visit are the second party. You arrive with either a pre-set contract you prefer on your device or pick one when you arrive, and it tells the site what information you will and will not offer up for access to content or services. Presumably, a site can work with that contract, modify itself to meet the terms, or perhaps tell you it can't do that.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/doc-searls-myterms-aims-to-offer-user-first-privacy-contracts-for-the-web/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Google Maps Timeline has long been a useful though slightly uncomfortable feature that maintains a complete record of everywhere your phone goes (and probably you with it). Google recently changed the way it stored timeline data to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/googles-confusing-new-location-settings-hide-data-in-two-different-places/">improve privacy</a>, but the company now confirms that a "technical issue" resulted in many users losing their timeline history altogether, and there might not be any way to recover it.</p>
<p>Timeline, previously known as Location History, is very useful if you need to figure out where you were on a particular day or if you just can't remember where you found that neat bar on your last vacation. Many Google users grew quite fond of having access to that data. However, Google had access to it, too. Starting in 2024, Google transitioned to storing Timeline data only on the user's individual smartphone instead of backing it up to the cloud. You can probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>Users started piping up over the past several weeks, posting on the <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/thread/329356095/timeline-history-is-missing?hl=en">Google support forums</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1j78uau/timeline_disappeared/">Reddit</a>, and other social media that their treasured Timeline data had gone missing. Google has been investigating the problem, and the news isn't good. In an email sent out over the weekend, Google confirmed what many already feared: Maps has accidentally deleted Timeline data on countless devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/oops-google-says-it-might-have-deleted-your-maps-timeline-data/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1 spent this past weekend in Shanghai for the 2025 Chinese Grand Prix. There was a little something for everyone: entertaining racing on-track, different winners for the sprint and Grand Prix, some driver and team intrigue, rumors of a potential technical shake-up happening soon, and a bit of an argument that exposes the entertainment side of the sport.</p>
<p>Once out in the countryside, skyscrapers are starting to fill in the backdrop behind the Shanghai International Circuit. One of the mid-2000s crop of race tracks designed by Hermann Tilke, it's characterized by the neverending decreasing radii that are turns 1 and 2, plus the longest straight on the calendar. It was freshly resurfaced for this year, eliminating the bumps and increasing the grip level to fix a botched job performed ahead of last year's F1 race.</p>
<p>China was home to the first sprint weekend of the year, with a 19-lap race on Saturday in place of that morning's practice session ahead of the 56-lap race on Sunday. Lewis Hamilton, now clad in bright Ferrari red, led from start to finish, showing the kind of ability that has led him to 105 race wins. Hamilton's last year with Mercedes was better than the winless 2022 and 2023, but his new Ferrari already appears to suit him better.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/driver-intrigue-v10-rumors-and-a-good-sprint-weekend-f1-in-shanghai/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, the genetic testing and heritage company 23andMe <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-initiates-voluntary-chapter-11-process-maximize">announced</a> that it had entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was asking a court to arrange its sale. The company has been losing money for years, and a conflict between its board and CEO about future directions led to the <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/independent-directors-23andme-resign-board">entire board resigning</a> back in September. Said CEO, Anne Wojcicki, has now resigned and will be pursuing an attempt to purchase the company and take it private.</p>
<p>At stake is the fate of genetic data from the company's 15 million customers. The company has secured enough funding to continue operations while a buyer is found, and even though US law limits how genetic data can be used, the pending sale has raised significant privacy concerns.</p>
<h2>Risky business</h2>
<p>The company launched around the time that "gene chips" first allowed people to broadly scan the human genome for sites where variations were common. A few of these variants are associated with diseases, and 23andMe received approval to test for a number of these. But its big selling point for many people was the opportunity to explore their heritage. This relied on looking broadly at the patterns of variation and comparing those to the patterns typically found in different geographic regions. It's an imperfect analysis, but it can often provide a decent big-picture resolution of a person's ancestry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/genetic-testing-company-23andme-declares-bankruptcy/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[The AWD Optiq is quite competitive in the sub-$60,000 EV crossover segment.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Cadillac provided flights from Los Angeles to San Fransisco and accommodation so Ars could drive the Optiq. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Badging on the rear of the new Cadillac Optiq may confuse some American buyers. This crossover is fully electric, so the alphanumeric nomenclature can't refer to engine displacement—and not horsepower, either. Instead, 500E4 refers to 500 Newton-meters of torque, the metric units for more familiar pound-feet, plus dual-motor all-wheel drive. Rating the Optiq's output in kilowatts might have at least rendered something at least somewhat more comprehensible, but the designation hints at the Optiq's intended global market, which in turn reveals just how important this crossover EV is for Cadillac's future.</p>
<p>The Optiq slots in as an upmarket variant of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-chevrolet-equinox-ev-shows-gm-can-make-a-car-for-the-masses/">the Chevrolet Equinox EV</a>, featuring a suite of enhancements unveiled at a Downtown Los Angeles preview last spring. With the exterior design, interior materials, and tech features all known quantities, I arrived to a drive program held in the San Francisco Bay Area—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/the-2025-cadillac-escalade-iq-first-drive-460-miles-on-a-single-charge.1506244/">concurrently with the Escalade IQ</a>—more curious to experience how much the Optiq's additional power and refinement can possibly improve on the already solid Equinox.</p>
<p>On paper, the Caddy bests its Chevy counterpart despite using much of the same hardware. In this case, an 85-kilowatt-hour battery allows for an EPA-estimated range of 302 miles (486 km) despite output from dual motors matching the AWD Equinox at 300 hp (223 kW), just with a bit more in the torque department at 354 lb-ft (almost, but not quite, that 500Nm figure).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-cadillac-optiq-sensibly-sized-and-improves-on-the-equinox-ev/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of November 2024, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected Amazon’s request to buy an additional 180 megawatts of power directly from the Susquehanna nuclear power plant for a data center located nearby. The rejection was due to the argument that buying power directly instead of getting it through the grid like everyone else works against the interests of other users.</p>
<p>Demand for power in the US has been flat for nearly 20 years. “But now we’re seeing load forecasts shooting up. Depending on [what] numbers you want to accept, they’re either skyrocketing or they’re just rapidly increasing,” said Mark Christie, a FERC commissioner.</p>
<p>Part of the surge in demand comes from data centers, and their increasing thirst for power comes in part from running increasingly sophisticated AI models. As with all world-shaping developments, what set this trend into motion was vision—quite literally.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/can-we-make-ai-less-power-hungry-these-researchers-are-working-on-it/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the course of his long career, magician and endurance performer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blaine">David Blaine</a> has taken on all kinds of death-defying feats: catching a bullet in his teeth, fasting for 44 days, or holding his breath for a record-breaking 17 minutes and 4 seconds, to name a few. Viewers will get to see a different side of Blaine as he travels the world to meet kindred spirits from a wide range of cultures in <em>David Blaine Do Not Attempt</em>, a new six-episode docuseries from National Geographic.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<p>The series was shot over three calendar years (2022-2024) in nine different countries and features Blaine interacting with, and learning from, all manner of daredevils, athletes, street performers, and magicians. In Southeast Asia, for instance, he watches practitioners of an Indonesian martial art called Debus manipulate razor blades in their mouths and eat nails. (There is no trick to this, just conditioned endurance to pain, as Blaine discovers when he attempts to eat nails: his throat was sore for days.) He braves placing scorpions on his body, breaks a bottle with his head, and sets himself on fire in Brazil while jumping off a high bridge.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/david-blaine-shows-his-hand-in-do-not-attempt/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>At the time, Daniel Metzler led a team of 40 students working on rocket engines and launching sounding rockets. Josef Fleischmann was on the team that won the first SpaceX <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/is-it-time-to-take-the-hyperloop-seriously/">Hyperloop competition</a>. Together with another classmate, Markus Brandl, they crafted rocket parts in a campus workshop before taking the leap and establishing Isar Aerospace, named for the river running through the Bavarian capital.</p>
<p>Now, Isar's big moment has arrived. The company's orbital-class first rocket, named Spectrum, is set to lift off from a shoreline launch pad in Norway as soon as this week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/this-launcher-is-about-to-displace-the-v-2-as-germanys-largest-rocket/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document, on which Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/19/trump-aides-circulate-plan-for-complete-revamp-of-foreign-aid-programs-00238862">first reported</a>, states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process.</p>
<p>“All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reads. “This approach would encourage innovation and efficiency among implementing partners and allow for more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.”</p>
<p>The memo does not make clear what specifically this means—if it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-administrations-blockchain-plan-for-usaid-is-a-real-head-scratcher/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Anyone who has suffered the indignity of a splinter, a blister, or a paper cut knows that small things can sometimes be hugely annoying. You aren't going to die from any of these conditions, but it's still hard to focus when, say, the back of your right foot is rubbing a new blister against the inside of your not-quite-broken-in-yet hiking boots.</p>
<p>I found myself in the computing version of this situation yesterday, when I was trying to work on a new Mac Mini and was brought up short by the fact that my third mouse button (that is, clicking on the scroll wheel) did nothing. This was odd, because I have for many years assigned this button to "Mission Control" on macOS—a feature that tiles every open window on your machine, making it quick and easy to switch apps. When I got the new Mini, I immediately added this to my settings. Boom!</p>
<p>And yet there I was, a couple hours later, clicking the middle mouse button by reflex and getting no result. This seemed quite odd—had I only <em>imagined</em> that I made the settings change? I made the alteration again in System Settings and went back to work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/sometimes-its-the-little-tech-annoyances-that-sting-the-most/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Measles has arrived in Kansas and is spreading swiftly in communities with very low vaccination rates. Since last week, the state has tallied 10 cases across three counties, with more pending.</p>
<p>On March 13, <a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483">health officials announced the state's first measles case</a> since 2018. The case was reported in Stevens County, which sits in the southwest corner of the state. As of now, it's unclear if the case is connected to the mushrooming outbreak that began in West Texas.</p>
<p>That initial case in Kansas already shows potential to mushroom on its own. Stevens County contains two school districts, both of which have extremely low vaccination rates among kindergartners. By the time children enter kindergarten, they should have their two doses of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, which together are 97 percent effective against measles. In the 2023–2024 school year, rates of kindergartners with their two shots stood at 83 percent in the Hugoton school district and 80 percent in the Moscow school district, <a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2016/Kindergarten-Immunization-Data">according to state data</a>. Those rates are significantly below the 95 percent threshold needed to block the onward community spread of measles—one of the most infectious viruses known to humankind.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/measles-takes-off-in-kansas-amid-low-vaccination-at-least-10-cases-reported/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, web infrastructure provider Cloudflare announced a new feature called "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/">AI Labyrinth</a>" that aims to combat unauthorized AI data scraping by serving fake AI-generated content to bots. The tool will attempt to thwart AI companies that crawl websites without permission to collect training data for large language models that power AI assistants like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>Cloudflare, founded in 2009, is probably best known as a company that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare">provides</a> infrastructure and security services for websites, particularly protection against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS_mitigation">distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) attacks and other malicious traffic.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Instead of simply blocking bots, Cloudflare's new system lures them into a "maze" of realistic-looking but irrelevant pages, wasting the crawler's computing resources. The approach is a notable shift from the standard block-and-defend strategy used by most website protection services. Cloudflare says blocking bots sometimes backfires because it alerts the crawler's operators that they've been detected.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/">Read full article</a></p>
