<p>Anybody can contribute to the Linux kernel, but any person's commit suggestion can become the subject of the kernel's master and namesake, Linus Torvalds. Torvalds is famously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/01/linus-torvalds-responds-to-ars-about-diversity-niceness-in-open-source/">not overly committed to niceness</a>, though he has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/linus-torvalds-apologizes-for-years-of-being-a-jerk-takes-time-off-to-learn-empathy/">working on it since 2018</a>. You can see glimpses of this newer, less curse-laden approach in how Torvalds recently addressed a commit with which he vehemently disagreed. It involves tabs.</p>
<p>The commit last week changed <a href="https://git.kernel.dk/?p=linux-block.git;a=commit;h=d96c36004e31">exactly one thing on one line</a>, replacing a tab character with a space: "It helps Kconfig parsers to read file without error." Torvalds responded with a commit of his own, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/16/torvalds_complicates_his_indents/">as spotted by The Register</a>, which would "<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/diff/?id=d5cf50dafc9dd5faa1e61e7021e3496ddf7fd61e">add some hidden tabs on purpose</a>." Trying to smooth over a tabs-versus-spaces matter seemed to awaken Torvalds to the need to have tab-detecting failures be "more obvious." Torvalds would have added more, he wrote, but didn't "want to make things uglier than necessary. But it *might* be necessary if it turns out we see more of this kind of silly tooling."</p>
<p>If you've read this far and don't understand what's happening, please allow me, a failed CS minor, to offer a quick explanation: <a href="https://www.popsci.com/inside-silicon-valleys-spaces-and-tabs-debate/">Tabs Versus Spaces</a> will <a href="https://roberttruesdale.medium.com/tabs-vs-spaces-the-never-ending-battle-beyond-code-037d493e6dd8">never</a> be truly resolved, codified, or set right by standards, and the energy spent on the issue over time could, if harnessed, likely power one or more small nations. Still, the Linux kernel has <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html">its own coding style</a>, and it directly cites "K&amp;R," or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/unix-legend-who-owes-us-nothing-keeps-fixing-foundational-awk-code/">Kernighan</a> &amp; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/10/dennis-ritchie-the-giant-whose-shoulders-we-stand-on/">Ritchie</a>, the authors of the coding bible <em>The C Programming Language,</em> which is a tabs book. If you are submitting kernel code, it had better use tabs (eight-character tabs, ideally, though that is tied in part to <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/16172/when-did-tabs-start-defaulting-to-8-columns">teletype and line-printer history</a>).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017554#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017554&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Cisco’s Talos security team is warning of a large-scale credential compromise campaign that’s indiscriminately assailing networks with login attempts aimed at gaining unauthorized access to VPN, SSH, and web application accounts.</p>
<p>The login attempts use both generic usernames and valid usernames targeted at specific organizations. Cisco included a <a href="https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/IOCs/blob/main/2024/04/large-scale-brute-force-activity-targeting-vpns-ssh-services-with-commonly-used-login-credentials.txt">list</a> of more than 2,000 usernames and almost 100 passwords used in the attacks, along with nearly 4,000 IP addresses sending the login traffic. The IP addresses appear to originate from TOR exit nodes and other anonymizing tunnels and proxies. The attacks appear to be indiscriminate and opportunistic rather than aimed at a particular region or industry.</p>
<p>“Depending on the target environment, successful attacks of this type may lead to unauthorized network access, account lockouts, or denial-of-service conditions,” Talos researchers <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/large-scale-brute-force-activity-targeting-vpns-ssh-services-with-commonly-used-login-credentials/">wrote Tuesday</a>. “The traffic related to these attacks has increased with time and is likely to continue to rise.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017646#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017646&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At least 19 women across nine US states appear to have been poisoned by bogus injections of Botox, t<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/outbreaks/harmful-reactions-botox-injections.html">he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported late Monday.</a></p>
<p>Nine of the 19 cases—47 percent—were hospitalized and four—21 percent—were treated with botulinum anti-toxin. The CDC's alert and outbreak investigation follows <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/sketchy-botox-shots-spark-multistate-outbreak-of-botulism-like-condition/">reports in recent days of botulism-like illnesses linked to shady injections</a> in Tennessee, where officials reported four cases, and Illinois, where there were two. The CDC now reports that the list of affected states also includes: Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, and Washington.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/counterfeit-version-botox-found-multiple-states">In a separate alert Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration</a> said that "unsafe, counterfeit" versions of Botox had been found in several states, and the toxic fakes were administered by unlicensed or untrained people and/or in non-medical or unlicensed settings, such as homes or spas. The counterfeit products appeared to have come from an unlicensed source, generally raising the risks that they're "misbranded, adulterated, counterfeit, contaminated, improperly stored and transported, ineffective and/or unsafe," the FDA said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017617#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017617&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Since the 1960s, scientists have known that the tiny tardigrade can withstand very intense radiation blasts 1,000 times stronger than what most other animals could endure. According to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(24)00316-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982224003166%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, it's not that such ionizing radiation doesn't damage tardigrades' DNA; rather, the tardigrades are able to rapidly repair any such damage. The findings complement those of a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/92621">separate study</a> published in January that also explored tardigrades' response to radiation.</p>
<p>“These animals are mounting an incredible response to radiation, and that seems to be a secret to their extreme survival abilities,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1041321">said co-author Courtney Clark-Hachtel</a>, who was a postdoc in Bob Goldstein's lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which has been conducting research into tardigrades for 25 years. “What we are learning about how tardigrades overcome radiation stress can lead to new ideas about how we might try to protect other animals and microorganisms from damaging radiation.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/tiny-tardigrades-crash-landed-on-the-moon-and-probably-survived/">reported previously</a>, tardigrades are micro-animals that can survive in the harshest conditions: extreme pressure, extreme temperature, radiation, dehydration, starvation—even exposure to the vacuum of outer space. The creatures were first described by German zoologist Johann Goeze in 1773. They were dubbed <em>tardigrada</em> ("slow steppers" or "slow walkers") four years later by Lazzaro Spallanzani, an Italian biologist. That's because tardigrades tend to lumber along like a bear. Since they can survive almost anywhere, they can be found in lots of places: deep-sea trenches, salt and freshwater sediments, tropical rain forests, the Antarctic, mud volcanoes, sand dunes, beaches, and lichen and moss. (Another name for them is "moss piglets.") </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017449#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017449&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Some net neutrality proponents are worried that soon-to-be-approved Federal Communications Commission rules will allow harmful fast lanes because the plan doesn't explicitly ban "positive" discrimination.</p>
<p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's proposed rules for Internet service providers would prohibit blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. The rules mirror the ones imposed by the FCC during the Obama era and repealed during Trump's presidency. But some advocates are criticizing a decision to let Internet service providers speed up certain types of applications as long as application providers don't have to pay for special treatment.</p>
<p>Stanford Law Professor Barbara van Schewick, who has consistently argued for stricter net neutrality rules, <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2024/04/harmful-5g-fast-lanes-are-coming-fcc-needs-stop-them">wrote in a blog post</a> on Thursday that "harmful 5G fast lanes are coming."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017518#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017518&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As far as black holes go, there are two categories: supermassive ones that live at the center of the galaxies (and we're unsure about how they got there) and stellar mass ones that formed through the supernovae that end the lives of massive stars.</p>
<p>Prior to the advent of gravitational wave detectors, the heaviest stellar-mass black hole we knew about was only a bit more than a dozen times the mass of the Sun. And this makes sense, given that the violence of the supernova explosions that form these black holes ensures that only a fraction of the dying star's mass gets transferred into its dark offspring. But then the gravitational wave data started flowing in, and we discovered there were lots of heavier black holes, with masses dozens of times that of the Sun. But we could only find them when they smacked into another black hole.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/esas-gaia-mission-set-to-survey-the-galaxy-with-biggest-camera-in-space/">Gaia mission</a>, we have observational evidence of the largest black hole in the Milky Way outside of the supermassive one, with a mass 33 times that of the Sun. And, in galactic terms, it's right next door at about 2,000 light-years distant, meaning it will be relatively easy to learn more.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017550#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017550&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Right now, the electric vehicle ownership experience is optimized for the owner who lives in a single-family home. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/">level 2 home AC charger</a> costs a few hundred dollars, and with a garage or carport, an EV that gets plugged in each night is an EV that starts each day with a 100 percent charged battery pack. Plenty of Ars readers have told us that a 120 V outlet even works for their needs, although perhaps better for Chevy Bolt-sized batteries rather than a Hummer EV.</p>
<p>However, about a third of Americans live in large multifamily developments, often in cities that stand to benefit the most from a switch to electrification. And electrifying the parking lots of existing developments is often easier said than done. Some developments will allow individuals to install their own dedicated charger, and newly built developments may even have planned ahead and put conduits in place already.</p>
<p>For many others, the parking spaces will be owned by the condo association or co-op, complicating the idea of giving each EV driver their own plug. Here, shared solutions make more sense, perhaps starting with one or two shared level 2 chargers as a pilot—often this won't even require extra work to the electrical panel. Costs are a little higher than for a home level 2 charger—between $7,500–$15,000 per charger, perhaps.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017499#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017499&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Despite promises of new and improved TV and movie viewing experiences, streaming services remain focused on growing revenue and app usage. As a result of that focus, streaming companies are mimicking the industry they sought to replace—cable.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/to-keep-viewers-disney-plans-a-new-streaming-concept-old-style-tv-channels">The Information</a> reported that Disney plans to add "a series" of channels to the Disney+ app. Those channels would still be streamed and require a Disney+ subscription to access. But they would work very much like traditional TV channels, featuring set programming that runs 24/7 with commercials. Disney hasn't commented on the report.</p>
<p>Disney is exploring adding channels to Disney+ with "programming in specific genres, including either Star Wars or Marvel-branded shows," The Information said, citing anonymous "people involved in the planning." It's unknown when the Disney+ channels are expected to launch.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017309#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017309&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>YouTube is putting third-party ad-blocking apps on notice. An ominous post on the official YouTube Community Help forum titled "Enforcement on Third Party Apps" says the company is "strengthening our enforcement on third-party apps that violate YouTube’s Terms of Service, specifically ad-blocking apps." Google would really like it if you all paid for YouTube Premium.</p>
<p>YouTube has been coming down on third-party apps, which often enable YouTube ad blocking. The company shut down one of the most popular third-party apps, "YouTube Vanced," in 2022. Vanced was open source, though, so new alternatives sprung up almost immediately. Vanced takes the official YouTube Android client and installs a duplicate, alternative version with a bunch of patches. It turns on all the YouTube Premium features like ad-blocking, background playback, and downloading without paying for the Premium sub. It also adds features the official app doesn't have, like additional themes and accessibility features, "repeat" and "dislike" buttons, and the ability to turn off addictive "suggestions" that appear all over the app.</p>
<p>Another popular option is "NewPipe," a from-scratch YouTube player that follows the open source ethos and is available on the FOSS-only store F-Droid. NewPipe wants a lightweight client without the proprietary code and million permissions that YouTube needs, but it also blocks ads.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017446#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017446&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Meta continues to slowly adapt Facebook and Instagram policies to account for increasing AI harms, this week confronting how it handles explicit deepfakes spreading on its platforms.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Meta Oversight Board <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/361856206851167-oversight-board-announces-two-new-cases-on-explicit-ai-images-of-female-public-figures/">announced</a> it will be reviewing two cases involving AI-generated sexualized images of female celebrities that Meta initially handled unevenly to "assess whether Meta’s policies and its enforcement practices are effective at addressing explicit AI-generated imagery."</p>
<p>The board is not naming the famous women whose deepfakes are being reviewed in hopes of mitigating "risks of furthering harassment," the board said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017451#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017451&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, the UK government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-cracks-down-on-deepfakes-creation">announced</a> a new law targeting the creation of AI-generated sexually explicit deepfake images. Under the legislation, which has not yet been passed, offenders would face prosecution and an unlimited fine, even if they do not widely share the images but create them with the intent to distress the victim. The government positions the law as part of a broader effort to enhance legal protections for women.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the rise of deep learning image synthesis technology has made it increasingly easy for people with a consumer PC to create misleading pornography by swapping out the faces of the performers with someone else who has not consented to the act. That practice spawned the term "deepfake" around 2017, named after a Reddit user named "deepfakes" that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gydydm/gal-gadot-fake-ai-porn">shared AI-faked porn</a> on the service. Since then, the term has grown to encompass completely new images and video <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/thanks-to-ai-its-probably-time-to-take-your-photos-off-the-internet/">synthesized entirely from scratch,</a> created from neural networks that have been trained on images of the victim.</p>
<p>The problem isn't unique to the UK. In March, deepfake nudes of female middle school classmates in Florida <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/florida-middle-schoolers-charged-with-making-deepfake-nudes-of-classmates/">led to charges</a> against two boys ages 13 and 14. The rise of open source image synthesis models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a> since 2022 has increased the urgency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/sharing-deepfake-could-lead-to-lengthy-prison-time-under-proposed-law/">among regulators in the US</a> to attempt to contain (or at least punish) the act of creating non-consensual deepfakes. The UK government is on a similar mission.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017401#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017401&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russia's once-vaunted launch industry has been much in decline due to a combination of factors, including an aging fleet of rockets, a reduction in government investment, and the country's war in Ukraine driving away Western customers.</p>
<p>However, it is has been difficult for the country's leaders to explain these difficult facts to the Russian people. Russians are justifiably proud of their country's heritage of space firsts and dominant position in spaceflight. So typically, officials bluster.</p>
<p>This is what Roscosmos chief Yuri Borisov did recently during a lecture at the Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics. Located south of Moscow, this is the world's first museum devoted solely to spaceflight. Borisov heads the country's main space corporation, and thus is the leader of the country's space activities.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017380#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017380&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When Microsoft revealed in January that foreign government hackers had <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-hpe-midnight-blizzard-email-breaches/">once again breached its systems</a>, the news prompted another round of recriminations about the security posture of the world’s largest tech company.</p>
<p>Despite the angst among policymakers, security experts, and competitors, Microsoft faced no consequences for its latest embarrassing failure. The United States government kept buying and using Microsoft products, and senior officials refused to publicly rebuke the tech giant. It was another reminder of how insulated Microsoft has become from virtually any government accountability, even as the Biden administration vows to make powerful tech firms take more responsibility for America’s cyber defense.</p>

<p>NASA's $11 billion plan to robotically bring rock samples from Mars back to Earth is too expensive and will take too long, the agency's administrator said Monday, so officials are tasking government and private sector engineers to come up with a better plan.</p>
<p>The agency's decision on how to move forward with the Mars Sample Return (MSR) program follows an independent review last year that found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/06/the-mars-sample-return-mission-is-starting-to-give-nasa-sticker-shock/">ballooning costs and delays</a> threatened the mission's viability. The effort would likely cost NASA between $8 billion and $11 billion, and the launch would be delayed at least two years until 2030, with samples getting back to Earth a few years later, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/msr-irb-report-final-copy-v3.pdf">the review board concluded</a>.</p>
<p>But that's not the whole story. Like all federal agencies, NASA faces new spending restrictions imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, a bipartisan budget deal struck last year between the White House and congressional Republicans. With these new budget headwinds, NASA officials determined the agency's plan for Mars Sample Return would not get specimens from the red planet back to Earth until 2040.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017338#p3">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017338&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I’d wager a guess that we are, as a species, rather fond of our home planet (our wanton carbon emissions notwithstanding). But the ugly truth is that the Earth is doomed. Someday, the Sun will enter a stage that will make life impossible on the Earth’s surface and eventually reduce the planet to nothing more than a sad, lonely chunk of iron and nickel.</p>
<p>The good news is that if we really put our minds to it—and don’t worry, we’ll have hundreds of millions of years to plan—we can keep our home world hospitable, even long after our Sun goes haywire.</p>
<h2>A waking nightmare</h2>
<p>The Sun is slowly but inexorably getting brighter, hotter, and larger with time. Billions of years ago, when collections of molecules first began to dance together and call themselves alive, the Sun was roughly 20 percent dimmer than it is today. Even the dinosaurs knew a weaker, smaller star. And while the Sun is only halfway through the main hydrogen-burning phase of its life, with 4-billion-and-change years before it begins its death throes, the peculiar combination of temperature and brightness that make life possible on this little world of ours will erode in only a few hundred million years. A blink of an eye, astronomically speaking.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017253#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017253&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Award-winning British TV writer Sally Wainwright is best known for the dramatic series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Valley_(TV_series)"><em>Happy Valley</em></a> (2014–2023) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jack_(TV_series)"><em>Gentleman Jack</em></a> (2019–2022), the latter produced jointly by BBC and HBO. Wainwright partnered with Disney+ for her latest series, the resolutely PG-13 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renegade_Nell"><em>Renegade Nell</em></a>, which is a different beast altogether: a good old-fashioned, swashbuckling comic adventure with a supernatural twist, featuring a sassy cross-dressing heroine forced to turn to highway robbery to survive.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>Set in 1705 during the reign of Queen Anne (Jodhi May, <em>Gentleman Jack</em>), the series stars Louisa Harland (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_Girls"><em>Derry Girls</em></a>) as Nell Jackson. Nell is a headstrong young woman with tomboy flair and a taste for adventure who returns home to her village of Tottenham after running off five years before to marry one Captain Jackson against her father's wishes. She's now widowed and possessed of occasional supernatural skills whenever someone threatens her, courtesy of a fairy sprite named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Blind">Billy Blind</a> (Nick Mohammed, aka Nathan from <em>Ted Lasso</em>), who has been tasked to protect Nell. Nell's family thought she'd been killed on the battlefield alongside her husband, so her homecoming is a bit of a shock.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017126#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017126&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A 28-year-old Delaware woman, Hadja Kone, was arrested after cops linked her to an international sextortion scheme targeting thousands of victims—mostly young men and including some minors, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/delaware-woman-arrested-international-sextortion-and-money-laundering-scheme">announced</a> Friday.</p>
<p>Citing a recently unsealed indictment, the DOJ alleged that Kone and co-conspirators "operated an international, financially motivated sextortion and money laundering scheme in which the conspirators engaged in cyberstalking, interstate threats, money laundering, and wire fraud."</p>
<p>Through the scheme, conspirators allegedly sought to extort about $6 million from "thousands of potential victims," the DOJ said, and ultimately successfully extorted approximately $1.7 million.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017299#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017299&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Federal prosecutors indicted a Nebraska man on charges he perpetrated a cryptojacking scheme that defrauded two cloud providers—one based in Seattle and the other in Redmond, Washington—out of $3.5 million.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1348006/dl">indictment</a>, filed in US District Court for the Eastern District of New York and unsealed on Monday, charges Charles O. Parks III—45 of Omaha, Nebraska—with wire fraud, money laundering, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions in connection with the scheme. Parks has yet to enter a plea and is scheduled to make an initial appearance in federal court in Omaha on Tuesday. Parks was arrested last Friday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/nebraska-man-indicted-multi-million-dollar-cryptojacking-scheme">allege</a> that Parks defrauded “two well-known providers of cloud computing services” of more than $3.5 million in computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. The indictment says the activity was in furtherance of a cryptojacking scheme, a term for crimes that generate digital coin through the acquisition of computing resources and electricity of others through fraud, hacking, or other illegal means.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017285#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017285&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google has been doing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/android-15-gets-satellite-messaging-starts-foldable-cover-app-support/">a lot of work</a> in Android to support satellite-based messaging, and it sure would be nice if someone actually shipped some hardware it could use. Despite the feature launching with the iPhone 14 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/apples-satellite-emergency-service-launches-in-the-us-and-canada/">in 2022</a>, Android manufacturers haven't been super receptive to copying the idea of satellite messaging. Qualcomm and satellite company Iridium built a working solution and incorporated it into Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, only for <em>zero</em> Android manufacturers to support the feature, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/qualcomm-kills-its-copy-of-apples-satellite-sos-after-ten-months/">the dissolution</a> of the partnership. If Google wants an Android satellite SMS phone to play with, it seems like it will need to build the device itself.</p>
<p>Reliable leaker Kamila Wojciechowska over at <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-sos-satellite-connectivity-3433498/">Android Authority</a> says Google is working on doing just that. It looks like the Pixel 9 will be getting emergency satellite SOS. Since the Pixel 6, Pixel phones have been the rare devices that don't use Qualcomm modems. Google partners with Samsung and bases its Pixel Tensor chips on Samsung Exynos chips, and that means using Samsung's (usually much maligned) modems, too. Citing a source, Wojciechowska says the Pixel 9 would use the new <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/news-events/tech-blog/exynos-modem-5400-1-worlds-first-11-2gbps-5g-speeds-with-only-fr1/">Exynos Modem 5400,</a> along with its optional NTN (non-terrestrial network) capabilities, allowing the phone to be "the first to support Android’s native satellite implementation." The initial service provider would be T-Mobile (just like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/10/android-g1-review/">the good old days</a>).</p>
<p>The move would make sense. The whole original point of the Nexus/Pixel line was to give Google something to build Android on. By incorporating the latest hardware features into the next Pixel, Android gets a target to program for and test on. Otherwise, we'd have a chicken-and-egg problem where no one makes the hardware because there's no software support, and no one makes software because there's no hardware to program for. Google just does it all at once.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017214#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017214&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
