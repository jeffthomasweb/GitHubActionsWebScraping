<p>Most of the time, when kids accidentally gulp down a non-edible object, it travels toward the stomach. In the best-case scenarios for these unfortunate events, it's a small, benign object that safely sees itself out in a day or two. But in the worst-case scenarios, it can go down an entirely different path.</p>
<p>That was the case for a poor teen in California, who somehow swallowed a quarter. The quarter didn’t head down the esophagus and toward the stomach, but veered into the airway, sliding passed the vocal cords like they were a vending-machine coin slot.</p>

<p>We've come a long way since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/riffusions-ai-generates-music-from-text-using-visual-sonograms/">primitive AI music generators</a> in 2022. Today, AI tools like <a href="https://www.suno.ai/">Suno.ai</a> allow any series of words to become song lyrics, including inside jokes (as you'll see below). On Wednesday, prompt engineer Riley Goodside <a href="https://x.com/goodside/status/1775713487529922702">tweeted</a> an AI-generated song created with the prompt "sad girl with piano performs the text of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a>," and it began to circulate widely in the AI community online.</p>
<p>The MIT License is a famous permissive software license created in the late 1980s, frequently used in open source projects. "My favorite part of this is ~1:25 it nails 'WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY' with a beautiful Imogen Heap-style glissando then immediately pronounces 'FITNESS' as 'fistiff,'" Goodside <a href="https://x.com/goodside/status/1775736282586427632">wrote</a> on X.</p>

<p>Suno (which means "listen" in Hindi) was formed in 2023 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It's the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/20/suno-gen-ai-music-microsoft">brainchild</a> of Michael Shulman, Georg Kucsko, Martin Camacho, and Keenan Freyberg, who formerly worked at companies like Meta and TikTok. Suno has already attracted big-name partners, such as Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24008279/microsoft-copilot-suno-ai-music-generator-extension">announced</a> the integration of an earlier version of the Suno engine into Bing Chat last December. Today, Suno is on v3 of its model, which can create temporally coherent two-minute songs in many different genres.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015379#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015379&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Former Apple design lead Jony Ive and current OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are seeking funding for a new company that will produce an "artificial intelligence-powered personal device," according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jony-ive-and-sam-altmans-ai-device-startup-in-funding-talks-with-emerson-thrive">The Information</a>'s sources, who are said to be familiar with the plans.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the device is unknown, but it will not look anything like a smartphone, according to the sources. We first heard tell of this venture in the fall of 2023, but The Information's story reveals that talks are moving forward to get the company off the ground.</p>
<p>Ive and Altman hope to raise at least $1 billion for the new company. The complete list of potential funding sources they've spoken with is unknown, but The Information's sources say they are in talks with frequent OpenAI investor Thrive Capital as well as Emerson Collective, a venture capital firm founded by Laurene Powell Jobs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015528#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015528&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission chair decided not to impose Universal Service fees on Internet service, rejecting arguments for new assessments to shore up an FCC fund that subsidizes broadband network expansions and provides discounts to low-income consumers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/027-5183">$8 billion-a-year</a> Universal Service Fund (USF) pays for FCC programs such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/poor-americans-will-get-9-a-month-to-buy-broadband-or-mobile-data/">Lifeline</a> discounts and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/internet-providers-that-won-fcc-grants-try-to-escape-broadband-commitments/">Rural Digital Opportunity Fund</a> deployment grants for ISPs. Phone companies must <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/contribution-methodology-administrative-filings">pay a percentage</a> of their revenue into the fund, and telcos generally pass those fees on to consumers with a "Universal Service" line item on telephone bills.</p>
<p>Imposing similar assessments on broadband could increase the Universal Service Fund's size and/or reduce the charges on phone service, spreading the burden more evenly across different types of telecommunications services. Some consumer advocates want the FCC to increase the fund in order to replace the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), a different government program that gives $30 monthly broadband discounts to people with low incomes but is about to run out of money because of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/fcc-to-halt-sign-ups-for-internet-discounts-as-republicans-threaten-funding/">inaction by Congress</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015506#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015506&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hackers are actively exploiting a pair of recently discovered vulnerabilities to remotely commandeer network-attached storage devices manufactured by D-Link, researchers said Monday.</p>
<p>Roughly 92,000 devices are vulnerable to the remote takeover exploits, which can be remotely transmitted by sending malicious commands through simple HTTP traffic. The vulnerability <a href="https://github.com/netsecfish/dlink">came to light</a> two weeks ago. The researcher said they were making the threat public because D-Link said it had no plans to patch the vulnerabilities, which are present only in end-of-life devices, meaning they are no longer supported by the manufacturer.</p>
<h2>An ideal recipe</h2>
<p>On Monday, researchers said their sensors began detecting active attempts to <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@greynoise/112236315274772968">exploit the vulnerabilities</a> starting over the weekend. Greynoise, one of the organizations reporting the in-the-wild exploitation, said in an email that the activity began around 02:17 UTC on Sunday. The attacks attempted to download and install one of several pieces of malware on vulnerable devices depending on their specific hardware profile. One such piece of malware is <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1b1f226a2de6581606a6aa9249c9d89b9c771a14e02022371405396c278da62d">flagged</a> under various names by 40 endpoint protection services.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015480#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015480&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Life-forms with no brain are capable of some astounding things. It might sound like sci-fi nightmare fuel, but some bacteria can wage kamikaze chemical warfare.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/after-decades-of-lurking-an-elusive-bacterium-finally-strikes-in-california/">Pathogenic bacteria</a> make us sick by secreting toxins. While the release of smaller toxin molecules is well understood, methods of releasing larger toxin molecules have mostly eluded us until now. Researcher Stefan Raunser, director of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology, and his team finally found out how the insect pathogen <i>Yersinia entomophaga </i>(which attacks beetles) releases its large-molecule toxin.</p>
<p>They found that designated “soldier cells” sacrifice themselves and explode to deploy the poison inside their victim. “YenTc appears to be the first example of an anti-eukaryotic toxin using this newly established type of secretion system,” the researchers said in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01571-z">study</a> recently published in Nature.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015365#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015365&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA collaboration searches the universe for gravitational waves produced by the mergers of black holes and neutron stars. It has now announced the detection of a signal indicating a merger between two compact objects, one of which has an unusual intermediate mass—heavier than a neutron star and lighter than a black hole. The collaboration provided specifics of their analysis of the merger and the "mystery object" in a draft manuscript <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04248">posted to</a> the physics arXiv, suggesting that the object might be a very low-mass black hole.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/danish-physicists-claim-to-cast-doubt-on-detection-of-gravitational-waves/">LIGO detects</a> gravitational waves via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/ligos-gravitational-wave-detection-takes-home-a-nobel/">laser interferometry</a>, using high-powered lasers to measure tiny changes in the distance between two objects positioned kilometers apart. LIGO has detectors in Hanford, Washington state, and in Livingston, Louisiana. A third detector in Italy, <a href="http://www.ego-gw.it/virgodescription/pag_4.html">Advanced VIRGO</a>, came online in 2016. In Japan, KAGRA is the first gravitational-wave detector in Asia and the first to be built underground. Construction began on LIGO-India in 2021, and physicists expect it will turn on sometime after 2025.</p>
<p>To date, the collaboration has detected dozens of merger events since its first <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-2017-nobel-prize">Nobel Prize-winning discovery</a>. Early detected mergers involved either two black holes or two neutron stars, but in 2021, LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA confirmed the detection of two separate "mixed" mergers between black holes and neutron stars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015392#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015392&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Canadian telecom Bell Canada has been pushing its cloud-based DVR service to its Fibe TV subscribers for years. While it has given customers advantages, like the ability to view their recordings from more devices, such as phones, compared to using local DVR storage, users don't have as much control over the recordings as they thought they had.</p>
<p>On May 1, Fibe TV will automatically delete recordings stored on its Cloud PVR (personal video recorder) offering once the recordings hit 61 days of age, as confirmed by Canadian online newspaper <a href="https://dailyhive.com/canada/bell-fibe-pvr-deleting-recordings">Daily Hive</a>. Currently, customers maintain access to recordings stored via Cloud PVR for 365 days.</p>
<p>Fibe TV <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonDingleyTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1775529679320961449%7Ctwgr%5Ed1040aa2cfa42c74fe680b41c5b97ab93de465a4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhive.com%2Fcanada%2Fbell-fibe-pvr-deleting-recordings">apparently</a> started alerting customers of the upcoming change this month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015412#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015412&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After an announcement that ended up being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/bluetooth-tags-for-androids-3-billion-strong-tracking-network-are-here/">a year early</a>, Android's version of Tile/AirTags is ready to launch. Google has been gearing up on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/after-a-one-year-delay-google-might-finally-launch-its-find-my-network/">the software side</a> of things to enable a Bluetooth tracking network on Android, and the company's two tracking tag hardware partners, Pebblebee and Chipolo, now have ship dates. The two companies each have a press release today, with Pebblebee saying its trackers will ship in "late May," while Chipolo says it will ship "after May 27th." Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device/">a blog post</a> out, too, promising "additional Bluetooth tags from Eufy, Jio, Motorola and more" later this year.</p>
<p>Both sets of devices have been up for preorder for a year now, and it doesn't seem like anything has changed since. Both companies are offering little Bluetooth trackers in a keychain tag or credit card format, and Pebblebee has a third stick-on tag format. They'll all be anonymously tracked by Android's 3 billion-device Bluetooth tracker network, and the device owner will be able to see them in Google's "Find my device" app.</p>
<p>Chipolo's "One Point" key chain tag is the only thing that takes a CR2032 coin cell battery, while the company's credit card tracker is not rechargeable. Pebblebee's key chain, credit card, and stick-on tracker <em>all</em> have rechargeable batteries, including the wallet card, which is very rare! Nothing has UWB for precise location tracking—everything uses a speaker. Both companies sell multiple SKUs of what look like the exact same product but are locked to Google's or Apple's network—no switching allowed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015402#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015402&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With this award—which includes additional funding up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans—TSMC has agreed to increase funding in Arizona fabrication plants to $65 billion. That's the largest foreign direct investment in a new project in US history, the Commerce Department said, and it will fuel construction of TSMC's third Arizona fab.</p>

<p>Tesla and its controversial Autopilot driver assistance system goes on trial again today in California. It's fighting a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer who was killed in 2018 when his Tesla Model X drove head-first into a highway gore. But despite the findings of a highly critical National Transportation Safety Board investigation, Tesla may well win in court—California juries let the automaker off the hook in two separate trials last year.</p>
<h2>Regular complaints</h2>
<p>Huang died on March 23, 2018, when his Model X crashed at 70 mph into a concrete divider on US Highway 101, apparently confused by an interchange with State Highway 85 to its left.</p>
<p>Huang trusted Tesla Autopilot, the carmaker's partially automated driving system that, at the time, combined forward-looking radar and optical sensors to control the car's speed on the road relative to other vehicles and keep it centered within the lane. (In the years since, Tesla has abandoned the use of forward-looking radar, relying on just optical cameras instead.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015397#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015397&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Elon Musk has been talking publicly about his sweeping vision for Mars settlement for nearly eight years now, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/musks-mars-moment-audacity-madness-brilliance-or-maybe-all-three/">dating to a speech</a> in Guadalajara, Mexico, in September 2016.</p>
<p>This weekend, at SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas, Musk once again took up the mantle of his "making life multiplanetary" cause. Addressing employees at the location of the company's Starship factory, <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1776669097490776563">Musk spoke about</a> the "high urgency" needed to extend the "light of consciousness" beyond Earth. That is not because humanity's home planet is a lost cause or should not be preserved. Rather, Musk said, he does not want humanity to remain a one-planet civilization that will, inevitably, face some calamity that will end the species.</p>
<p>All of this is fairly familiar territory for spaceflight enthusiasts—and observers of Musk. But during the last eight years he has become an increasingly controversial and polarizing figure. Based on his behavior, many people will dismiss Musk's Mars comments as those of a megalomaniac. At least in regard to spaceflight, however, that would be wrong. Musk's multiplanetary ambitions today are more credible because SpaceX has taken steps toward doing what he said the company would do.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015351#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015351&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>What if human <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/08/vlad-the-impaler-may-have-shed-tears-of-blood-study-finds/">blood</a> turned into a sort of rubbery slime that can bounce back into a wound and stop it from bleeding in record time?</p>
<p>Until now, it was a mystery how hemolymph, or insect blood, was able to clot so quickly outside the body. Researchers from Clemson University have finally figured out how this works through observing caterpillars and cockroaches. By changing its physical properties, the blood of these animals can seal wounds in about a minute because the watery hemolymph that initially bleeds out turns into a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/the-physics-of-salt-water-taffy/">viscoelastic</a> substance outside of the body and retracts back to the wound.</p>
<p>“In insects vulnerable to dehydration, the mechanistic reaction of blood after wounding is rapid,” the research team said in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsfm.2024.1341129/full">study</a> recently published in Frontiers in Soft Matter. “It allows insects to minimize blood loss by sealing the wound and forming primary clots that provide scaffolding for the formation of new tissue.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015354#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015354&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brazil’s attorney general has demanded “urgent regulation” of social media sites after Elon Musk threatened to disobey a court order banning certain profiles on his X platform and after he called for a Supreme Court justice to “resign or be impeached.”</p>
<p>“It is urgent to regulate social networks,” said Jorge Messias.</p>
<p>“We cannot live in a society in which billionaires domiciled abroad have control of social networks and put themselves in a position to violate the rule of law, failing to comply with court orders and threatening our authorities.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015360#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015360&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Lamborghini provided flights from Las Vegas to Montreal and accommodation so Ars could attend the ice driving school. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>From the passenger seat of my Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato, 24 Hours of Daytona winner Corey Lewis gives me a "slow down" hand gesture, urging me to avoid an Urus high-centered on a snow bank. I resist the childish impulse to blast by at full throttle and spray the recovery crew with a fresh layer of snow because I don't want to be the next driver to cause a scene. Once we pass the group, I punch it again, countersteering into a wide drift as my studded Blizzak winter tires shred through snow and ice, exhaust wide open and barking at redline, cranking through a series of left-right-left transitions until we come back around to the stuck SUV.</p>
<p>Lewis and I both laugh—everybody spins at least once while ice-drifting Lamborghinis on Lake Catchima north of Montreal, which played host in February to North America's Esperienza Neve winter driving academy. This year, Lamborghini invited customers out to tear up the pristine Canadian winterscape in three Sterratos, four Uruses, and two rear-wheel-drive Huracán Tecnicas—all told, about $3 million worth of cars.</p>
<p>Drifting in six-figure Lambos might make anyone a little nervous. In the controlled environment of a 30-inch (762 mm)-thick ice sheet, though, the consequences are minimal (there are bruised egos whenever anybody loses control and needs a tow, of course). So much power on the slip-and-slide immediately exposes driver skill—or lack thereof—despite 400 studs per tire on the Huracáns and 300 per tire on the Uruses providing grip and confidence. Even for a driver as experienced as Lewis, ice-drifting still has its value. For the mere mortals among us, all the more so.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013397#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013397&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Caroline Chaboo’s eyes light up when she talks about tortoise beetles. Like gems, they exist in myriad bright colors: shiny blue, red, orange, leaf green and transparent flecked with gold. They’re members of a group of 40,000 species of leaf beetles, the Chrysomelidae, one of the most species-rich branches of the vast beetle order, Coleoptera. “You have your weevils, longhorns, and leaf beetles,” she says. “That’s really the trio that dominates beetle diversity.”</p>
<p>An entomologist at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, <a href="https://www.leafbeetles.org/caroline-chaboo/">Chaboo</a> has long wondered why the kingdom of life is so skewed toward beetles: The tough-bodied creatures make up about a quarter of all animal species. Many biologists have wondered the same thing, for a long time. “Darwin was a beetle collector,” Chaboo notes.</p>

<p>Of the roughly 1 million named insect species on Earth, about 400,000 are beetles. And that’s just the beetles described so far. Scientists typically describe thousands of new species each year. So—why so many beetle species? “We don’t know the precise answer,” says Chaboo. But clues are emerging.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015249#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015249&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The United States government is currently poised to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/bill-that-could-ban-tiktok-passes-in-house-despite-constitutional-concerns/">outlaw TikTok</a>. Little of the evidence that convinced Congress the app may be a national security threat has been shared publicly, in some cases because it remains <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/21/1239691465/tiktok-ban-bill-senate">classified</a>. But one former TikTok employee turned whistleblower, who claims to have driven key news reporting and congressional concerns about the app, has now come forward.</p>
<p>Zen Goziker worked at TikTok as a risk manager, a role that involved protecting the company from external security and reputational threats. In a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against TikTok's parent company ByteDance in January, he alleges he was fired in February 2022 for refusing “to sign off” on Project Texas, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/congress-calls-tiktok-ceos-security-and-privacy-assurances-worthless/">$1.5 billion program</a> that TikTok designed to assuage US government security concerns by storing American data on servers managed by Oracle.</p>

<p>Engineers have determined why NASA's Voyager 1 probe has been transmitting gibberish for nearly five months, raising hopes of recovering humanity's most distant spacecraft.</p>
<p>Voyager 1, traveling outbound some 15 billion miles (24 billion km) from Earth, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/humanitys-most-distant-space-probe-jeopardized-by-computer-glitch/">started beaming unreadable data</a> down to ground controllers on November 14. For nearly four months, NASA knew Voyager 1 was still alive—it continued to broadcast a steady signal—but could not decipher anything it was saying.</p>
<p>Confirming their hypothesis, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California confirmed a small portion of corrupted memory caused the problem. The faulty memory bank is located in Voyager 1's Flight Data System (FDS), one of three computers on the spacecraft. The FDS operates alongside a command-and-control central computer and another device overseeing attitude control and pointing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015200#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015200&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amylyx, the maker of a new drug to treat ALS, is pulling that drug from the market and laying off 70 percent of its workers after a large clinical trial found that the drug did not help patients, <a href="https://www.amylyx.com/news/amylyx-pharmaceuticals-announces-formal-intention-to-remove-relyvrior/albriozatm-from-the-market-provides-updates-on-access-to-therapy-pipeline-corporate-restructuring-and-strategy">according to an announcement from the company Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>The drug, Relyvrio, won approval from the Food and Drug Administration in September 2022 to slow the progression of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease). However, the data behind the controversial decision was shaky at best; it was based on a study of just 137 patients that had <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-als-drug">several weaknesses and questionable statistical significance</a>, and FDA advisers initially voted against approval. Still, given the severity of the neurodegenerative disease and lack of effective treatments, the FDA ultimately granted approval under the condition that the company was working on a Phase III clinical trial to solidify its claimed benefits.</p>
<p>Relyvrio—a combination of two existing generic drugs—went on the market with a list price of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/health/relyvrio-price-als-amylyx.html">$158,000</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015321#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015321&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has long forbidden apps that run code from an external source, but today's announced changes now allow "software that is not embedded in the binary" in certain cases, with "retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games" specifically listed as one of those cases.</p>
