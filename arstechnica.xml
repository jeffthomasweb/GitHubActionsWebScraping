<p>Firms that serve as intermediaries to negotiate and control prescription drug access in the US "wield enormous power," largely with "extraordinarily opaque" business practices, and may be "inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies" for profit, according to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/pharmacy-benefit-managers-staff-report.pdf">a searing interim report released Tuesday by the Federal Trade Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Amid a national focus on America's uniquely astronomical drug costs, the FTC is taking aim at firms that largely work deep in the bowels of the country's labyrinthine health care system, well hidden from public understanding and scrutiny: pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).</p>
<p>PBMs were initially hired by various payors—employers, health insurance companies, government health plans, and others—to manage prescription drug benefits through various plans. But PBMs have evolved over the years to also negotiate rebates from drugmakers, set reimbursements for dispensing pharmacies, and develop drug formularies (the list of drugs that a health plan covers.) While those functions alone grant PBMs a large amount of power, consolidation and integration over recent years has concentrated that power in troubling ways, according to the FTC report.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036032#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036032&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Recent betas have included evidence that Apple is working on a touchscreen-enabled version of the interface. (credit: Andrew Cunningham)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple’s tvOS betas are usually among its least exciting; the Apple TV’s operating system has changed so little in the last decade that the most exciting thing to happen to it in recent memory is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/tvos-17s-extra-column-of-icons-is-its-most-useful-new-feature-in-years/">an extra column of icons</a>.</p>
<p>But this week’s tvOS 18 beta 3 release includes a hidden feature that might be exciting for smart speaker enthusiasts, if not for people who still want their Apple TV boxes to develop exciting new capabilities. 9to5Mac has discovered <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/09/touchscreen-interface-tvos-homepod/">a touchscreen interface</a> (codenamed "PlasterBoard") inside of the latest beta, a sign that Apple is testing alternate input mechanisms for software that is currently manipulated via remote control and voice.</p>

<p>Last week, MacRumors also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/">discovered</a> a reference to a device called “HomeAccessory17,1” in Apple’s beta software, a naming convention similar to the “AudioAccessory” device identifiers that Apple uses for HomePod speakers. Together, these developments suggest that Apple is working on a version of the HomePod with an integrated touchscreen, a device that rumors have suggested could launch in 2024 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd">or 2025</a>. The company has reportedly been working on a smart home device with a screen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats">since at least 2021</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035899#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035899&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'll readily grant you that Houston might not be the most idyllic spot in the world. The summer heat is borderline unbearable. The humidity is super sticky. We don't have mountains or pristine beaches—we have concrete.</p>
<p>But we also have a pretty amazing melting pot of culture, wonderful cuisine, lots of jobs, and upward mobility. Most of the year, I love living here. Houston is totally the opposite of, "It's a nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there." Houston is not a particularly nice place to visit, but you might just want to live here.</p>
<p>Except for the hurricanes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035885#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035885&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of the more striking things about quantum computing is that the field, despite not having proven itself especially useful, has already spawned a collection of startups that are focused on building something other than qubits. It might be easy to dismiss this as opportunism—trying to cash in on the hype surrounding quantum computing. But it can be useful to look at the things these startups are targeting, because they can be an indication of hard problems in quantum computing that haven't yet been solved by any one of the big companies involved in that space—companies like Amazon, Google, IBM, or Intel.</p>
<p>In the case of a UK-based company called Riverlane, the unsolved piece that is being addressed is the huge amount of classical computations that are going to be necessary to make the quantum hardware work. Specifically, it's targeting the huge amount of data processing that will be needed for a key part of quantum error correction: recognizing when an error has occurred.</p>
<h2>Error detection vs. the data</h2>
<p>All qubits are fragile, tending to lose their state during operations, or simply over time. No matter what the technology—cold atoms, superconducting transmons, whatever—these error rates put a hard limit on the amount of computation that can be done before an error is inevitable. That rules out doing almost every useful computation operating directly on existing hardware qubits.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035942#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035942&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the most widely used network protocols is vulnerable to a newly discovered attack that can allow adversaries to gain control over a range of environments, including industrial controllers, telecommunications services, ISPs, and all manner of enterprise networks.</p>
<p>Short for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS">RADIUS</a> harkens back to the days of dial-in Internet and network access through public switched telephone networks. It has remained the de facto standard for lightweight authentication ever since and is supported in virtually all switches, routers, access points, and VPN concentrators shipped in the past two decades. Despite its early origins, RADIUS remains an essential staple for managing client-server interactions for:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">VPN access</li>
<li aria-level="1">DSL and Fiber to the Home connections offered by ISPs,</li>
<li aria-level="1">Wi-Fi and 802.1X authentication</li>
<li aria-level="1">2G and 3G cellular roaming</li>
<li aria-level="1">5G Data Network Name authentication</li>
<li aria-level="1">Mobile data offloading</li>
<li aria-level="1">Authentication over private APNs for connecting mobile devices to enterprise networks</li>
<li aria-level="1">Authentication to critical infrastructure management devices</li>
<li aria-level="1">Eduroam and OpenRoaming Wi-Fi</li>
</ul>
<p>RADIUS provides seamless interaction between clients—typically routers, switches, or other appliances providing network access—and a central RADIUS server, which acts as the gatekeeper for user authentication and access policies. The purpose of RADIUS is to provide centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting management for remote logins.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035809#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035809&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Back in 2010—after the first iPhone, but before its camera was any good—a mirrorless, lens-swapping camera that could upload photos immediately to social media or photo storage sites was a novel proposition. That's what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_NX_series">Samsung's NX cameras</a> promised.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Samsung didn't keep that promise too much longer after it dropped its camera business and sales numbers disappeared. It tried out the quirky idea of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/samsung-galaxy-nx-android-camera-gets-official-prices-and-specs/">jamming together Android phones and NX cameras</a> in 2013, providing a more direct means of sending shots and clips to Instagram or YouTube. But it shut down its Social Network Services (SNS) entirely in 2021, leaving NX owners with the choices of manually transferring their photos or ditching their cameras (presuming they had not already moved on).</p>
<p>Some people, wonderfully, refuse to give up. People like Georg Lukas, who reverse-engineered Samsung's SNS API to <a href="https://op-co.de/blog/posts/samsung_nx_mastodon/#index1h3">bring back a version of direct picture posting to Wi-Fi-enabled NX models</a>, and even expand it. It was not easy, but at least the hardware is cheap. By reflashing the surprisingly capable board on a USB 4G dongle, Lukas is able to create a Wi-Fi hotspot with LTE uplink and run his modified version of Samsung's (<a href="https://op-co.de/blog/posts/samsung_nx_cryptofail/">woefully insecure</a>) service natively on the stick.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035842#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035842&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission said it is preparing to block a phone company that carried illegal robocalls pushing fake programs that promised to wipe out consumers' tax debt. Veriwave Telco "has not complied with FCC call blocking rules for providers suspected of carrying illegal traffic" and now has two weeks to contest an <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-645A1.pdf">order</a> that would require all downstream voice providers to block all of the telco's call traffic, the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-prepares-block-provider-facilitating-illegal-tax-robocalls">FCC announced yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Robocalls sent in the months before tax filing season "purported to provide information about a 'National Tax Relief Program' and, in some instances, also discussed a 'Tax Dismissal Program,'" the FCC order said. "The [Enforcement] Bureau has found no evidence of the existence of either program. Many of the messages further appealed to recipients with the offer to 'rapidly clear' their tax debt."</p>

<p>Two Russian citizens <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/feds-arrest-russians-accused-of-running-the-largest-pirated-ebook-library/">arrested for running the pirate e-book site Z-Library</a> have <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-admins-escape-house-arrest-after-judge-approves-u-s-extradition-240708/">reportedly</a> escaped house arrest in Argentina and vanished after a court approved their extradition to the United States.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/two-russian-nationals-charged-running-massive-e-book-piracy-website">Accused by the US</a> of criminal copyright infringement, wire fraud, and money laundering, Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova were arrested in 2022. Until last May, they were being detained in Argentina while a court mulled the Department of Justice's extradition request, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/us-seizes-z-library-login-domain-but-secret-urls-for-each-user-remain-active/">US quickly moved to seize Z-Library domains</a>.</p>
<p>But according to a translated article from a local publication called <a href="https://www.lavoz.com.ar/sucesos/los-rusos-buscados-por-el-fbi-se-escaparon-de-la-prision-domiciliaria-en-cordoba/">La Voz</a>, the pair suddenly disappeared after submitting a request "to be considered political refugees" in order to "avoid being sent to the US." Napolsky and Ermakova had long denied wrongdoing, and apparently they "ran away" after giving up on the legal process. They reportedly even stopped talking to their defense lawyer.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035869#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035869&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ridley Scott's epic 2000 historical drama <em>Gladiator</em> was a blockbuster hit that has become a classic over the ensuing two decades, thanks to powerful performances and spectacular special effects—especially in the gladiator arena. The director has long wanted to make a sequel, and we're finally getting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_II"><em>Gladiator II</em></a> later this year. Paramount Pictures just dropped the first trailer, and it promises to be just as much of a visual feast, as a new crop of power players (plus a couple of familiar faces) clash over the future of Rome.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for 2000's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_(2000_film)"><em>Gladiator</em></a> below.)</strong></p>
<p>For those who inexplicably haven't seen the original: Russell Crowe starred as Maximus, a Roman general who leads his army to victory against Germanic tribes on behalf of his emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). The aging emperor wishes Maximus to succeed him and restore the Roman Republic, passing over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Commodus secretly murders his father instead and proclaims himself emperor, executing Maximus' wife and son because Maximus would not acknowledge his rule. Commodus also harbors squicky incestuous longings for his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), mother to Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) and former lover of Maximus.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035805#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035805&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For patients with Type 2 diabetes, taking one of the new GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic, is associated with lower risks of developing 10 out of 13 obesity-associated cancers as compared with taking insulin, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820833">a recent study published in JAMA Network Open</a>.</p>
<p>The study was retrospective, capturing data from over 1.6 million patients with Type 2 diabetes but no history of obesity-associated cancers prior to the study period. Using electronic health records, researchers had follow-up data for up to 15 years after the patients started taking either a GLP-1 drug, insulin, or metformin between 2008 and 2015.</p>
<p>This type of study can't prove that the GLP-1 drugs caused the lower associated risks, but the results fit with some earlier findings. That includes results from one trial that found a 32 percent overall lower risk of obesity-associated cancers following bariatric surgery for weight loss.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035856#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035856&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 1994, Hewlett-Packard released a miracle machine: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX">HP 200LX</a> pocket-size PC. In the depths of the device, among the MS-DOS productivity apps built into its fixed memory, there lurked a first-person maze game called <em>Lair of Squid</em>. Intrigued by the game, we tracked down its author, Andy Gryc, and probed into the title's mysterious undersea origins.</p>

<p>"If you ask my family, they’ll confirm that I’ve been obsessed with squid for a long time," Gryc told Ars Technica. "It’s admittedly very goofy—and that’s my fault—although I was inspired by <i data-stringify-type="italic">Doom</i>, which had come out relatively recently."</p>
<p>In <i data-stringify-type="italic">Lair of Squid</i>, you're trapped in an underwater labyrinth, seeking a way out while avoiding squid roaming the corridors. A collision with any cephalopod results in death. To progress through each stage and ascend to the surface, you locate the exit and provide a hidden, scrambled code word. The password is initially displayed as asterisks, with letters revealed as you encounter them within the maze.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022814#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022814&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PuzpblWpVM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>Fallout: London</em> as it looked back in December, when its planned April 23 release was announced. </p></div>
<p>After years of work, the third-party modders at Team Folon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1dwntc1/release_progress_update/">announced over the weekend</a> that their long-awaited (and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-fallout-london-mod-has-been-delayed-by-fallout-4s-planned-next-gen-update/">recently delayed</a>) "DLC-sized" unofficial fan mod, <a href="https://fallout4london.com/?page_id=14"><em>Fallout: London</em></a>, is now in "QA testing" and awaiting the "final green light" from release partner GOG. But that release will apparently need to make use of a "downgrader" to work around a recent Bethesda "next-gen" update that upended all of the team's modding efforts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-london-mod-finally-gets-release-date-april/">In December</a>, Team Folon announced that its work on the <em>Fallout: London</em> mod would culminate in a planned April 23 release, lining up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George%27s_Day_in_England">England's widely celebrated St. George's Day</a>. Then, just weeks before the planned launch, Bethesda <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1778444117770444973">announced</a> that its own planned "next-gen" update for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/fallout-4-review-check-your-next-gen-expectations-at-the-vault-door/">the 2015 game</a> would be coming out on April 25, two days after <em>Fallout: London</em>'s launch target.</p>
<p>"That has, for lack of a better term, screwed us over," Team Folon Project Manager Dean Carter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L71cZvASvAE">said in an interview with the BBC</a> shortly after Bethesda's upgrade announcement. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpqMftkTteo">a separate video</a>, Carter said that the next-gen update "requires many of our internal systems to be updated," since the content they created in the <a href="https://f4se.silverlock.org/"><em>Fallout 4</em> Script Extender</a> likely wouldn't work under the updated code. That turned out to be a valid concern, as the next-gen update <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-is-nearly-16-gigs-breaks-modded-saves-and-doesnt-seem-to-change-much-at-all/">did end up breaking many <em>Fallout 4</em> mods and saves</a> after its release.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035720#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035720&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Since antiquity, humans have envisioned various means of time travel into the future or the past. The concept has since become a staple of modern science fiction. In particular, the number of films that make use of time travel has increased significantly over the decades, while the real-world science has evolved right alongside them, moving from simple Newtonian mechanics and general relativity to quantum mechanics and the notion of a multiverse or more exotic alternatives like string theory.</p>
<p>But not all time-travel movies are created equal. Some make for fantastic entertainment, but the time travel makes no scientific or logical sense, while others might err in the opposite direction, sacrificing good storytelling in the interests of technical accuracy. That's why last fall, we gave you the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2023/11/the-ars-guide-to-time-travel-in-the-movies/">Ars Guide to Time Travel in the Movies</a>, co-written by yours truly and my spouse, physicist Sean Carroll of Johns Hopkins University. The aim was to help us all make better, more informed decisions when it comes to choosing our time travel movie fare—and have a bit of fun while doing so.</p>
<p>The guide was never meant to be an exhaustive/comprehensive list; rather, we selected films that represented many diverse approaches to time travel across multiple subgenres and decades. We then evaluated each one—grading on a curve—with regard to its overall entertainment value and scientific logic, with the final combined score determining a film's spot on the overall ranking. Does the time travel make logical sense? Second, is the physical mechanism of time travel somewhat realistic? And third, does the film use time travel in narratively interesting ways? So a movie like <i>Looper</i>, which makes absolutely no sense if you think about it too hard, gets points for weaving time paradoxes thoroughly into the fabric of the story.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034631#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034631&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Set for liftoff from French Guiana, the new rocket will be Europe's flagship launcher for the next decade, providing rides to space for European science probes, navigation satellites, and military payloads. Ariane 6 also has a toehold in the commercial market, with a contract for 18 launches to deliver satellites to orbit for Amazon's Project Kuiper broadband network.</p>
<p>The first Ariane 6 rocket has a four-hour launch window opening at 2 pm EDT (18:00 UTC) Tuesday to depart the European-run Guiana Space Center in South America.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035544#p3">Read 55 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035544&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Northwest Oregon had never seen anything like it. Over the course of three days in June 2021, Multnomah County—the state’s most populous county, which rests in the swayback along Oregon’s northern border—recorded highs of 108°, 112°, and 116° Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Temperatures were so hot that <a href="https://x.com/PDXStreetcar/status/1409287314870837253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the metal on cable cars melted</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the asphalt on roadways buckled</a>. Nearly half the homes in the county lacked cooling systems because of Oregon’s typically gentle summers, where average highs top out at 81°. Sixty-nine people perished from heat stroke, most of them in their homes.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36289-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientific studies showed</a> that the extreme temperatures were caused by heat domes, which experts say are influenced by climate change, county officials didn’t just chalk it up to a random weather occurrence. They started researching the large fossil fuel companies whose emissions are driving the climate crisis—including ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron—and <a href="https://multco-web7-psh-files-usw2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/First%20Amended%20Complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued them</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035696#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035696&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Despite the fact that Americans buy more electric bicycles than electric cars, widespread adoption of electric motorcycles still lags well behind both. Part of the sluggish sales pace likely comes down to high prices, but as tech continues to evolve, e-moto sticker shock will eventually subside.</p>
<p>Lower prices will only enhance the obvious benefits of electrifying motorbikes: silent operation, quick and easy charging, fewer moving parts to service, and a smaller footprint while commuting. In the meantime, one of the most interesting concepts on the market today comes courtesy of a company called Verge, in Finland, with an utterly baffling hubless rear-wheel motor design.</p>
<p>As usual with bleeding-edge tech, Verge's first model, the TS, commands a serious premium: a base TS starts at $26,900, and the mid-level TS Pro adds $3,000 to that, while the TS Ultra ramps all the way up to $49,900. I recently test-rode an early TS Pro that Verge shipped to the United States, hoping to prove whether this hubless rear motor truly deserves a future in the industry or simply represents another over-priced gimmick.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035501#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035501&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been a whirlwind journey of stops and starts, but <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/05/apple-green-lights-epic-games-store-in-rapid-reversal">AppleInsider reports</a> the Epic Game Store for iOS in the European Union has passed Apple's notarization process.</p>
<p>This paves the way for Epic CEO Tim Sweeney to realize his long-stated goal of launching an alternative game store on Apple's closed platform—at least in Europe.</p>
<p>Apple announced plans to allow third-party app stores on iOS in the region earlier this year, complying with the letter of the law (though some say not the spirit) as required by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which was enacted in hopes of making platforms more open and competitive.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035658#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035658&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The true identity of nosy next-door neighbor Agatha—played to perfection by Kathryn Hahn—was the big reveal of 2021's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/review-wandavision-sticks-the-landing-with-a-very-marvel-esque-finale/"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, even inspiring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8u8md-NiHM">a meta-jingle</a> that went viral. Now Hahn is bringing the character back for her own standalone adventure with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_All_Along_(miniseries)"><em>Agatha All Along.</em></a> Based on the first trailer, it looks like a lot of dark, spooky fun, just in time for the Halloween season. The nine-episode series is one of the TV series in the MCU's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe:_Phase_Five">Phase Five</a>, coming on the heels of <em>Secret Invasion, Loki </em>S2, <em>What If...?</em> S2, and <em>Echo</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision"><em>WandaVision</em></a> below.)</strong></p>
<p><em>WandaVision</em> was set immediately after the events of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> (but before <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>), with newlyweds Wanda and Vision starting their married life in the town of Westview, New Jersey. Wacky hijinks ensued as the couple tried to lead a normal life while hiding their superpowers from their neighbors—especially Hahn's nosy Agnes. Each episode was shot in the style of a particular era of sitcom television, from the 1950s through the 2000s. The couple noticed more and more jarring elements—a full-color drone, a voice calling out to Wanda over the radio, neighbors briefly breaking character—hinting that this seemingly idyllic suburban existence might not be what it seemed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035566#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035566&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After "cyber incidents" on June 19 and 20 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/cyberattacks-have-forced-thousands-of-car-dealerships-to-paper-for-a-second-day/">took down CDK Global</a>, a software-as-a-service vendor for more than 15,000 car dealerships, forum and Reddit comments by service tech workers and dealers advised their compatriots to prepare for weeks, not days, before service was restored.</p>
<p>That sentiment proved accurate, as CDK Global <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/07/01/cdk-cyberattack-outage-back-up-update/74270415007/">last expected</a> to have "all dealers' connections" working by either July 3 or 4, roughly two weeks' time. Posts across various dealer-related subreddits today suggest CDK's main services are mostly restored, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/partscounter/comments/1dyb295/is_cdk_back_yet/">if not entirely</a>. Restoration of services is a mixed blessing for some workers, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/partscounter/comments/1dw934a/return_of_cdk_day_5/">huge backlogs of paperwork</a> now need entering into digital systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/cdk-hackers-want-millions-in-ransom-to-end-car-dealership-outage">Bloomberg reported</a> on June 21 that a ransomware gang, BlackSuit, had demanded "tens of millions of dollars" from CDK and that the company was planning to pay that amount, according to a source familiar with the matter. CDK later told its clients on June 25 that the attack was a "cyber ransom event," and that restoring services would take "several days and not weeks." Allan Liska, with analyst Recorded Future, told Bloomberg that BlackSuit was responsible for at least 95 other recorded ransomware breaches around the world.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035541#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035541&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In 2019, Nike got closer than ever to its dreams of popularizing self-tying sneakers by releasing the Adapt BB. Using Bluetooth, the sneakers paired to the Adapt app that let users do things like tighten or loosen the shoes' laces and control its LED lights. However, Nike has <a href="https://www.nike.com/help/a/adapt-app">announced</a> that it's "retiring" the app on August 6, when it will no longer be downloadable from Apple's App Store or the Google Play Store; nor will it be updated.</p>
<p>In an announcement recently spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24192184/nike-adapt-bb-shoes-sneakers-apple-android-app">The Verge</a>, Nike's brief explanation for discontinuing the app is that Nike "is no longer creating new versions of Adapt shoes.” The company started informing owners about the app's retirement about four months ago.</p>
<p>Those who already bought the shoes can still use the app after August 6, but it's expected that iOS or Android updates will eventually make the app unusable. Also, those who get a new device won't be able to download Adapt after August 6.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035526#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035526&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
