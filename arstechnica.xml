                            <![CDATA[<p>I did not expect to feature NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers in the Tuesday Telescope so soon, but a recent photo she shared is just sublime. (In case you missed it, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/tuesday-telescope-its-not-space-weather-but-weather-from-space/">we wrote about</a> her photo of lightning from space about a month ago.)</p>
<p>This week Ayers has a time-lapse sequence she captured from the Cupola as the International Space Station soared near Central and South America.</p>
<p>"Soooooo much going on in this picture," Ayers wrote on the <a href="https://x.com/Astro_Ayers/status/1925580825199874196/photo/1">social media site X</a>.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device, <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>. Google says it's investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities.</p>
<p>The covert tracking—implemented in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-pixel/">Meta Pixel</a> and <a href="https://ads.yandex/metrica">Yandex Metrica</a> trackers—allows Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it. <a href="https://source.Android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox">Android sandboxing</a>, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources. Defenses such <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state</a></span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/State_Partitioning"> partitioning</a> and <a href="https://privacysandbox.google.com/cookies/storage-partitioning">storage partitioning</a>, which are built into all major browsers, store site cookies and other data associated with a website in containers that are unique to every top-level website domain to ensure they're off-limits for every other site.</p>
<h2>A blatant violation</h2>
<p>“One of the fundamental security principles that exists in the web, as well as the mobile system, is called sandboxing,” Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, one of the researchers behind the discovery, said in an interview. “You run everything in a sandbox, and there is no interaction within different elements running on it. What this attack vector allows is to break the sandbox that exists between the mobile context and the web context. The channel that exists allowed the Android system to communicate what happens in the browser with the identity running in the mobile app.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/headline-to-come/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Exercise is generally good for you, but a new high-quality clinical trial finds that it's so good, it can even knock back colon cancer—and, in fact, rival some chemotherapy treatments.</p>
<p>The finding comes from a phase 3, randomized clinical trial led by researchers in Canada, who studied nearly 900 people who had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for colon cancer. After those treatments, patients were evenly split into groups that either bulked up their regular exercise routines in a three-year program that included coaching and supervision or were simply given health education. The researchers found that the exercise group had a 28 percent lower risk of their colon cancer recurring, new cancers developing, or dying over eight years compared with the health education group.</p>
<p>The benefits of exercise, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760">published in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, became visible after just one year and increased over time, the researchers found. The rate of people who survived for five years and remained cancer-free was 80.3 percent among the exercise group. That's a 6.4 percentage-point survival boost over the education group, which had a 73.9 percent cancer-free survival rate. The overall survival rate (with or without cancer) during the study's eight-year follow-up was 90.3 percent in the exercise group compared with 83.2 percent in the education group—a 7.1 percentage point difference. Exercise reduced the relative risk of death by 37 percent (41 people died in the exercise group compared with 66 in the education group).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/exercise-improves-colon-cancer-survival-high-quality-trial-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Broadcom has cut the lowest tier in its VMware partner program. The move allows the enterprise technology firm to continue its focus on customers with larger VMware deployments, but it also risks more migrations from VMware users and partners.</p>
<h2>Broadcom ousts low-tier VMware partners</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.broadcom.com/partners/fueling-customer-success-through-deep-partner-collaboration">blog post</a> on Sunday, Broadcom executive Brian Moats announced that the Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Resellers, which became the VMware partner program after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/">Broadcom eliminated the original one</a> in January 2024, would now offer three tiers instead of four. Broadcom is killing the Registered tier, leaving the Pinnacle, Premier, and Select tiers.</p>
<p>The reduction is a result of Broadcom's "strategic direction" and a "comprehensive partner review" and affects VMware's Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan geographies, Moats wrote. Affected partners are receiving 60 days' notice, Laura Falko, Broadcom’s head of global partner programs, marketing, and experience, told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/01/vmware_channel_changes/">The Register</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/broadcom-ends-business-with-vmwares-lowest-tier-channel-partners/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We've been covering the small, reversible USB Type-C connector since the days when it was just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/reversible-tiny-faster-hands-on-with-the-usb-type-c-plug/">a USB Implementers Forum tech demo</a>, and in the decade-plus since then, the port has gradually taken over the world. It quietly migrated from laptops to game consoles, to PC accessories, to Android phones, to e-readers, and to iPhones. Despite some hiccups and shortcomings, we're considerably closer to a single connector that does <em>everything</em> than we were a decade ago.</p>
<p>But some confusion persists. A weakness built into the USB-C from the very beginning was that the specification for the physical connector was always separate from the specifications for the USB Power Delivery specification for charging, the USB-C Alt Mode specification for carrying non-USB signals like DisplayPort or HDMI, and for the USB protocol itself (that is, the data transfer speed a given port is capable of).</p>
<p>All of these specifications were frequently grouped together so that individual USB-C ports could handle charging, display output, and data transfers (or some combination of all three at once), but they weren't <em>required</em> to go together, so occasionally users will still run into physical USB-C ports that fall short of the port's do-everything promise.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-belatedly-attempts-to-tame-usb-c-confusion-with-its-rules-for-pc-oems/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It has become a common refrain during Google's antitrust saga: What happened to "don't be evil?" Google's unofficial motto has haunted it as it has grown ever larger, but a shareholder lawsuit sought to rein in some of the company's excesses. And it might be working. The plaintiffs in the case have reached a settlement with Google parent company Alphabet, which will spend a boatload of cash on "comprehensive" reforms. The goal is to steer Google away from the kind of anticompetitive practices that got it in hot water.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement, obtained by <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/InreAlphabetIncShareholderDerivativeLitigationDocketNo321cv09388N/1?doc_id=X6L5I3F7H479DQB4STTU3JAG8JV">Bloomberg Law</a>, Alphabet will spend $500 million over the next 10 years on systematic reforms. The company will have to form a board-level committee devoted to overseeing the company's regulatory compliance and antitrust risk, a rarity for US firms. This group will report directly to CEO Sundar Pichai. There will also be reforms at other levels of the company that allow employees to identify potential legal pitfalls before they affect the company. Google has also agreed to preserve communications. Google's propensity to use auto-deleting chats drew condemnation from several judges overseeing its antitrust cases.</p>
<p>The agreement still needs approval from US District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco, but that's mainly a formality at this point. Naturally, Alphabet does not admit to any wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, but it may have to pay tens of millions in legal fees on top of the promised $500 million investment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/google-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-will-spend-500m-on-being-less-evil/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On May 23, President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/restoring-gold-standard-science/">issued an executive order</a> entitled "Restoring Gold Standard Science." And, in news that may surprise our readers, it sounds remarkably good, focusing on issues like reproducibility and conflicts of interest. While there were a few things that could be phrased better, when it comes to basic scientific practices, the language was remarkably reasonable.</p>
<p>So, why didn't we report on what appeared to be a rare bit of good news? I'd considered doing so, but the situation is complicated by the fact that the order is structured in a way that makes it very sensitive to who's responsible for implementing it, a situation that's subtle enough that I couldn't figure out how to handle it well. Fortunately, I only had to wait a week for a member of the Trump administration to show just how dangerous it could be and highlight its biggest problem.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary appeared on one of the weekend news programs, where he was asked about the decision to limit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-axes-covid-shot-guidance-for-pregnant-people-kids/">pregnant people's access to the COVID-19 vaccines</a>. The host mentioned that aggregation of studies involving a total of over 1.8 million women had shown the vaccine was safe and effective.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/analysis-trumps-gold-standard-science-is-already-wearing-thin/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every smartphone maker is racing to find a way to put AI in your pocket, but no one has cracked the code yet. Samsung was an early supporter of Google's Gemini AI, which has largely supplanted its little-used Bixby assistant. However, a new report claims Samsung is planning a big AI shakeup by partnering with Perplexity on the Galaxy S26.</p>
<p>Perplexity pitches itself as an AI-powered search service, running on the same generative AI technology behind ChatGPT, Gemini, and all the others. However, it cites its sources around the web more prominently than a pure chatbot. Perplexity made waves during the Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-and-doj-tussle-over-how-ai-will-remake-the-web-in-antitrust-closing-arguments/">search antitrust trial</a> when executive Dmitry Shevelenko testified that Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/perplexity-will-come-to-moto-phones-after-exec-testified-google-blocked-access/">blocked Motorola from using Perplexity</a> on its 2024 phones. The company got its wish this year, though, with Perplexity finding a place on 2025 Razr phones.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-01/samsung-nears-wide-ranging-deal-with-perplexity-for-ai-features">report from Bloomberg</a> says Samsung will be the next to leverage Perplexity's AI. The companies are apparently close to signing a deal that will make this AI model a core part of the Galaxy S26 lineup. Motorola uses Perplexity for search functionality inside its Moto AI system, but the Samsung deal would be more comprehensive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/samsung-could-drop-google-gemini-in-favor-of-perplexity-for-galaxy-s26/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>With the federal hiring freeze lifting in mid-July, the Trump administration has rolled out a controversial <a href="https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/Merit%20Hiring%20Plan%205-29-2025%27.pdf">federal hiring plan</a> that critics warn will politicize and likely slow down the process rather than increase government efficiency.</p>
<p>De-emphasizing degree requirements and banning DEI initiatives—as well as any census tracking of gender, race, ethnicity, or religion to assess the composition of government—the plan requires every new hire to submit essays explaining which executive orders or policy initiatives they will help advance.</p>
<p>These essays must be limited to 200 words and cannot be generated by a chatbot, the guidance noted. While some applicants may point to policies enacted by prior presidents under their guidance, the president appears to be seeking to ensure that only Trump supporters are hired and that anyone who becomes disillusioned with Trump is weeded out over time. In addition to asking for a show of loyalty during the interview process, all federal workers will also be continuously vetted and must agree to submit to "checks for post-appointment conduct that may impact their continued trustworthiness," the guidance noted, referencing required patriotism repeatedly.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/new-federal-employees-must-praise-trump-eos-submit-to-continuous-vetting/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>GILA RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION, Ariz.—About 33 miles south of Phoenix, Interstate 10 bisects a line of solar panels traversing the desert like an iridescent snake. The solar farm’s shape follows the path of a canal, with panels serving as awnings to shade the gently flowing water from the unforgiving heat and wind of the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>The panels began generating power last November for the Akimel O’otham and Pee Posh tribes—known together as the Gila River Indian Community, or GRIC—on their reservation in south-central Arizona, and they are the first of their kind in the US. The community is studying the effects of these panels on the water in the canal, hopeful that they will protect a precious resource from the desert’s unflinching sun and wind.</p>
<p>In September, GRIC is planning to break ground on another experimental effort to conserve water while generating electricity: floating solar. Between its canal canopies and the new project that would float photovoltaic panels on a reservoir it is building, GRIC hopes to one day power all of its canal and irrigation operations with solar electricity, transforming itself into one of the most innovative and closely watched water users in the West in the process.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/can-floating-solar-panels-on-a-reservoir-help-the-colorado-river/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1 held its annual Spanish Grand Prix this past weekend at the Catalunya circuit near Barcelona. It's a good place to test a modern F1 car, as you need <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/how-a-day-driving-high-downforce-cars-at-vir-taught-me-im-ok-being-slow/">great aerodynamics</a> to be fast around here, especially now that the awkward chicanes are gone. You also need good mechanical grip. Races used to be processional here, but the re-profiled turn 10 and the flat-out nature of the last turn have changed all that.</p>
<p>This was to be the weekend of new front wings, the result of a "technical directive" meant to stop excessive flexing as part of the sport's ongoing antipathy toward creatively movable aerodynamics <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/lighter-nimbler-more-hybrid-power-he-f1-car-of-2026/">outside a tightly described domain</a>. The competitive order would be reset, some hoped, as their rivals would be forced to give up unfair advantages. In fact, the new wings turned out to be a nothingburger. McLaren's advantage remains, and that was clear on a circuit that tests every aspect of a racing car.</p>
<p>But there's only one story that anyone really cares about after Spain, and it's the one about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. For much of the race, Verstappen held onto third place, behind the too-fast McLarens. This required using one more set of tires than they did, and for his last stint, all that was left for the Red Bull driver was a set of the too-hard compound, giving him little in the way of grip.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/f1-in-spain-now-that-was-a-lapse-in-judgement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Netflix held its Tudum Global Fan Event in Los Angeles this weekend to showcase its upcoming slate of programming. Among the highlights: the official trailer for the third and final season of <em>Squid Game</em>, the first six minutes of <em>Wednesday</em> S2, a teaser for Guillermo del Toro's <em>Frankenstein</em>, and date announcements for the fifth and final season of <em>Stranger Things,</em> as well as <em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<h2><em>Squid Game</em> S3</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/player-456-is-back-for-revenge-in-squid-game-s2-trailer/">previously reported</a>, S<em>quid Game</em>'s first season followed Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-Jae), a down-on-his-luck gambler who has little left to lose when he agrees to play children's playground games against 455 other players for money. The twist? If you lose a game, you die. If you cheat, you die. And if you win, you might also die. In the S1 finale, Gi-hun faced off against fellow finalist and childhood friend Cho Sang-woo (Park Hae-soo) in the titular "squid game." He won their fight but refused to kill his friend. Sang-woo instead stabbed himself in the neck, leaving Gi-hun the guilt-ridden winner.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/netflix-drops-squid-game-s3-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"Just disconnect your TV from the Internet and use an Apple TV box."</p>
<p>That's the common guidance you'll hear from Ars readers for those seeking the joys of streaming without giving up too much privacy. Based on our research and the experts we've consulted, that advice is pretty solid, as Apple TVs offer significantly more privacy than other streaming hardware providers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/all-the-ways-apple-tv-boxes-do-and-mostly-dont-track-you/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's a regrettable reality that there is never time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. May's list includes a nifty experiment to make a predicted effect of special relativity visible; a ping-pong playing robot that can return hits with 88 percent accuracy; and the discovery of the rare genetic mutation that makes orange cats orange, among other highlights.</p>
<h2>Special relativity made visible</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most well-known feature of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity is time dilation and length contraction. In 1959, two physicists predicted another feature of relativistic motion: An object moving near the speed of light should also appear to be rotated. It has not been possible to demonstrate this experimentally, however—until now. Physicists at the Vienna University of Technology figured out how to reproduce this rotational effect in the lab using laser pulses and precision cameras, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02003-6">a paper</a> published in the journal Communications Physics.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/research-roundup-ping-pong-bots-the-genetic-key-for-ginger-cats-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For years, members of the Russian cybercrime cartel <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/">Trickbot</a> unleashed a relentless hacking spree on the world. The group attacked thousands of victims, including businesses, schools, and hospitals. “Fuck clinics in the usa this week,” one member wrote in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/">internal Trickbot messages</a> in 2020 about a list of 428 hospitals to target. Orchestrated by an enigmatic leader using the online moniker “Stern,” the group of around 100 cybercriminals stole hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of roughly six years.</p>
<p>Despite a wave of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cyber-command-hackers-trickbot-botnet-precedent/">law enforcement</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conti-trickbot-ransomware-sanctions-uk-us/">disruptions</a> and a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/costa-rica-ransomware-conti/">damaging</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/conti-leaks-ransomware-work-life/">leak of more than 60,000 internal chat messages</a> from Trickbot and the closely associated counterpart group Conti, the identity of Stern has remained a mystery. Last week, though, Germany’s federal police agency, the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA, and local prosecutors <a href="https://www.bka.de/DE/IhreSicherheit/Fahndungen/Personen/BekanntePersonen/Endgame_2/KVN/Sachverhalt.html">alleged that Stern’s real-world name is Vi­ta­ly Ni­ko­lae­vich Kovalev</a>, a 36-year-old, 5-foot-11-inch Russian man who cops believe is in his home country and thus shielded from potential extradition.</p>
<p>A recently issued Interpol <a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices/View-Red-Notices#2025-39252">red notice</a> says that Kovalev is wanted by Germany for allegedly being the “ringleader” of a “criminal organisation.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/german-police-say-theyve-identified-trickbot-ransomware-kingpin/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since Google released its Veo 3 AI model last week, social media users have been having fun with its ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/ai-video-just-took-a-startling-leap-in-realism-are-we-doomed/">quickly generate highly realistic eight-second clips complete with sound and lip-synced dialogue</a>. TikTok's algorithm has been serving me plenty of Veo-generated videos featuring <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8MrUDpt/">impossible challenges</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@echofueltv/video/7510331996917304622?">fake news reports</a>, and even <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8MrCJNm/">surreal short narrative films</a>, to name just a few popular archetypes.</p>
<p>However, among all the AI-generated video experiments spreading around, I've also noticed a surprising counter-trend on my TikTok feed. Amid all the videos of Veo-generated avatars pretending to be real people, there are now also a bunch of videos of real people pretending to be Veo-generated avatars.</p>
<h2>“This has to be real. There’s no way it’s AI.”</h2>
<p>I stumbled across this trend when the TikTok algorithm fed me <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kongosmusic/video/7509895663065500974">this video</a> topped with the extra-large caption "Google VEO 3 THIS IS 100% AI." As I watched and listened to the purported AI-generated band that appeared to be playing in the crowded corner of someone's living room, I read the caption containing the supposed prompt that had generated the clip: "a band of brothers with beards playing rock music in 6/8 with an accordion."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/real-tiktokers-are-pretending-to-be-veo-3-ai-creations-for-fun-attention/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>From its humble beginnings in the late 20th century, Google has come to dominate online searches, putting it squarely in the US government's antitrust crosshairs. The ongoing search antitrust case threatens to upend Google's dominance, giving smaller players a chance to thrive and possibly wiping others out. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/">wrapping up testimony</a> in the case earlier this month, lawyers for Google and the Department of Justice have now made their closing arguments.</p>
<p>The DOJ won the initial trial, securing a ruling that Google used anticompetitive practices to maintain its monopoly in general search. During the time this case has taken to meander its way through the legal system, the online landscape has been radically altered, making it harder than ever to envision a post-Google Internet.</p>
<p>To address Google's monopoly, the DOJ is asking United States District Judge Amit Mehta to impose limits on Google's business dealings and order a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">divestment of the Chrome browser</a>. Forcing the sale of Chrome would be a major penalty and a coup for the DOJ lawyers, but this issue has been overshadowed somewhat as the case drags on. During closing arguments, the two sides dueled over how Google's search deals and the rise of AI could change the Internet as we know it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-and-doj-tussle-over-how-ai-will-remake-the-web-in-antitrust-closing-arguments/">Read full article</a></p>
