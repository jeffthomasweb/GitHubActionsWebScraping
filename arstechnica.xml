<p>The Ocean Sciences Building at the University of Washington in Seattle is a brightly modern, four-story structure, with large glass windows reflecting the bay across the street.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of July 7, 2016, it was being slowly locked down.</p>
<p>Red lights began flashing at the entrances as students and faculty filed out under overcast skies. Eventually, just a handful of people remained inside, preparing to unleash one of the most destructive forces in the natural world: the crushing weight of about 2½ miles of ocean water.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030884#p3">Read 84 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030884&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Hackers working for the Chinese government gained access to more than 20,000 VPN appliances sold by Fortinet using a critical vulnerability that the company failed to disclose for two weeks after fixing it, Netherlands government officials said.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-42475, is a heap-based buffer overflow that allows hackers to remotely execute malicious code. It carries a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10. A maker of network security software, Fortinet silently fixed the vulnerability on November 28, 2022, but failed to mention the threat until December 12 of that year, when the company <a href="https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-22-398">said</a> it became aware of an “instance where this vulnerability was exploited in the wild.” On January 11, 2023—more than six weeks after the vulnerability was fixed—Fortinet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/fortinet-says-hackers-exploited-critical-vulnerability-to-infect-vpn-customers/">warned</a> a threat actor was exploiting it to infect government and government-related organizations with advanced custom-made malware.</p>
<h2>Enter CoatHanger</h2>
<p>The Netherlands officials first <a href="https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc/documenten/publicaties/2024/februari/6/mivd-aivd-advisory-coathanger-tlp-clear/TLP-CLEAR+MIVD+AIVD+Advisory+COATHANGER.pdf">reported</a> in February that Chinese state hackers had exploited CVE-2022-42475 to install an advanced and stealthy backdoor tracked as CoatHanger on Fortigate appliances inside the Dutch Ministry of Defence. Once installed, the never-before-seen malware, specifically designed for the underlying FortiOS operating system, was able to permanently reside on devices even when rebooted or receiving a firmware update. CoatHanger could also escape traditional detection measures, the officials warned. The damage resulting from the breach was limited, however, because infections were contained inside a segment reserved for non-classified uses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030948#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030948&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will reportedly visit North Korea later this month, and you can bet collaboration on missiles and space programs will be on the agenda.</p>
<p>The bilateral summit in Pyongyang will follow a mysterious North Korean rocket launch on May 27, which ended in a fireball over the Yellow Sea. The fact that this launch fell short of orbit is not unusual—two of the country's three previous satellite launch attempts failed. But North Korea's official state news agency dropped some big news in the last paragraph of its report on the May 27 launch.</p>
<p>The Korean Central News Agency called the launch vehicle a "new-type satellite carrier rocket" and attributed the likely cause of the failure to "the reliability of operation of the newly developed liquid oxygen + petroleum engine" on the first stage booster. A small North Korean military spy satellite was destroyed. The fiery demise of the North Korean rocket was captured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u89YEjjlD4">video recorded by the Japanese news broadcaster NHK</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028713#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028713&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When T-Mobile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/">announced price hikes</a> of up to $5 per line on older smartphone plans last month, many customers were shocked because of T-Mobile's years-old promise that their price would never rise as long as they stuck with the same plan.</p>
<p>"New rule: Only YOU should have the power to change what you pay," T-Mobile said in a <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next">January 2017 announcement</a> of its "Un-contract" promise for T-Mobile One plans. "Now, T-Mobile One customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it. T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile One plan."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the promise wasn't as simple as T-Mobile claimed it to be in that press release. T-Mobile also published an FAQ that answered the question, "What happens if you do raise the price of my T-Mobile One service?" It explained that the only guarantee is T-Mobile will pay your final month's bill if the price goes up and you decide to cancel.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030912#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030912&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk is so opposed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/apple-and-openai-currently-have-the-most-misunderstood-partnership-in-tech/">Apple's plan to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT with device operating systems</a> that he's seemingly spreading misconceptions while heavily criticizing the partnership.</p>

<p>On X (formerly Twitter), Musk has been criticizing alleged privacy and security risks since the plan was <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">announced</a> Monday at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>
<p>"If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies," Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800265431078551973">posted</a> on X. "That is an unacceptable security violation." In another post responding to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800266437677768765">wrote</a>, "Don't want it.

<p>Lots of animals communicate with each other, from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/singing-mice-could-offer-clues-about-how-human-brains-manage-conversation/">tiny mice</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/do-sperm-whale-calls-share-features-with-speech-or-song/">enormous whales</a>. But none of those forms of communication share all but a small fraction of the richness of human language. Still, finding new examples of complex communications can tell us things about the evolution of language and what cognitive capabilities are needed for it.</p>
<p>On Monday, researchers report what may be the first instance of a human-like language ability in another species. They report that elephants refer to each other by individual names, and the elephant being referred to recognizes when it's being mentioned. The work could be replicated with a larger population and number of calls, but the finding is consistent with what we know about the sophisticated social interactions of these creatures.</p>
<h2>What’s in a name?</h2>
<p>We use names to refer to each other so often that it's possible to forget just how involved their use is. We recognize formal and informal names that refer to the same individual, even though those names often have nothing to do with the features or history of that person. We easily handle hundreds of names, including those of people we haven't interacted with in decades. And we do this in parallel with the names of thousands of places, products, items, and so on.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030904#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030904&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We’ve written before about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/how-to-use-free-virtualization-apps-to-safely-test-the-macos-ventura-betas/">Apple’s handy virtualization framework</a> in recent versions of macOS, which allows users of Apple Silicon Macs with sufficient RAM to easily set up macOS and Linux virtual machines using a number of lightweight third-party apps. This is useful for anyone who needs to test software in multiple macOS versions but doesn’t own a fleet of Mac hardware or multiple boot partitions. (Intel Macs support the virtualization framework, too, but only for Linux VMs, making it less useful.)</p>

<p>But up until now, you haven’t been able to sign into iCloud using macOS on a VM. This made the feature less useful for developers or users hoping to test iCloud features in macOS, or whose apps rely on some kind of syncing with iCloud, or people who just wanted easy access to their iCloud data from within a VM.</p>
<p>This limitation is going away in macOS 15 Sequoia, according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/using_icloud_with_macos_virtual_machines">developer documentation</a> that Apple released yesterday. As long as your host operating system is macOS 15 or newer and your guest operating system is macOS 15 or newer, VMs will now be able to sign into and use iCloud and other Apple ID-related services just as they would when running directly on the hardware.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030849#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030849&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google's June Android update is out, and it's bringing a few <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-feature-drop-june-2024/">notable changes</a> for Pixel phones. The most interesting is that the Pixel 8a, Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are all getting DisplayPort Alt Mode capabilities via their USB-C ports. This means you can go from USB-C to DisplayPort and plug right into a TV or monitor. This has been <a href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1623734657996017667">rumored forever</a> and landed in some of the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-8-display-output-3424412/">Android Betas</a> earlier, but now it's finally shipping out to production.</p>
<p>The Pixel 8's initial display support is just a mirrored mode. You can either get an awkward vertical phone in the middle of your wide-screen display or turn the phone sideways and get a more reasonable layout. You could see it being useful for videos or presentations. It would be nice if it could do more.</p>
<p>Alongside this year-plus of display port rumors has been a steady drum beat (again) for an Android desktop mode. Google has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/03/this-is-android-ns-freeform-window-mode/">playing around</a> with this idea since Android 7.0 in 2016. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/android-qa-android-engineers-take-us-on-a-deep-dive-of-android-q/3/#:~:text=Ghuloum%3A%C2%A0I,form%20factor%20devices.">In 2019</a>, we were told it was just a development testing project, and it never shipped to any real devices. Work around Android's desktop mode has been heating up, though, so maybe a second swing at this idea will result in an actual product.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030791#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030791&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, Apple premiered "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/">Apple Intelligence</a>" during a wide-ranging presentation at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino, California. However, the heart of its new tech, an array of <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models">Apple-developed AI models</a>, was overshadowed by the announcement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-integrates-chatgpt-into-siri-ios-and-mac-os/">ChatGPT integration</a> into its device operating systems.</p>

<p>Since rumors of the <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/">partnership</a> first emerged, we've seen confusion on social media about why Apple didn't develop a cutting-edge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">GPT-4-like</a> chatbot internally. Despite Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/report-apple-has-already-built-its-own-chatgpt-like-chatbot/">year-long development</a> of its own large language models (LLMs), many perceived the integration of ChatGPT (and opening the door for others, like Google Gemini) as a sign of Apple's lack of innovation.</p>
<p>"This is really strange. Surely Apple could train a very good competing LLM if they wanted? They've had a year," <a href="https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/1800284767465636091">wrote</a> AI developer Benjamin De Kraker on X. Elon Musk has also been grumbling about the OpenAI deal—and spreading misconceptions about it—<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800269249912381773">saying things</a> like, "It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security &amp; privacy!"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030003#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030003&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Adobe has <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/06/10/updating-adobes-terms-of-use">promised</a> to update its terms of service to make it "abundantly clear" that the company will "never" train generative AI on creators' content after days of customer backlash, with some saying they would cancel Adobe subscriptions over its vague terms.</p>
<p>Users got upset last week when an Adobe pop-up informed them of updates to terms of use that seemed to give Adobe broad permissions to access user content, take ownership of that content, or train AI on that content. The pop-up forced users to agree to these terms to access Adobe apps, disrupting access to creatives' projects unless they immediately accepted them.</p>
<p>For any users unwilling to accept, canceling annual plans could trigger fees amounting to 50 percent of their remaining subscription cost. Adobe justifies collecting these fees because a "yearly subscription comes with a significant discount."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030777#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030777&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX began launching operational Starlink satellites five years ago this month. Since then, the company has been rapidly developing its constellation of broadband satellites in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX has now launched about 6,000 satellites with its Falcon 9 rocket and has delivered on its promise to provide fast Internet around the world. Today, the company is the largest satellite operator in the world by a factor of 10.</p>
<p>But is this massive enterprise to deliver Internet from space profitable?</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/just-5-years-after-its-first-launch-the-starlink-constellation-is-profitable/">new report by Quilty Space</a>, the answer is <em>yes</em>. Quilty built a model to assess Starlink's profitability. First, the researchers assessed revenue. The firm estimates this will grow to $6.6 billion in 2024, up from essentially zero just four years ago. In addition to rapidly growing its subscriber base of about 3 million, SpaceX has also managed to control costs. Based upon its model, therefore, Quilty estimates that Starlink's free cash flow from the business will be about $600 million this year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027115#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027115&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Astronomers have been puzzling over the origins of mysterious fast radio bursts (FRBs) since the first one was spotted in 2007. Researchers now have their first look at non-repeating FRBs, i.e., those that have only produced a single burst of light to date. The authors of a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad40aa">new paper</a> published in The Astrophysical Journal looked specifically at the properties of polarized light emitting from these FRBs, yielding further insight into the origins of the phenomenon. The analysis supports the hypothesis that there are different origins for repeating and non-repeating FRBs.</p>
<p>“This is a new way to analyze the data we have on FRBs. Instead of just looking at how bright something is, we’re also looking at the angle of the light’s vibrating electromagnetic waves,” <a href="https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/origins-of-fast-radio-bursts-come-into-focus-through-polarized-light/">said co-author Ayush Pandhi</a>, a graduate student at the University of Toronto's Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics. “It gives you additional information about how and where that light is produced and what it has passed through on its journey to us over many millions of light years.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/its-coming-from-inside-the-galaxy-first-fast-radio-burst-source-idd/">we've reported previously</a>, FRBs involve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst">sudden blast</a> of radio-frequency radiation that lasts just a few microseconds. Astronomers have over a thousand of them to date; some come from sources that repeatedly emit FRBs, while others seem to burst once and go silent. You can produce this sort of sudden surge of energy by destroying something. But the existence of repeating sources suggests that at least some of them are produced by an object that survives the event. That has led to a focus on compact objects, like neutron stars and black holes—especially a class of neutron stars called magnetars—as likely sources.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030151#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030151&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Few people were happier with the successful outcome of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/spacexs-starship-took-a-beating-but-held-on-for-first-return-from-space/">last week's test flight</a> of SpaceX's Starship launch system than a NASA engineer named Catherine Koerner.</p>
<p>In remarks after the spaceflight, Koerner praised the "incredible" video of the Starship rocket and its Super Heavy booster returning to Earth, with each making a soft landing. "That was very promising, and a very, very successful engineering test," she added, speaking at a meeting of the Space Studies Board.</p>
<p>A former flight director, Koerner now manages development of the "exploration systems" that will support the Artemis missions for NASA—a hugely influential position within the space agency. This includes the Space Launch System rocket, NASA's Orion spacecraft, spacesuits, and the Starship vehicle that will land on the Moon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030054#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030054&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, Stoke Space announced the firing of its first stage rocket engine for the first time earlier this month, briefly igniting it for about two seconds. The company declared the June 5 test a success because the engine performed nominally and will be fired up again soon.</p>
<p>"Data point one is that the engine is still there," said Andy Lapsa, chief executive of the Washington-based launch company, in an interview with Ars.</p>
<p>The test took place at the company's facilities in Moses Lake, Washington. Seven of these methane-fueled engines, each intended to have a thrust of 100,000 pounds of force, will power the company's Nova rocket. This launch vehicle will have a lift capacity of about 5 metric tons to orbit. Lapsa declined to declare a target launch date, but based on historical developmental programs, if Stoke continues to move fast, it could fly Nova for the first time in 2026.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030683#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030683&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today, people around the world will head to school, doctor’s appointments, and pharmacies, only to be told, “Sorry, our computer systems are down.” The frequent culprit is a cybercrime gang operating on the other side of the world, demanding payment for system access or the safe return of stolen data.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> epidemic shows no signs of slowing down in 2024—despite increasing police crackdowns—and experts worry that it could soon enter a more violent phase.</p>

<p>Somehow, neutrinos went from just another random particle to becoming tiny monsters that require multi-billion-dollar facilities to understand. And there’s just enough mystery surrounding them that we feel compelled to build those facilities since neutrinos might just tear apart the entire particle physics community at the seams.</p>
<p>It started out innocently enough. Nobody asked for or predicted the existence of neutrinos, but there they were in our early particle experiments. Occasionally, heavy atomic nuclei spontaneously—and for no good reason—transform themselves, with either a neutron converting into a proton or vice-versa. As a result of this process, known as beta decay, the nucleus also emits an electron or its antimatter partner, the positron.</p>
<p>There was just one small problem: Nothing added up. The electrons never came out of the nucleus with the same energy; it was a little different every time. Some physicists argued that our conceptions of the conservation of energy only held on average, but that didn’t feel so good to say out loud, so others argued that perhaps there was another, hidden particle participating in the transformations. Something, they argued, had to sap energy away from the electron in a random way to explain this.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030571#p3">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030571&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Photos of Brazilian kids—sometimes spanning their entire childhood—have been used without their consent to power AI tools, including popular image generators like Stable Diffusion, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/06/10/brazil-childrens-personal-photos-misused-power-ai-tools">warned on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>This act poses urgent privacy risks to kids and seems to increase risks of non-consensual AI-generated images bearing their likenesses, HRW's report said.</p>
<p>An HRW researcher, Hye Jung Han, helped expose the problem. She analyzed "less than 0.0001 percent" of LAION-5B, a dataset built from Common Crawl snapshots of the public web. The dataset does not contain the actual photos but includes image-text pairs derived from 5.85 billion images and captions posted online since 2008.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030521#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030521&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As many as 165 customers of cloud storage provider Snowflake have been compromised by a group that obtained login credentials through information-stealing malware, researchers said Monday.</p>
<p>On Friday, Lending Tree subsidiary QuoteWizard confirmed it was among the customers notified by Snowflake that it was affected in the incident. Lending Tree spokesperson Megan Greuling said the company is in the process of determining whether data stored on Snowflake has been stolen.</p>
<p>“That investigation is ongoing,” she wrote in an email. “As of this time, it does not appear that consumer financial account information was impacted, nor information of the parent entity, Lending Tree.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030619#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030619&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
