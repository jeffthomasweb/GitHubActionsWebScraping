<p>Senior NASA leaders, including the agency's administrator Bill Nelson, will meet Saturday in Houston to decide whether Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is safe enough to ferry astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth from the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The Flight Readiness Review (FRR) is expected to conclude with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasa-is-about-to-make-its-most-important-safety-decision-in-nearly-a-generation/">NASA's most consequential safety decision in nearly a generation</a>. One option is to clear the Starliner spacecraft to undock from the space station in early September with Wilmore and Williams onboard, as their flight plan initially laid out, or to bring the capsule home without its crew.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, the two veteran astronauts have been on the space station for 77 days, nearly 10 times longer than their planned stay of eight days. Wilmore and Williams were the first people to launch and dock at the space station aboard a Starliner spacecraft, but multiple thrusters failed and the capsule leaked helium from its propulsion system as it approached the orbiting completed on June 6.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044910#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044910&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Owners of the $1,695 Snoo "smart" bassinet like to gather in forums like Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SnooLife/">r/snoolife</a> to swap tracking graphs of their children's sleep patterns. But they also like to complain about <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com">Happiest Baby</a>, the company behind the Snoo. That's because Happiest Baby this summer added a $20 monthly subscription fee to several of the Snoo's "premium features," which are controlled by a smartphone app.</p>
<p>Those who bought their Snoo from an "authorized" retailer before July 15, 2024, get the premium features free for nine months. No problem!</p>
<p>But those who bought their Snoo from an unauthorized retailer—that is, got it used—can "enjoy all the fun and benefits of our premium App features—for FREE—until July 15, 2024," the company <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/pages/shipping-returns">announced in its fine print</a>. After that date, premium features went away; the only option for premium feature access on used Snoos now is to cough up $20 each month, atop the $600–$1,000 already spent on the device.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044924#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044924&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the COVID-19 case count <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/amid-summer-covid-surge-fda-reportedly-poised-to-approve-updated-shots/">continues to tick upward</a>, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved an updated vaccine for use ahead of the northern hemisphere winter.

<p>The booster shots will target the JN.1 and KP.2 strains of SARS-CoV-2, both of which are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/who-warns-of-potential-for-more-variants-as-omicron-subvariant-found-in-us/">omicron variants</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/everyone-should-get-a-covid-booster-this-fall-cdc-says/">Last year's booster</a> keyed on omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, which has long since lost the evolutionary arms race.</p>

<p>A federal judge sentenced a 53-year-old Kansas man to more than 24 years in prison after the former bank CEO abused his trusted position to embezzle $47 million after falling for a cryptocurrency scam that he believed would make him wildly rich.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/former-ceo-failed-bank-sentenced-prison">press release,</a> the US Attorney's Office said that Shan Hanes was driven by "greed" when directing bank employees to transfer millions in funds to a sketchy crypto wallet managed by still-unknown third parties behind the so-called <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-a-pig-butchering-scam-heres-how-to-avoid-falling-victim-to-one">"pig butchering" scheme</a>.</p>
<p>Hanes was first targeted by scammers in late 2022, apparently when he got a message from an unidentified co-conspirator on WhatsApp, prosecutors said. After blowing through his own funds seeking promised profits, Hanes stole tens of thousands from a local church, then a local investor club, and finally his daughter's college fund, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/cryptocurrency-pig-butchering-scam-wrecks-kansas-bank-sends-ex-ceo-pri-rcna167642">reported</a>. Then when all those wells dried up, he started stealing bank funds—all in the false hopes that sending more and more money to the scammers would somehow "unlock the supposed returns" on his crypto investments.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044890#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044890&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Peloton will start charging people a one-time $95 "used equipment activation fee" for used bikes purchased from outside of Peloton and its official distribution partners.</p>
<p>The fee will apply in the US and Canada. As pointed out by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225988/peloton-used-equipment-activation-fee-fitness">The Verge</a>, Peloton confirmed in its fiscal Q4 2024 <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/om239iz6/">earnings call</a> today that people who buy a used bike directly from Peloton or one of its third-party partners will not be subject to the fee.</p>
<p>During the call, Peloton's interim CEO, Christopher Bruzzo, said that the activation fee "will be a source of incremental revenue and gross profit" and support Peloton's "investments in improving the fitness experience for our members."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044830#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044830&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google has agreed to fund local journalism and an artificial intelligence initiative in California as part of a deal that would <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-21/california-lawmakers-bill-requires-tech-platforms-pay-for-news-journalism-preservation-act">reportedly</a> result in lawmakers shelving a proposal to require Google to pay news outlets for distributing their content. But the deal's state financing requires legislative approval as part of California's annual budget process and is drawing criticism from some lawmakers and a union for journalists.</p>
<p>Governor Gavin Newsom is on board, <a href="https://a14.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240821-assemblymember-wicks-secures-agreement-state-major-tech-companies-support">saying</a> that the "agreement represents a major breakthrough in ensuring the survival of newsrooms and bolstering local journalism across California—leveraging substantial tech industry resources without imposing new taxes on Californians." The deal "will provide nearly $250 million in public and private funding over the next five years, with the majority of funding going to newsrooms," said an announcement by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat.</p>
<p>A "News Transformation Fund" would be created with funding from the state and Google and be administered by the UC Berkeley School of Journalism. The state would contribute $30 million the first year and $10 million in each of the next four years, according to a summary provided to Ars by Wicks' office.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044874#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044874&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong"><em>Pong</em></a> will always hold a special place in the history of gaming as one of the earliest arcade video games. Introduced in 1972, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhd7FfGCdCo">a table tennis game</a> featuring very simple graphics and gameplay. In fact, it's simple enough that even non-living materials known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogel">hydrogels</a> can "learn" to play the game by "remembering" previous patterns of electrical stimulation, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00436-3">new paper</a> published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science.</p>
<p>"Our research shows that even very simple materials can exhibit complex, adaptive behaviors typically associated with living systems or sophisticated AI," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1055131?">said co-author Yoshikatsu Hayashi</a>, a biomedical engineer at the University of Reading in the UK. "This opens up exciting possibilities for developing new types of 'smart' materials that can learn and adapt to their environment."</p>
<p>Hydrogels are soft, flexible biphasic materials that swell but do not dissolve in water. So a hydrogel may contain a large amount of water but still maintain its shape, making it useful for a wide range of applications. Perhaps the best-known use is soft contact lenses, but various kinds of hydrogels are also used in breast implants, disposable diapers, EEG and ECG medical electrodes, glucose biosensors, encapsulating quantum dots, solar-powered water purification, cell cultures, tissue engineering scaffolds, water gel explosives, actuators for soft robotics, supersonic shock-absorbing materials, and sustained-release drug delivery systems, among other uses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044726#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044726&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AMD recently released its Ryzen 9000-series processors, which brought the company's new Zen 5 CPU architecture to desktops for the first time. But we (and multiple other reviewers) had issues getting the chips' performance to match up to AMD's promises, something that the company wasn't able to fully resolve before the processors launched to the public.</p>
<p>AMD has since <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/ryzen-9000-series-community-update-gaming-performance/ba-p/704054">put out statements</a> explaining some of the discrepancies and promising at least partial fixes for some of them.</p>
<h2>A Windows problem</h2>
<p>The main fix for slower-than-expected game performance, the company says, will come with the Windows 11 24H2 update later this year, which will include "optimized AMD-specific branch prediction code" that improves Ryzen 9000's performance by between 3 and 13 percent in an AMD-provided cross-section of games and benchmarks (though a handful of tests also showed no change). AMD says that these improvements will also benefit Zen 3- and Zen 4-based Ryzen processors, but that "the biggest boost" will be reserved for Ryzen 9000 and Zen 5.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044784#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044784&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A small town in Massachusetts is urging residents to stay indoors in the evenings after the spread of a dangerous mosquito-spread virus reached "critical risk level."</p>
<p>The virus causes Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), which kills between 30 and 50 percent of people who are stricken—who are often children under the age of 15 and the elderly. Around half who survive are left permanently disabled, and some die within a few years due to complications. There is no treatment for EEE. So far, one person in the town—an elderly resident of Oxford—has already become seriously ill with neuroinvasive EEE.</p>
<p>EEE virus is spread by mosquitoes in certain swampy areas of the country, particularly in Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the Great Lakes region. Mosquitoes shuttle the virus between wild birds and animals, including horses and humans. In humans, the virus causes very few cases in the US each year—<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/eastern-equine-encephalitis/data-maps/index.html">an average of 11</a>, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But given the extreme risk of EEE, health officials take any spread seriously.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044837#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044837&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Tom Francis and his Suspicious Developments team spent 6.5 years crafting the perfect finale to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration">defenestration</a> trilogy, and it shows. If you liked blasting people out of windows in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/gunpoint-hands-on-an-intelligent-spy-thriller-with-breakable-glass/"><em>Gunpoint</em></a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2017/2/"><em>Heat Signature</em></a>—or snappy writing, endearing characters, wizards, turn-based tactical gameplay, and efficiency challenges—you are going to love <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a>.</p>
<p>The game's name is as efficient as its design, telling you a lot about its tone and distinct offerings. You play as a small team of magic wielders, each of which you can control, one at a time, in a world where magic use, mana, and all the rest have been militarized and corporatized. There are stasis hexes put on illegally parked cars and even a Traffic Warlock, who, after getting on his bad side, will try to mow you down with an entire ghost highway full of spectral drivers.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FXMSBXnJlWM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> launch trailer. </p></div>
<p>Luckily, bad guys like him can only hit you if you don't plan accordingly. Owing to the powers of your teammate Zan, you can foresee everything that will happen within a round of combat (he's a one-second clairvoyant). Move team member Jen to this square on the grid, have her chain-zap three guys, seal the door next to her, then see what that leaves Zan to do. Don't like the outcome? Rewind repeatedly until you've gotten the most out of your team's actions or maybe achieved one of the game's optional achievements. You get "Confidence" for pulling off stunts like "knock three baddies out a window with one action," but they're entirely optional because Confidence only unlocks cool outfits, not powers or gameplay. The actual perks you unlock give you delicious choices to make, deciding which way to take each character's powers to complement or offset one another.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044560#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044560&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple is comprehensively restructuring its long-standing App Store team, splitting the team into two separate divisions as the executive who has run it for more than a decade says goodbye to the company.</p>
<p>There will now be one team for the familiar, Apple-run App Store, and another one to handle alternative app stores in the European Union. Apple recently partially opened the platform to third-party app stores in response to the Digital Markets Act, a set of European regulations meant to break up what legislators and regulators deemed to be app store monopolies.</p>
<p>As noted, the restructuring comes with some notable personnel changes, too. App Store Vice President Matt Fischer, who has been at the helm of the platform since 2010, will leave the company.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044820#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044820&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Kentucky man has been sentenced to nearly seven years in prison after hacking into state registries to fake his own death, in hopes of avoiding about $116,000 in child support payments.</p>
<p>In a press release, the US Attorney's Office wrote that Jesse Kipf, 39, was sentenced for charges including computer fraud and aggravated identity theft. On top of hacking state death registries in Arizona, Hawaii, and Vermont, Kipf also "hacked into private businesses and attempted to sell access to networks on the dark web" and stole identities of real people to open two credit accounts.</p>
<p>Now, Kipf has agreed to pay $195,758.65 in damages, including the child support owed to his ex-wife and nearly $80,000 to repair damage to the state death registries.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044781#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044781&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following a successful recall, federal safety investigators have concluded an investigation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/nhtsa-is-investigating-cruise-autonomous-vehicles-for-brake-checking/">that was sparked</a> after a number of Cruise robotaxis crashed after braking inappropriately when being followed by other cars. It's a spot of good news for the autonomous driving startup, which has been under heavy scrutiny by federal and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/california-suspends-cruises-robotaxis-after-pedestrian-was-critically-injured/">state</a> regulators lately.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2022/INOA-PE22014-4871.PDF">opened</a> a preliminary evaluation in December 2022 after reports emerged that Cruise's robotaxis could engage in "inappropriately hard braking" or become immobilized while driving, thus becoming obstacles and potentially causing a crash.</p>
<p>At the time, NHTSA had three reports of Cruise robotaxis braking hard in response to another vehicle or cyclist approaching quickly from behind, resulting in the robotaxi being rear-ended.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044780#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044780&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Booming demand for artificial intelligence is encouraging big tech companies and their suppliers to explore converting old power stations and industrial sites into data centers.</p>
<p>Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are pouring billions of dollars into building data centers to power cloud computing and AI services, but it has become increasingly challenging to find suitable locations with sufficient power for the energy-hungry facilities.</p>
<p>Many data center markets are “heavily constrained when it comes to land availability and power,” which in turn fueled interest in smaller markets and “more complicated sites” such as old power stations, said Adam Cookson, head of land transactions for real estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Emea data center advisory group.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044771#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044771&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The number of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/authorities-investigating-death-possibly-linked-to-toxic-microdosing-candies/">poisonings connected to Diamond Shruumz-brand microdosing candies</a> has reached 145 cases across 29 states. Since the illnesses first came to light in early June, 59 of those sickened have required hospitalization, and health officials have reported people having seizures, needing intubation, and being admitted to intensive care units. Two deaths are under investigation. Yet, despite tireless efforts to analyze the candies' components, the cause of the poisonings remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Diamond Shruumz suggestively markets the chocolates—as well as its gummies and candy cones—as containing psychedelic drugs but doesn't say what's in them exactly. They're only said to contain a "primo proprietary blend of nootropic and functional mushrooms," and the company has identified non-hallucinogenic mushrooms, including Lion's mane, Reishi, and Chaga.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024">latest investigation update</a> Monday, the Food and Drug Administration laid out the testing results of 22 chocolate bars from Diamond Shruumz—and the list of illicit and troubling drugs found keeps growing. Stunningly, none of the drugs found so far can alone explain the severe illnesses.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044759#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044759&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA would like to start stacking the Space Launch System rocket for the Artemis II mission—the first human flight around the Moon since 1972—sometime next month, but the agency's exploration chief says the milestone could be delayed as engineers continue studying the readiness of the Orion spacecraft's heat shield.</p>
<p>The heat shield, already installed at the base of the Orion spacecraft, will take the brunt of the heating when the capsule blazes through Earth's atmosphere at the end of the 10-day mission. On the Artemis I test flight in late 2022, NASA sent an Orion spacecraft to the Moon and back without a crew aboard. The only significant blemish on the test flight was a finding that charred chunks of the heat shield unexpectedly stripped away from the capsule during reentry as temperatures increased to nearly 5,000° Fahrenheit (2,760° Celsius).</p>
<p>The spacecraft safely splashed down, and if any astronauts had been aboard, they would have been fine. However, the inspections of the recovered spacecraft showed divots of heat shield material were missing. The heat shield material, called Avcoat, is designed to erode away in a controlled manner during reentry. Instead, fragments fell off the heat shield that left cavities resembling potholes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044603#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044603&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bethesda's <em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em> is the latest game from a Microsoft subsidiary that will make its way to the PlayStation 5. The game will hit Sony's console in the spring of 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/the-great-circle-is-indiana-jones-for-a-post-uncharted-world/">announced yesterday</a>, months after a planned December launch on Xbox Series S/X and Windows.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_o61DN93ik">an interview with YouTube channel Xbox On</a>, Microsoft's Phil Spencer expanded on that decision, implying that multiplatform releases for Microsoft gaming properties were important to the Xbox division's bottom line. "We run a business," he said. "It's definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery that we have to give back to the company, because we get a level of support from the company that's just amazing in what we're able to go do."</p>

<p>Amid massive layoffs that have hit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/report-embracers-ongoing-layoffs-kill-a-new-deus-ex-game-after-2-years-work/">other</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/unity-cuts-25-percent-of-workforce-as-it-refocuses-on-game-engine-business/">gaming companies</a> in recent months, Spencer noted that there's "a lot of pressure on the [game] industry" these days. "[The industry] has been growing for a long, long time and now people are looking for ways to grow," he said. "And I think that us, as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there's going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed [are] going to change... for all of us."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044702#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044702&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A phone company agreed to pay a $1 million fine for transmitting spoofed robocalls in which a deepfake of President Joe Biden's voice urged New Hampshire residents not to vote. Lingo Telecom, which is based in Texas, agreed to a settlement with the Federal Communications Commission, the agency <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404951A1.pdf">announced today</a>.</p>
<p>Lingo Telecom "will pay a $1 million civil penalty and implement a historic compliance plan—the first of its kind secured by the FCC—that will require strict adherence to the FCC's STIR/SHAKEN Caller ID authentication rules," the FCC said. The settlement includes "requirements that the company abide by 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) and 'Know Your Upstream Provider' (KYUP) principles" that focus on vetting call traffic to ensure it is trustworthy, and "requirements that the company more thoroughly verify the accuracy of the information provided by its customers and upstream providers."</p>
<p>The calls made before New Hampshire's presidential primary in January were orchestrated by Steve Kramer, a Democratic consultant who was working for a candidate running against Biden. Kramer was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/democratic-consultant-indicted-for-biden-deepfake-that-told-people-not-to-vote/">indicted</a> on charges of voter suppression and impersonation of a candidate, and the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-6-million-fine-deepfake-robocalls-around-nh-primary">proposed a $6 million fine</a> for Kramer. The calls inaccurately displayed a phone number associated with a prominent New Hampshire political operative.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044661#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044661&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rLhGmbkkGFw?si=coZhQ6N4kFnzlY-X?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">The German navy going "full Empire" down the Thames. </p></div>
<p>The FGS <em>Braunschweig</em> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_corvette_Braunschweig">German naval corvette</a> made for stealthy littoral (shoreline) operations, but the <em>Braunschweig</em> ditched the stealth completely while transiting up the Thames this week on a training mission to London. Instead, the ship turned out its enlisted men to stand on deck in <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/watch-german-navy-plays-darth-100342710.html">light blue shirts and dark pants</a> while the boat blasted a recording of "The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)" from <em>Star Wars</em> as it floated past Tower Bridge.</p>
<p>Coming eight decades after Londoners lived through the German "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz">blitz</a>" in World War II and then spent years waiting for a German naval invasion that never materialized, playing the Big Bad Guy's theme from Star Wars films was certainly a bold choice. But a German naval spokesperson <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cn87608w389o">assured the BBC</a> that the music had "no deeper message" and added that it was not some sort of commentary from the German naval staff. Rather, the boat's commander "can choose the music freely."</p>
<p>The little spectacle did show two things. One—assuming this was, in fact, a joke—it put the lie to the old stereotype that the Germans have no sense of humor, a stereotype that has led to the production of actual BBC headlines like "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20170802-why-people-think-germans-arent-funny">Why people think Germans aren't funny</a>."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044654#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044654&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
