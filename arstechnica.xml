<p>An asteroid that has been wandering through space for billions of years is going to have been bombarded by everything from rocks to radiation. Billions of years traveling through interplanetary space increase the odds of colliding with something in the vast emptiness, and at least one of those impacts had enough force to leave the asteroid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/08/ryugu-samples-reveal-traces-of-rock-from-before-the-sun-existed/">Ryugu</a> forever changed.</p>
<p>When the Japanese Space Agency’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft touched down on Ryugu, it collected samples from the surface that revealed that particles of magnetite (which is usually magnetic) in the asteroid’s regolith are devoid of magnetism. A team of researchers from Hokkaido University and several other institutions in Japan are now offering an explanation for how this material lost most of its magnetic properties. Their analysis showed that it was caused by at least one high-velocity micrometeoroid collision that broke the magnetite’s chemical structure down so that it was no longer magnetic.</p>
<p>“We surmised that pseudo-magnetite was created [as] the result of space weathering by micrometeoroid impact,” the researchers, led by Hokkaido University professor Yuki Kimura, said in a study recently published in Nature Communications.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025328#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025328&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ruth Ann Norton used to look forward to seeing the blue flame that danced on the burners of her gas stove. At one time, she says, she would have sworn that preparing meals with the appliance actually made her a better cook.</p>
<p>But then she started learning about the toxic gasses, including carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and other harmful pollutants that are emitted by stoves into the air, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14022023/gas-induction-stoves-indoor-air-pollution/">even when they’re turned off</a>.</p>
<p>“I’m a person who grew up cooking, and love that blue flame,” said Norton, who <a href="https://www.greenandhealthyhomes.org/person/ruth-ann-norton/">leads the environmental advocacy group known as the Green &amp; Healthy Homes Initiative</a>. “But people fear what they don’t know. And what people need to understand really strongly is the subtle and profound impact that this is having—on neurological health, on respiratory health, on reproductive health.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025260#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025260&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In July last year, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/">announced the formation of a new research team</a> that would prepare for the advent of supersmart <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> capable of outwitting and overpowering its creators. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist and one of the company’s co-founders, was named as the co-lead of this new team. OpenAI said the team would receive 20 percent of its computing power.</p>
<p>Now OpenAI’s “superalignment team” is no more, the company confirms. That comes after the departures of several researchers involved, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-leaves-openai-six-months-after-altman-ouster/">Tuesday’s news</a> that Sutskever was leaving the company, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/janleike/status/1790603862132596961">resignation</a> of the team’s other co-lead. The group’s work will be absorbed into OpenAI’s other research efforts.</p>

<p>Unraveling how consciousness arises out of particular configurations of organic matter is a quest that has absorbed scientists and philosophers for ages. Now, with AI systems behaving in strikingly conscious-looking ways, it is more important than ever to get a handle on who and what is capable of experiencing life on a conscious level. As Christof Koch writes in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541602803/?tag=arstech20-20"><em>Then I Am Myself the World</em></a>, "That you are intimately acquainted with the way life feels is a brute fact about the world that cries out for an explanation." His explanation—bounded by the limits of current research and framed through Koch’s preferred theory of consciousness—is what he eloquently attempts to deliver.</p>
<p>Koch, a physicist, neuroscientist, and former president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, has spent his career hunting for the seat of consciousness, scouring the brain for physical footprints of subjective experience. It turns out that the posterior hot zone, a region in the back of the neocortex, is intricately connected to self-awareness and experiences of sound, sight, and touch. Dense networks of neocortical neurons in this area connect in a looped configuration; output signals feedback into input neurons, allowing the posterior hot zone to influence its own behavior. And herein, Koch claims, lies the key to consciousness.</p>
<h2>In the hot zone</h2>
<p>According to integrated information theory (IIT)—which Koch strongly favors over a multitude of contending theories of consciousness—the Rosetta Stone of subjective experience is the ability of a system to influence itself: to use its past state to affect its present state and its present state to influence its future state.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025246#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025246&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the debut of remarkably effective weight-loss drugs, America's high obesity rate and its uniquely astronomical prescription drug pricing appear to be set on a catastrophic collision course—one that threatens to "bankrupt our entire health care system," according to <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Wegovy-report-FINAL.pdf">a new Senate report</a> that modeled the economic impact of the drugs in different uptake scenarios.</p>
<p>If just half of the adults in the US with obesity start taking a new weight-loss drug, such as Wegovy, the collective cost would total an estimated $411 billion per year, the analysis found. That's more than the $406 billion Americans spent in 2022 on all prescription drugs combined.</p>
<p>While the bulk of the spending on weight-loss drugs will occur in the commercial market—which could easily lead to spikes in health insurance premiums—taxpayer-funded Medicare and Medicaid programs will also see an extraordinary financial burden. In the scenario that half of adults with obesity go on the drug, the cost to those federal programs would total $166 billion per year, rivaling the programs' total 2022 drug costs of $175 billion.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025320#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025320&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple’s initial pitch for the tvOS and the Apple TV as it currently exists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/tvos-17s-extra-column-of-icons-is-its-most-useful-new-feature-in-years/">was centered around apps</a>. No longer a mere streaming box, the Apple TV would also be a destination for general-purpose software and games, piggybacking off of the iPhone's vibrant app and game library.</p>
<p>That never really panned out, and the Apple TV is still mostly a box for streaming TV shows and movies. But the same App Store rule change that recently allowed <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PPSSPP</a>, and other retro console emulators onto the iPhone and iPad could also make the Apple TV appeal to people who want a small, efficient, no-fuss console emulator for their TVs.</p>

<p>So far, few of the emulators that have made it to the iPhone have been ported to the Apple TV. But earlier this week, the streaming box got an official port of RetroArch, the sprawling collection of emulators that <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">runs on everything</a> from the PlayStation Portable to the Raspberry Pi. RetroArch could be sideloaded onto iOS and tvOS before this, but only using <a href="https://docs.libretro.com/guides/install-ios/">awkward workarounds</a> that took a lot more work and know-how than downloading an app from the App Store.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025043#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025043&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Stuff posted on Reddit is getting incorporated into ChatGPT, Reddit and OpenAI <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-oai-partner">announced</a> on Thursday. The new partnership grants OpenAI access to Reddit’s Data API, giving the generative AI firm real-time access to Reddit posts.</p>
<p>Reddit content will be incorporated into ChatGPT "and new products," Reddit's blog post said. The social media firm claims the partnership will "enable OpenAI’s AI tools to better understand and showcase Reddit content, especially on recent topics." OpenAI will also start advertising on Reddit.</p>
<p>The deal is similar to one that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/your-reddit-posts-may-train-ai-models-following-new-60-million-agreement/">Reddit struck with Google</a> in February that allows the tech giant to make "new ways to display Reddit content" and provide "more efficient ways to train models," Reddit <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-and-google-expand-partnership">said</a> at the time. Neither Reddit nor OpenAI disclosed the financial terms of their partnership, but Reddit's partnership with Google was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-16/reddit-is-said-to-sign-ai-content-licensing-deal-ahead-of-ipo?sref=10lNAhZ9">reportedly</a> worth $60 million.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025270#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025270&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Cats and robots are a winning combination, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk4XB2wZqF4">all those videos</a> of kitties riding on Roombas. And now we have Cat Royale, a "multispecies" live installation in which three cats regularly "played" with a robot over 12 days, carefully monitored by human operators. Created by computer scientists from the University of Nottingham in collaboration with artists from a group called Blast Theory, the installation debuted at the World Science Festival in Brisbane, Australia, last year and is now a touring exhibit. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un-bet9CFIQ&amp;list=PLNEbg2a9DdkrlsKwPCq8JQDlekE7MGJrK">accompanying YouTube video series</a> recently won a Webby Award, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642115">a paper</a> outlining the insights gleaned from the experience was similarly voted best paper at the recent Computer-Human Conference (CHI’24).</p>
<p>"At first glance, the project is about designing a robot to enrich the lives of a family of cats by playing with them," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1044427">said co-author Steve Benford</a> of the University of Nottingham, who led the research, "Under the surface, however, it explores the question of what it takes to trust a robot to look after our loved ones and potentially ourselves." While cats might love Roombas, not all animal encounters with robots are positive: Guide dogs for the visually impaired <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3555582">can get confused</a> by delivery robots, for example, while the rise of lawn mowing robots can have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33919297/">a negative impact</a> on hedgehogs, per Benford et al.</p>
<p>Blast Theory and the scientists first held a series of exploratory workshops to ensure the installation and robotic design would take into account the welfare of the cats. "Creating a multispecies system—where cats, robots, and humans are all accounted for—takes more than just designing the robot," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1044427">said co-author Eike Schneiders</a> of Nottingham's Mixed Reality Lab about the primary takeaway from the project. "We had to ensure animal well-being at all times, while simultaneously ensuring that the interactive installation engaged the (human) audiences around the world. This involved consideration of many elements, including the design of the enclosure, the robot, and its underlying systems, the various roles of the humans-in-the-loop, and, of course, the selection of the cats.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024062#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024062&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Buried under the news from Google I/O this week is one of Google Cloud's biggest blunders ever: Google's Amazon Web Services competitor accidentally deleted a giant customer account for no reason. UniSuper, an Australian pension fund that manages $135 billion worth of funds and has 647,000 members, had its entire account wiped out at Google Cloud, including all its backups that were stored on the service. UniSuper thankfully had some backups with a different provider and was able to recover its data, but according to UniSuper's incident log, downtime started May 2, and a full restoration of services didn't happen until May 15.</p>
<p>UniSuper's website is now full of must-read admin nightmare fuel about how this all happened. First is <a href="https://www.unisuper.com.au/about-us/media-centre/2024/a-joint-statement-from-unisuper-and-google-cloud">a wild page</a> posted on May 8 titled "A joint statement from UniSuper CEO Peter Chun, and Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian." This statement reads, "Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian has confirmed that the disruption arose from an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription. This is an isolated, ‘one-of-a-kind occurrence’ that has never before occurred with any of Google Cloud’s clients globally. This should not have happened. Google Cloud has identified the events that led to this disruption and taken measures to ensure this does not happen again."</p>
<p>In the next section, titled "Why did the outage last so long?" the joint statement says, "UniSuper had duplication in two geographies as a protection against outages and loss. However, when the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription occurred, it caused deletion across both of these geographies." Every cloud service keeps full backups, which you would presume are meant for worst-case scenarios. Imagine some hacker takes over your server or the building your data is inside of collapses, or something like that. But no, the <em>actual </em>worst-case scenario is "Google deletes your account," which means all those backups are gone, too. Google Cloud is supposed to have safeguards that don't allow account deletion, but none of them worked apparently, and the only option was a restore from a separate cloud provider (shoutout to the hero at UniSuper who chose a multi-cloud solution).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025177#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025177&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will require some financial institutions to disclose security breaches within 30 days of learning about them.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the SEC adopted changes to Regulation S-P, which governs the treatment of the personal information of consumers. Under the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/34-100155-fact-sheet.pdf">amendments</a>, institutions must notify individuals whose personal information was compromised “as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days” after learning of unauthorized network access or use of customer data. The new requirements will be binding on broker-dealers (including funding portals), investment companies, registered investment advisers, and transfer agents.</p>
<p>"Over the last 24 years, the nature, scale, and impact of data breaches has transformed substantially," SEC Chair Gary Gensler <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-58">said</a>. "These amendments to Regulation S-P will make critical updates to a rule first adopted in 2000 and help protect the privacy of customers’ financial data. The basic idea for covered firms is if you’ve got a breach, then you’ve got to notify. That’s good for investors."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025242#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025242&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Anyone can do a simple experiment. Navigate to a search engine that offers suggested completions for what you type, and start typing "scientists believe." When I did it, I got suggestions about the origin of whales, the evolution of animals, the root cause of narcolepsy, and more. The search results contained a long list of topics, like "How scientists believe the loss of Arctic sea ice will impact US weather patterns" or "Scientists believe Moon is 40 million years older than first thought."</p>
<p>What do these all have in common? They're misleading, at least in terms of how most people understand the word "believe." In all these examples, scientists have become convinced via compelling evidence; these are more than just hunches or emotional compulsions. Given that difference, using "believe" isn't really an accurate description. Yet all these examples come from searching Google News, and so are likely to come from journalistic outlets that care about accuracy.</p>
<p>Does the difference matter? A recent study suggests that it does. People who were shown headlines that used subjective verbs like "believe" tended to view the issue being described as a matter of opinion—even if that issue was solidly grounded in fact.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025235#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025235&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After <a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/slack-ai-has-arrived">launching</a> Slack AI in February, Slack appears to be digging its heels in, defending its vague <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/trust/data-management/privacy-principles">policy</a> that by default sucks up customers' data—including messages, content, and files—to train Slack's global AI models.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.threads.net/@aaronjmaurer/post/C7C2-NPuL61">According to Slack engineer Aaron Maurer</a>, Slack has explained in a <a href="https://slack.engineering/how-we-built-slack-ai-to-be-secure-and-private/">blog</a> that the Salesforce-owned chat service does not train its large language models (LLMs) on customer data. But Slack's policy may need updating "to explain more carefully how these privacy principles play with Slack AI," Maurer wrote on Threads, partly because the policy "was originally written about the search/recommendation work we've been doing for years prior to Slack AI."</p>
<p>Maurer was responding to a Threads <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gergelyorosz_/post/C7CtYPOIkPA">post</a> from engineer and writer Gergely Orosz, who called for companies to opt out of data sharing until the policy is clarified, not by a blog, but in the actual policy language.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025179#p3">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025179&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Twitter.com links are now redirecting to the x.com domain as Elon Musk gets closer to wiping out the Twitter brand name over a year and half after buying the company.</p>
<p>"All core systems are now on X.com," Musk wrote in an <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1791351500217754008">X post</a> today. X also displayed a message to users that said, "We are letting you know that we are changing our URL, but your privacy and data protection settings remain the same."</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In recent years, we've reported on multiple efforts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/beyond-emulation-the-massive-effort-to-reverse-engineer-n64-source-code/">reverse-engineer Nintendo 64 games</a> into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/reverse-engineering-team-completes-its-ocarina-of-time-decompilation/">fully decompiled, human-readable C code</a> that can then become the basis for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/perfect-dark-finally-gets-the-full-featured-pc-port-it-deserves/">full-fledged PC ports</a>. While the results can be impressive, the decompilation process can take years of painstaking manual effort, meaning only the most popular N64 games are likely to get the requisite attention from reverse engineers.</p>
<p>Now, a newly released tool promises to vastly reduce the amount of human effort needed to get basic PC ports of most (if not all) N64 games. The <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp/tree/dev?tab=readme-ov-file">N64 Recompiled project</a> uses a process known as <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/155511/why-is-static-recompilation-not-possible">static recompilation</a> to automate huge swaths of the labor-intensive process of drawing C code out of N64 binaries.</p>
<p>While human coding work is still needed to smooth out the edges, project lead Mr-Wiseguy told Ars that his recompilation tool is "the difference between weeks of work and years of work" when it comes to making a PC version of a classic N64 title. And parallel work on a powerful N64 graphic renderer means PC-enabled upgrades like smoother frame rates, resolution upscaling, and widescreen aspect ratios can be added with little effort.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025130#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025130&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony Music is sending warning letters to more than 700 artificial intelligence developers and music streaming services globally in the latest salvo in the music industry’s battle against tech groups ripping off artists.</p>
<p>The Sony Music letter, which has been seen by the Financial Times, expressly prohibits AI developers from using its music—which includes artists such as Harry Styles, Adele and Beyoncé—and opts out of any text and data mining of any of its content for any purposes such as training, developing or commercializing any AI system.</p>
<p>Sony Music is sending the letter to companies developing AI systems including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Suno, and Udio, according to those close to the group.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025114#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025114&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The hot water took too long to come out of the tap. That is what I was trying to solve. I did not intend to discover that, for a while there, water heaters like mine may have been open to anybody. That, with some API tinkering and an email address, a bad actor could possibly set its temperature or make it run constantly. That’s just how it happened.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back. My wife and I moved into a new home last year. It had a Rinnai <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters">tankless water heater</a> tucked into a utility closet in the garage. The builder and home inspector didn't say much about it, just to run a yearly cleaning cycle on it.</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t keep a big tank of water heated and ready to be delivered to any house tap, tankless water heaters save energy—up to 34 percent, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters">according to the Department of Energy</a>. But they're also, by default, slower. Opening a tap triggers the exchanger, heats up the water (with natural gas, in my case), and the device has to push it through the line to where it's needed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020163#p3">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020163&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.44 of the Rocket Report! Kathy Lueders, general manager of SpaceX's Starbase launch facility, says the company expects to receive an FAA launch license for the next Starship test flight shortly after Memorial Day. It looks like this rocket could fly in late May or early June, about two-and-a-half months after the previous Starship test flight. This is an improvement over the previous intervals of seven months and four months between Starship flights.</p>

<p><b>Blue Origin launch on tap this weekend. </b>Blue Origin plans to launch its <a href="https://bit.ly/3J1Z8Hc">first human spaceflight mission in nearly two years on Sunday</a>. This flight will launch six passengers on a flight to suborbital space more than 60 miles (100 km) over West Texas. Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos's space company, has not flown people to space since a New Shepard rocket failure on an uncrewed research flight in September 2022. The company successfully launched New Shepard on another uncrewed suborbital mission in December.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025077#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025077&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An Arizona woman has been accused of helping generate millions of dollars for North Korea’s ballistic missile program by helping citizens of that country land IT jobs at US-based Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Christina Marie Chapman, 49, of Litchfield Park, Arizona, raised $6.8 million in the scheme, federal prosecutors said in an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1352191/dl">indictment</a> unsealed Thursday. Chapman allegedly funneled the money to North Korea’s Munitions Industry Department, which is involved in key aspects of North Korea’s weapons program, including its development of ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>Part of the alleged scheme involved Chapman and co-conspirators compromising the identities of more than 60 people living in the US and using their personal information to get North Koreans IT jobs across more than 300 US companies.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025081#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025081&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An autopsy report of a Massachusetts teen who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/teens-death-after-eating-a-single-chip-highlights-risks-of-ultra-spicy-foods/">tragically died hours after eating an ultra-spicy tortilla chip</a> suggested that his death was due to the high dose of spice in the chip and a congenital heart defect, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/paqui-spicy-chip-challenge-death-autopsy-f81c220c549ec497bcc626dec4fc2be4">according to reporting by the Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>Harris Wolobah, a previously healthy 14-year-old from Worcester, died September 1, 2023 hours after eating the chip—a 2023 Paqui One Chip Challenge chip—which were sold individually, wrapped in tin foil, and seasoned with two of hottest peppers in the world, the Naga Viper pepper and the Carolina Reaper pepper. Paqui sold the chip with a challenge in which eaters were dared to consume the chip, wait as long as possible before eating or drinking anything, and post the aftermath on social media, where the challenge went viral.</p>
<p>Harris' mother, Lois Wolobah, immediately suspected the chip was involved in his untimely death. At the time, she reportedly said she picked him up from school after getting a call from the nurse. He was clutching his stomach and, about two hours later, lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital, where he died. She reported that he had no known medical conditions at the time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025060#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025060&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
