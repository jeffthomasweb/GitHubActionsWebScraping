                            <![CDATA[<p>KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—The rocket NASA is preparing to send four astronauts on a trip around the Moon will emerge from its assembly building on Florida's Space Coast early Saturday for a slow crawl to its seaside launch pad.</p>
<p>Riding atop one of NASA's diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world's heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours.</p>
<p>The rollout marks a major step for NASA's Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/managers-on-alert-for-launch-fever-as-pressure-builds-for-nasas-moon-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In recent weeks, Rackspace <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/applications/rackspace-email">updated its email hosting pricing</a>. Its standard plan is now $10 per mailbox per month. Businesses can also pay for the Rackspace Email Plus add-on for an extra $2/mailbox/month (for “file storage, mobile sync, Office-compatible apps, and messaging”), and the Archiving add-on for an extra $6/mailbox/month (for unlimited storage).</p>
<p>As recently as November 2025, Rackspace charged $3/mailbox/month for its Standard plan, and an extra $1/mailbox/month for the Email Plus add-on, and an additional $3/mailbox/month for the Archival add-on, according to the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251125191645/https:/www.rackspace.com/applications/rackspace-email">Wayback Machine</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Archaeologists recently found the wreck of an enormous medieval cargo ship lying on the seafloor off the Danish coast, and it reveals new details of medieval trade and life at sea.</p>
<p>Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE.</p>

<h2><b>A medieval megaship</b></h2>
<p>Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/archaeologists-find-a-supersized-medieval-shipwreck-in-denmark/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The operator of WorldCat won a default judgment against Anna's Archive, with a federal judge ruling yesterday that the shadow library must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data.</p>
<p>Anna's Archive is a shadow library and search engine for other shadow libraries that was launched in 2022. It archives books and other written materials and makes them available via torrents, and recently expanded its ambitions by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">scraping Spotify to make a 300TB copy</a> of the most-streamed songs.

<p>Yesterday's ruling is in a case filed by OCLC, a nonprofit that operates the WorldCat library catalog on behalf of member libraries. OCLC alleged that Anna’s Archive “illegally hacked WorldCat.org” to steal 2.2TB of data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-annas-archive-to-delete-scraped-data-no-one-thinks-it-will-comply/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>A generally healthy 63-year-old man in the New England area went to the hospital with a fever, cough, and vision problems in his right eye. His doctors eventually determined that a dreaded hypervirulent bacteria—which is rising globally—was ravaging several of his organs, including his brain.</p>
<p>According to the man, the problems started three weeks before his hospital visit, when he said he ate some bad meat and started vomiting and having diarrhea. Those symptoms faded after about two weeks, but then new problems began—he started coughing and having chills and a fever. His cough only worsened from there.</p>
<p>At the hospital, doctors took X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest and abdomen. The images revealed over 15 nodules and masses in his lungs. But that's not all they found. The imaging also revealed a mass in his liver that was 8.6 cm in diameter (about 3.4 inches). Lab work pointed toward an infection, so doctors admitted him to the hospital and provided oxygen to help with his breathing, as well as antibiotics. But his chills and cough continued.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/01/this-may-be-the-grossest-eye-pic-ever-but-the-cause-is-whats-truly-horrifying/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">announced</a> it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVRHTWWEIz4&amp;t=2267s">described</a> advertising in ChatGPT as a "last resort" and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.</p>
<p>The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/">ChatGPT Go</a> plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.</p>
<p>Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/openai-to-test-ads-in-chatgpt-as-it-burns-through-billions/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Security firm Mandiant has released a database that allows any administrative password protected by Microsoft’s NTLM.v1 hash algorithm to be hacked in an attempt to nudge users who continue using the deprecated function despite known weaknesses.</p>
<p>The database comes in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow table</a>, which is a precomputed table of hash values linked to their corresponding plaintext. These generic tables, which work against multiple hashing schemes, allow hackers to take over accounts by quickly mapping a stolen hash to its password counterpart. NTLMv1 rainbow tables are particularly easy to construct because of NTLMv1’s limited keyspace, meaning the relatively small number of possible passwords the hashing function allows for. NTLMv1 rainbow tables have existed for two decades but typically require large amounts of resources to make any use of them.</p>
<h2>New ammo for security pros</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Mandiant <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/net-ntlmv1-deprecation-rainbow-tables/">said</a> it had <a href="https://research.google/resources/datasets/?dataset_types=other&amp;search=Net-NTLMv1&amp;">released</a> an NTLMv1 rainbow table that will allow defenders and researchers (and, of course, malicious hackers, too) to recover passwords in under 12 hours using consumer hardware costing less than $600 USD. The table is hosted in Google Cloud. The database works against Net-NTLMv1 passwords, which are used in network authentication for accessing resources such as SMB network sharing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/mandiant-releases-rainbow-table-that-cracks-weak-admin-password-in-12-hours/">Read full article</a></p>

Standalone, direct-to-consumer RAM kits were some of the first products to feel the bite, with prices spiking by 300 or 400 percent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/for-just-a-couple-of-months-in-the-middle-of-2025-it-was-an-ok-time-to-build-a-pc/">by the end of 2025</a>; prices for SSDs had also increased noticeably, albeit more modestly.</p>
<p>The rest of 2026 is going to be all about where, how, and to what extent those price spikes flow downstream into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/the-ram-shortages-silver-lining-less-talk-about-ai-pcs/">computers</a>, phones, and other components that use RAM and NAND chips—areas where the existing supply of products and longer-term supply contracts negotiated by big companies have helped keep prices from surging too noticeably so far.</p>
<p>This week, we're seeing signs that the RAM crunch is starting to affect the GPU market—Asus made some waves when it inadvertently <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/110943-rtx-5070-ti-effectively-dead-gpu-market-worse.html">announced</a> that it was discontinuing its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-an-rtx-4080-for-749-at-least-in-theory/">GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/ram-shortage-chaos-expands-to-gpus-high-capacity-ssds-and-even-hard-drives/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The last <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M595/K063/595063475.PDF">approval</a> came from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which allowed the deal in a 5–0 vote yesterday. There were months of negotiations that resulted in requirements to deploy more fiber and wireless infrastructure, offer $20-per-month Internet service to people with low incomes for the next decade, and other commitments, including some designed to replace the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policies that Verizon had to end because of demands by the Trump administration.</p>

<p>TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-cant-keep-china-from-getting-ai-chips-tsmc-suggests/">US-China tensions</a> over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth.</p>
<p>"All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it's starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that," Wei <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4860033-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-tsm-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript">said</a> during the call. "So another question is 'can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?' I'll tell you the truth, I don't know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it's going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/tsmc-says-ai-demand-is-endless-after-record-q4-earnings/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Late last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened yet another investigation into Tesla and its partially automated driver assist systems. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-fsd-gets-worse-at-driving-nhtsa-opens-new-investigation/">This time it was about FSD</a> (again), which has been the subject of more than 60 complaints to the regulator after Teslas operating under FSD either ignored red traffic lights or crossed into oncoming traffic. As part of the preliminary investigation, NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation has asked Tesla for more information on the problem. This week, <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INRE-PE25012-34988.pdf">it told the automaker</a> it could have a five-week extension on its homework.</p>
<p>To be fair to Tesla, <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INIM-PE25012-30897.pdf">NHTSA has asked for a comprehensive amount of information</a>: a list of every Tesla produced and sold or leased in the United States, including whether or not that car had FSD and which version; cumulative data on how many US Teslas have FSD and how often it's used; and a list of all the customer complaints, field reports, incident reports, lawsuits, and other data related to FSD ignoring traffic laws.</p>
<p>For each incident involving a crash, Tesla must give NHTSA a summary of the incident, including "causal and contributing factors." Further questions require information on FSD use by crashed cars; any alert shown to the drivers; what work, simulation, or otherwise Tesla has conducted to ameliorate the problem; any modifications or changes to FSD hardware or software; an explanation of Tesla's theory of operation for traffic lights and stop signs; and Tesla's assessment of the problem.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/feds-give-tesla-another-five-weeks-to-respond-to-fsd-probe/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Retro design and a naturally aspirated V12 deliver tremendous appeal, but it’ll cost ya.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It has been nearly 80 years since Ferrari unleashed its first V12-powered sports car upon the world with the 125 S. In 1947, its debut year, the 125 S secured Ferrari’s first race victory, along with five other wins in the 14 events it competed in that season.</p>
<p>Although it was soon replaced by the 159 S, the success of the 125 S kick-started Ferrari’s storied history of producing some of the most desirable 12-cylinder performance cars known to man. And while the Italian automaker has come to embrace <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/the-2023-ferrari-296-gts-we-drive-ferraris-plug-in-hybrid-convertible/">forced induction and electrification</a> in recent years, its legacy of building stunning front-engine, rear-wheel drive machines with spectacular V12s stuffed into their engine bays continues with the 12Cilindri Spider.</p>
<p>Ferrari hasn’t shied away from leveraging cutting-edge technology in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/everything-we-know-about-ferraris-first-electric-vehicle/">development of its latest models</a>, but the company also understands the value of a good throwback. As the successor to the 812 Superfast, the 12Cilindri boasts clever performance technologies, like a sophisticated active aero system and a four-wheel steering system that can manage each corner independently to enhance response, but it’s ultimately an homage to the heady days of late '60s luxury grand touring. The exterior styling takes obvious inspiration from the 365 GTB Daytona, while its lack of all-wheel drive, turbocharging, and electric assistance bucks trends that have become nearly inescapable in modern performance cars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/driven-the-ferrari-12cilindri-spider-is-open-top-grand-touring-bliss/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.25 of the Rocket Report! All eyes are on Florida this weekend as NASA rolls out the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to its launch site in Florida for the Artemis II mission. NASA has not announced a launch date yet, and this will depend in part on how well a "wet dress rehearsal" goes with fueling the rocket. However, it is likely the rocket has a no-earlier-than launch date of February 8. Our own Stephen Clark will be in Florida for the rollout on Saturday, so be sure and check back here for coverage.</p>

<p><strong>MaiaSpace scores a major launch deal</strong>. The ArianeGroup subsidiary, created in 2022, has inked a major new launch contract with satellite operator Eutelsat, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2026/01/15/la-nouvelle-fusee-francaise-maia-securise-son-plan-de-vol-grace-a-la-constellation-d-eutelsat_6662406_3234.html">Le Monde reports</a>. A significant portion of the 440 new satellites ordered by Eutelsat from Airbus to renew or expand its OneWeb constellation will be launched into orbit by the new Maia rocket. MaiaSpace previously signed two contracts: one with Exotrail for the launch of an orbital transfer, and the other for two satellites for the Toutatis mission, a defense system developed by U-Space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/rocket-report-ariane-64-to-debut-soon-india-has-a-falcon-9-clone-too/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Pharmaceutical executives are finally saying how they really feel about the extreme anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been ruthlessly implementing—and it's not pretty.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-14/drugmakers-vent-vaccine-anger-during-jpmorgan-health-conference">reporting from Bloomberg</a> at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference that ended today in San Francisco, pharmaceutical executives who had previously been careful to avoid criticizing the Trump administration appear to have reached a breaking point, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla offering some of the most candid comments.</p>
<p>"I am very annoyed. I'm very disappointed. I'm seriously frustrated," Bourla said. "What is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda which is political, and then antivax."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/big-pharma-is-openly-railing-against-rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-agenda/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The New York Times has published new details about a purported cyberattack that unnamed US officials claim plunged parts of Venezuela into darkness in the lead-up to the capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p>Key among the new details is that the cyber operation was able to turn off electricity for most residents in the capital city of Caracas for only a few minutes, though in some neighborhoods close to the military base where Maduro was seized, the outage lasted for three days. The cyber-op also targeted Venezuelan military radar defenses. The paper said the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Cyber_Command">US Cyber Command</a> was involved.</p>
<h2>Got more details?</h2>
<p>“Turning off the power in Caracas and interfering with radar allowed US military helicopters to move into the country undetected on their mission to capture Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president who has now been brought to the United States to face drug charges,” the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/us/politics/cyberattack-venezuela-military.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ElA.iDRW.2t0IQViABMN5&amp;smid=url-share">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/unnamed-officials-tell-nyt-precise-cyber-op-took-out-venezuelas-power-grid/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth"><em>This post contains some mild spoilers, mostly from the beginning of the first episode.</em></aside>
<p>Today is a good day to watch television. That's because the first two episodes of <em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em> hit the Paramount+ streaming service, becoming the newest addition to the long-running Star Trek franchise. It's set in the late 32nd century, 120 years after the burn that ended all warp travel, and with it, most of Starfleet in the process. Now that warp travel is once again possible—you'll have to watch <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/star-trek-discovery/">Discovery's</a></em> final three seasons for more on that—the Federation is putting itself back together, and that includes reopening Starfleet Academy.</p>
<p>That means this show is about young people in space, like Caleb Mir (Sandro Rosta), who was separated from his mother by Starfleet as a child, 15 years earlier. Mir and his mother, played by Tatiana Maslany, were traveling with a pirate—Nus Braka, played by a scenery-chewing Paul Giamatti—who killed a Federation officer while stealing food for them. The first episode opens on Braka and the Mirs being apprehended by Starfleet. Despite her misgivings, Captain Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter) carries out her order to separate mother and child. She's to go to a rehabilitation colony, he's to become a ward of the Federation and go to school on Bajor.</p>
<p>At least that's the plan until he escapes a few minutes later. Then we jump forward 15 years. Ake is teaching on Bajor, having retired from the Federation, ashamed of what she'd done. Admiral Vance (Oded Fehr) shows up and asks her to become commandant at the newly reopened academy in San Francisco; for the past few decades, new recruits have been trained instead by the War College. But Starfleet needs explorers now, and having a rival school means they can show up at some point to challenge some of the show's protagonists to a Parrises Squares tournament.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/star-trek-starfleet-academy-tries-something-different-and-i-dont-hate-it/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The early homecoming culminated in an on-target splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at 12:41 am PST (08:41 UTC) inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The splashdown occurred minutes after the Dragon capsule streaked through the atmosphere along the California coastline, with sightings of Dragon's fiery trail reported from San Francisco to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Four parachutes opened to slow the capsule for the final descent. Zena Cardman, NASA's commander of the Crew-11 mission, radioed SpaceX mission control moments after splashdown: "It feels good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams who got us there and back."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-first-ever-medical-evacuation-from-space-ends-with-on-target-splashdown/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is once again being accused of failing to do enough to prevent ChatGPT from encouraging suicides, even after a series of safety updates were made to a controversial model, 4o, which OpenAI designed to feel like a user's closest confidant.</p>
<p>It's now been revealed that one of the most shocking ChatGPT-linked suicides happened shortly after Sam Altman claimed on X that ChatGPT 4o was safe. OpenAI had "been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues" associated with ChatGPT use, Altman claimed in October, hoping to alleviate concerns after ChatGPT <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">became a "suicide coach"</a> for a vulnerable teenager named Adam Raine, the family's lawsuit said.</p>
