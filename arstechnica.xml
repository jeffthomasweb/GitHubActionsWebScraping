<p>The H5N1 bird flu appears to be stampeding through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/bird-flu-reaches-cows-in-california-the-countrys-largest-milk-producer/">dairy farms in California</a>, the country's largest milk producer. Over the weekend, the total number of confirmed infected cow herds stunningly doubled, going from <a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal_Health/HPAI.html">17 last Thursday</a> to <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">34 Monday morning</a>, according to state and federal officials.</p>
<p>With the new tally, California now ranks second among all affected states for having the most herds with avian influenza. Only Colorado, which has adopted bulk milk-tank surveillance, has more, with 64 herds confirmed. California's high ranking is despite the fact that it only reported its first three infected herds on August 30, while the dairy outbreak was first confirmed on March 25 and thought to have begun late last year.</p>
<p>To date, 232 herds in 14 states have been infected with the bird flu.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051926#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051926&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman outlined his vision for an AI-driven future of tech progress and global prosperity in a new personal blog post titled "<a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/">The Intelligence Age</a>." The essay paints a picture of human advancement accelerated by AI, with Altman suggesting that superintelligent AI could emerge within the next decade.</p>

<p>"It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there," he wrote.</p>
<p>OpenAI's current goal is to <a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/">create AGI</a> (artificial general intelligence), which is a term for hypothetical technology that could match human intelligence in performing many tasks without the need for specific training. In contrast, superintelligence surpasses AGI, and it could be seen as a hypothetical level of machine intelligence that can dramatically outperform humans at any intellectual task, perhaps even to an unfathomable degree.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051754#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051754&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Late last week, Russia's military planned to launch a Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on a test flight from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Imagery from commercial satellites captured over the weekend suggest the missile exploded before or during launch.</p>
<p>This is at least the second time an RS-28 Sarmat missile has failed in less than two years, dealing a blow to the country's nuclear forces days after the head of the Russian legislature issued a veiled threat to use the missile against Europe if Western allies approved Ukraine's use of long-range weapons against Russia.</p>
<p>Commercial satellite imagery collected by Maxar and Planet show before-and-after views of the Sarmat missile silo at Plesetsk, a military base about 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of Moscow. The view from one of Maxar's imaging satellites Saturday revealed unmistakable damage at the launch site, with a large crater centered on the opening to the underground silo.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051740#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051740&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Five years ago, researchers made a grim discovery—a legitimate Android app in the Google Play market that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/google-play-app-with-100-million-downloads-executed-secret-payloads/">surreptitiously made malicious</a> by a library the developers used to earn advertising revenue. With that, the app was infected with code that caused 100 million infected devices to connect to attacker-controlled servers and download secret payloads.</p>
<p>Now, history is repeating itself. Researchers from the same Moscow, Russia-based security firm <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/necro-infects-android-users/52201/">reported Monday</a> that they found two new apps, downloaded from Play 11 million times, that were infected with the same malware family. The researchers, from Kaspersky, believe a malicious software developer kit for integrating advertising capabilities is once again responsible.</p>
<h2>Clever tradecraft</h2>
<p>Software developer kits, better known as SDKs, are apps that provide developers with frameworks that can greatly speed up the app-creation process by streamlining repetitive tasks. An unverified SDK module incorporated into the apps ostensibly supported the display of ads. Behind the scenes, it provided a host of advanced methods for stealthy communication with malicious servers, where the apps would upload user data and download malicious code that could be executed and updated at any time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051854#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051854&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2024/cloudflare-helps-content-creators-regain-control-of-content-from-ai/">announced</a> new tools Monday that it claims will help end the era of endless AI scraping by giving all sites on its network the power to block bots in one click.</p>
<p>That will help stop the firehose of unrestricted AI scraping, but, perhaps even more intriguing to content creators everywhere, Cloudflare says it will also make it easier to identify which content that bots scan most, so that sites can eventually wall off access and charge bots to scrape their most valuable content. To pave the way for that future, Cloudflare is also creating a marketplace for all sites to negotiate content deals based on more granular AI audits of their sites.</p>
<p>These tools, Cloudflare's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2024/cloudflare-helps-content-creators-regain-control-of-content-from-ai/">blog</a> said, give content creators "for the first time" ways "to quickly and easily understand how AI model providers are using their content, and then take control of whether and how the models are able to access it."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051732#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051732&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>This past weekend, I said goodbye to Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 6 design after 10 long years.</p>
<p>It started with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/iphone-6-and-6-plus-in-deep-with-apples-thinnest-phones/">the iPhone 6 itself</a> in 2014, a long-awaited screen size upgrade for the iPhone (<a href="https://marco.org/2011/10/08/iphone-screen-size">some of</a> the 2011-era Apple punditry insisting that 3.5 inches was the functionally perfect size for a phone screen and that Apple would <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/10/thoughts_and_observations_iphone_4s">never, ever change it</a>, is an interesting time capsule). It ends with my wife’s third-generation iPhone SE, its battery capacity already collapsing, which I replaced with an iPhone 16 on Friday.</p>

<p>There are huge differences between those two phones—eight years’ worth of spec upgrades and water resistance being the most significant—but they look and feel almost the same, and things that were fine or forgivable in 2014 have become harder to live with now.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051832#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051832&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Electrification is moving through different parts of the automotive industry at different speeds. And soon, it will be time for the recreational vehicle segment to start adding batteries and electric motors. Today, Thor Industries revealed a new hybrid class A motorhome that demos a new hybrid electric powertrain <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/how-harbinger-is-building-commercial-evs-with-20-year-life-spans/">from Harbinger</a>.</p>
<p>"Electrification will play a central role in the future of mobility, including RVing," said Thor Industries President and CEO Bob Martin. "This first-of-its-kind hybrid platform and our ongoing collaboration with Harbinger are reinforcing Thor's leadership in this segment and creating major points of product differentiation for our family of companies."</p>
<p>Thor and Harbinger have been working together for a while now—in March <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/harbinger-delivers-first-customer-electric-truck-chassis-to-rv-maker-thor/">Thor took delivery</a> of a medium-duty EV chassis from Harbinger. But the battery EV RV will only have a range of about 250 miles on a single charge. By comparison, the two companies say that the hybrid RV should have a range of twice that—500 miles—courtesy of a 140 kWh lithium-ion traction battery and a gasoline-powered range extender.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051838#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051838&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hardware hacker Dmitry Grinberg recently achieved what might sound impossible: <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=35.%20Linux4004">booting Linux on the Intel 4004</a>, the world's first commercial microprocessor. With just 2,300 transistors and an original clock speed of 740 kHz, the 1971 CPU is incredibly primitive by modern standards. And it's slow—it takes about 4.76 days for the Linux kernel to boot.</p>

<p>Initially designed for a Japanese calculator called the Busicom 141-PF, the 4-bit 4004 <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2011/11/15/intel-4004/index.html">found limited use</a> in commercial products of the 1970s before being superseded by more powerful Intel chips, such as the 8008 and 8080 that powered early personal computers—and then the <a href="https://stevemorse.org/pcw40.html">8086</a> and 8088 that launched the IBM PC era.</p>
<p>If you're skeptical that this feat is possible with a raw 4004, you're right: The 4004 itself is far too limited to run Linux directly. Instead, Grinberg created a solution that is equally impressive: an emulator that runs on the 4004 and emulates a MIPS R3000 processor—the architecture used in the <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/DECstation_2100">DECstation 2100</a> workstation that Linux was originally ported to. This emulator, along with minimal hardware emulation, allows a stripped-down Debian Linux to boot to a command prompt.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051764#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051764&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In May, Sonos updated its mobile app—to the dismay of many users. With missing features and bugs, customers complained about a loss of functionality and hardware not working the way it should. As Sonos deals with the expensive repercussions, a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-23/how-sonos-botched-an-app-and-infuriated-its-customers">Bloomberg</a> today highlights how Sonos allowed the release of an update so buggy and incomplete as to overturn its goodwill with long-standing customers.</p>
<p>Illustrating how poorly this app update has gone, last month<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/pained-by-having-let-you-down-sonos-apologizes-for-app-failures/">,</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/pained-by-having-let-you-down-sonos-apologizes-for-app-failures/">Sonos CEO</a> Patrick Spence said the company would spend <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/app-redesign-blowback-will-cost-sonos-up-to-30-million-ceo-says/">$20 million to $30 million</a> in the short term to get the app where it needs to be (which is, basically, functioning as well as the predecessor) and rebuild customer and partner trust. Sonos also expects to miss its annual revenue target by $200 million. This is partially due to its delay of two hardware releases to focus on the app. Bloomberg noted that “Sonos shares are down 25% this year.” Annual bonuses and merit-based raises have also reportedly been canceled.</p>
<h2>Outdated code</h2>
<p>One reason for the app’s failure is the outdated code and infrastructure that the prior app was running on. Anonymous employees Bloomberg spoke with claimed that the Sonos app’s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/technical-debt">technical debt</a> had been building up for 20 years before the update.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051728#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051728&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

We've got a shiny new trailer for <em>Gladiator II</em>. </p></div>
<p>When the first trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_II"><em>Gladiator II</em></a> dropped in early July, it racked up more than 180 million views in its first 48 hours, so clearly there's an audience for Ridley Scott's long-awaited sequel to his 2000 blockbuster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_(2000_film)"><em>Gladiator</em></a>. And no wonder; as I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/its-another-bloody-power-struggle-for-romes-future-in-gladiator-ii-trailer/">noted at the time</a>, the film "promises to be just as much of a visual feast, as a new crop of power players (plus a couple of familiar faces) clash over the future of Rome." We've now got a shiny new trailer, and I stand by that initial assessment—especially since this trailer confirms what had previously been hinted about the protagonist's biological father.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for <em>Gladiator</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Gladiator II</em> centers around Lucius Verus (Paul Mescal), son of Lucilla and former heir to the Roman Empire, given that his father (also named Lucius Verus) was once a co-emperor of Rome. Lucius hasn't been seen in Rome for 15 years. Instead, he has been living in a small coastal town in Numidia with his wife and child. Like Maximus before him, he is captured by the Roman army and forced to become a gladiator after the death of his family. Per the official premise:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051654#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051654&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Studios has dropped an extended teaser trailer for the final feature film in its Phase Six slate: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolts*"><em>Thunderbolts*</em></a>, now with a mysterious asterisk to the title. The studio has touted the film as having a different tone from other recent MCU offerings—thanks in part to hiring "a crew of indie veterans who sold out" to make the film—and judging from the teaser, it looks like they just might deliver on that.</p>

<p>Elon Musk is apparently conceding defeat in his fight with Brazil Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes, as the X social platform has started complying with the judge's demands in an attempt to get the service un-blocked in the country.</p>
<p>X previously refused to suspend dozens of accounts accused of spreading disinformation. Internet service providers have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/starlink-reluctantly-blocks-x-in-brazil-vows-to-keep-fighting-asset-freeze/">blocking X</a> under orders from the government since early September, and De Moraes seized $2 million from a Starlink bank account and $1.3 million from an X account to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/brazil-judge-seizes-cash-from-starlink-to-cover-fine-imposed-on-elon-musks-x/">collect on fines</a> issued to X.</p>
<p>X has <a href="https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1829296715989414281">claimed</a> the orders violate Brazil's own laws.

<p>As someone who has been following the growth of generative AI for a while now, I know that the technology <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/gmails-ai-powered-email-summaries-can-dig-through-your-inbox-for-you/">can be pretty good</a> (if <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/australian-government-trial-finds-ai-is-much-worse-than-humans-at-summarizing/">not quite human-level</a>) at quickly summarizing complex documents into a more digestible form. But I still wasn't prepared for how disarmingly compelling it would be to listen to <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">Google's NotebookLM</a> condense <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">my recent book about <em>Minesweeper</em></a> into a tight, 12.5-minute, podcast-style conversation between two people who don't exist.</p>
<p>There are still enough notable issues with NotebookLM's audio output to prevent it from fully replacing professional podcasters any time soon. Even so, the podcast-like format is an incredibly engaging and endearing way to take in complex information and points to a much more personable future for generative AI than the dry back-and-forth of a text-based chatbot.</p>

<p>Since reports emerged earlier this year that dairy cows across the country had been infected with H5N1 bird flu, the prospect that the virus could evolve to spark another pandemic has stoked <a href="https://undark.org/2024/07/22/avian-flu-actual-mortality-rate/">serious concern</a>.</p>
<p>But unlike COVID-19, the flu is an old, well-known foe. And health authorities have reassured the public that the US has squirreled away millions of doses of the flu medication oseltamivir, known under the brand name Tamiflu. As health policy expert Leana S. Wen wrote in a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/23/bird-flu-h5n1-plan-pandemic/">opinion piece</a>, the drug “works against seasonal flu and is expected to work well against H5N1.”</p>
<p>While oseltamivir may help in cases of severe flu, some experts are concerned that the US is banking far too much on a so-so drug while failing to prioritize research on new treatments.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051670#p3">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051670&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US government is readying its latest measure to defend local automotive manufacturing. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/biden-set-to-levy-100-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-this-week/">In May</a>, US President Joe Biden levied new 100 percent tariffs targeted at specific Chinese automakers. Now, the US Commerce Department is set to enact a <em>de facto</em> ban on most Chinese vehicles, by prohibiting Chinese connected car software and hardware from operating on US roads, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-proposes-banning-chinese-vehicles-us-roads-with-software-crackdown-2024-09-23/">according to Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The rationale? National security concerns. "When foreign adversaries build software to make a vehicle [connected], that means it can be used for surveillance, can be remotely controlled, which threatens the privacy and safety of Americans on the road," said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.</p>
<p>"In an extreme situation, a foreign adversary could shut down or take control of all their vehicles operating in the United States all at the same time, causing crashes, blocking roads," said Secretary Raimondo, a scenario we saw depicted in <em>Fate of the Furious</em> (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/04/fate-of-the-furious-may-be-fun-but-it-made-my-brain-hurt/">where it caused me a headache</a>), as well as more recently (<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/701948/tesla-netflix-upstream-cybersecurity/">and to better effect</a>) in <em>Leave the World Behind</em>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051655#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051655&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Chinese space startup conducted what it called a "high-altitude" test flight of its Nebula-1 rocket on Sunday, launching the vehicle to an altitude of about 5 km or so before attempting to land it back at the Ejin Banner Spaceport in Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>The test flight went well for about two and a half minutes before the vehicle experienced a problem just before landing and erupted into a fireball.</p>
<p>This is not the first vertical rocket landing test by a Chinese company, but what sets Deep Blue Aerospace apart from its competitors is its transparency. Within hours the company released <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jwYBZ1tlt9AcgtW2eG3gOg">a detailed statement</a> about the test flight, its objectives, and a preliminary review of what went wrong.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051630#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051630&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tandem OLED has been around for years, but Apple made the technology feel new and shiny when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/new-ipad-pros-are-the-thinnest-apple-device-ever-feature-dual-oled-screens/">announced</a> that the screen in its first ever OLED-based iPad would use a tandem structure.</p>
<p>Other consumer gadgets, like laptops and phones, are also slowly starting to incorporate Tandem OLED displays. So we thought it's a good time to look at how Tandem OLED is used, what benefits it's delivering, and how the technology could impact future devices and compete against other emerging display technologies, like MicroLED and QDEL.</p>
<h2>OLED TVs, monitors already use different kinds of tandem stacks</h2>
<p>We won’t go too deep into the technical details of Tandem OLED in this article (interested readers can reference this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3moprE5S3Qc">handy breakdown</a>, which also includes information on current technical obstacles, like light-extraction inefficiencies). But if you're new to Tandem OLED, here’s a brief look at what makes it so interesting for tech gadgets.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041081#p3">Read 52 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041081&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A pleasant female voice greets me over the phone. “Hi, I’m an assistant named Jasmine for Bodega,” the voice says. “How can I help?”</p>
<p>“Do you have patio seating,” I ask. Jasmine sounds a little sad as she tells me that unfortunately, the San Francisco–based Vietnamese restaurant doesn't have outdoor seating. But her sadness isn’t the result of her having a bad day. Rather, her tone is a feature, a setting.</p>
<p>Jasmine is a member of a new, growing clan: the AI voice restaurant host. If you recently called up a restaurant in New York City, Miami, Atlanta, or San Francisco, chances are you have spoken to one of Jasmine’s polite, calculated competitors.  </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051613#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051613&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Our planet is choking on plastics. Some of the worst offenders, which can take decades to degrade in landfills, are polypropylene—which is used for things such as food packaging and bumpers—and polyethylene, found in plastic bags, bottles, toys, and even mulch.</p>
<p>Polypropylene and polyethylene can be recycled, but the process can be difficult and often produces large quantities of the greenhouse gas methane. They are both polyolefins, which are the products of polymerizing ethylene and propylene, raw materials that are mainly derived from fossil fuels. The bonds of polyolefins are also notoriously hard to break.</p>
<p>Now, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have come up with a method of recycling these polymers that uses catalysts that easily break their bonds, converting them into propylene and isobutylene, which are gases at room temperature. Those gases can then be recycled into new plastics.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051605#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051605&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If the past five years of EU tech rules could take human form, they would embody <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/thierry-breton-eu-commissioner/">Thierry Breton</a>. The bombastic commissioner, with his swoop of white hair, became the public face of Brussels’ irritation with American tech giants, touring Silicon Valley last summer to personally remind the industry of looming regulatory deadlines.</p>
<p>Combative and outspoken, Breton warned that Apple had spent too long “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-hits-a-major-roadblock-as-eu-targets-app-store/">squeezing</a>” other companies out of the market. In a case against TikTok, he emphasized, “our children <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-faces-fresh-probe-over-addictive-effect-on-kids/">are not guinea pigs</a> for social media.”  </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>
<p>His confrontational attitude to the CEOs themselves was visible in his posts on X. In the lead-up to Musk’s interview with Donald Trump, Breton posted a vague but threatening <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1823033048109367549">letter</a> on his account reminding Musk there would be consequences if he used his platform to amplify “harmful content.” Last year, he published a photo <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1672361958262153219">with Mark Zuckerberg</a>, declaring a new EU motto of “move fast to fix things”—a jibe at the notorious early Facebook <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512034517/d287954ds1.htm">slogan</a>. And in a 2023 meeting with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Breton <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-12/zuckerberg-musk-didn-t-think-eu-legislators-could-regulate-them-is-that-changi">reportedly</a> got him to agree to an “AI pact” on the spot, before <a href="https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1661362714030092289">tweeting the agreement</a>, making it difficult for Pichai to back out.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051513#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051513&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
