<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last week, a hobbyist experimenting with the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/">Flux</a> AI image synthesis model <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ex0yg1/now_that_we_have_flux_it_is_possible_to_train/">discovered</a> that it's unexpectedly good at rendering custom-trained reproductions of typefaces. While far more efficient methods of displaying computer fonts have existed for decades, the new technique is useful for AI image hobbyists because Flux is capable of rendering depictions of accurate text, and users can now directly insert words rendered in custom fonts into AI image generations.</p>

<p>We've had the technology to accurately produce smooth computer-rendered fonts in custom shapes since the 1980s (1970s in the research space), so creating an AI-replicated font isn't big news by itself. But a new technique means you could see a particular font appear in AI-generated images, say, of a chalkboard menu at a photorealistic restaurant or a printed business card being held by a cyborg fox.</p>
<p>Shortly after the emergence of mainstream AI image synthesis models like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a> in 2022, some people began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/10iixwp/anyway_to_create_an_image_of_a_person_wearing/">wondering</a>: How can I insert my own product, clothing item, character, or style into an AI-generated image? One answer that emerged came in the form of LoRA (low-rank adaptation), a technique <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">discovered</a> in 2021 that allows users to augment knowledge in an AI base model with modular add-ons that have been custom-trained.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045327#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045327&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's more bad news for the company behind an experimental MDMA therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, which the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/mdma-for-ptsd-three-studies-retracted-on-heels-of-fda-rejection/">roundly rejected earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/fda-widens-probe-of-ecstasy-based-drug-studies-510307b0">a report from The Wall Street Journal</a>, the FDA is now expanding an investigation into clinical trials behind the experimental psychedelic therapy—even though the agency has already rejected it. Agency investigators reportedly interviewed four additional people last week, asking questions regarding whether the trials underreported side effects.</p>
<p>People involved in the trial have previously alleged, among other things, that ill effects, such as suicidal thoughts, went undocumented, and trial participants were discouraged from reporting them to bolster the chances of FDA approval. Overall, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/">the MDMA trials faced crushing criticism</a> amid the FDA's review, with outside experts and agency advisors calling out allegations of sexual misconduct at one trial site, as well as flaws in overall trial designs, multiple sources of biases, and claims of that the company behind the therapy, Lykos, fostered a cult-like belief in psychedelics.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045406#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045406&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Samsung will provide operating system updates for its newer TVs for at least seven years, the company announced last week. The updates will first apply to some TVs released in 2023 and TVs released in March 2024.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=223535">Business Korea</a>, Samsung made the announcement regarding the Tizen OS at the Digital Research Lab of Samsung Electronics' Suwon Campus in Gyeonggi Province. As spotted by <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1724665225">FlatPanelsHD</a>, the announcement follows previously announced plans from Samsung to provide <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/the-galaxy-s24-gets-seven-years-of-updates-1300-titanium-ultra-model/">seven years of software updates for the Galaxy S24</a> smartphone series.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/electronics/newsView/ked202408230003">Korea Economic Daily</a>, speaking at last week's event, Samsung Electronics' president of the Visual Display Business Division, Yoon Seok-Yoon, said: "With the seven-year free upgrade of Tizen applied to AI TVs, we will widen the gap in market share with Chinese companies."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045367#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045367&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you read Ars Technica regularly, you've known <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/leaks-from-valves-deadlock-look-like-a-pressed-sandwich-of-every-game-around/">since May</a> that Valve is working on <em>Deadlock</em>, a mishmash of genres that has been slowly amassing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max">SteamDB-tracked players</a> through an invite-only playtest. Over the weekend, Valve took the "hiding" part out of that "hiding-in-plain-sight" test, launching <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/?curator_clanid=4777282">a bare bones Steam page for <em>Deadlock</em></a>, the company's first attempt at developing a new gaming franchise since collectible card game <em>Artifact</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/exclusive-valve-walks-us-through-artifacts-new-demo-leaves-us-wanting-more/">launched in 2018</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/valve-scraps-revamped-artifact-dumps-free-unfinished-2-0-version-on-steam/">fell apart in 2021</a>).</p>
<p>The new page, which went up on Saturday, has precious little information about <em>Deadlock</em>, save for a description as "a multiplayer game in early development" and a 22-second trailer that essentially pans over a piece of concept art. Everything from the game's system requirements to the release date is still "TBD," and players who are lucky enough to get "friend invites via our playtesters" are promised "temporary art and experimental gameplay" on the Steam page.</p>
<p>Not that a Steam page is strictly needed for more info on <em>Deadlock</em> at this point. Since the first leaks months ago, the playtest has slowly expanded from hundreds of players to tens of thousands, including some who have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">posted extensive impressions</a> of the game. Valve has also reportedly lifted rules regarding streaming for invited playtesters, leading to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/deadlock-1">a surge of players showing off live gameplay on Twitch</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045368#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045368&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A federal judge ordered Missouri's attorney general to halt an investigation into Media Matters for America, a nonprofit journalism organization that earned Elon Musk's wrath when it published an <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle">article</a> showing that Musk's X platform placed advertisements next to pro-Nazi posts.</p>
<p>In March, Missouri AG Andrew Bailey <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/missouri-ag-sues-media-matters-in-lawsuit-echoing-elon-musks-complaints/">issued an investigative demand</a> seeking names and addresses of all Media Matters donors who live in Missouri and a range of internal communications and documents regarding the group's research on Musk and X. Bailey also filed a lawsuit asking Cole County Circuit Court for an order to enforce the investigative demand.</p>
<p>Media Matters countered by suing Bailey in US District Court for the District of Columbia. Last week, US District Judge Amit Mehta granted a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.263967/gov.uscourts.dcd.263967.70.0.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> that prohibits Bailey from enforcing the civil investigative demand and from pursuing the related lawsuit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045340#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045340&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX is set to launch the 14th crewed flight on its Dragon spacecraft early on Tuesday morning—and it's an intriguing one.</p>
<p>This Polaris Dawn mission, helmed and funded by an entrepreneur and billionaire named Jared Isaacman, is scheduled to lift off at 3:38 am ET (07:38 UTC) on Tuesday from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>This is just the second free-flying Crew Dragon mission that SpaceX has flown, and like the Inspiration4 mission that came before it, Polaris Dawn will once again field an entire crew of private astronauts. Although this is a private spaceflight, it really is not a space tourism mission. Rather, it seeks to push the ball of exploration forward. Isaacman has emerged as one of the most serious figures in commercial spaceflight in recent years, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fly into space and push forward the boundaries of what private citizens can do in space.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045232#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045232&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Such was the case for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Gregory_Thompson">Tommy Thompson</a>, an American treasure hunter who famously beat the odds to discover the location of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Central_America">SS <em>Central America</em> shipwreck</a> in 1988. It had been dubbed the "Ship of Gold" since it sank in 1857 laden with 30,000 pounds of gold bars and coins—collectively worth enough money to have some impact on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1857">Panic of 1857</a> financial crisis.</p>
<p>Thompson and his team recovered significant amounts of gold and artifacts to great fanfare, with experts at the time suggesting the trove could be worth as much as $400 million. The euphoria proved short-lived. Thirty-nine insurance companies filed lawsuits, claiming the gold was rightfully theirs since the companies had paid damages for the lost gold back in the mid-19th century. Thompson eventually prevailed in 1996, when courts awarded him and his discovery team 92 percent of the gold they'd recovered.</p>
<p>But actually realizing profits from the gold proved challenging; In the end, Thompson sold the gold for just $52 million, almost all of which went to pay off the massive debt the project had accumulated over the ensuing years. So naturally, there were more lawsuits, this time from the investors who had financed Thompson's expedition, accusing him of fraud. Thompson didn't help his case when he went on the run in 2012 with his assistant, living off some $4 million in assets stashed in an offshore account.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044740#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044740&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple's next product announcement event is happening on September 9 at 1 pm ET, the company announced today. While most of Apple’s products are updated irregularly, Apple has reliably launched next-generation iPhones every September <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/09/long-awaited-iphone-5-finally-debuts/">since the iPhone 5 was announced</a> in 2012. This year, we expect new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.</p>
<p>The most reliable rumors about Apple's next-gen iPhones (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">gathered here by MacRumors</a> for your convenience) point to mostly iterative improvements to the current versions: marginally larger screens for the Pro phones, an Action Button and a rearranged camera bump for the non-Pro phones, and improved processors for each. Notably, both phones should be compatible with the first wave of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/">Apple Intelligence AI features</a>; as of this writing, the iPhone 15 Pro is the only iPhone that will support Apple Intelligence when it launches.</p>

<p>Apple also usually announces new Apple Watches at its September events. Updated Apple TV boxes are also occasionally unveiled, though Apple’s streaming box is updated more sporadically than most of its other products. We’re also due to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/report-apple-plans-mini-er-mac-mini-its-first-design-update-in-14-years/">the first wave of M4 Macs</a> at some point soon, including refreshed MacBook Pros and a newly redesigned Mac mini. But Apple often holds Mac launches for a separate event <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/new-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-add-m3-chips-plus-a-1599-entry-level-model/">sometime in October</a> or November, so don’t be surprised if the Mac goes unmentioned on September 9.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045240#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045240&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While solar power is growing at an extremely rapid clip, in absolute terms, the use of natural gas for electricity production has continued to outpace renewables. But that looks set to change in 2024, as the US Energy Information Agency (EIA) has <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62864">run the numbers</a> on the first half of the year and found that wind, solar, and batteries were each installed at a pace that dwarfs new natural gas generators. And the gap is expected to get dramatically larger before the year is over.</p>
<h2>Solar, batteries booming</h2>
<p>According to the EIA's numbers, about 20 GW of new capacity was added in the first half of this year, and solar accounts for 60 percent of it. Over a third of the solar additions occurred in just two states, Texas and Florida. There were two projects that went live that were rated at over 600 MW of capacity, one in Texas, the other in Nevada.</p>
<p>Next up is batteries: The US saw 4.2 additional gigawatts of battery capacity during this period, meaning over 20 percent of the total new capacity. (Batteries are treated as the equivalent of a generating source by the EIA since they can dispatch electricity to the grid on demand, even if they can't do so continuously.) Texas and California alone accounted for over 60 percent of these additions; throw in Arizona and Nevada, and you're at 93 percent of the installed capacity.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045242#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045242&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Jumping into a new car from the driver's seat of something built before 2010 can cause quite the case of future shock. Over that time, automakers have been on a technology frenzy, loading up new vehicles with all manner of gizmos, gadgets, and features, some meant to make your life easier, others to make your journey safer. But do car buyers actually want all this stuff? A new survey by JD Power suggests they may not.</p>
<p>With enough time, a new convenience feature just becomes something buyers expect to be there. Starter motors replaced hand cranks for a reason, and I imagine most modern motorists would prefer not to deal with manual chokes. Manual window winders became more expensive and heavier than electric ones, leading to their extinction.</p>
<p>Some of the technology creep has come about by regulation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/automatic-emergency-braking-should-become-mandatory-feds-say/">or the threat of it</a>. While many bemoan the "iPad on the dash," the legal requirement for a backup camera means there needs to be a screen in the car to display that feed. Steering wheels and dashboards grew to conceal airbags. And now vehicle fascias conceal sensors that can alert the driver or stop the car in the event of an imminent head-on crash.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045227#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045227&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ikea is taking on the likes of eBay, Craigslist, and Gumtree with a peer-to-peer marketplace for customers to sell secondhand furniture to each other.</p>
<p>Ikea Preowned will be tested in Madrid and Oslo until the end of the year with the aim of rolling out the buying and selling platform globally, according to Jesper Brodin, chief executive of Ingka, the main operator of Ikea stores.</p>
<p>“This has been a dream in the making for a while,” Brodin told the Financial Times. “We are in a place in Ikea where we can do more advanced and cool stuff.

<p>Last week, Microsoft mentioned <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-configuration-tools-in-windows-f8a49657-b038-43b8-82d3-28bea0c5666b">in a support document</a> that it was formally deprecating Windows' 39-year-old Control Panel applets. But following widespread reporting of the change, Microsoft has either backtracked or clarified its language to remove the note about Control Panel being deprecated in favor of the Settings app. Here's what the original post said, as also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240822093623/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-configuration-tools-in-windows-f8a49657-b038-43b8-82d3-28bea0c5666b">preserved by the Internet Wayback Machine</a> (emphasis ours):</p>
<p>"The Control Panel is a feature that's been part of Windows for a long time. It provides a centralized location to view and manipulate system settings and controls," the support page explains. "Through a series of applets, you can adjust various options ranging from system time and date to hardware settings, network configurations, and more. <strong>The Control Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience.</strong>"</p>

<p>The current version of the page has changed that last sentence considerably. It now says that "<strong>many of the settings in Control Panel are in the process of being migrated to the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience</strong>."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045029#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045029&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ten years ago next month, NASA announced that Boeing, one of the agency's most experienced contractors, won the lion's share of government money available to end the agency's sole reliance on Russia to ferry its astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>At the time, Boeing won $4.2 billion from NASA to complete the development of the Starliner spacecraft and fly a minimum of two, and potentially up to six, operational crew flights to rotate crews between Earth and the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX won a $2.6 billion contract for essentially the same scope of work.</p>
<p>A decade later, the Starliner program finds itself at a crossroads after Boeing learned it will not complete the spacecraft's first Crew Flight Test with astronauts onboard. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/">NASA formally decided Saturday</a> that Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who launched on the Starliner capsule on June 5, will instead return to Earth in a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Put simply, NASA isn't confident enough in Boeing's spacecraft after it suffered multiple thruster failures and helium leaks on the way to the ISS.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045136#p3">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045136&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Late this afternoon at a Parisian airport, French authorities detained Pavel Durov, the founder of the Telegram messaging/publication service. They are allegedly planning to hit him tomorrow with serious charges related to abetting terrorism, fraud, money laundering, and crimes against children, all of it apparently stemming from a near-total lack of moderation on Telegram. According to French authorities, thanks to its encryption and support for crypto, Telegram has become the new top tool for organized crime.</p>
<p>French outlet TF1 <a href="https://www.tf1info.fr/justice-faits-divers/info-tf1-lci-le-fondateur-et-pdg-de-la-messagerie-cryptee-telegram-interpelle-en-france-2316072.html">had the news first</a> from sources within the investigation. (<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/factbox-who-is-pavel-durov-ceo-of-messaging-app-telegram/ar-AA1pno0L?cvid=ef3071d656d7414e9dab22073405b670&amp;ei=11">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/europe/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-detained-france-intl-latam/index.html">CNN</a> have since run stories as well.) Their source said, "Pavel Durov will definitely end up in pretrial detention. On his platform, he allowed an incalculable number of offenses and crimes to be committed, which he does nothing to moderate nor does he cooperate."</p>
<p>Durov is a 39-year-old who gained a fortune by building VKontakte, a Russian version of Facebook, before being forced out of his company by the Kremlin. He left Russia and went on to start Telegram, which became widely popular, especially in Europe. He was arrested today when his private plane flew from Azerbaijan to Paris' Le Bourget Airport.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045167#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045167&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following weeks of speculation, NASA finally made it official on Saturday: Two astronauts who flew to the International Space Station on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in June will not return home on that vehicle. Instead, the agency has asked SpaceX to use its Crew Dragon spacecraft to fly astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth.</p>
<p>"NASA has decided that Butch and Suni will return with Crew-9 next February," said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at the outset of a news conference on Saturday afternoon at Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p>In a sign of the gravity surrounding the agency's decision, both Nelson and NASA's deputy administrator, Pam Melroy, attended a Flight Readiness Review meeting held Saturday in Houston. During that gathering of the agency's senior officials, an informal "go/no go" poll was taken. Those present voted unanimously for Wilmore and Williams to return to Earth on Crew Dragon. The official recommendation of the Commercial Crew Program was the same, and Nelson accepted it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045133#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045133&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lithium-ion battery fires can be intense and frightening. As someone who used to repair second-hand <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/smartphones/">smartphones</a>, I’ve extinguished my fair share of flaming iPhones with punctured lithium-ion <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/batteries/">batteries</a>. And the type of smartphone battery in your pocket right now is similar to what’s inside of <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/electric-vehicles/">electric vehicles</a>. Except, the EV battery stores way more energy—so much energy that some firefighters are <a href="https://ktvz.com/cnn-regional/2024/08/20/a-look-at-sacramento-metro-fires-specialized-training-for-electric-vehicle-fires/">receiving special training</a> to extinguish the extra-intense EV flames that are emitted by burning EV batteries after road accidents.</p>
<p>If you’ve been reading the news about EVs, you’ve likely encountered plenty of <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/08/08/tech/korea-ev-explosion-safety-fears/">scary articles about battery fires</a> on the rise. Recently, the US National Transportation Safety Board and the California Highway Patrol <a href="https://x.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/1826430280220999771">announced</a> they are investigating a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkMSzmCqsRY">Tesla semi truck fire</a> that ignited after the vehicle struck a tree. The lithium-ion battery burned for around four hours.</p>

<p>Microsoft is stepping up its plans to make Windows more resilient to buggy software after a botched CrowdStrike update took down millions of PCs and servers in a global IT outage.</p>
<p>The tech giant has in the past month intensified talks with partners about adapting the security procedures around its operating system to better withstand the kind of software error that crashed 8.5 million Windows devices on July 19.</p>
<p>Critics say that any changes by Microsoft would amount to a concession of shortcomings in Windows’ handling of third-party security software that could have been addressed sooner.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045127#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045127&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/manos-antonakakis">Dr. Emmanouil "Manos" Antonakakis</a> runs a Georgia Tech <a href="https://astrolavos.gatech.edu">cybersecurity lab</a> and has attracted millions of dollars in the last few years from the US government for Department of Defense research projects like "Rhamnousia: Attributing Cyber Actors Through Tensor Decomposition and Novel Data Acquisition."</p>
<p>The government yesterday sued Georgia Tech in federal court, singling out Antonakakis and claiming that neither he nor Georgia Tech followed basic (and required) security protocols for years, knew they were not in compliance with such protocols, and then submitted invoices for their DoD projects anyway. (Read the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1364901/dl?inline">complaint</a>.) The government claims this is fraud:</p>
<blockquote><p>At bottom, DoD paid for military technology that Defendants stored in an environment that was not secure from unauthorized disclosure, and Defendants failed to even monitor for breaches so that they and DoD could be alerted if information was compromised. What DoD received for its funds was of diminished or no value, not the benefit of its bargain.</p></blockquote>
<h2>AV hate</h2>
<p>Given the nature of his work for DoD, Antonakakis and his lab are required to abide by many sets of security rules, including those outlined in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r3.pdf">NIST Special Publication 800–171</a>, "Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045111#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045111&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the impending arrival of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/08/fda-green-lights-fall-covid-19-boosters/">2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines approved yesterday</a>, some Americans are now gaming out when to get their dose—right away while the summer wave is peaking, a bit later in the fall to maximize protection for the coming winter wave, or maybe a few weeks before a big family event at the end of the year? Of course, the group pondering such a question is just a small portion of the US.</p>
<p>Only <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/vaccination-dashboard.html">22.5 percent of adults and 14 percent of children</a> in the country are estimated to have gotten the 2023–2024 vaccine. By contrast, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html">48.5 percent of adults and 54 percent of children</a> were estimated to have gotten a flu shot. The stark difference is despite the fact that COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving faster than seasonal influenza viruses.</p>
<p>In a press briefing Friday, federal health officials were quick to redirect focus when reporters raised questions about the timing of COVID-19 vaccination in the coming months and the possibility of updating the vaccines twice a year, instead of just once, to keep up with an evolving virus that has been producing both summer and winter waves.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045105#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045105&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
