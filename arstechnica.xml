<p>Cybercriminals and spies working for nation-states are surreptitiously coexisting inside the same compromised name-brand routers as they use the devices to disguise attacks motivated both by financial gain and strategic espionage, researchers said.</p>
<p>In some cases, the coexistence is peaceful, as financially motivated hackers provide spies with access to already compromised routers in exchange for a fee, researchers from security firm Trend Micro reported Wednesday. In other cases, hackers working in nation-state-backed advanced persistent threat groups take control of devices previously hacked by the cybercrime groups. Sometimes the devices are independently compromised multiple times by different groups. The result is a free-for-all inside routers and, to a lesser extent, VPN devices and virtual private servers provided by hosting companies.</p>
<p>“Cybercriminals and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors share a common interest in proxy anonymization layers and Virtual Private Network (VPN) nodes to hide traces of their presence and make detection of malicious activities more difficult,” Trend Micro researchers Feike Hacquebord and Fernando Merces <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/e/router-roulette.html">wrote</a>. “This shared interest results in malicious internet traffic blending financial and espionage motives.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021233#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021233&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Streaming services like Netflix and Peacock have already found multiple ways to aggravate paying subscribers this week.</p>
<p>The streaming industry has been heating up. As media giants rush to establish a successful video streaming business, they often make platform changes that test subscribers' patience and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/the-lines-between-streaming-and-cable-continue-blurring/">value of streaming</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a look at the most exasperating news from streaming services from this week. The scale of this article demonstrates how fast and frequently disappointing streaming news arises. Coincidentally, as we wrote this article, <em>another</em> price hike was announced.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021143#p3">Read 49 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021143&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Wednesday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/team-plan-and-ios">announced</a> the launch of an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/claude/id6473753684">iOS mobile app</a> for its Claude 3 AI language models that are similar to OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>. It also introduced a new subscription tier designed for group collaboration. Before the app launch, Claude was only available through a website, an API, and other apps that integrated Claude through API.</p>

<p>Like the ChatGPT app, Claude's new mobile app serves as a gateway to chatbot interactions, and it also allows uploading photos for analysis. While it's only available on Apple devices for now, Anthropic says that an Android app is coming soon.</p>
<p>Anthropic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities">rolled out</a> the Claude 3 large language model (LLM) family in March, featuring three different model sizes: Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku. Currently, the app utilizes Sonnet for regular users and Opus for Pro users.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021092#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021092&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission chair today made a final plea to Congress, asking for money to continue a broadband-affordability program that gave out its last round of $30 discounts to people with low incomes in April.</p>
<p>The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) has lowered monthly Internet bills for people who qualify for benefits, but Congress allowed funding to run out. People may receive up to $14 in May if their ISP opted into offering a partial discount during the program's final month. After that there will be no financial help for the 23 million households enrolled in the program.</p>
<p>"Additional funding from Congress is the only near-term solution for keeping the ACP going," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel wrote in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-final-update-congress-affordable-connectivity-program-0">letter</a> to members of Congress today. "If additional funding is not promptly appropriated, the one in six households nationwide that rely on this program will face rising bills and increasing disconnection. In fact, according to our survey of ACP beneficiaries, 77 percent of participating households report that losing this benefit would disrupt their service by making them change their plan or lead to them dropping Internet service entirely."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021148#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021148&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Anyone who's been to a Dave &amp; Buster's location in recent years knows the arcade's heavy reliance on <a href="https://www.gameroomguys.com/games/redemption-games">so-called redemption games</a> makes the experience more like an ersatz casino than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/inside-the-largest-video-game-arcade-in-the-usa/">the quarter-munching video game halls of the '70s and '80s</a>. On the vast majority of D&amp;B games, you end up wagering money (in the form of gameplay chips) to win virtual tickets that can be traded for trinkets at the rewards counter.</p>
<p>Now, the massive arcade chain has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240429412806/en/The-Game-Within-The-Game-Lucra-Establishes-B2B-Presence-with-Blockbuster-Dave-and-Buster%E2%80%99s-Deal">announced</a> that players will soon be able to use the D&amp;B app to directly wager on the results of arcade games through "real-money contests." The arcade giant, which has over 200 locations across North America, is partnering with <a href="https://www.lucrasports.com/">"gamification layer" platform Lucra</a> on a system that will let D&amp;B Rewards members "digitally compete with each other, earn rewards, and unlock exclusive perks while competing with friends at Dave &amp; Buster’s," according to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240429412806/en/The-Game-Within-The-Game-Lucra-Establishes-B2B-Presence-with-Blockbuster-Dave-and-Buster%E2%80%99s-Deal">Tuesday's announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Neither Lucra nor Dave &amp; Buster's has responded to a request for comment from Ars Technica, so we're still missing extremely basic information, like what games will support app-based wagering, minimum and maximum bet sizes, or what kinds of fees might be involved. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/dave-busters-to-allow-customers-to-bet-on-arcade-games.html">CNBC's report</a> on the announcement suggests the system will be launching "in the next few months" to players 18 and older across 44 states (and specifically mention Skee-Ball and Hot Shots Basketball competitions). <a href="https://lucrasports.com/case-studies/dave-and-busters.html">Lucra's webpage</a> simply says the integration will "provide... social connectivity and friendly competition," suggesting you'll probably face off against friends playing in the same location.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021157#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021157&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two separately owned dogs in New Jersey tested positive last year for a dreaded, extensively drug resistant bacterial strain spread in the US by contaminated artificial eye drops manufactured in India. Those drops caused a deadly multi-state outbreak in humans over many months last year, with at least 81 people ultimately infected across 18 states. Fourteen people lost their vision, an additional four had eyeballs surgically removed, and four people died.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tools.eventpower.com/paperclip/24CDC-EIS/reg_custom_field/gZfYK36VyB/supporting_file_2985677.pdf">preliminary data</a> on the dogs—presented recently at a conference of disease detectives hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—highlights that now that the deadly outbreak strain has been introduced around the US, it has the potential to lurk in unexpected places, spread its drug resistance to fellow bacteria, and cause new infections in people and animals who may have never used the drops.</p>
<p>The two dogs in New Jersey were not known to have received the drops linked to the outbreak: EzriCare Artificial Tears and two additional products made by the same manufacturer, which were <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/global-pharma-healthcare-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-artificial-tears-lubricant-eye-drops-due">recalled in February 2023</a>. Such over-the-counter products are sometimes used in animals as well as people. But the dogs' separate owners said they didn't recall using the drops either. They also didn't report any exposures in health care settings or recent international travel that could explain the infections. One of the dogs did, at one point, receive eye drops, but they were not an outbreak-associated brand. The only connection between the two dogs was that they were both treated at the same veterinary hospital, which didn't stock the outbreak-associated eyedrops.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021144#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021144&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In mid-June 2019, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and CEO Satya Nadella received a rude awakening in an <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/r22rfPap2wyQ/v0">email</a> warning that Google had officially gotten too far ahead on AI and that Microsoft may never catch up without investing in OpenAI.</p>
<p>With the subject line "Thoughts on OpenAI," the email came from Microsoft's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, who is also the company’s executive vice president of AI. In it, Scott said that he was "very, very worried" that he had made "a mistake" by dismissing Google's initial AI efforts as a "game-playing stunt."</p>
<p>It turned out, Scott suggested, that instead of goofing around, Google had been building critical AI infrastructure that was already paying off, according to a competitive analysis of Google's products that Scott said showed that Google was competing even more effectively in search. Scott realized that while Google was already moving on to production for "larger scale, more interesting" AI models, it might take Microsoft "multiple years" before it could even attempt to compete with Google.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021108#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021108&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A controversial bill that would require all new cars to be fitted with AM radios looks set to become a law in the near future. Yesterday, Senator Edward Markey (D-Mass) revealed that the "<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1669">AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act</a>" now has the support of 60 US Senators, as well as 246 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives, making its passage an almost sure thing. Should that happen, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would be required to ensure that all new cars sold in the US had AM radios at no extra cost.</p>
<p>"Democrats and Republicans are tuning in to the millions of listeners, thousands of broadcasters, and countless emergency management officials who depend on AM radio in their vehicles. AM radio is a lifeline for people in every corner of the United States to get news, sports, and local updates in times of emergencies. Our commonsense bill makes sure this fundamental, essential tool doesn’t get lost on the dial. With a filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate, Congress should quickly take it up and pass it," said Sen. Markey and his co-sponsor Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).</p>
<p>About 82 million people still listen to AM radio, according to the National Association of Broadcasters, which as you can imagine was rather pleased with the congressional support for its industry.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021104#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021104&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When it comes to judging which large language models are the "best," most <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">evaluations</a> tend to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">look at</a> whether or not a machine can retrieve accurate information, perform logical reasoning, or show human-like creativity. Recently, though, a team of researchers at Georgia State University set out to determine if LLMs could match or surpass human performance in the field of moral guidance.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58087-7?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2KThx3QLRGm7277Ug0PKc_5pYwN-dNKD7BMtPmOwztoN6DdwT1oklX-60_aem_ARCrm12OVR3g1wA_fex_uFY4pPMtrJNBjf_KJE1yLEwXQJ3dITlLFpRzbTHsFxv6-aSlSv5pBxIJRu7jXUxJsNXq">"Attributions toward artificial agents in a modified Moral Turing Test"</a>—which was recently published in Nature's online, open-access Scientific Reports journal—those researchers found that morality judgments given by ChatGPT4 were "perceived as superior in quality to humans'" along a variety of dimensions like virtuosity and intelligence. But before you start to worry that philosophy professors will soon be replaced by hyper-moral AIs, there are some important caveats to consider.</p>
<h2>Better than <em>which</em> humans?</h2>
<p>For the study, the researchers used a modified version of a Moral Turing Test <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09528130050111428">first proposed in 2000</a> to judge "human-like performance" on theoretical moral challenges. The researchers started with a set of 10 moral scenarios <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0024796">originally designed to evaluate the moral reasoning of psychopaths</a>. These scenarios ranged from ones that are almost unquestionably morally wrong ("Hoping to get money for drugs, a man follows a passerby to an alley and holds him at gunpoint") to ones that merely transgress social conventions ("Just to push his limits, a man wears a colorful skirt to the office for everyone else to see.")</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020992#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020992&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you haven't heard of the <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/rabbit-r1">Rabbit R1</a>, this is yet another "AI box" that is trying to replace your smartphone with a voice command device that runs zero apps. Just like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-a-700-voice-command-box-definitely-wont-replace-your-phone/">Humane AI Pin</a>, this thing recently launched and seems to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTV12hErTc">dead on arrival</a> as a completely non-viable device that doesn't solve any real problems, has terrible battery life, and is missing big chunks of core functionality. Before the device fades into obscurity, though, Android Authority's <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/rabbit-r1-is-an-android-app-3438805/">Mishaal Rahman</a> looked at the software and found the "smartphone replacement" device just <em>runs</em> a smartphone OS. It's Android—both an Android OS and Android app, just in a very limited $200 box.</p>
<p>OK, technically, we can't call it "Android" since that's a Google trademark that you can only access after licensing Google Play. It runs AOSP (the Android Open Source Project codebase), which is the open source bits of Android without any proprietary Google code. The interface—which is mostly just a clock, settings screen, and voice input—is also just an Android app. Being a normal Android app means you can install it on an Android phone, and Rahman was able to get the Rabbit R1 software running on a Pixel 6. He even got the AI assistant to answer questions on the phone.</p>
<p>Rabbit Inc. does not sound happy about Rahman's discovery. The company posted on X that it is "<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">aware there are some unofficial rabbit OS app/website emulators out there" and that since it does not want to support "third-party clients," a "local bootleg APK without the proper OS and Cloud endpoints won’t be able to access our service." The company describes its device as a "very bespoke AOSP and lower level firmware modifications," but that's a statement that would be true for many phones. In <a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1785472763664486618">another statement</a> to Rahman, the company threatens that it will "reserve all rights for any malicious and illegal cyber security activities towards our services."</span></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020955#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020955&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Supreme Court yesterday denied a request to block a Texas law that requires age-verification systems on porn websites. The Supreme Court denial leaves in place, at least for now, an appeals court ruling that said Texas can enforce the law.</p>
<p>"The application for stay presented to Justice [Samuel] Alito and by him referred to the Court is denied," the one-sentence <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/043024zr_8oka.pdf">order</a> issued yesterday said.</p>
<p>Pornhub <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/pornhub-blocks-all-texas-users-after-court-upholds-age-verification-law/">disabled its website in Texas</a> after the appeals court ruling in March.

<p>Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html">4 am in the morning</a>, a quiet revolution in computing began at Dartmouth College. That's when mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the first program written in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the college's General Electric GE-225 mainframe.</p>
<p>Little did they know that their creation would go on to democratize computing and inspire generations of programmers over the next six decades.</p>
<h2>What is BASIC?</h2>
<p>In its most traditional form, BASIC is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreted</a> programming language that runs line by line, with line numbers.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you've ever sent an iPhone in for repair, you might be familiar with the dance Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109519">asks you to do</a> if your device still powers on: back up your data, then <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109519">either erase the phone or disable the Find My feature</a> so your phone can easily be serviced (or, if it's being exchanged for a new one, refurbished and resold). If you're also using the Stolen Device Protection and Security Delay feature <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ios-17-3-adds-multiple-features-originally-planned-for-ios-17/">introduced in iOS 17.3</a>, this can be a pain, since you need to wait a full hour to turn Find My off after you make the request.</p>
<p>It looks like Apple is making some changes to that process in iOS 17.5, which is currently in beta testing. The update adds a new "repair state" mode that leaves the device functional while keeping both Find My and Activation Lock enabled. This means that iPhones swiped while in transit will still be trackable and that they'll still stay locked to your Apple ID so they can't easily be wiped and resold.</p>
<p>MacRumors has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-17-5-repair-state/">a good overview</a> of the feature as it currently functions. You can set an iPhone to repair state mode by pulling it up in the Find My app and attempting to remove the device from your account while it’s still online and active. Rather than removing the device from your account, the app will offer to put it in the repair state instead; unlike when you try to disable Find My entirely, this doesn't trigger the one-hour Security Delay waiting period. If your phone is offline, Find My will offer to remove it from your account, as it currently does.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020956#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020956&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been 18 months since the European Union <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/europes-major-satellite-players-line-up-to-build-starlink-competitor/">announced its intent</a> to develop an independent satellite Internet constellation, and the plans appear to be heading into troubled waters.</p>
<p>In that time, a single bid—from a consortium of multinational companies that includes Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space—has emerged to build the network of a few hundred satellites. The companies are to build, launch, and deploy the network of satellites, intended as Europe's answer to SpaceX's Starlink satellite Internet service for connectivity and secure communications, by 2027.</p>
<p>However, the European Commission recently delayed the awarding of a contract to this consortium from March to an undetermined date. In April, Europe's Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton, <a href="https://spacenews.com/eu-to-delay-space-law-constellation-contract/">said</a>, “There is an independent committee which is working on the evaluation process. The work is being carried out extremely seriously." He did not say when this work would conclude.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020954#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020954&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI has been showcasing Sora, its artificial intelligence video-generation model, to media industry executives in recent weeks to drum up enthusiasm and ease concerns about the potential for the technology to disrupt specific sectors.</p>
<p>The Financial Times wanted to put Sora to the test, alongside the systems of rival AI video generation companies Runway and Pika.</p>
<p>We asked executives in advertising, animation, and real estate to write prompts to generate videos they might use in their work. We then asked them their views on how such technology may transform their jobs in the future.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020963#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020963&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope.

<p>Good morning. It's May 1, and today's photo is <em>ridiculously</em> awesome. Taken by the James Webb Space Telescope, it features the sharpest infrared image of the Horsehead Nebula captured to date—it is so zoomed in we can only see the mane. Even so, the image covers an area that is nearly one light-year across, or about 7.6 trillion km.</p>
<p>The Horsehead Nebula is fairly close to Earth, as these things go, about 1,300 light-years. So, it is within our galaxy. In addition to the prominent star at the top of the image and a handful of other stars with six diffraction spikes, the rest of the objects in this image are distant galaxies.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020621#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020621&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Telecom provider CenturyLink left a couple in Oregon without landline phone service for two months, then sent a bill for $239.</p>
<p>CenturyLink customer Kirstin Appel and her husband live in Banks, a city with fewer than 2,000 residents in Oregon's Tualatin Valley. They keep a landline for emergencies because their only Internet service is satellite, and cellular service in the area is poor. Appel said they pay $41 a month for CenturyLink phone service.</p>
<p>CenturyLink phone service became spotty and intermittent around January 20 when winter storms hit the area and then went out completely on January 27, Appel told us. She contacted Ars nearly two months after the outage began, desperate for a fix because her various chats with CenturyLink customer service led nowhere.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020483#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020483&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Facing competition from Starlink and other emerging satellite broadband networks, the two companies that own most of the traditional commercial communications spacecraft in geostationary orbit announced plans to join forces Tuesday.</p>
<p>SES, based in Luxembourg, will buy Intelsat for $3.1 billion. The acquisition will create a combined company boasting a fleet of some 100 multi-ton satellites in geostationary orbit, a ring of spacecraft located more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. This will be more than twice the size of the fleet of the next-largest commercial geostationary satellite operator.</p>
<p>The problem is that demand is waning for communication services through large geostationary (GEO) satellites. There are some large entrenched customers, like video media companies and the military, that will continue to buy telecom capacity on geostationary satellites. But there's a growing demand among consumers, and some segments of the corporate and government markets, for the types of services offered by constellations of smaller satellites flying closer to Earth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020892#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020892&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, the US General Services Administration began <a href="https://gsaauctions.gov/auctions/preview/282996">an auction</a> for the decommissioned <a href="https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history/cheyenne">Cheyenne supercomputer</a>, located in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The 5.34-petaflop supercomputer ranked as the <a href="https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history/cheyenne">20th most powerful</a> in the world at the time of its installation in 2016. Bidding started at $2,500, but it's price is currently $27,643 with the reserve not yet met.</p>

<p>The supercomputer, which officially operated between January 12, 2017, and December 31, 2023, at the <a href="https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-wyoming-supercomputing-center">NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center</a>, was a powerful (and once considered energy-efficient) system that significantly advanced atmospheric and Earth system sciences research.</p>
<p>"In its lifetime, Cheyenne delivered over 7 billion core-hours, served over 4,400 users, and supported nearly 1,300 NSF awards," writes the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) on its official Cheyenne <a href="https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-supercomputing-history/cheyenne">information page</a>. "It played a key role in education, supporting more than 80 university courses and training events. Nearly 1,000 projects were awarded for early-career graduate students and postdocs. Perhaps most tellingly, Cheyenne-powered research generated over 4,500 peer-review publications, dissertations and theses, and other works."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020861#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020861&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has spent the last year trying to convince gamers that they can get a console-like, triple-A experience on the latest iPhones. The newest test of that promise will be Ubisoft's <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, which now has a release date and pricing information.</p>
<p><em>Mirage</em> will land on compatible iPhones—the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max—on June 6, according to Ubisoft (though the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-mirage/id6472704261">App Store listing</a> says June 10.) That coincides pretty closely with Apple's annual developer conference, so we'd expect it to get a shoutout there. <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6hRBheSWDoKUdnKxzy5YOg/assassins-creed-mirage-is-coming-to-ios">Ubisoft's blog post</a> also says it will come to the iPad Air and iPad Pro models with an M1 chip or later.</p>
<p>The game will be a free download with a 90-minute free trial. After that, you'll have to pay $50 to keep playing, which is pretty close to what the game costs on PC and consoles. It will support cross-progression, provided you sign into Ubisoft Connect. Ubisoft Connect is not exactly beloved by players, but it's nice to be able to take your saves back and forth between other platforms if you can stomach it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020857#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020857&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
