                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, tech content creators began to suspect that AI was making it harder to share some of the most highly sought-after tech tutorials on YouTube, but now YouTube is denying that odd removals were due to automation.</p>
<p>Creators grew alarmed when educational videos that YouTube had allowed for years were suddenly being bizarrely flagged as “dangerous” or “harmful,” with seemingly no way to trigger human review to overturn removals. AI seemed to be running the show, with creators’ appeals seemingly getting denied faster than a human could possibly review them.</p>
<p>Late Friday, a YouTube spokesperson confirmed that videos flagged by Ars have been reinstated, promising that YouTube will take steps to ensure that similar content isn’t removed in the future. But, to creators, it remains unclear why the videos got taken down, as YouTube claimed that both initial enforcement decisions and decisions on appeals were not the result of an automation issue.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/youtube-denies-ai-was-involved-with-odd-removals-of-tech-tutorials/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You’ll often hear plastic pollution referred to as a problem. But the reality is that it’s multiple problems. Depending on the properties we need, we form plastics out of different polymers, each of which is held together by a distinct type of chemical bond. So the method we use to break down one type of polymer may be incompatible with the chemistry of another.</p>
<p>That problem is why, even though we’ve had success finding enzymes that break down common plastics like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/">polyesters</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/researchers-engineer-enzyme-to-break-down-plastic-bottles/">PET</a>, they’re only partial solutions to plastic waste. However, researchers aren’t sitting back and basking in the triumph of partial solutions, and they’ve now got very sophisticated protein design tools to help them out.</p>
<p>That’s the story behind a completely new enzyme that researchers developed to break down polyurethane, the polymer commonly used to make foam cushioning, among other things. The new enzyme is compatible with an industrial-style recycling process that breaks the polymer down into its basic building blocks, which can be used to form fresh polyurethane.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/polyurethane-is-the-latest-polymer-broken-down-by-designer-enzymes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Cursor has for the first time introduced what it claims is a competitive coding model, <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/2-0">alongside the 2.0 version</a> of its <span id="_4iUFacC-BZvR0PEP-JWhyQQ_118" class="wtBS9">integrated development environment (</span>IDE) with a new feature that allows running tasks with multiple agents in parallel.</p>
<p>The company’s flagship product is an IDE modeled after Visual Studio Code in many respects, but with a strong emphasis on vibe coding and heavier direct integration of <span id="_ESYFaejIBrXI0PEPtPSzuA4_99" class="wtBS9">large language model</span>-based tools in the interface and workflow. Since its introduction, Cursor has supported models developed by other companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. However, while it has trialed its own built-in models, they weren’t competitive with the big frontier models.</p>
<p>It’s a different story now, according to the company’s claims about Composer. <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/kernels">Built with</a> reinforcement learning and a mixture-of-experts architecture, Composer is dubbed by Cursor “a frontier model that is 4x faster than similarly intelligent models”—a significant claim when you consider what it’s competing with.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/cursor-introduces-its-coding-model-alongside-multi-agent-interface/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Two Windows vulnerabilities—one a zero-day that has been known to attackers since 2017 and the other a critical flaw that Microsoft initially tried and failed to patch recently—are under active exploitation in widespread attacks targeting a swath of the Internet, researchers say.</p>
<p>The zero-day went undiscovered until <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html">March</a>, when security firm Trend Micro said it had been under active exploitation since 2017, by as many as 11 separate advanced persistent threats (APTs). These APT groups, often with ties to nation-states, relentlessly attack specific individuals or groups of interest. Trend Micro went on to say that the groups were exploiting the vulnerability, then tracked as ZDI-CAN-25373, to install various known post-exploitation payloads on infrastructure located in nearly 60 countries, with the US, Canada, Russia, and Korea being the most common.</p>
<h2>A large-scale, coordinated operation</h2>
<p>Seven months later, Microsoft still hasn’t patched the vulnerability, which stems from a bug in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-shllink/16cb4ca1-9339-4d0c-a68d-bf1d6cc0f943">Windows Shortcut</a> binary format. The Windows component makes opening apps or accessing files easier and faster by allowing a single binary file to invoke them without having to navigate to their locations. In recent months, the ZDI-CAN-25373 tracking designation has been changed to CVE-2025-9491.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/two-windows-vulnerabilities-one-a-0-day-are-under-active-exploitation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission will vote in November to repeal a ruling that requires telecom providers to secure their networks, acting on a request from the biggest lobby groups representing Internet providers.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2025/10/29/halloween-treats">said</a> the ruling, adopted in January just before Republicans gained majority control of the commission, “exceeded the agency’s authority and did not present an effective or agile response to the relevant cybersecurity threats.” Carr said the vote scheduled for November 20 comes after “extensive FCC engagement with carriers” who have taken “substantial steps… to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses.”</p>
<p>The FCC’s January 2025 <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-25-9A1_Rcd.pdf">declaratory ruling</a> came in response to attacks by China, including the Salt Typhoon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/us-recommends-encrypted-messaging-as-chinese-hackers-linger-in-telecom-networks/">infiltration of major telecom providers</a> such as Verizon and AT&amp;T. The Biden-era FCC found that the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a 1994 law, “affirmatively requires telecommunications carriers to secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/fcc-dumps-plan-for-telecom-security-rules-that-internet-providers-dont-like/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A measles investigation amid a large, ongoing outbreak at the Arizona-Utah border has hit a roadblock as the first probable case identified in the Salt Lake City area refuses to work with health officials, the local health department reported this week.</p>
<p>There have been over 150 cases collectively across the two states, mostly in northwestern Mohave County, <a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php">Arizona</a>, and the southwest health district of <a href="https://avrpublic.dhhs.utah.gov/uwss/">Utah</a>, in the past two months. Both areas have abysmally low vaccination rates: In Mohave County, only <a href="https://apps.azdhs.gov/IDRREportStats">78.4 percent of kindergartners</a> in the 2024–2025 school year were vaccinated against measles, according to state records. In the southwest district of Utah, <a href="https://immunize-training.at.utah.gov/captivate/UtahSchoolsData_Kinder_UpdatedApr2025.html">only 80.7 percent</a> of kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year had records of measles vaccination. Public health experts say vaccination coverage of 95 percent is necessary to keep the disease from spreading in a community.</p>
<p>While the outbreak has largely exploded along the border, cases are also creeping to the north, toward Salt Lake County, which encompasses the city. Utah County, which sits just south of Salt Lake County, has identified eight cases, including <a href="https://health.utahcounty.gov/2025/10/31/new-measles-case-in-utah-county/">a new case reported today</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/measles-outbreak-investigation-in-utah-blocked-by-patient-who-refuses-to-talk/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The road to the second flight of Blue Origin’s heavy-lifting New Glenn rocket got a lot clearer Thursday night with a success test-firing of the launcher’s seven main engines on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.</p>
<p>Standing on a seaside launch pad, the New Glenn rocket ignited its seven BE-4 main engines at 9:59 pm EDT Thursday (01:59 UTC Friday). The engines burned for 38 seconds while the rocket remained firmly on the ground, according to a <a href="https://x.com/blueorigin/status/1984096485961613559">social media post</a> by Blue Origin.</p>
<p>The hold-down firing of the first stage engines was the final major test of the New Glenn rocket before launch day. Blue Origin previously test-fired the rocket’s second-stage engines. Officials have not announced a target launch date, but sources tell Ars the rocket could be ready for liftoff as soon as November 9.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/blue-origin-test-fires-second-new-glenn-rocket-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>2017 feels like another era these days, but if you cast your mind back that far, you might remember Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s vaporware Roadster 2.0. Full of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/not-just-a-semi-announcement-tesla-promises-a-new-roadster/">nonsensical-sounding features</a> that impressed people who know a little bit about rockets but nothing about cars, the $200,000 electric car promised to have a suction fan and “cold gas thrusters,” plus 620 miles (1,000 km) of range and a whole load of other stuff that’s never happening.</p>
<p>Plenty of other electric automakers have introduced electric hypercars in the eight years since Musk declared the second Roadster a thing, with no sign of it being any closer to reality, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/tesla-roadster-early-development/">if the latest job postings are accurate</a>. And it seems that over time, a lot of the people who gave the company a hefty deposit—some say interest-free loan—have become tired of waiting and want their money back.</p>
<p>And that’s not quite so easy, it turns out. Musk’s current Silicon Valley rival is the latest to discover this. According to Sam Altman’s social media account, he placed an order for a Roadster on July 11, 2018, with a deposit of $45,000 ($58,206 in today’s money). But after emailing Tesla for a refund, he discovered the email address associated with preorders had been deleted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/sam-altman-wants-a-refund-for-his-50000-tesla-roadster-deposit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T yesterday sued the advertising industry’s official watchdog over the group’s demand that AT&amp;T stop using its rulings for advertising and promotional purposes.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/att-ad-congratulating-itself-for-its-ethics-violated-an-ad-industry-rule/">previously reported</a>, BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD) found that AT&amp;T violated a rule “by issuing a video advertisement and press release that use the NAD process and its findings for promotional purposes,” and sent a cease-and-desist letter to the carrier. The NAD operates the US advertising industry’s system of self-regulation, which is designed to handle complaints that advertisers file against each other and minimize government regulation of false and misleading claims.</p>
<p>While it’s clear that both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have a history of misleading ad campaigns, AT&amp;T portrays itself as a paragon of honesty in new ads calling T-Mobile “the master of breaking promises.” An AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/att-stands-up-for-consumers.html">press release</a> about the ad campaign said the NAD “asked T-Mobile to correct their marketing claims 16 times over the last four years,” and an AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EHkISq0p9Q">commercial</a> said T-Mobile has faced more challenges for deceptive ads from competitors than all other telecom providers in that time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/att-sues-ad-industry-watchdog-instead-of-pulling-ads-that-slam-t-mobile/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Hyundai’s E-GMP platform for electric vehicles arrived on the market, it cemented the Korean automaker’s place as one of the leaders of its industry. And in the absence of an influx of Chinese EVs, the Ioniq range of cars, crossovers, and SUVs is about as leading-edge as you’ll find in showrooms right now, particularly mainstream brands.</p>
<p>The first of the E-GMP cars was the Ioniq 5, which looks like a 1980’s hatch scaled up to the midsize crossover segment. Now made in the US, it has been a firm hit—and at the beginning of the month just got <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/hyundai-gives-the-ioniq-5-a-huge-price-cut-for-model-year-2026/">a hefty price cut</a>, to boot. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/the-2023-hyundai-ioniq-6-a-streamlined-look-equals-serious-range/">midsized sedan</a> followed, but these are a less common sight here given American car-buying tastes. Those tastes shaped the Ioniq 9, though.</p>
<p>The underlying technology might hail from Hyundai’s Namyang R&amp;D center in South Korea, but the Ioniq 9 is the result of that technology expressed through the tastes of suburban America. Not so much the exterior styling, though. The hood is too low, the corners are more rounded, and it’s generally a less-threatening shape than the average domestic three-row SUV.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/a-week-with-the-hyundai-ioniq-9-suv-what-we-liked-what-we-didnt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As artificial intelligence drives the need for vastly more computing storage and processing power, interest in space-based data centers has spiked.</p>
<p>Although several startup companies, such as Starcloud, have begun to address this problem, the idea has also attracted the interest of tech barons. In May, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/eric-schmidt-apparently-bought-relativity-space-to-put-data-centers-in-orbit/">it emerged that</a> former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt acquired Relativity Space due to his interest in space-based data centers. Then, earlier this month, Amazon founder <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/data-centres-space-jeff-bezos-thinks-its-possible-2025-10-03/">Jeff Bezos predicted</a> that gigawatt-scale data centers will be built in space within the next 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p>Now, Elon Musk, whose SpaceX owns and operates significantly more space-based infrastructure than any other company or country in the world, has also expressed interest in the technology.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/elon-musk-on-data-centers-in-orbit-spacex-will-be-doing-this/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One reason to use the Task Manager in Windows is to see if any of the apps running on your computer are misbehaving or using a disproportionate amount of resources. But what do you do when the misbehaving app is the Task Manager itself?</p>
<p>After a recent Windows update, some users (including <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/10/30/windows-11-kb5067036-issue-task-manager-wont-close-and-duplicates-may-hurt-performance/">Windows Latest</a>) noticed that closing the Task Manager window was actually failing to close the app, leaving the executable running in memory. More worryingly, each time you open the Task Manager, it spawns a new process on top of the old one, which you can repeat essentially infinitely (or until your PC buckles under the pressure).</p>
<p>Each instance of Task Manager takes up around 20MB of system RAM and hovers between 0 and 2 percent CPU usage—if you have just a handful of instances open, it’s unlikely that you’d notice much of a performance impact. But if you use Task Manager frequently or just go a long time between reboots, opening up two or three dozen copies of the process that are all intermittently using a fraction of your CPU can add up, leading to a potentially significant impact on performance and battery life.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-11-task-manager-bug-makes-the-apps-close-button-do-the-exact-opposite/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The speedy demolition of the East Wing of the White House last week has health advocates and Democratic lawmakers seeking answers about what efforts were taken, if any, to keep workers and passersby safe from potential plumes of asbestos that could arise from the destruction, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/30/east-wing-demolition-asbestos-abatement/">according to a report by The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>The East Wing was originally constructed in 1902 and was renovated in 1942, and asbestos was used extensively in government buildings during this period, according to the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization (ADAO), a nonprofit focused on preventing asbestos exposure. Anyone who inadvertently breathes in asbestos fibers launched into the air by construction work could be at heightened risk of lung diseases and cancer.</p>
<p>“Every building of this age must undergo full asbestos inspection and abatement before any demolition begins,” Linda Reinstein, president and cofounder of ADAO, <a href="https://www.asbestosdiseaseawareness.org/newsroom/blogs/release-white-house-east-wing-demolition/">said in a press statement</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/trumps-swift-demolition-of-east-wing-may-have-launched-asbestos-plumes/">Read full article</a></p>

The pair of artifacts, unearthed from layers 47,000 and 46,000 years old, showed signs of being deliberately shaped into crayons and resharpened over time. A third piece of ocher had been carefully carved with parallel lines. The finds add to the growing body of evidence that Neanderthals had an artistic streak.</p>

<h2>Please pass Og the yellow crayon</h2>
<p>Rock shelters, occupied by Neanderthals between 100,000 and 33,000 years ago, dot the landscape near the modern city of Bilohirsk in Crimea (a peninsula in southern Ukraine). Archaeologists studying those rock shelters have unearthed dozens of chunks of an iron-rich mineral called ocher. Many of them have flakes knocked out or grooves gouged into their surface, which mark how Neanderthals extracted powdery red, orange, or yellow pigment from the stone. D’Errico and his colleagues used X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopes to examine 16 ocher chunks to better understand exactly what ancient Crimean Neanderthals were doing with the stuff.</p>
<p>Most of those ocher chunks could have been used for nearly anything. Ocher is handy not just as a pigment but also for tanning animal hides, mixing with resins into adhesives for hafting tools, or even repelling insects and preventing infection. Knapping a few flakes off a hard nodule of ocher, then crushing them into powder (or just carving out a chunk of a softer, more crumbly piece), is a good way to prepare it for any of those uses. But two pieces, both from a site called Zaskalnaya V, were clearly different.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/crimean-neanderthals-made-stone-age-crayons-from-ocher-50000-years-ago/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>About an hour after sunrise over the Mojave Desert of Southern California, NASA’s newest experimental supersonic jet took to the skies for the first time on Tuesday. The X-59 Quesst (Quiet SuperSonic Technology) is designed to decrease the noise of a sonic boom when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier, paving the way for future commercial jets to fly at supersonic speeds over land.</p>
<p>The jet, built by Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, took off from US Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. Flown by Nils Larson, NASA’s lead test pilot for the X-59, the inaugural flight validated the jet’s airworthiness and safety before landing about an hour after takeoff near NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California.</p>
<p>“X-59 is a symbol of American ingenuity,” acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy <a href="https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2025-10-28-X-59-Soars-A-New-Era-in-Supersonic-Flight-Begins">said in a statement.</a> “It’s part of our DNA—the desire to go farther, faster, and even quieter than anyone has ever gone before.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/nasa-test-flight-seeks-to-help-bring-commercial-supersonic-travel-back/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>SpaceX on Thursday released the most detailed public update in nearly two years on its multibillion-dollar contract to land astronauts on the Moon for NASA, amid growing sentiment that China is likely to beat the United States back to the lunar surface with humans.</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates#moon-and-beyond">published on SpaceX’s website</a> Thursday, the company said it “will be a central enabler that will fulfill the vision of NASA’s Artemis program, which seeks to establish a lasting presence on the lunar surface… and ultimately forge the path to land the first humans on Mars.”</p>
<p>Getting to Mars is SpaceX’s overarching objective, a concise but lofty mission statement introduced by Elon Musk at the company’s founding nearly a quarter-century ago. Musk has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/elon-musk-were-going-straight-to-mars-the-moon-is-a-distraction/">criticized NASA’s Artemis program</a>, which aims to return US astronauts to the Moon for the first time since the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972, as unambitious and too reliant on traditional aerospace contractors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/as-pressure-mounts-spacex-insists-starship-is-fastest-path-to-moon-landing/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You just can’t ignore the effects of the generative AI boom.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t go looking for AI bots, they’re being integrated into virtually every product and service. And for what? There’s a lot of hand-wavey chatter about agentic this and AGI that, but what can “gen AI” do for you right now? <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/googles-gemini-powered-smart-home-revamp-is-here-with-a-new-app-and-cameras/">Gemini for Home</a> is Google’s latest attempt to make this technology useful, integrating Gemini with the smart home devices people already have. Anyone paying for extended video history in the Home app is about to get a heaping helping of AI, including daily summaries, AI-labeled notifications, and more.</p>
<p>Given the supposed power of AI models like Gemini, recognizing events in a couple of videos and answering questions about them doesn’t seem like a bridge too far. And yet Gemini for Home has demonstrated a tenuous grasp of the truth, which can lead to some disquieting interactions, like periodic warnings of home invasion, both human and animal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/unexpectedly-a-deer-briefly-entered-the-family-room-living-with-gemini-home/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><strong>Skyroot nearing first launch with big ambitions</strong>. Three years after India opened up its space sector to private companies, Hyderabad-based Skyroot Aerospace is targeting its first full-scale commercial satellite launch mission in January 2026, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/india-space-startup-skyroot-private-rocket-launch-11761623312736.html">Mint reports</a>. After this debut flight, Skyroot is targeting a launch every three months next year, and one every month from 2027. Each satellite launch mission is expected to generate the company nearly $5 million, according to Skyroot chief executive Pawan Chandana.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/rocket-report-chinas-moon-rocket-to-debut-soon-arcaspace-is-back-sort-of/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Siblings Casey and Calley Means—wellness darlings of the Make America Healthy Again movement, despite being rife with potential conflicts of interest—are both missing from the political arena, at least for now.</p>
<p>Casey Means, President Trump’s nominee for surgeon general, was scheduled to appear virtually at a Senate confirmation hearing today, but the hearing was postponed indefinitely after she went into labor. The hearing, it turns out, had been scheduled two days after her due date, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/casey-means-surgeon-general-hearing-delayed-labor">CNN reported this morning</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/health/calley-means-kennedy-adviser-departure.html">The New York Times separately reported</a> that Calley Means has departed from the White House, vacating his role as a “Special Government Employee,” which has a 130-day term limit. The Times reported that Calley left about a month ago when the term ended, though the White House never announced his departure, and he has continued to be identified as a government employee in press articles and at a conference. Calley, who has acted as an influential advisor to anti-vaccine health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told the Times that the press articles and his conference biography were inaccurate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/the-means-siblings-darlings-of-maha-both-out-of-the-trump-admin-for-now/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Wednesday, Larry Bushart was released from Perry County Jail, where he had spent weeks unable to make bail, which a judge set at $2 million. Prosecutors have not explained why the charges against him were dropped, according <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/10/30/larry-bushart-tennessee-free-speech-charlie-kirk-meme/">to The Intercept</a>, which has been tracking the case closely. However, officials faced mounting pressure following media coverage and a social media campaign called “Free Larry Bushart,” which stoked widespread concern over suspected police censorship of a US citizen over his political views.</p>
