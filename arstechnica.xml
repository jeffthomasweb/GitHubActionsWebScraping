<p>A 37-year-old man is fighting for his life in an intensive care unit in Hong Kong after being wounded by monkeys during a recent park visit and contracting a rare and deadly virus spread by primates.</p>
<p>The man, who was previously in good health, was wounded by wild macaque monkeys during a visit to Kam Shan Country Park in late February, <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/03/P2024040400151.htm">according to local health officials</a>. The park is well known for its conservation of wild macaques and features an area that locals call "<a href="https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cou/cou_vis_cou_ks/cou_vis_cou_ks.html">Monkey Hill</a>" and describe as a macaque kingdom.</p>
<p>On March 21, he was admitted to the hospital with a fever and "decreased conscious level," health officials reported. As of Wednesday, April 3, he was in the ICU listed in critical condition. Officials reported the man's case Wednesday after testing of his cerebrospinal fluid revealed the presence of B virus.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015081#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015081&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Atlantic hurricane season does not begin for another eight weeks, but we are deep in the heart of hurricane season prediction season.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the most influential of these forecasts was issued by Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane scientist at Colorado State University. To put a fine point on it, Klotzbach and his team foresee an exceptionally busy season in the Atlantic basin, which encompasses the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>"We anticipate that the 2024 Atlantic basin hurricane season will be extremely active," Klotzbach wrote <a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/Forecast/2024-04.pdf">in his forecast discussion</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015040#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015040&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson yesterday issued a statement debunking claims of widespread voter fraud that were amplified by X owner Elon Musk on the social network formerly named Twitter. Election officials in two other states also disputed the "extremely false" information shared by Musk.</p>
<p>Musk is generally a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/elon-musk-proposes-tesla-move-to-texas-after-delaware-judge-voids-56-billion-pay/">big fan of Texas</a>, but on Tuesday he shared a post by the account "End Wokeness" that claimed, "The number of voters registering without a photo ID is SKYROCKETING in 3 key swing states: Arizona, Texas, and Pennsylvania." The account claimed there were 1.25 million such registrations in Texas since the beginning of 2024, over 580,000 in Pennsylvania, and over 220,000 in Arizona.</p>
<p>"Extremely concerning," Musk wrote in <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1775243907506274781">a <del>retweet</del> re-X</a>. The End Wokeness post shared by Musk suggested that "illegals" are registering to vote in large numbers by using Social Security numbers that can be obtained <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10096.pdf">for work authorizations</a>. The End Wokeness post has been viewed 63 million times so far, and Musk's re-post has been viewed 58.2 million times.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015015#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015015&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Mars has a history of liquid water on its surface, including lakes like the one that used to occupy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/organic-chemicals-on-mars-are-associated-with-water-shaped-deposits/">Jezero Crater</a>, which have long since dried up. Ancient water that carried debris—and melted water ice that presently does the same—were also thought to be the only thing driving the formation of gullies spread throughout the Martian landscape. That view may now change thanks to new results that suggest dry ice can also shape the landscape.</p>
<h2>It’s sublime</h2>
<p>Previously, scientists were convinced that only liquid water shaped gullies on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/before-ingenuity-ever-landed-on-mars-scientists-almost-managed-to-kill-it/">Mars</a> because that’s what happens on Earth. What was not taken into account was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/10/the-snow-forecast-for-mars-dry-ice-and-a-meter-a-year/">sublimation</a>, or the direct transition of a substance from a solid to a gaseous state. Sublimation is how CO<sub>2</sub> ice disappears (<a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9326/nasa-explores-a-winter-wonderland-on-mars/#:~:text=Martian%20snow%20comes%20in%20two,it%20even%20touches%20the%20ground.">sometimes water ice</a> experiences this, too).</p>
<p>Frozen carbon dioxide is everywhere on Mars, including in its gullies. When CO<sub>2</sub> ice sublimates on one of these gullies, the resulting gas can push debris further down the slope and continue to shape it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015020#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015020&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Washington State Lottery has taken down a promotional AI-powered web app after a local mother reported that the site generated an image with her face on the body of a topless woman.</p>
<p>The lottery's <a href="https://testdriveawin.com/">"Test Drive a Win" website</a> was designed to help visitors visualize various dream vacations they could pay for with their theoretical lottery winnings. The site included the ability to upload a headshot that would be integrated into an AI-generated tableau of what you might look like on that vacation.</p>
<p>But Megan (last name not given), a 50-year-old from Olympia suburb Tumwater, <a href="https://mynorthwest.com/3956403/rantz-washingtons-lottery-ai-porn-user/">told conservative Seattle radio host Jason Rantz</a> that the image of her "swim with the sharks" dream vacation on the website showed her face atop a woman sitting on a bed with her breasts exposed. The background of the AI-generated image seems to show the bed in some sort of aquarium, complete with fish floating through the air and sprawling undersea flora sitting awkwardly behind the pillows.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015007#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015007&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you run a personal or hobby website, getting a copyright notice from a law firm about an image on your site can trigger some fast-acting panic. As someone who has paid to settle a news service-licensing issue before, I can empathize with anybody who wants to make this kind of thing go away.</p>
<p>Which is why a new kind of angle-on-an-angle scheme can seem both obvious to spot and likely effective. Ernie Smith, the prolific, ever-curious writer behind the newsletter <a href="https://tedium.co/">Tedium</a>, received a "DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice" in late March from "Commonwealth Legal," representing the "Intellectual Property division" of Tech4Gods.</p>
<p>The issue was with <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-cell-phone-on-a-car-dashboard-MQYdpvztfsE">a photo of a keyfob</a> from legitimate photo service Unsplash used in service of a post about <a href="https://midrange.tedium.co/issues/the-great-key-fob-caper/">a strange Uber ride Smith once took</a>. As Smith <a href="https://writing.exchange/@ernie/112180217732787648">detailed in a Mastodon thread</a>, the purported firm needed him to "add a credit to our client immediately" through a link to Tech4Gods, and said it should be "addressed in the next five business days." Removing the image "does not conclude the matter," and should Smith not have taken action, the putative firm would have to "activate" its case, relying on <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">DMCA 512(c)</a> (which, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/512/">in many readings</a>, actually does grant relief should a website owner, unaware of infringing material, "act expeditiously to remove" said material). The email unhelpfully points to the main page of the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> so that Smith might review "past usage records."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014933#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014933&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I found myself in the air long enough to give some thought to how I could land while remaining atop the bicycle I had been riding the instant before I hit the jump. Based on similar experiences while skiing, I immediately recognized that this invariably meant very bad things. A few seconds later, as I was brushing dirt out of the abrasions I had just picked up, I contemplated where I had gone wrong.</p>
<p>Once again, I had misunderstood HPC's Trailblazer e-mountain bike. Doing so had become a feature of the time I spent using the bike.</p>
<p>The Trailblazer looks like a solid, hefty beast of a bike (that's not an insult—I got compliments on its looks while taking a train to some trails). It's covered with components that are likely to be unfamiliar to people who know the default sets that come with bikes from large manufacturers. But if you do some research on the components, you realize that the Trailblazer was specced by someone with deep knowledge and fairly particular tastes.

<p>Google has <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Google-v-Sun-Complaint-4-4-2024.pdf">sued</a> two app developers based in China over an alleged scheme targeting 100,000 users globally over four years with at least 87 fraudulent cryptocurrency and other investor apps distributed through the Play Store.</p>
<p>The tech giant alleged that scammers lured victims with "promises of high returns" from "seemingly legitimate" apps offering investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies and other products. Commonly known as "pig-butchering schemes," these scams displayed fake returns on investments, but when users went to withdraw the funds, they discovered they could not.</p>
<p>In some cases, Google alleged, developers would "double down on the scheme by requesting various fees and other payments from victims that were supposedly necessary for the victims to recover their principal investments and purported gains."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014955#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014955&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A scientific journal published by Elsevier has reportedly posted a stunning 101 expressions of concern on studies connected to Didier Raoult, a disgraced French microbiologist who gained international prominence amid the pandemic by promoting, with little evidence, that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could treat COVID-19—<a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/chloroquine-or-hydroxychloroquine-useful-treating-people-covid-19-or-preventing-infection">a claim</a> that has now been firmly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/who-gives-up-on-hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-stops-trials/">debunked</a>.</p>

An op-ed in the major French newspaper Le Monde described the study as "<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2023/05/28/recherche-clinique-a-l-ihu-de-marseille-en-l-absence-de-reaction-des-institutions-les-graves-manquements-constates-pourraient-devenir-la-norme_6175184_1650684.html">the largest 'wild' therapeutic trial known to date</a>."</p>

<p>Phoenix Uber Eats customers can fire up the app and order some food, and they might see the message “autonomous vehicles may deliver your order.” Waymo says you'll be able to opt out of robot delivery at checkout if you want.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014908#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014908&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Or at least it's a feature Microsoft is testing in the newest builds of its Chromium-based Edge browser (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24120867/microsoft-edge-ram-control-settings">The Verge</a>). User Leopeva64 on X, formerly Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1773100165114499555">posted screenshots</a> of an Edge build with a "resource controls" slider for manually limiting the browser's RAM usage. There's also a toggle to set whether you want RAM limits to kick in when you're playing a game, or if you want the limit to be enforced at all times.</p>
<p>It builds on a feature that's already in the stable version of Edge, where the browser will alert you if an individual tab has particularly high memory usage. The minimum limit you can set for Edge appears to be 1GB, and it goes all the way up to the amount of physical memory you have installed in your PC.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014910#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014910&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For most people, Windows 10 will stop receiving critical security updates on October 14, 2025, roughly a decade after its initial release. For people using computers that can't upgrade to Windows 11 or organizations with dozens or hundreds of PCs to manage, Microsoft is making another three years of Extended Security Updates (ESUs) available, but only if you can pay for them. And the company is ready to start talking about pricing.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/when-to-use-windows-10-extended-security-updates/ba-p/4102628">a blog post published earlier this week</a>, Microsoft's Jason Leznek writes that the first year of ESUs will cost $61 per PC for businesses that want to keep their systems updated.</p>

<p>And as with the Windows 7 ESUs a few years ago, Microsoft says that the price will double each year—so the second year of ESUs will cost $122 per PC, and the third year will cost a whopping $244 per device. And Microsoft says this pricing is cumulative; if you decided to buy ESUs for year three after skipping the first two years, you'd also need to pay for the first two years retroactively. These slow price hikes seem intended to drive businesses to migrate to Windows 11 as quickly as they can while still giving them a way to keep using Windows 10 when absolutely necessary.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014888#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014888&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>An international collaboration of scientists has created the largest 3D map of our universe to date based on <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2024/04/04/desi-first-results-make-most-precise-measurement-of-expanding-universe/">the first results</a> from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). It's an impressive achievement, with more to come, but the most significant finding stems from the collaboration's new measurements of dark energy. Those results roughly agree with the current prevailing theoretical model for dark energy, in which dark energy is constant over time. But there are some tantalizing hints that it could vary over time instead, which would call for some changes to that prevailing model.</p>
<p>Granted, those hints are still below the necessary threshold to claim discovery and hence fall under the rubric of "huge, if true." We'll have to wait for more data from DESI's continuing measurements to see if they hold up. In the meantime, <a href="https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/papers/">multiple papers</a> delving into the technical details behind these first results have been posted to the arXiv, and there will be several talks presented at <a href="https://april.aps.org">a meeting</a> of the American Physical Society being held this week in Sacramento, California, as well as at Rencontres de Moriond in Italy.</p>
<p>“Our results show some interesting deviations from the standard model of the universe that could indicate that dark energy is evolving over time,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1039847">said Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki</a>, a physicist at the University of Texas, Dallas, and a member of the DESI collaboration. “The more data we collect, the better equipped we will be to determine whether this finding holds. With more data, we might identify different explanations for the result we observe or confirm it. If it persists, such a result will shed some light on what is causing cosmic acceleration and provide a huge step in understanding the evolution of our universe.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013826#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013826&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA has made another bold bet on the nation's commercial space industry, this time asking private companies to provide a lunar rover that can survive for up to a decade near the South Pole of the Moon.</p>
<p>The space agency on Wednesday announced the selection of three teams, led by Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost, and Venturi Astrolab, to work on designs for a rover that can be used by astronauts and function autonomously when no crew is around.</p>
<p>Each company will work with the space agency for the next year or so to reach what is known as a "preliminary design review" for their vehicle. The initial awards are not huge; each is a few tens of millions of dollars. But this work will set the stage for a demonstration phase, which will be worth significantly more.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014744#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014744&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The number of partisan news outlets in the US masquerading as legitimate journalism now equals genuine local newspaper sites, researchers say, as so-called pink slime operators gear up ahead of November’s presidential election.</p>
<p>Pink slime sites mimic local news providers but are highly partisan and tend to bury their deep ties to dark money, lobbying groups, and special interests.</p>
<p>NewsGuard, which rates the quality and trustworthiness of news sites, has identified 1,197 pink slime sites operating in the US as of April 1—about as many as the estimated 1,200 real news sites operated by daily local newspapers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014866#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014866&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In February, NASA celebrated the arrival of the first US-made lander on the Moon in more than 50 years, an achievement that helps pave the way for the return of American astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade. But the clock was ticking for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/it-turns-out-that-odysseus-landed-on-the-moon-without-any-altimetry-data/">Intuitive Machines' <em>Odysseus </em>spacecraft</a> after touching down on February 22 near the Moon's south pole.</p>
<p>Each day and night on the Moon lasts two weeks. When the Sun sets, a solar-powered lunar lander like <i>Odysseus </i>is starved of energy. Temperatures during the lunar night plummet, bottoming out at around <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasas-lro-finds-lunar-pits-harbor-comfortable-temperatures/#:~:text=The%20pits%2C%20and%20caves%20to,minus%20173%20C)%20at%20night.">minus 280° Fahrenheit</a> (minus 173° Celsius).</p>
<p>Over the course of two weeks, these cold temperatures can damage sensitive spacecraft equipment, killing a lander even if it could start generating power again at lunar sunrise. Surviving the night requires heat and electricity, and NASA officials say nuclear power is one of the most attractive solutions to this problem.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013310#p3">Read 49 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013310&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A strategy document released by the Pentagon this week lays out where the US military can most effectively rely on the commercial space industry and what missions should remain in government hands.</p>
<p>"This marks a new effort to harness the remarkable innovation of the commercial space sector to enhance our resilience and strengthen integrated deterrence as a department," said John Plumb, assistant secretary of defense for space policy.</p>
<p>The Space Force already buys a lot from the commercial space industry. The military doesn't build or own satellite launch vehicles—those come from commercial companies. While the Space Force operates government-owned reconnaissance and surveillance satellites, it also buys supplementary data and imagery from the commercial industry.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014655#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014655&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google might start charging for access to search results that use generative artificial intelligence tools. That's according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4bfeb4-6579-4819-9f5f-b3a46ff59ed1">a new Financial Times report</a> citing "three people with knowledge of [Google's] plans."</p>
<p>Charging for any part of the search engine at the core of its business would be a first for Google, which has funded its search product solely with ads <a href="https://instapage.com/blog/google-adwords-infographic/">since 2000</a>. But it's far from the first time Google would charge for AI enhancements in general; the "AI Premium" tier of a Google One subscription <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans">costs $10 more per month</a> than a standard "Premium" plan, for instance, while "Gemini Business" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2024/02/google-launches-gemini-business-ai-adds-20-to-the-6-workspace-bill/">adds $20 a month</a> to a standard Google Workspace subscription.</p>
<p>While those paid products offer access to Google's high-end "Gemini Advanced" AI model, Google also <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">offers free access to its less performant, plain "Gemini" model</a> without any kind of paid subscription.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014756#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014756&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The flare-up of highly pathogenic bird flu continues to widen in US livestock after federal officials confirmed last week that the virus has spread to US cows for the first time. The virus has now been <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-dairy-herd-idaho">detected in dairy cows in at least five states</a>, a single person in Texas exposed to infected cows, and an egg farm in Texas, all spurring yet more intense monitoring and biosecurity vigilance as the situation continues to evolve.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, seven dairy herds in Texas, two in Kansas, and one each in Idaho, Michigan, and New Mexico had tested positive for the virus. The affected dairy herd in Michigan had recently received cows from one of the infected herds in Texas. It remains unclear if there is cow-to-cow transmission of the flu virus.</p>
<p>The virus—a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza or HPAI—has been devastating wild birds worldwide for the past several years. Throughout the devastating outbreak, the flu virus has spilled over <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals">to various species</a>, including big cats in zoos, river otters, bears, dolphins, seals, squirrels, and foxes. While cows were an unexpected addition to the list, federal officials noted last week that affected dairy farms had found dead wild birds on their farms, suggesting that wild birds introduced the virus to the cows, not an intermediate host.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014743#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014743&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Spotify Premium subscriptions include up to 15 hours of audiobook listening. But starting in April, the company will charge an extra $1 to $2 per month for the feature, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/spotify-is-changing-how-it-charges-customers-with-new-plans-and-prices?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> reported today, citing anonymous “people familiar with the matter.” The reported price hike would be the second that Spotify customers have faced in nine months.</p>
<p>Currently, Spotify charges nothing for its free plan with ads, $5.99/month for students, $10.99/month for its Premium plan, $14.99/month for its Duo Premium plan for two users, and $16.99/month for its Family Premium plan with up to six users.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that individual plan prices will go up by approximately $1 per month, and multi-member plans will increase by $2 per month.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014721#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014721&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
