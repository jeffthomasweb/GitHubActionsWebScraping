                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">BMW provided flights from Los Angeles to Munich and Washington, plus accommodation, so Ars could be briefed on the iX3. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>MUNICH—BMW's next model launch is an important one. When the new iX3 goes on sale in Europe later this year, then here in North America in 2026, it will be the first of a new family of electric BMWs, built using an advanced new platform known <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/heres-bmws-electric-replacement-for-the-x3-production-starts-in-2025/">as the Neue Klasse,</a> as an homage to the original Neue Klasse of the 1960s that helped BMW define its image for decades. Some of what we know about the new iX3—including what it looks like—has to remain under wraps for another few weeks, but for now, we can say that this should be BMW's most sustainable production car to date. Here's why.</p>
<p>BMW has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/09/gallery-the-highlights-of-bmws-museum-in-munich/">always built interesting concept cars</a>, even if some of its ideas—like the fabric bodywork of the GINA Light Visionary Model—have never made it to production. One of my favorite BMW concepts of late was probably the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/bmw-explores-recycling-with-the-i-vision-circular-concept/">i Vision Circular</a>, which the automaker showed off in 2021—not so much for the car itself but for the construction techniques it previewed, some of which have shown up in the iX3.</p>
<p>That includes the heavy use of mono materials. Making the center console out of just one kind of plastic means it's far easier to recycle at the end of the car's life. BMW also significantly upped the use of secondary materials in the car: About 1,600 lbs-worth (740 kg) is recycled material, including half of all the lithium, cobalt, and nickel in the battery pack; 70 percent of the aluminum in the alloy wheels; and 80 percent of the aluminum in the wheel carriers. The frunk is made from plastic containing 30 percent recycled fishing nets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/how-bmw-slashed-the-carbon-footprint-of-its-next-ev-the-2026-ix3/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For years, Philip Goulder has been obsessed with a particularly captivating idea: In the hunt for an HIV cure, could children hold the answers?</p>
<p>Starting in the mid-2010s, the University of Oxford pediatrician and immunologist began working with scientists in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, with the aim of tracking several hundred children who had acquired HIV from their mothers, either during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.</p>
<p>After putting the children on antiretroviral drugs early in their lives to control the virus, Goulder and his colleagues were keen to monitor their progress and adherence to standard antiretroviral treatment, which stops HIV from replicating. But over the following decade, something unusual happened. Five of the children stopped coming to the clinic to collect their drugs, and when the team eventually tracked them down many months later, they appeared to be in perfect health.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/five-children-see-hiv-viral-loads-vanish-after-taking-antiretroviral-drugs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Silicon Valley's AI talent war just reached a compensation milestone that makes even the most legendary scientific achievements of the past look financially modest. When Meta <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/ai-researchers-nba-stars.html">recently offered</a> AI researcher Matt Deitke $250 million over four years (an average of $62.5 million per year)—with potentially $100 million in the first year alone—it shattered every historical precedent for scientific and technical compensation we can find on record. That includes salaries during the development of major scientific milestones of the 20th century.</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/ai-pay-matt-deitke-meta.html">reported</a> that Deitke had cofounded a startup called <a href="https://vercept.com/">Vercept</a> and previously led the development of Molmo, a multimodal AI system, at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. His expertise in systems that juggle images, sounds, and text—exactly the kind of technology Meta wants to build—made him a prime target for recruitment. But he's not alone: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-researcher-declines-1-billion-offer-meta-mark-zuckerberg">reportedly</a> also offered an unnamed AI engineer $1 billion in compensation to be paid out over several years. What's going on?</p>
<p>These astronomical sums reflect what tech companies believe is at stake: a race to create <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI) or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/after-ai-setbacks-meta-bets-billions-on-undefined-superintelligence/">superintelligence</a>—machines capable of performing intellectual tasks at or beyond the human level. Meta, Google, OpenAI, and others are betting that whoever achieves this breakthrough first could dominate markets worth trillions. Whether this vision is realistic or merely Silicon Valley hype, it's driving compensation to unprecedented levels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/at-250-million-top-ai-salaries-dwarf-those-of-the-manhattan-project-and-the-space-race/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The vote rescinded $1.1 billion that Congress had allocated to CPB to fund public broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. In a press release, CPB explained that the cuts "excluded funding for CPB for the first time in more than five decades." CPB president and CEO Patricia Harrison said the corporation had no choice but to prepare to shut down.</p>
<p>"Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations," Harrison said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/corporation-for-public-broadcasting-will-shut-down-in-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Vaccination rates among the country's kindergartners have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html">fallen once again</a>, with coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination dropping from 92.7 percent in the 2023–2024 school year to 92.5 percent in 2024–2025. The percentage changes are small across the board, but they represent thousands of children and an ongoing downward trend that makes the country more vulnerable to outbreaks.</p>
<p>In the latest school year, an estimated 286,000 young children were not fully protected against measles. At the same time, the country has seen numerous explosive measles outbreaks, with case counts in 2025 already higher than any other year since the highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in 2000. In fact, the case count is at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/measles-cases-reach-33-year-high-as-rfk-jr-pursues-anti-vaccine-agenda/">a 33-year high</a>.</p>
<p>The latest small decline is one in a series that is eroding the nation's ability to keep bygone infectious diseases at bay. In the 2019–2020 school year, 95 percent of kindergartners were protected against measles and other serious childhood diseases, such as polio. That 95 percent coverage is the target that health experts say prevents an infectious disease from spreading in a community. But amid the pandemic, vaccination rates fell, dropping to 93.9 percent MMR coverage in the 2020–2021 year, and have kept creeping downward.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/under-rfk-jr-cdc-skips-study-on-vaccination-rates-quietly-posts-data-on-drop/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla was found partially liable in a wrongful death lawsuit in a federal court in Miami today. It's the first time that a jury has found against the car company in a wrongful death case involving its Autopilot driver assistance system—previous cases have been dismissed or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-settles-autopilot-wrongful-death-suit-avoiding-court-trial/">settled</a>.</p>
<p>In 2019, George McGee was operating his Tesla Model S using Autopilot when he ran past a stop sign and through an intersection at 62 mph then struck a pair of people stargazing by the side of the road. Naibel Benavides was killed and her partner Dillon Angulo was left with a severe head injury.</p>
<p>While Tesla said that McGee was solely responsible, as the driver of the car, McGee told the court that he thought Autopilot "would assist me should I have a failure or should I miss something, should I make a mistake," a perception that Tesla and its CEO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/musk-oversaw-staged-tesla-self-driving-video-emails-show/">Elon Musk</a> has done much to foster with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/in-2017-the-feds-said-tesla-autopilot-cut-crashes-40-that-was-bogus/">highly misleading statistics</a> that paint an impression of a brand that is much safer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/teslas-using-autopilot-crashed-273-times-in-less-than-a-year/">than in reality</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/tesla-loses-autopilot-wrongful-death-case-in-329-million-verdict/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has placed unbelievable pressure on drone developers on both sides of the war, who have responded with astounding innovations that include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn47e5qyno">fiber-optic drones</a> (to prevent radio jamming)</li>
<li>kamikaze <a href="https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/07/under-wraps-no-more-ukraines-original-naval-drone-revealed/">sea drones</a>, eventually equipped with anti-air missiles</li>
<li>drones that fire shotguns</li>
<li>bomber drones that drop mines and grenades</li>
<li>drones that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/ukrainian-drones-now-spray-2500-c-thermite-streams-right-into-russian-trenches/">release flaming thermite</a> into trenches</li>
<li>long-range, <a href="https://www.uav.org/meet-liutyi-ukraines-homegrown-drone-behind-strikes-on-r/">aircraft-style drones</a> that can substitute for small cruise missiles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2025/07/15/ukraine-deploying-tens-of-thousands-of-interceptors-to-stop-shaheds/">interceptor drones</a> that hunt down other drones</li>
<li>first-person view (FPV) drones so maneuverable they can be piloted right through a broken window pane to hit indoor targets</li>
<li>ground drones for both combat and transport</li>
</ul>
<p>Many drone developers are now chasing the next big thing—AI built right into the drone, allowing it to make autonomous targeting decisions if its communication links are cut.</p>
<p>But sometimes you don't need high-tech software, agility, or stealth. Sometimes, you just need a <em>really, really big drone</em> that can carry an entire e-bike and deliver it to a soldier stranded several kilometers away.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/ukraine-rescues-soldier-via-drone-delivery-of-complete-e-bike/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>A lot has changed in the nearly eight years since then, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the rocky departure of Roscosmos leader Dmitry Rogozin in 2022 who was subsequently dispatched to the front lines of the war, several changes in NASA leadership, and more.</p>
<p>This drought in high-level meetings was finally broken this week when the relatively new leader of Roscosmos, Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Bakanov, visited the United States to view the launch of the Crew-11 mission from Florida, which included cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. Bakanov has also met with some of NASA's human spaceflight leaders at Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/the-curious-case-of-russias-charm-offensive-with-nasa-this-week/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Faced with mounting backlash, OpenAI removed a controversial ChatGPT feature that caused some users to unintentionally allow their private—and highly personal—chats to appear in search results.</p>
<p>Fast Company exposed the privacy issue on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91376687/google-indexing-chatgpt-conversations">reporting</a> that thousands of ChatGPT conversations were found in Google search results and likely only represented a sample of chats "visible to millions." While the indexing did not include identifying information about the ChatGPT users, some of their chats did share personal details—like highly specific descriptions of interpersonal relationships with friends and family members—perhaps making it possible to identify them, Fast Company found.</p>
<p>OpenAI's chief information security officer, Dane Stuckey, explained <a href="https://x.com/cryps1s/status/1951041845938499669">on X</a> that all users whose chats were exposed opted in to indexing their chats by clicking a box after choosing to share a chat.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-users-shocked-to-learn-their-chats-were-in-google-search-results/">Read full article</a></p>

Amazon said in a press release on Thursday that it has given early access of the generative AI voice assistant to “millions” of people. The product isn’t publicly available yet, and some advertised features are still unavailable, but Amazon’s CEO is already considering loading the chatbot up with ads.</p>
<p>During an investors call yesterday, as reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/amazon-ceo-wants-to-put-ads-in-your-alexa-conversations/">TechCrunch</a>, Andy Jassy noted that Alexa+ started rolling out as early access to some customers in the US and that a broader rollout, including internationally, should happen later this year. An analyst on the call asked Amazon executives about Alexa+'s potential for “increasing engagement” long term.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-amazon-q2-2025-earnings-beat-expectations-93CH-4164802">transcript</a> of the call, Jassy responded by saying, in part, "I think over time, there will be opportunities, you know, as people are engaging in more multi-turn conversations to have advertising play a role to help people find discovery and also as a lever to drive revenue."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/amazon-is-considering-shoving-ads-into-alexa-conversations/">Read full article</a></p>

In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. July's list includes the discovery of the tomb of the first Maya king of Caracol in Belize, the fluid dynamics of tacking a sailboat, how to determine how fast blood was traveling when it stained cotton fabric, and how the structure of elephant ears could lead to more efficient indoor temperature control in future building designs, among other fun stories.</p>

<p>Archaeologists Arlen and Diane Chase are the foremost experts on the ancient Maya city of Caracol in Belize and are helping to pioneer the use of airborne LiDAR to locate hidden structures in dense jungle, including a web of interconnected roadways and a cremation site in the center of the city's Northeast Acropolis plaza. They have been painstakingly excavating the site since the mid-1980s. Their <a href="https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2025/july/07102025-caracol-chase-discovery-maya-ruler.php">latest discovery</a> is the tomb of Te K'ab Chaak, Caracol's first ruler, who took the throne in 331 CE and founded a dynasty that lasted more than 460 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/research-roundup-7-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">Read full article</a></p>

Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">delayed</a> preorders of the Switch 2 in the US and increased accessory prices, and Microsoft gave its Series S and X consoles across-the-board price hikes<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">in May</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Nintendo is back for more, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">increasing prices</a> on the <em>original</em> Switch hardware, as well as some Amiibo, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nintendos-new-clock-tracks-your-movement-in-bed/">the Alarmo clock</a>, and some Switch and Switch 2 accessories. The price increases will formally take effect on August 3.</p>
<p>The company says that there are currently no price increases coming for the Switch 2 console, Nintendo Online memberships, and physical and digital Switch 2 games. But it didn't take future price increases off the table, noting that "price adjustments may be necessary in the future."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/citing-market-conditions-nintendo-hikes-prices-for-original-switch-consoles/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is unleashing its most powerful Gemini model today, but you probably won't be able to try it. After revealing Gemini 2.5 Deep Think <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/gemini-2-5-is-leaving-preview-just-in-time-for-googles-new-250-ai-subscription/">at the I/O conference back in May</a>, Google is making this AI available in the Gemini app. Deep Think is designed for the most complex queries, which means it uses more compute resources than other models. So it should come as no surprise that only those subscribing to Google's $250 AI Ultra plan will be able to access it.</p>
<p>Deep Think is based on the same foundation as Gemini 2.5 Pro, but it increases the "thinking time" with greater parallel analysis. According to Google, Deep Think explores multiple approaches to a problem, even revisiting and remixing the various hypotheses it generates. This process helps it create a higher-quality output.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US just launched its biggest effort yet to compensate victims of human trafficking, setting up a process to dole out $200 million from seizures related to shutting down the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/backpage-ceo-arrested-accused-of-running-worlds-top-online-brothel/">notorious online escorts ad service Backpage.com</a>.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-department-justice-announces-compensation-process-victims-trafficked-through-backpagecom">announcement</a> on Thursday, the Department of Justice confirmed that "this marks the largest remission process to date to compensate victims of human trafficking."</p>
<p>Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti said the effort to redistribute millions of ill-gotten gains "underscores the Department’s unwavering commitment to use forfeiture to take the profit out of crime and to compensate victims." It comes after Backpage's "owners and key executives and businesses related to the platform" were found guilty of facilitating crimes including money laundering and "unlawful commercial sex using a facility in interstate or foreign commerce," the DOJ said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/backpage-scandal-ends-in-largest-us-payout-to-trafficking-victims/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The mid-engine sports car is an increasingly rare breed, but Lotus still carries the torch with its Emira, which is available with a choice of supercharged V6 or turbocharged inline-four cylinder engines. Between its steering, compact dimensions, standard manual transmission, and low mass, it’s a breath of fresh air, and it's ready to capture the hearts of enthusiasts. Pricing starts at $102,250 for the V6, which is in direct competition with the Porsche 718 Cayman GTS while it lasts, and a sea of mostly cosmetic options inflated this example to $116,950.</p>
<p>Like many Lotuses before it, the Emira’s foundation is a bonded aluminum chassis with Bilstein passive damper-equipped double-wishbone suspension at all four corners and the engine mounted right behind the seats. Curb weight isn’t as low as you’d think at 3,187 lbs (1,445 kg), but it’s contained within an overall length, width (sans mirrors), and height of 173, 75, and 48 inches (4,395 mm, 1,905 mm, 1,220 mm), respectively.</p>
<p>Mid-engine layouts generally put the same components like radiators in the same places, and the Emira's shape follows its predecessors (as well as cars from McLaren or Ferrari) with large intake ducts straked across its doors and rear fenders, a low nose, and little overhang past the axles. In fact, these are key in its sense-of-occasion appeal; climbing over its door sills and into its driver position is teeming with "let’s go" energy, and the view out the windshield—fenders, short nose, and all—is more exotic than anything else at its price.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/lotus-still-knows-how-to-make-a-drivers-car-the-2025-emira-v6-driven/">Read full article</a></p>

The change was announced quietly <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/education/windows/windows-11-se-overview#cw">via this Microsoft support document</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.drwindows.de/news/windows-11-se-microsoft-stampft-sonderedition-fuer-den-bildungsbereich-ein">the German-language site Dr. Windows</a>), which says that Windows 11 SE will not be getting a version of this year's Windows 11 25H2 update. Security updates for Windows 11 SE will end in October of 2026, when Windows 11 24H2 stops receiving updates.</p>
<p>"Support for Windows 11 SE—including software updates, technical assistance, and security fixes—will end in October 2026," the document reads. "While your device will continue to work, we recommend transitioning to a device that supports another edition of Windows 11 to ensure continued support and security."</p>
<p>Microsoft has fielded multiple would-be ChromeOS competitors over the years, looking to prevent, suspend, and/or reverse Google's success in selling the laptops to schools and price-conscious laptop buyers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/microsoft-kills-windows-11-se-another-in-a-long-line-of-failed-chromeos-competitors/">Read full article</a></p>
