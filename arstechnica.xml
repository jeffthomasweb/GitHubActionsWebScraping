                            <![CDATA[<p>You just can’t ignore the effects of the generative AI boom.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t go looking for AI bots, they’re being integrated into virtually every product and service. And for what? There’s a lot of hand-wavey chatter about agentic this and AGI that, but what can “gen AI” do for you right now? <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/googles-gemini-powered-smart-home-revamp-is-here-with-a-new-app-and-cameras/">Gemini for Home</a> is Google’s latest attempt to make this technology useful, integrating Gemini with the smart home devices people already have. Anyone paying for extended video history in the Home app is about to get a heaping helping of AI, including daily summaries, AI-labeled notifications, and more.</p>
<p>Given the supposed power of AI models like Gemini, recognizing events in a couple of videos and answering questions about them doesn’t seem like a bridge too far. And yet Gemini for Home has demonstrated a tenuous grasp of the truth, which can lead to some disquieting interactions, like periodic warnings of home invasion, both human and animal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/unexpectedly-a-deer-briefly-entered-the-family-room-living-with-gemini-home/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><strong>Skyroot nearing first launch with big ambitions</strong>. Three years after India opened up its space sector to private companies, Hyderabad-based Skyroot Aerospace is targeting its first full-scale commercial satellite launch mission in January 2026, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/india-space-startup-skyroot-private-rocket-launch-11761623312736.html">Mint reports</a>. After this debut flight, Skyroot is targeting a launch every three months next year, and one every month from 2027. Each satellite launch mission is expected to generate the company nearly $5 million, according to Skyroot chief executive Pawan Chandana.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/rocket-report-chinas-moon-rocket-to-debut-soon-arcaspace-is-back-sort-of/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Siblings Casey and Calley Means—wellness darlings of the Make America Healthy Again movement, despite being rife with potential conflicts of interest—are both missing from the political arena, at least for now.</p>
<p>Casey Means, President Trump’s nominee for surgeon general, was scheduled to appear virtually at a Senate confirmation hearing today, but the hearing was postponed indefinitely after she went into labor. The hearing, it turns out, had been scheduled two days after her due date, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/casey-means-surgeon-general-hearing-delayed-labor">CNN reported this morning</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/health/calley-means-kennedy-adviser-departure.html">The New York Times separately reported</a> that Calley Means has departed from the White House, vacating his role as a “Special Government Employee,” which has a 130-day term limit. The Times reported that Calley left about a month ago when the term ended, though the White House never announced his departure, and he has continued to be identified as a government employee in press articles and at a conference. Calley, who has acted as an influential advisor to anti-vaccine health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told the Times that the press articles and his conference biography were inaccurate.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/the-means-siblings-darlings-of-maha-both-out-of-the-trump-admin-for-now/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The saga of a 61-year-old man jailed for more than a month after reposting a Facebook meme has ended, but free speech advocates are still reeling in the wake.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Larry Bushart was released from Perry County Jail, where he had spent weeks unable to make bail, which a judge set at $2 million. Prosecutors have not explained why the charges against him were dropped, according <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/10/30/larry-bushart-tennessee-free-speech-charlie-kirk-meme/">to The Intercept</a>, which has been tracking the case closely. However, officials faced mounting pressure following media coverage and a social media campaign called “Free Larry Bushart,” which stoked widespread concern over suspected police censorship of a US citizen over his political views.</p>
<h2>How a meme landed a man in jail</h2>
<p>Bushart’s arrest came after he decided to troll a message thread about a Charlie Kirk vigil in a Facebook group called “What’s Happening in Perry County, TN.” He posted a meme showing a picture of Donald Trump saying, “We should get over it.” The meme included a caption that said “Donald Trump, on the Perry High School mass shooting, one day after,” and Bushart included a comment with his post that said, “This seems relevant today ….”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/man-finally-released-a-month-after-absurd-arrest-for-reposting-trump-meme/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Despite being a vast repository of personal information, smartphones used to have little by way of security. That has thankfully changed, but companies like Cellebrite offer law enforcement tools that can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/android-0-day-sold-by-cellebrite-exploited-to-hack-serbian-students-phone/">bypass security on some devices</a>. The company keeps the specifics quiet, but an anonymous individual recently logged in to a Cellebrite briefing and came away with a list of which of Google’s Pixel phones are vulnerable to Cellebrite phone hacking.</p>
<p>This person, who goes by the handle rogueFed, posted screenshots from the recent Microsoft Teams meeting to the <a href="https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/27698-new-cellebrite-capability-obtained-in-teams-meeting">GrapheneOS forums</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.404media.co/someone-snuck-into-a-cellebrite-microsoft-teams-call-and-leaked-phone-unlocking-details/">404 Media</a>). GrapheneOS is an Android-based operating system that can be installed on select phones, including Pixels. It ships with enhanced security features and no Google services. Because of its popularity among the security-conscious, Cellebrite apparently felt the need to include it in its matrix of Pixel phone support.</p>
<p>The screenshot includes data on the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9 family. It does not list the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-pixel-10-series-review-dont-call-it-an-android/">Pixel 10 series</a>, which launched just a few months ago. The phone support is split up into three different conditions: before first unlock, after first unlock, and unlocked. The before first unlock (BFU) state means the phone has not been unlocked since restarting, so all data is encrypted. This is traditionally the most secure state for a phone. In the after first unlock (AFU) state, data extraction is easier. And naturally, an unlocked phone is open season on your data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/leaker-reveals-which-pixels-are-vulnerable-to-cellebrite-phone-hacking/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When graphic design platform-provider Canva bought the Affinity image-editing and publishing apps early last year, we had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/canvas-affinity-acquisition-is-a-subscription-based-weapon-against-adobe/">some major questions</a> about how the companies’ priorities and products would mesh. How would Canva serve the users who preferred Affinity’s perpetually licensed apps to Adobe’s subscription-only software suite? And how would Affinity’s <a href="https://x.com/Affinity/status/1722628680302948394">strong stance against generative AI</a> be reconciled with Canva’s embrace of those technologies.</p>
<p>This week, Canva gave us definitive answers to all of those questions: a brand-new unified Affinity app that melds the Photo, Designer, and Publisher apps into a single piece of software called “Affinity by Canva” that is free to use with a Canva user account, but which gates generative AI features behind <a href="https://www.canva.com/pricing/#main">Canva’s existing paid subscription plans</a> ($120 a year for individuals).</p>
<p>This does seem like <em>mostly</em> good news, in the near to mid term, for existing Affinity app users who admired Affinity’s anti-AI stance: All three apps’ core features are free to use, and the stuff you’re being asked to pay for is stuff you mostly don’t want anyway. But it may come as unwelcome news for those who like the predictability of pay-once-own-forever software or are nervous about where Canva might draw the line between “free” and “premium” features down the line.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/canvas-new-affinity-app-is-free-to-use-but-locks-ai-features-behind-a-subscription/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We’re a few weeks away from the debut of the fifth and final season of <em>Stranger Things</em>—at least the first of three parts of it—and Netflix has dropped one doozy of a trailer that shows things looking pretty bleak for our small-town heroes of Hawkins.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for prior seasons below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/linda-hamilton-rocks-stranger-things-s5-extended-teaser/">previously reported</a>, S4 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/catching-up-with-stranger-things-s4-yes-we-have-some-feels/">ended with</a> Vecna—the Big Bad behind it all—opening the gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We’re getting a time jump for S5, but in a way, we’re coming full circle, since the events coincide with the third anniversary of Will’s original disappearance in S1. The fifth season will have eight episodes, and each one will be looong—akin to eight feature-length films.

<p>The administration claims that net neutrality rules are a form of rate regulation and thus not allowed under the US law that created the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. Commerce Department official Arielle Roth said that any state accepting BEAD funds must exempt Internet service providers from net neutrality and price regulations in all parts of the state, not only in areas where the ISP is given funds to deploy broadband service.</p>
<p>States could object to the NTIA decisions and sue the US government. But even a successful lawsuit could take years and leave unserved homes without broadband for the foreseeable future.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trump-admin-demands-states-exempt-isps-from-net-neutrality-and-price-laws/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/">told Reuters</a> during a livestream that going public “is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have.” Now sources familiar with the matter say the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, with filings possible as early as the second half of 2026. However, news of the potential IPO comes as the company faces mounting losses that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/microsoft_earnings_q1_26_openai_loss/">may have reached</a> as much as $11.5 billion in the most recent quarter, according to one estimate.</p>
<p>Going public could give OpenAI more efficient access to capital and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping finance Altman’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/sam-altman-calls-ai-a-bubble-while-seeking-500b-valuation-for-openai/">plans</a> to spend trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking who spoke with Reuters. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates the company targets a 2027 IPO listing, while some financial advisors predict 2026 could be possible.</p>
<p>Three people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters that OpenAI has discussed raising $60 billion at the low end in preliminary talks. That figure refers to how much money the company would raise by selling shares to investors, not the total worth of the company. If OpenAI sold that amount of stock while keeping most shares private, the entire company could be valued at $1 trillion or more. The final figures and timing will likely change based on business growth and market conditions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/is-openai-worth-1-trillion-potential-ipo-may-reveal-the-answer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Disney+ has started streaming movies and shows in the HDR10+ format.</p>
<p>Support is somewhat limited for now. Only certain content from Hulu, which The Walt Disney Company acquired in June, is available in HDR10+. In an announcement today, Samsung said that “over 1,000” Hulu titles are available in HDR10+ and that “additional Disney+” content will support HDR10+ “in the future.” Previously, Disney+ only supported the HDR10 and Dolby Vision HDR formats.</p>
<p>Samsung TVs are the first devices to gain the ability to stream HDR10+ content from Disney+, according to an announcement from Samsung today. The electronics company said that its Samsung Crystal UHD TVs and above from 2018 onward, including its OLED TVs, The Frame TVs, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/overblown-quantum-dot-conspiracy-theories-make-important-points-about-qled-tvs/">QLED TVs</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/samsungs-micro-rgb-tv-proves-the-value-of-rgb-backlights-for-premium-displays/">Micro RGB TV</a>, support HDR10+.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/disney-gets-hdr10-through-over-1000-hulu-titles/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For four decades, a frequently acrimonious debate has raged in paleontological circles about the correct taxonomy for a handful of rare fossil specimens. One faction insisted the fossils were juvenile <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>; the other argued that they represented a new species dubbed <em>Nanotyrannus lancensis</em>. Now, paleontologists believe they have settled the debate once and for all due to a new analysis of a well-preserved fossil.</p>
<p>The verdict: It is indeed a new species, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature. The authors also reclassified another specimen as a second new species, distinct from <em>N. lancensis</em>. In short, <em>Nanotyrannus</em> is a valid taxon and contains two species.</p>
<p>“This fossil doesn’t just settle the debate,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1103512?">said Lindsay Zanno</a>, a paleontologist at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. “It flips decades of <em>T. rex</em> research on its head.” That’s because paleontologists have relied on such fossils to model the growth and behavior of <em>T. rex.</em> The new findings suggest that there could have been multiple tyrannosaur species and that paleontologists have been underestimating the diversity of dinosaurs from this period.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/nanotyrannus-species-confirmed-its-not-just-a-baby-t-rex/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Since launching Google Play (née Android Market) in 2008, Google has never made a change to the US store that it didn’t want to make—until now. Having <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-orders-google-to-distribute-third-party-app-stores-on-google-play/">lost the antitrust case</a> brought by Epic Games, Google has implemented the first phase of changes mandated by the court. Developers operating in the Play Store will have more freedom to direct app users to resources outside the Google bubble. However, Google has not given up hope of reversing its loss before it’s forced to make bigger changes.</p>
<p>Epic began pursuing this case in 2020, stemming from its attempt to sell <em>Fortnite</em> content without going through Google’s payment system. It filed a similar case against Apple, but the company fell short there because it could not show that Apple put its thumb on the scale. Google, however, engaged in conduct that amounted to suppressing the development of alternative Android app stores. It lost the case and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">came up short on appeal</a> this past summer, leaving the company with little choice but to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>Google has updated its <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/15582165">support pages</a> to confirm that it’s abiding by the court’s order. In the US, Play Store developers now have the option of using external payment platforms that bypass the Play Store entirely. This could hypothetically allow developers to offer lower prices, as they don’t have to pay Google’s commission, which can be up to 30 percent. Devs will also be permitted to direct users to sources for app downloads and payment methods outside the Play Store.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-begins-loosening-developer-restrictions-in-play-store-against-its-will/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Character.AI <a href="https://blog.character.ai/u18-chat-announcement/">announced</a> it will bar anyone under the age of 18 from open-ended chats with its AI characters starting on November 25, implementing one of the most restrictive age policies yet among AI chatbot platforms. The company faces <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/chatbots-posed-as-therapist-and-adult-lover-in-teen-suicide-case-lawsuit-says/">multiple lawsuits</a> from families who say its chatbots contributed to teenager deaths by suicide.</p>
<p>Over the next month, Character.AI says it will ramp down chatbot use among minors by identifying them and placing a two-hour daily limit on their chatbot access. The company plans to use technology to detect underage users based on conversations and interactions on the platform, as well as information from connected social media accounts. On November 25, those users will no longer be able to create or talk to chatbots, though they can still read previous conversations. The company said it is working to build alternative features for users under the age of 18, such as the ability to create videos, stories, and streams with AI characters.</p>
<p>Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/technology/characterai-underage-users.html">told</a> The New York Times that the company wants to set an example for the industry. “We’re making a very bold step to say for teen users, chatbots are not the way for entertainment, but there are much better ways to serve them,” Anand said in the interview. The company also plans to establish an AI safety lab.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/10/after-teen-death-lawsuits-character-ai-will-restrict-chats-for-under-18-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US inched one step closer to taking over TikTok’s algorithm after President Donald Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday.</p>
<p>Neither leader confirmed that China has agreed to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/china-keeps-the-algorithm-critics-attack-trumps-tiktok-deal/">terms of Trump’s proposed deal</a>, which would create a US version of TikTok that licenses the Chinese-owned algorithm. But the Chinese Commerce Ministry provided a <a href="https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_c42035acf50846ffb9fb4761ee224faf.html">statement</a> following the meeting; translated, it indicates that “China will properly resolve TikTok-related issues with the United States.”</p>
<p>Trump, who has long <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/trump-told-scotus-he-plans-to-make-a-deal-to-save-tiktok/">vowed to “save” TikTok</a>, was notably silent on Thursday, but US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News ahead of Trump’s meeting with Xi that “we finalized the TikTok agreement in terms of getting Chinese approval.” According to Bessent, the deal will “finally” be resolved over the “coming weeks and months,” Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-us-trade-deal-could-be-signed-next-week-us-treasurys-bessent-says-2025-10-30/">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/us-creeps-closer-to-controlling-tiktok-after-trump-xi-meeting/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Solar power developers want to cover an area larger than Washington, DC, with silicon panels and batteries, converting sunlight into electricity that will power air conditioners in sweltering Las Vegas along with millions of other homes and businesses.</p>
<p>But earlier this month, bureaucrats in charge of federal lands scrapped collective approval for the Esmeralda 7 projects, in what campaigners fear is part of an attack on renewable energy under President Donald Trump. “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying [sic] Solar,” he posted on his Truth Social platform in August. Developers will need to reapply individually, slowing progress.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/theres-a-global-boom-in-solar-except-in-the-united-states/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There has been much discussion in the space community recently about building large data centers in orbit to avoid the environmental consequences of sprawling computing facilities on Earth. These space-based data centers could take advantage of the always-on, free fusion reactor at the center of the Solar System.</p>
<p>Proponents say this represents a natural step in the evolution of moving heavy industry off the planet’s surface and a solution for the ravenous energy needs of artificial intelligence. Critics say building data centers in space is technically very challenging and cite major hurdles, such as radiating away large amounts of heat and the cost of accessing space.</p>
<p>It is unclear who is right, but one thing is certain: Such facilities would need to be massive to support artificial intelligence.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/an-in-space-construction-firm-says-it-can-help-build-massive-data-centers-in-orbit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Just a few weeks ago, automakers were celebrating a healthy third quarter for electric vehicle sales. General Motors was looking particularly flush, with EV sales up 104 percent for the year to date compared to the first nine months of 2024. But the strong EV sales in Q3 were seemingly due to the imminent end of the federal tax credit that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/its-october-1-so-the-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-is-dead-now/">expired at the end of September</a>, with many consumers buying a car sooner than planned to take advantage of the $7,500 incentive.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has been altering the regulatory environment in other ways to discourage clean technologies, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/trumps-trade-and-environment-policies-are-a-disaster-for-car-makers/">canceling infrastructure initiatives</a> and turning <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/feds-let-automakers-off-the-hook-for-fuel-economy-violations/">a blind eye to pollution</a>. On top of that, the impact of the president’s chaotic trade war has driven up prices and is cooling demand. Two weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/gms-ev-push-will-cost-it-1-6-billion-in-q3-with-end-of-the-tax-credit/">GM told investors</a> that things are looking so bad that it will take a $1.6 billion hit to its bank accounts as it realigns manufacturing capacity going forward.</p>
<p>Now we can see some of the impact of that realignment. <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2025/10/29/gm-cutting-hundreds-of-jobs-at-detroit-tennessee-ohio-ev-sites/86962834007/">According to The Detroit News</a>, 1,200 workers are being laid off at GM’s EV-building Hamtramck Assembly Center near Detroit, which will move from two shifts a day to just one in early January.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/weak-ev-demand-sees-gm-lay-off-1700-workers-at-two-plants/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s spooky season, and what better way to spend Halloween weekend than settling in to watch a classic Hollywood ghost story? To help you figure out what to watch, we’ve compiled a handy list of 15 classic ghost stories, presented in chronological order.</p>
<p>What makes a good ghost story? Everyone’s criteria (and taste) will differ, but for this list, we’ve focused on more traditional elements. There’s usually a spooky old house with a ghostly presence and/or someone who’s attuned to said presence. The living must solve the mystery of what happened to trap the ghost(s) there in hopes of setting said ghost(s) free. In that sense, the best, most satisfying ghost stories are mysteries—and sometimes <a href="https://electricliterature.com/the-best-ghost-stories-are-really-love-stories/">also love stories</a>. The horror is more psychological, and when it comes to gore, less is usually more.</p>
<p>As always, the list below isn’t meant to be exhaustive. Mostly, we’re going for a certain atmospheric vibe to set a mood. So our list omits overt comedies like <em>Ghostbusters</em> and (arguably) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(1990_film)"><em>Ghost</em></a>, as well as supernatural horror involving demonic possession—<em>The Exorcist, The Conjuring</em>, <em>Insidious—</em>or monsters, like <em>The Babadook</em> or <em>Sinister</em>. Feel free to suggest your own recommendations in the comments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/10/halloween-film-fest-15-classic-ghost-stories/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, Meta asked a US district court to toss a lawsuit alleging that the tech giant <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/meta-pirated-and-seeded-porn-for-years-to-train-ai-lawsuit-says/">illegally torrented pornography to train AI</a>.</p>
<p>The move comes after Strike 3 Holdings discovered illegal downloads of some of its adult films on Meta corporate IP addresses, as well as other downloads that Meta allegedly concealed using a “stealth network” of 2,500 “hidden IP addresses.” Accusing Meta of stealing porn to secretly train an unannounced adult version of its AI model powering Movie Gen, Strike 3 sought damages that could have exceeded $350 million, TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/meta-pirated-adult-film-downloads-were-for-personal-use-not-ai-training/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Filing a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Strike-3-Holdings-v-Meta-Motion-to-DIsmiss-10-27-25.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> the lawsuit on Monday, Meta accused Strike 3 of relying on “guesswork and innuendo,” while writing that Strike 3 “has been labeled by some as a ‘copyright troll’ that files extortive lawsuits.” Requesting that all copyright claims be dropped, Meta argued that there was no evidence that the tech giant directed any of the downloads of about 2,400 adult movies owned by Strike 3—or was even aware of the illegal activity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/meta-says-porn-downloads-on-its-ips-were-for-personal-use-not-ai-training/">Read full article</a></p>
