<p>Marvel Studios decided to ring in the new year with a fresh trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Man_(miniseries)"><em>Wonder Man</em></a>, its eight-episode miniseries premiering later this month on Disney+. Part of the MCU’s Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton (<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings</em>) and Andrew Guest (<em>Hawkeye</em>), with Guest serving as showrunner.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/marvel-gets-meta-with-wonder-man-teaser/">previously reported</a>, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stars as Simon Williams, aka Wonder Man, an actor and stunt person with actual superpowers who decides to audition for the lead role in a superhero TV series—a reboot of an earlier Wonder Man incarnation. Demetrius Grosse plays Simon’s brother, Eric, aka Grim Reaper; Ed Harris plays Simon’s agent, Neal Saroyan; and Arian Moayed plays P. Clearly, an agent with the Department of Damage Control. Lauren Glazier, Josh Gad, Byron Bowers, Bechir Sylvain, and Manny McCord will also appear in as-yet-undisclosed roles</p>
<p>Rounding out the cast is Ben Kingsley, reprising his MCU role as failed actor Trevor Slattery. You may recall Slattery from 2013’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_3"><em>Iron Man 3</em></a>, hired by the villain of that film to pretend to be the leader of an international terrorist organization called the <a title="Ten Rings (organization)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Rings_(organization)">Ten Rings.</a>Slattery showed up again in 2021’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang-Chi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings"><em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,</em></a>rehabilitated after a stint in prison; he helped the titular Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) on his journey to the mythical village of Ta Lo.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/marvel-rings-in-new-year-with-wonder-man-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we’ve featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we’ve experimented with a monthly collection. December’s list includes a fossilized bird that choked to death on rocks; a double-detonating "superkilonova"; recovering an ancient seafarer's fingerprint; the biomechanics of kangaroo movement; and cracking a dark matter puzzle that stumped fictional physicists on <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, among other tantalizing tidbits</p>
<h2>Secrets of kangaroo posture</h2>

<p>Kangaroos and wallabies belong to a class of animals called macropods, with unique form and style of movement. Their four limbs and tail all contact the ground at slow speeds, while they use a hopping gait at higher speeds. Typically, high-speed movements are more energy-intensive than slow-speed motion, but the opposite is true for macropods like kangaroos; somehow the hopping speed and energy cost become uncoupled. According to <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96437">a paper</a> published in the journal eLife, this may be due to changes in a kangaroo's posture at higher hopping speeds.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/research-roundup-7-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed-2/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We’re far from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/the-tv-streaming-apps-broke-their-promises-and-now-theyre-jacking-the-price/">streaming’s original promise</a>: instant access to beloved and undiscovered titles without the burden of ads, bundled services, or price gouging that have long been associated with cable.</p>
<p>Still, every year we get more dependent on streaming for entertainment. Despite streaming services’ flaws, many of us are bound to keep subscribing to at least one service next year. Here’s what we can expect in 2026 and beyond.</p>
<h2>Subscription prices keep rising, but perhaps not as expected</h2>
<p>There’s virtually no hope of streaming subscription prices plateauing in 2026. Streaming companies continue to face challenges as content production and licensing costs rise, and it's often easier to get current customers to pay slightly more than to acquire new subscribers. Meanwhile, many streaming companies are still struggling with profitability and revenue after spending years focusing on winning subscribers with content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/streaming-stops-feeling-infinite-what-subscribers-can-expect-in-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything too major, please note this list does include a few specific references that some might consider spoiler-y.</em></p>
<p>It's been a strange year for movies. Most of the big, splashy tentpole projects proved disappointing, while several more modest films either produced or acquired by streaming platforms—and only briefly released in theaters—wound up making our year-end list. This pattern was not intentional. But streaming platforms have been increasingly moving into the film space with small to medium-sized budgets—i.e., the kind of fare that used to be commonplace but has struggled to compete over the last two decades as blockbusters and elaborate superhero franchises dominated the box office.</p>
<p>Add in lingering superhero fatigue—only one superhero saga made our final list this year—plus Netflix's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/paramount-says-it-could-get-antitrust-approval-for-wbd-before-netflix/">controversial bid</a> to acquire Warner Bros., and we just might be approaching a sea change in how movies are made and distributed, and by whom. How this all plays out in the coming year is anybody's guess.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/film-technica-our-top-picks-for-the-best-films-of-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[This time, a Colorado plant scheduled to shut down will be kept on standby.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued a now familiar order: because of a supposed energy emergency, a coal plant scheduled for closure would be forced to remain open. This time, the order targeted one of the three units present at Craig Station in Colorado, which was scheduled to close at the end of this year. The remaining two units were expected to shut in 2028.</p>
<p>The supposed reason for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/documents/federal-power-act-section-202c-craig-order-no-202-25-14">this order</a> is an emergency caused by a shortage of generating capacity. "The reliable supply of power from the coal plant is essential for keeping the region’s electric grid stable," according to a statement issued by the Department of Energy. Yet <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/11/14/tri-state-craig-station-trump-federal-power-act-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">the Colorado Sun notes</a> that Colorado's Public Utilities Commission had already analyzed the impact of its potential closure, and determined, "Craig Unit 1 is not required for reliability or resource adequacy purposes."</p>
<p>The order does not require the plant to actually produce electricity; instead, it is ordered to be available in case a shortfall in production occurs. As noted in the Colorado Sun article, actual operation of the plant would potentially violate Colorado laws, which regulate airborne pollution and set limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The cost of maintaining the plant is likely to fall on the local ratepayers, who <a href="https://www.rmpbs.org/blogs/science-environment/craig-coal-plant-closure">had already adjusted</a> to the closure plans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trump-admin-orders-another-coal-plant-to-stay-open/">Read full article</a></p>

Supply-chain attacks played prominently again this year, as a seemingly unending rash of them hit organizations large and small.</p>
<p>For threat actors, supply-chain attacks are the gift that keeps on giving—or, if you will, the hack that keeps on hacking. By compromising a single target with a large number of downstream users—say a cloud service or maintainers or developers of widely used open source or proprietary software—attackers can infect potentially millions of the target’s downstream users. That’s exactly what threat actors did in 2025.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/backdoor-slips-into-popular-code-library-drains-155k-from-digital-wallets/">such event</a> occurred in December 2024, making it worthy of a ranking for 2025.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Following two years of immense hype in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/a-song-of-hype-and-fire-the-10-biggest-ai-stories-of-2023/">2023</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/">2024</a>, this year felt more like a settling-in period for the LLM-based token prediction industry. After more than two years of public fretting over AI models as future <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/openai-execs-warn-of-risk-of-extinction-from-artificial-intelligence-in-new-open-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threats</a> to human civilization or the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/after-ai-setbacks-meta-bets-billions-on-undefined-superintelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seedlings of future gods</a>, it's starting to look like hype is giving way to pragmatism: Today's AI can be very useful, but it's also clearly imperfect and prone to mistakes.</p>
<p>That view isn't universal, of course. There's a lot of money (and rhetoric) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ars-live-recap-is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-pop-ed-zitron-weighs-in/">betting</a> on a stratospheric, world-rocking trajectory for AI. But the "when" keeps getting pushed back, and that's because nearly everyone agrees that more significant technical breakthroughs are required. The original, lofty <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">claims</a> that we're on the verge of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence (ASI) have not disappeared. Still, there's a growing awareness that such proclaimations are perhaps best viewed as venture capital marketing. And every commercial foundational model builder out there has to grapple with the reality that, if they're going to make money <em>now</em>, they have to sell practical AI-powered solutions that perform as reliable tools.</p>
<p>This has made 2025 a year of wild juxtapositions. For example, in January, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/sam-altman-says-we-are-now-confident-we-know-how-to-build-agi/">claimed</a> that the company knew how to build <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">AGI</a>, but by November, he was publicly celebrating that GPT-5.1 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/forget-agi-sam-altman-celebrates-chatgpt-finally-following-em-dash-formatting-rules/">finally learned</a> to use em dashes correctly when instructed (but not always). Nvidia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/nvidia-hits-record-5-trillion-mark-as-ceo-dismisses-ai-bubble-concerns/">soared</a> past a $5 trillion valuation, with Wall Street still projecting high price targets for that company's stock while some banks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/bank-of-england-warns-ai-stock-bubble-rivals-2000-dotcom-peak/">warned</a> of the potential for an AI bubble that might rival the 2000s dotcom crash.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/from-prophet-to-product-how-ai-came-back-down-to-earth-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Freedom of speech is a foundational principle of healthy democracies and hence a primary target for aspiring authoritarians, who typically try to squash dissent. There is a point where the threat from authorities is sufficiently severe that a population will self-censor rather than risk punishment. Social media has complicated matters, blurring traditional boundaries between public and private speech, while new technologies such as facial recognition and moderation algorithms give authoritarians powerful new tools.</p>
<p>Researchers explored the nuanced dynamics of how people balance their desire to speak out vs their fear of punishment in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508028122">a paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>The authors had previously worked together on a model of political polarization, a project that wrapped up right around the time the social media space was experiencing significant changes in the ways different platforms were handling moderation. Some adopted a decidedly hands-off approach with little to no moderation. Weibo, on the other hand, began releasing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/tech/weibo-user-location-bad-behavior#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWeibo%20has%20always%20been%20committed,of%20the%20user's%20IP%20address.&amp;text=Last%20month%2C%20Weibo%20said%20it,Russia%20over%20the%20ongoing%20war.">the IP addresses</a> of people who posted objectionable commentary, essentially making them targets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/the-science-of-how-and-when-we-decide-to-speak-out-or-self-censor/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/nih-agrees-to-evaluate-and-complete-review-on-stalled-scientific-grant-applications">announced</a> that it and other organizations representing medical researchers had <a href="https://www.aclu.org/documents/apha-v-nih-stipulation-agreement">reached a settlement</a> in their suit against the federal government over grant applications that had been rejected under a policy that has since been voided by the court. The agreement, which still has to be approved by the judge overseeing the case, would see the National Institutes of Health restart reviews of grants that had been blocked on ideological grounds. It doesn't guarantee those grants will ultimately be funded, but it does mean they will go through the standard peer review process.</p>
<p>The grants had previously been rejected without review because their content was ideologically opposed by the Trump administration. That policy has since been declared arbitrary and capricious, and thus in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
<h2>How'd we get here?</h2>
<p>Immediately after taking office, the Trump Administration identified a number of categories of research, some of them extremely vague, that it would not be supporting: climate change, DEI, pandemic preparedness, gender ideology, and more. Shortly thereafter, federal agencies started cancelling grants that they deemed to contain elements of these disfavored topics, and blocking consideration of grant applications for the same reasons. As a result, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/things-well-never-know-science-fair-highlights-us-canceled-research/">grants were cancelled</a> that funded everything from research into antiviral drugs to the incidence of prostate cancer in African Americans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/feds-researchers-settle-suit-over-grants-blocked-by-now-illegal-order/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Determining how "successful" Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) truly was depends on who you ask, but it's increasingly hard to claim that DOGE made any sizable dent in federal spending, which was its primary goal.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, Musk himself notably downplayed DOGE as only being "a little bit successful" on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz5Hjk40FD4">podcast</a>, marking one of the first times that Musk admitted DOGE didn't live up to its promise. Then, more recently, on Monday, Musk revived evidence-free claims he made while campaigning for Donald Trump, insisting that government fraud remained vast and unchecked, seemingly despite DOGE's efforts. On X, he estimated that "my lower bound guess for how much fraud there is nationally is [about 20 percent] of the Federal budget, which would mean $1.5 trillion per year. Probably much higher."</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/elon-musk-to-exit-government-upset-that-trump-bill-undermines-doges-work/">Musk loudly left DOGE</a> in May after clashing with Trump, complaining that a Trump budget bill threatened to undermine DOGE's work. These days, Musk does not appear confident that DOGE was worth the trouble of wading into government. Although he said on the December podcast that he considered DOGE to be his "best side quest" ever, the billionaire confirmed that if given the chance to go back in time, he probably would not have helmed the agency as a special government employee.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/doge-did-not-find-2t-in-fraud-but-that-doesnt-matter-musk-allies-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>MANVILLE, N.J.—Richard Onderko said he will never forget the terrifying Saturday morning back in 1971 when the water rose so swiftly at his childhood home here that he and his brother had to be rescued by boat as the torrential rain from the remnants of Hurricane Doria swept through the neighborhood.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time—or the last—that the town endured horrific downpours. In fact, the working-class town of 11,000, about 25 miles southwest of Newark, has long been known for getting swamped by tropical storms, nor’easters or even just a wicked rain. It was so bad, Onderko recalled, that the constant threat of flooding had strained his parents’ marriage, with his mom wanting to sell and his dad intent on staying.</p>
<p>Eventually, his parents moved to Florida, selling the two-story house on North Second Avenue in 1995. But the new homeowner didn’t do so well either when storms hit, and in 2015, the property was sold one final time: to a state-run program that buys and demolishes houses in flood zones and permanently restores the property to open space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/as-floods-become-more-severe-a-new-jersey-program-provides-a-model/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><em>Stranger Things</em> fans are hyped for the premiere of the hotly anticipated series finale on New Year's Eve: they'll either be glued to their TVs or heading out to watch it in a bona fide theater. Netflix has dropped one last trailer for the finale—not that it really needs to do anything more to boost anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for Vols. 1 and 2 below but no major Vol. 2 reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/stranger-things-s5-trailer-teases-vol-2/">previously reported</a>, in Vol. 1, we found Hawkins under military occupation and Vecna targeting a new group of young children in his human form under the pseudonym “Mr. Whatsit” (a nod to <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em>). He kidnapped Holly Wheeler and took her to the Upside Down, where she found an ally in Max, still in a coma, but with her consciousness hiding in one of Vecna’s old memories. Dustin was struggling to process his grief over losing Eddie Munson in S4, causing a rift with Steve. The rest of the gang was devoted to stockpiling supplies and helping Eleven and Hopper track down Vecna in the Upside Down. They found Kali/Eight, Eleven’s psychic “sister” instead, being held captive in a military laboratory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/stranger-things-series-finale-trailer-is-here/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, a hacker named Lovely claimed to have breached a Condé Nast user database and released a list of more than <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/WIRED">2.3 million user records from our sister publication WIRED</a>. The released materials contain demographic information (name, email, address, phone, etc.) but no passwords.</p>
<p>The hacker also says that they will release an additional 40 million records for other Condé Nast properties, including our other sister publications <em>Vogue</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and more. Of critical note to our readers, <em>Ars Technica</em> was not affected as we run on our own bespoke tech stack.</p>
<p>The hacker said that they had urged Condé Nast to patch vulnerabilities to no avail. “Condé Nast does not care about the security of their users data,” the hacker wrote. “It took us an entire month to convince them to fix the vulnerabilities on their websites. We will leak more of their users’ data (40+ million) over the next few weeks. Enjoy!”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/conde-nast-user-database-reportedly-breached-ars-unaffected/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Lobsters are generally notable for their large claws, which can serve as a deterrent to any predators. But there's a whole family of spiny lobsters that lack these claws. They tend to ward off predators by forming large groups that collectively can present a lot of pointy bits towards anything attempting to eat them. In fact, studies found that the lobsters can sense the presence of other species-members using molecules emitted into the water, and use that to find peers to congregate with.</p>
<p>A new study, however, finds that this same signal may lure young lobsters to their doom, causing them to try to congregate with older lobsters that are too big to be eaten by nearby predators. The smaller lobsters thus fall victim to a phenomenon called an "ecological trap," which has rarely been seen to occur without human intervention.</p>
<h2>Lobsters vs. groupers</h2>
<p>The study was performed in the waters off Florida, where the seafloor is dotted by what are called "solution holes." These features are the product of lower sea levels such as those that occur during periods of expanded glaciers and ice caps. During these times, much of the area off Florida was above sea level, and water dissolved the limestone rocks unevenly. This created an irregular array of small shallow pits and crevices, many of which have been reshaped by sea life since the area was submerged again.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/looking-for-friends-lobsters-may-stumble-into-an-ecological-trap/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There were a lot of horrifying things in the news this year—a lot. But some of it was horrifying in a <em>good way</em>.</p>
<p>Extraordinary medical cases—even the grisly and disturbing ones—offer a reprieve from the onslaught of current events and the stresses of our daily lives. With those remarkable reports, we can marvel at the workings, foibles, and resilience of the human body. They can remind us of the shared indignities from our existence in these mortal meatsacks. We can clear our minds of worry by learning about something we never even knew we should worry about—or by counting our blessings for avoiding so far. And sometimes, the reports are just grotesquely fascinating.</p>
<p>Every year, there's a new lineup of such curious clinical conditions. There are always some unfortunate souls to mark medical firsts or present ultra-rare cases. There is also an endless stream of humans making poor life choices—and arriving at an emergency department with the results. This year was no different.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/the-top-5-most-horrifying-and-fascinating-medical-cases-of-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>2025 has been a tumultuous year for the car world. After years of EV optimism, revanchists are pushing back against things like clean energy and fuel economy. Automakers have responded, postponing or canceling new electric vehicles in favor of gasoline-burning ones. It hasn't been all bad, though. Despite the changing winds, EV infrastructure continues to be built out and, anecdotally at least, feels far more reliable. We got to witness a pretty epic Formula 1 season right to the wire, in addition to some great sports car and Formula E racing. And we drove a whole bunch of cars, some of which stood out from the pack.</p>
<p>Here are the 10 best things we sat behind the wheel of in 2025.</p>
<h2>10th: Lotus Emira V6</h2>

<p>Let's be frank: The supposed resurgence of Lotus hasn't exactly gone to plan. When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/lotus-cars-is-saved-being-bought-by-chinas-geely/">Geely bought the British Automaker in 2017</a>, many of us hoped that the Chinese company would do for Lotus what it did for Volvo, only in Hethel instead of Gothenburg. Even before tariffs and other protectionist measures undermined the wisdom of building new Lotuses in China, the fact that most of these new cars were big, heavy EVs had already made them a hard sell. But a more traditional Lotus exists and is still built in Norfolk, England: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/lotus-still-knows-how-to-make-a-drivers-car-the-2025-emira-v6-driven/">the Lotus Emira</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/the-10-best-vehicles-ars-technica-drove-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Yakisugi is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakisugi">a Japanese architectural technique</a>  for charring the surface of wood. It has become quite popular in bioarchitecture because the carbonized layer protects the wood from water, fire, insects, and fungi, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the wood. Yakisugi techniques were first codified in written form in the 17th and 18th centuries. But it seems Italian Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci wrote about the protective benefits of charring wood surfaces more than 100 years earlier, according to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397379290_Leonardo_da_Vinci_and_the_Science_of_Wood_The_Note_in_the_Madrid_Codex_II_as_a_Foreshadowing_of_Modern_Bioarchitecture">a paper</a> published in Zenodo, an open repository for EU funded research.</p>
<h2>Check the notes</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/leonardo-noted-link-between-gravity-and-acceleration-centuries-before-einstein/">previously reported</a>, Leonardo produced more than 13,000 pages in his notebooks (later gathered into codices), less than a third of which have survived. The notebooks contain all manner of inventions that foreshadow future technologies: flying machines, bicycles, cranes, missiles, machine guns, an “unsinkable” double-hulled ship, dredges for clearing harbors and canals, and floating footwear akin to snowshoes to enable a person to walk on water. Leonardo foresaw the possibility of constructing a telescope in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Atlanticus">Codex Atlanticus</a> </i>(1490)—he wrote of “making glasses to see the moon enlarged” a century before the instrument’s invention.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alessandro Vezzosi, director of Italy’s Museo Ideale, came across <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/leonardo-godfather-of-tupperware">some recipes</a> for mysterious mixtures while flipping through Leonardo’s notes. Vezzosi experimented with the recipes, resulting in a mixture that would harden into a material eerily akin to Bakelite, a synthetic plastic widely used in the early 1900s. So Leonardo may well have invented the first manmade plastic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/did-one-line-in-a-leonardo-codex-anticipate-yakisugi/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The nervous system does an astonishing job of tracking sensory information, and does so using signals that would drive many computer scientists insane: a noisy stream of activity spikes that may be transmitted to hundreds of additional neurons, where they are integrated with similar spike trains coming from still other neurons.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have used spiking circuitry to build an artificial robotic skin, adopting some of the principles of how signals from our sensory neurons are transmitted and integrated. While the system relies on a few decidedly not-neural features, it has the advantage that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/understanding-neuromorphic-computing-and-why-intels-excited-about-it/">we have chips</a> that can run neural networks using spiking signals, which would allow this system to integrate smoothly with some energy-efficient hardware to run <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/scientists-built-an-ai-co-pilot-for-prosthetic-bionic-hands/">AI-based control software</a>.</p>
<h2>Location via spikes</h2>
<p>The nervous system in our skin is remarkably complex. It has specialized sensors for different sensations: heat, cold, pressure, pain, and more. In most areas of the body, these feed into the spinal column, where some preliminary processing takes place, allowing reflex reactions to be triggered without even involving the brain. But signals do make their way along specialized neurons into the brain, allowing further processing and (potentially) conscious awareness.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/researchers-make-neuromorphic-artificial-skin-for-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>China drafted landmark rules to stop AI chatbots from emotionally manipulating users, including what could become the strictest policy worldwide intended to prevent AI-supported suicides, self-harm, and violence.</p>
<p>China's Cyberspace Administration <a href="https://www.cac.gov.cn/2025-12/27/c_1768571207311996.htm">proposed</a> the rules on Saturday. If finalized, they would apply to any AI products or services publicly available in China that use text, images, audio, video, or "other means" to simulate engaging human conversation. Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/29/china-ai-chatbot-rules-emotional-influence-suicide-gambling-zai-minimax-talkie-xingye-zhipu.html">told CNBC</a> that the "planned rules would mark the world’s first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics" at a time when companion bot usage is rising globally.</p>
<h2>Growing awareness of problems</h2>
<p>In 2025, researchers <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/new-research-sheds-light-on-ai-companions/">flagged</a> major harms of AI companions, including promotion of self-harm, violence, and terrorism. Beyond that, chatbots shared harmful misinformation, made unwanted sexual advances, encouraged substance abuse, and verbally abused users. Some psychiatrists are increasingly ready to link psychosis to chatbot use, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-chatbot-psychosis-link-1abf9d57">reporte</a>d this weekend, while the most popular chatbot in the world, ChatGPT, has triggered lawsuits over outputs linked to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">child suicide</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/">murder-suicide</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/china-drafts-worlds-strictest-rules-to-end-ai-encouraged-suicide-violence/">Read full article</a></p>
