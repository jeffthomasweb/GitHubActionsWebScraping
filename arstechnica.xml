<p>You can't buy <em>Mini Settlers</em> right now, but I think you should play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2788870/Mini_Settlers_Prologue/?snr=1_5_1100__1100&amp;utm_source=steamwidget">the free "Prologue" demo</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521630/Mini_Settlers/">wishlist the full game</a> if you dig it. It's not quite like any other city builder I've played.</p>
<p><em>Mini Settlers </em>is "mini" like minimalism. It is in the same genre, but quite far from, games like <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> (a choice with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/">some proven merit</a>). Your buildings are not 3D-rendered with real-time lighting. Your buildings are colored squares, sometimes with a few disc tokens stacked on them, tabletop-style. Your roads don't have traffic, but they have drivers (tiny squares) that take resources between nodes. When things go wrong, you don't get depressing news about pollution and riots; some people just leave their homes, but they'll come back if you fix what's wrong.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1itNwoQ07jA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>Mini Settlers</em> announcement video. </p></div>
<p>Mini Settlers is not the game to play to satisfy your long-running suspicion that urban planning was your missed calling. In the (non-progress-saving) Prologue-free demo out this week, the mines and quarries have infinite resources. There is no "money" to speak of, so far as I can tell. Apple farms must be placed near apple orchards and water pumps by water, and the rest is up to you. The interface looks like a thought experiment in how far you can get from traditional city sim HUDs, but then someone implemented it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021093#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021093&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.42 of the Rocket Report! There are several major missions set for launch in the next few months. These include the first crew flight on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, set for liftoff on May 6, and the next test flight of SpaceX's Starship rocket, which could happen before the end of May. Perhaps as soon as early summer, SpaceX could launch the Polaris Dawn mission with four private astronauts, who will perform the first fully commercial spacewalk in orbit. In June or July, Europe's new Ariane 6 rocket is slated to launch for the first time. Rest assured, Ars will have it all covered.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>German rocket arrives at Scottish spaceport. </b>Rocket Factory Augsburg has delivered a booster for its privately developed RFA One rocket to SaxaVord Spaceport in Scotland, <a href="https://x.com/rfa_space/status/1785338329170346014">the company announced on X</a>. The first stage for the RFA One rocket was installed on its launch pad at SavaVord to undergo preparations for a static fire test. The booster arrived at the Scottish launch site with five of its kerosene-fueled Helix engines.

<p>Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/">earnings report</a> for the second quarter of the company's 2024 fiscal year showed a slide in hardware sales, especially for the iPhone. Nonetheless, Apple beat analysts' estimates for the quarter thanks to the company's rapidly growing services revenue.</p>
<p>iPhone revenue dropped from $51.33 billion in the same quarter last year to $45.96 billion, a fall of about 10 percent. This was the second consecutive quarter with declining iPhone revenues. That said, investors feared a sharp drop before the earnings call.</p>
<p>Notably, Apple's revenue in the region it dubs Greater China (which includes China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong) fell 8 percent overall. The company fared a little better in other regions. China's economy is slowing even as China-based Huawei is taking bigger slices of the pie in the region.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021582#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021582&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T is now charging mobile customers an extra $7 per month for faster wireless data speeds. AT&amp;T says the Turbo add-on, <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2024/turbo.html">available starting today</a>, is "built to support high-performance mobile applications, like gaming, social video broadcasting and live video conferencing, with optimized data while customers are on the go."</p>
<p>While Turbo "boosts all the high-speed and hotspot data on a user's connection," AT&amp;T said the difference will be more noticeable for certain kinds of applications. For example, gaming applications using Turbo will experience "less freezing or stuttering and lower latency," AT&amp;T said.</p>
<p>The $7 charge is for each line. Adding Turbo to multiple lines on the same account requires paying the extra fee for each line. <a href="https://www.att.com/plans/att-turbo?cjevent=02f51e0f08be11ef839c018f0a82b821&amp;source=EC1NAT10600aff12A&amp;wtExtndSource=100017430">AT&amp;T said</a> that Turbo lets users "optimize their plan's high-speed (premium) and hotspot data allotments" and provides better data performance "even during busy times on the network."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021487#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021487&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Halfway through the first day of closing arguments in the Department of Justice's big antitrust trial against Google, US District Judge Amit Mehta posed the question that likely many Google users have pondered over years of DOJ claims that Google's market dominance has harmed users.</p>
<p>"What should Google have done to remain outside the crosshairs of the DOJ?" Mehta asked plaintiffs halfway through the first of two full days of closing arguments.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ and state attorneys general suing, Google has diminished search quality everywhere online, primarily by locking rivals out of default positions on devices and in browsers. By <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/google-paid-26b-for-default-contracts-in-2021-google-exec-testified/">paying billions for default placements</a> that the government has argued allowed Google to hoard traffic and profits, Google allegedly made it nearly impossible for rivals to secure enough traffic to compete, ultimately decreasing competition and innovation in search by limiting the number of viable search engines in the market.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021429#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021429&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            Weird Al's <em>Rambo</em> parody was a drop in the bucket amidst all the other jokes in the film, but it's among the most memorable.                          [credit:

<p>Believe it or not, it's been 35 years since Weird Al's quotable cult classic <em>UHF</em> first came out. Right on time for that anniversary, Shout Factory will release an UltraHD Blu-ray of the movie. This will be the first time it has ever been available in 4K.</p>
<p>Releasing July 2 but pre-ordering now, the disc will include a new 4K scan of the original 35mm negative, along with audio commentary from Weird Al and Jay Levy, the film's director.</p>
<p>It will also come bundled with a standard HD Blu-ray that includes the film in that older format along with a bunch of special features, including video of a 2014 Comic-Con panel on the movie, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes videos, and some other assets. Some of those return from the movie's last physical edition, which was a 25th anniversary HD Blu-ray, but not 4K.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021071#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021071&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The good news for <em>Elden Ring</em> fans is that the two-plus-year wait for the game's first DLC, "Shadow of the Erdtree," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/namco-announces-the-first-elden-ring-expansion-is-in-development/">will end in just a couple of months</a>. The bad news is that "Shadow of the Erdtree" will also be the <em>last</em> bit of DLC for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/putting-elden-rings-12-million-sales-in-context/">FromSoftware's multimillion-selling action RPG</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/694720699">a wide-ranging interview with Chinese site Zhihu</a> (<a href="https://zhuanlan-zhihu-com.translate.goog/p/694720699?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">machine translation</a>), <em>Elden Ring</em> producer Hidetaka Miyazaki said "Shadow of the Erdtree" contains a lot of existing lore and content that was created for the original game but couldn't fit into the final package. Miyazaki said the team decided to release all of that unused content as one large DLC expansion, rather than multiple smaller bits, because "if they were sold separately, the freedom of exploration and sense of adventure would be reduced."</p>
<p>As for just how big the DLC will be, Miyazaki balked when the interviewer asked how long it would take players to complete. Miyazaki brought up memories of being called a liar after estimating in an earlier interview that the original game would only take about 30 hours of play to complete—crowdsourced game-length database HowLongToBeat puts the "main story" estimate <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/68151">closer to 60 hours</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021453#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021453&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A maximum severity vulnerability that allows hackers to hijack GitLab accounts with no user interaction required is now under active exploitation, federal government officials warned as data showed that thousands of users had yet to install a patch released in January.</p>
<p>A change GitLab implemented in May 2023 made it possible for users to initiate password changes through links sent to secondary email addresses. The move was designed to permit resets when users didn’t have access to the email address used to establish the account. In January, GitLab <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/01/11/critical-security-release-gitlab-16-7-2-released/">disclosed</a> that the feature allowed attackers to send reset emails to accounts they controlled and from there click on the embedded link and take over the account.</p>
<p>While exploits require no user interaction, hijackings work only against accounts that aren’t configured to use multifactor authentication. Even with MFA, accounts remained vulnerable to password resets, but the attackers ultimately are unable to access the account, allowing the rightful owner to change the reset password. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-7028, carries a severity rating of 10 out of 10.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021409#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021409&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Steam Deck is a Linux computer. There is, technically, very little you cannot get running on it, given enough knowledge, time, and patience. That said, it's never a bad thing when someone has done all the work for you, leaving you to focus on what matters: sneaking game time on the couch.</p>
<p>GeForce Now, Nvidia's game-streaming service that uses your own PC gaming libraries, has made it easier for Steam Deck owners to get its service <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-may-games-list/">set up on their Deck</a>. On <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/#steam-deck-modal">the service's Download page</a>, there is now a section for Gaming Handheld Devices. Most of the device links provide the service's Windows installer, since devices like the ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go run Windows. Some note that GeForce Now is already installed on devices like the Razer Edge and Logitech G Cloud.</p>
<p>But Steam Deck types are special. We get a Unix-style executable script, a folder with all the necessary Steam icon image assets, and a README.md file.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021392#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021392&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Wear OS was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/android-wear-is-getting-killed-and-its-all-qualcomms-fault/">nearly dead</a> a few years ago but is now on a remarkable comeback trajectory, thanks to renewed commitment from Google and a hardware team-up with Samsung. Wear OS is still in a distant second place compared to the Apple Watch, but a new <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-smartwatch-market-2024/">Counterpoint Research</a> report has the wearable OS at 21 percent market share, with the OS expected to hit 27 percent in 2024.</p>
<p>Counterpoint's market segmentation for this report is basically "smartwatches with an app store," so it excludes cheaper fitness bands and other, more simple electronic watches. We're also focusing on the non-China market for now. The report has Apple's market share at 53 percent and expects it to fall to 49 percent in 2024. The "Other" category is at 26 percent currently. That "Other" group would have to be Garmin watches, a few remaining Fitbit smartwatches like the Versa and Ionic, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2023/10/guidemaster-can-a-100-smartwatch-best-the-apple-watch-se/">Amazfit</a> watches. Counterpoint expects the whole market (including China) to grow 15 percent in 2024 and that a "major part" of the growth will be non-Apple watches. Counterpoint lists Samsung as the major Wear OS driver, with OnePlus, Oppo, Xiaomi, and Google getting shout-outs too.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-11.png"><img alt="2023 are actual numbers, while 2024 is a forecast. " src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-11-980x563.png"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-11.png" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">2023 are actual numbers, while 2024 is a forecast. </a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-smartwatch-market-2024/">Counterpoint Research</a>)</p></div>
<p>China is a completely different world, with Huawei's HarmonyOS currently dominating with 48 percent. Counterpoint expects the OS's smartwatch market share to grow to 61 percent this year. Under the hood, HarmonyOS-for-smartwatches is an <a href="https://xdaforums.com/t/world-first-guide-to-install-apk-on-watch-3-series.4316911/">Android fork,</a> and for hardware, the company is gearing up to launch an <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/30/huawei-apple-watch-ripoff-leak/">Apple Watch clone</a>. Apple is only at 28 percent in China, and Wear OS is relegated to somewhere in the "Other" category. There's no Play Store in China, so Wear OS is less appealing, but some Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Oppo are still building Wear OS watches.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021351#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021351&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Starting in March with the release of iOS 17.4, iPhones in the European Union have been subject to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), a batch of regulations that (among other things) forced Apple to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">support alternate app stores</a>, app sideloading, and third-party browser engines in iOS for the first time. This week, EU regulators announced that they are also categorizing Apple's iPadOS as a "gatekeeper," meaning that the iPad will soon be subject to the same regulations as the iPhone.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=d0z8d8rx">a developer blog post released today</a>, Apple said that it would comply with the EU's regulations "later this fall, as required." All changes that Apple has made to iOS on European iPhones to comply with the DMA will be implemented in the same way on the iPad, though it's not clear whether these changes will be brought to iPadOS 17 or if they'll just be a part of the upcoming iPacOS 18 update.</p>

<p>The EU began investigating whether iPadOS would qualify as a gatekeeper in September 2023, the same day it decided that iOS, the Safari browser, and the App Store were all gatekeepers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020496#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020496&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Here at Ars, we were obviously excited by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/the-game-awards-awards-picking-the-nights-best-new-game-trailers/">the late 2022 announcement of <em>Hades II</em></a> as a follow-up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2020/6/">our favorite game of 2020</a>. But when early coverage of that sequel suggested major changes to the game's core combat, we were a bit worried that the developers at Supergiant risked messing up the core gameplay loop that made the original game so satisfying.</p>
<p>So far, it seems like those worries were unfounded. After spending a few hours <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-tech-test-sign-up/">playing through the game's recent technical test</a>—which covers content up through the game's first major "boss" character—we found a confident sequel that keeps the original games familiar flow while adding just enough changes to avoid feeling like a rehash. If anything, the new systems in <em>Hades II</em> make the original game's positional combat more satisfying than ever.</p>
<p><em>Spoiler warning: The rest of this piece offers minor spoilers for the early parts of Hades II.</em></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021354#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021354&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's well-known that the ancient Maya had their own version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Ballgame">ball games</a>, which were played with a rubber ball on stone courts. Such games served not just as athletic events but also religious ones that often involved ritual sacrifices. Archaeologists have now found evidence that the Maya may have blessed newly constructed ball courts in rituals involving plants with hallucinogenic properties, according to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0301497">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE.</p>
<p>“When they erected a new building, they asked the goodwill of the gods to protect the people inhabiting it,” <a href="https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/2024/04/uc-researchers-find-evidence-of-ceremonial-offerings-in-mexico.html">said co-author David Lentz</a> of the University of Cincinnati. “Some people call it an ensouling ritual, to get a blessing from and appease the gods.” Lentz and his team <a href="https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/2022/06/ancient-maya-used-sustainable-farming-forestry-for-millennia.html">previously used</a> genetic and pollen analyses of the wild and cultivated plants found in the ancient Maya city Yaxnohcah in what is now Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2022.868033/full">revealing evidence</a> of sustainable agriculture and forestry spanning a millennia.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/ancient-egyptian-followers-of-a-deity-called-bes-may-have-used-hallucinogens/">reported previously</a>, there is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includes not just ancient Egypt but also ancient Greek, Vedic, Maya, Inca, and Aztec cultures. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urarina">Urarina</a> people who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca">ayahuasca</a> in their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have also been known to participate.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020387#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020387&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>We're living through a period of radically shifting automotive technology. Companies are working on increasing electric vehicle range and redefining our concept of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/whats-the-state-of-wireless-ev-charging/">reenergizing</a>. They're also gradually refining driver assistance technology and figuring out how to make vehicles an extension of their drivers.</p>
<p>Sony Honda Mobility's (SHM) main aim with its AFEELA luxury-tier sedan concept is to put the emphasis on the latter. The <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/prototype/">dynamic duo's website</a> is filled with marketing buzzwords, but what is the concept actually like in person?</p>
<p>Recently, I was invited by SHM to check out AFEELA firsthand. It's still very much a prototype, so certain key information like price, range, and charging times weren't disclosed. But it was still worthwhile to see how these two Japanese institutions put their know-how into this spacious sedan.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021276#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021276&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft is currently investigating a bug in its most recent batch of Windows 10 and Windows 11 updates that is preventing some VPN software from working properly. The company updated <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-23H2">its list of known Windows issues</a> to say that it has recreated the issue on its end and that it's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-23H2#3291msgdesc">currently working on a fix</a>.</p>

<p>The VPN issue affects all currently supported versions of Windows: Windows 10 21H2 and 22H2; Windows 11 versions 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2; and Windows Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, and 2022.</p>
<p>Microsoft says the problem was caused by update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/april-9-2024-kb5036893-os-builds-22621-3447-and-22631-3447-a674a67b-85f5-4a40-8d74-5f8af8ead5bb">KB5036893</a>, which was initially released on April 9, 2024. The update makes "miscellaneous security improvements to internal OS functionality," among a few other minor changes. The company hasn't provided specific information on what's been broken or what needs fixing, noting only that PCs "might face VPN connection failures" after installing the update.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021278#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021278&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The need for long-duration energy storage, which helps to fill the longest gaps when wind and solar are not producing enough electricity to meet demand, is as clear as ever. Several technologies could help to meet this need.</p>
<p>But which approaches could be viable on a commercial scale?</p>
<p>Toronto-based Hydrostor Inc. is one of the businesses developing long-duration energy storage that has moved beyond lab scale and is now focusing on building big things. The company makes systems that store energy underground in the form of compressed air, which can be released to produce electricity for eight hours or longer.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021294#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021294&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA's acting inspector general, George A. Scott, <a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/office-of-inspector-general-oig/audit-reports/nasas-readiness-for-the-artemis-ii-crewed-mission-to-lunar-orbit/">released a report</a> Wednesday that provided an assessment of NASA's readiness to launch the Artemis II mission next year. This is an important flight for the space agency because, while the crew of four will not land on the Moon, it will be the first time humans have flown into deep space in more than half a century.</p>
<p>The report did not contain any huge surprises. In recent months the biggest hurdle for the Artemis II mission has been the performance of the heat shield that protects the Orion spacecraft during its fiery reentry at more than 25,000 mph from the Moon.</p>
<p>Although NASA downplayed the heat shield issue in the immediate aftermath of the uncrewed Artemis I flight in late 2022, it is clear that the unexpected damage and charring during that uncrewed mission is a significant concern. As recently as last week, Amit Kshatriya, who oversees development for the Artemis missions in NASA's exploration division, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/nasa-still-doesnt-understand-root-cause-of-orion-heat-shield-issue/">said the agency is still looking for the root cause</a> of the problem.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021239#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021239&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Acura provided flights from Washington to Los Angeles and accommodation so Ars could drive the ZDX Type-S. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>MONTECITO, Calif.—Acura's first fully electric SUV has just gone on sale. The luxury automaker wants all its vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2040, and parent company Honda is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/honda-to-spend-11-billion-on-four-ev-factories-in-north-america/">investing billions of dollars</a> in electric vehicle manufacturing in North America to help that happen. But its homegrown EVs aren't quite ready yet, and in the meantime, Acura has resorted to a bit of platform-sharing to fill the gap. Scratch under the skin of the 2024 Acura ZDX Type-S and it's pure General Motors, using the same Ultium platform as the Cadillac Lyriq. But the polish is all Acura, including the software.</p>
<p>The ZDX range starts at $64,500 for the single-motor, rear-wheel drive A-Spec model, which is similar in specs to the Cadillac Lyriq <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/">we drove a couple of years ago</a>. But Acura brought the $73,500 2024 ZDX Type-S to the first drive. This is the top-spec model, with a 499 hp (372 kW), 544 lb-ft (738 Nm) twin-motor, all-wheel drive powertrain, air suspension, and rather large Brembo brakes.</p>
<h2>It’s no lightweight</h2>
<p>Those last two features are highly welcome, because they help control the ZDX Type-S's considerable mass—its curb weight is a hefty 6,052 lbs (2,745 kg). Air springs are fast becoming the default choice for premium EVs, and it's quite remarkable how quickly they can react to weight transfer. But the steering lacks feel and makes up for it with weight, and maneuvers like avoiding road debris on the highway will give you a definite reminder that you're driving nearly 3 tons of vehicle. You do get a smooth ride thanks to those air springs, though.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021077#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021077&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cybercriminals and spies working for nation-states are surreptitiously coexisting inside compromised name-brand routers as they use the devices to disguise attacks motivated both by financial gain and strategic espionage, researchers said.</p>
<p>In some cases, the coexistence is peaceful, as financially motivated hackers provide spies with access to already compromised routers in exchange for a fee, researchers from security firm Trend Micro reported Wednesday. In other cases, hackers working in nation-state-backed advanced persistent threat groups take control of devices previously hacked by the cybercrime groups. Sometimes the devices are independently compromised multiple times by different groups. The result is a free-for-all inside routers and, to a lesser extent, VPN devices and virtual private servers provided by hosting companies.</p>
<p>“Cybercriminals and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors share a common interest in proxy anonymization layers and Virtual Private Network (VPN) nodes to hide traces of their presence and make detection of malicious activities more difficult,” Trend Micro researchers Feike Hacquebord and Fernando Merces <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/e/router-roulette.html">wrote</a>. “This shared interest results in malicious internet traffic blending financial and espionage motives.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021233#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021233&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Streaming services like Netflix and Peacock have already found multiple ways to aggravate paying subscribers this week.</p>
<p>The streaming industry has been heating up. As media giants rush to establish a successful video streaming business, they often make platform changes that test subscribers' patience and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/the-lines-between-streaming-and-cable-continue-blurring/">value of streaming</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a look at the most exasperating news from streaming services from this week. The scale of this article demonstrates how fast and frequently disappointing streaming news arises. Coincidentally, as we wrote this article, <em>another</em> price hike was announced.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021143#p3">Read 49 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021143&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
