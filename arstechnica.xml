              <![CDATA[<p>A Russian court has issued a life sentence to a man found guilty of being the kingpin of a dark web drug marketplace that supplied more than a metric ton of narcotics and psychotropic substances to customers around the world.</p>
<p>On Monday, the court found that Stanislav Moiseyev oversaw Hydra, a Russian-language market that operated an anonymous website that matched sellers of drugs and other illicit wares with buyers. Hydra was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/04/hydra-the-worlds-biggest-cybercrime-forum-shut-down-in-police-sting/">dismantled in 2022</a> after authorities in Germany seized servers and other infrastructure used by the sprawling, billion-dollar enterprise and a stash of bitcoin worth millions of dollars. At the time, Hydra was the largest crime forum, having facilitated $5 billion in transactions for 17 million customers. The market had been in operation since 2015.</p>
<h2>One-stop cybercrime shop</h2>
<p>“The court established that from 2015 to October 2018, the criminal community operated in various regions of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus,” the state prosecutor’s office of the Moscow Region <a href="https://epp.genproc.gov.ru/web/proc_50/mass-media/news?item=99442998">said</a>. “The well-covered activities of the organized criminal group were aimed at systematically committing serious and especially serious crimes related to the illegal trafficking of drugs and psychotropic substances.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/russian-court-sentences-kingpin-of-hydra-drug-marketplace-to-life-in-prison/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's nothing quite like a deep dive into the shallow, vomitous puddles of children's splash pads. Even toeing the edge is enough to have one longing for the unsettling warmth of a kiddie pool. But the brave souls at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have done it, wading into 25 years' worth of records on gastrointestinal outbreaks linked to the wellsprings of fecal pathogens. And they unsurprisingly found enough retch-inducing results to make any modern-day <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Snow-British-physician">John Snows</a> want to start removing some water handles.</p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2022, splash pads across the country were linked to at least 60 outbreaks, with the largest sickening over 2,000 water frolickers in one go. In all, the outbreaks led to at least 10,611 illnesses, 152 hospitalizations, and 99 emergency department visits. People, mostly children, were sickened with pathogens including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/hard-to-kill-poop-parasites-that-lurk-in-swimming-pools-on-the-rise-cdc-warns/"><em>Cryptosporidium</em></a>,<em> Camplyobacter jejuni, Giardia duodenalis, Salmonella, Shigella, </em>and norovirus, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/ss/ss7308a1.htm?s_cid=ss7308a1_w">the analysis, published Tuesday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</a>. The tallies of outbreaks and illnesses are likely undercounts, given reporting delays and missed connections.</p>
<p>Though previous <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/fecal-fountains-cdc-warns-of-diarrheal-outbreaks-linked-to-poopy-splash-pads/">outbreak-based studies</a> have provided bursts of data, the new analysis is the first to provide a comprehensive catalog of all the documented outbreaks since splash pads erupted in the 1990s. Together, they provide a clear, stomach-churning explanation of how the outbreaks keep happening. Basically, small children go into the watery playgrounds while they're sick and spread their germs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/from-diapers-to-mouths-of-babes-how-splash-pads-sickened-over-10k/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>An app outage that locked numerous rental car customers out of their vehicles is a reminder of the perils of completely relying on apps for basic functionality—especially when those apps have seemingly limited support resources.</p>
<p>Zipcar is a car-sharing service that lets customers pay a membership fee to rent vehicles. Users use the Zipcar app to locate cars, unlock and lock them, share images of the vehicle (for proof that you didn't damage it), and report concerns. One typically goes through the entire Zipcar rental process without interacting with a human. Avoiding car rental lines and customer service representatives seems efficient until the app utterly fails you.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-total-meltdown-black-friday-zipcar-outage-strands-customers-in-random-places/">404 Media</a> today, Zipcar experienced an outage on Friday that prevented the app from functioning properly for numerous users. Without the app support, people could not unlock cars to start rentals, open cars that didn't come with keys, lock cars, and/or return cars before their rental period expired.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nightmare-zipcar-outage-is-a-warning-against-complete-app-dependency/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-steps-down-after-terrible-no-good-very-bad-year/">Turnover at the top of the company</a> isn't stopping Intel from launching new products: Today the company is announcing the first of its next-generation B-series Intel Arc GPUs, the Arc B580 and Arc B570.</p>
<p>Both are decidedly midrange graphics cards that will compete with the likes of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 and AMD's RX 7600 series, but Intel is pricing them competitively: $249 for a B580 with 12GB of RAM and $219 for a B570 with 10GB of RAM. The B580 launches on December 13, while the B570 won't be available until January 16.</p>
<p>The two cards are Intel's first dedicated GPUs based on its next-generation "Battlemage" architecture, a successor to the "Alchemist" architecture used in the A-series cards. Intel's Core Ultra 200 laptop processors were its first products to ship with Battlemage, though they used an integrated version with fewer of Intel's Xe cores and no dedicated memory. Both B-series GPUs use silicon manufactured on a 5 nm TSMC process, an upgrade from the 6 nm process used for the A-series; as of this writing, no integrated <em>or</em> dedicated Arc GPUs have been manufactured by one of Intel's factories.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/intel-targets-budget-friendly-1440p-gaming-with-249-and-219-arc-b500-gpus/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"A clean desk is a sign of a sick mind" is a phrase sometimes attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Levant">Oscar Levant</a>, but I give it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_Spengler">Egon Spengler</a>. I also live that phrase.</p>
<p>My desk is not clean, but I know why everything is on it. It is inefficient if you are not me and are trying to find things or make sense of it. If you know where to look, like I do, however, every piece is doing a particular job.</p>
<p>If you're like me, or know someone like me, you know desk space is at a premium—not to keep it tidy and empty, but to fill it with even more junk. With this in mind, I have compiled some of the items I either own and cherish, or have saved to various online carts and considered many times. These gadgets keep devices powered, items labeled, the office space conveniently automated, and cables always within arm's reach. With all the space and mental stress these gadgets can and do save me, I have so much more room for, say, reading about Oscar Levant and putting empty seltzer cans everywhere.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/favorite-desk-accessories/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On April 15, 2019, the world watched in transfixed horror as a fire ravaged the famed Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, collapsing the spire and melting the lead roof. After years of painstaking restoration costing around $740 million, the cathedral reopens to the public this weekend. The December issue of National Geographic features <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/notre-dame-cathedral-restoration-reopening">an exclusive look</a> inside the restored cathedral, accompanied by striking photographs by Paris-based photographer and visual artist Tomas van Houtryve.</p>
<p>For several hours, it seemed as if the flames would utterly destroy the 800-year-old cathedral. But after a long night of work by more than 400 Paris firefighters, the fire finally began to cool and attention began to shift to what could be salvaged and rebuilt. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to restore Notre Dame to its former glory and set a five-year deadline. The COVID-19 pandemic caused some delays, but France nearly met that deadline regardless.</p>
<p>Those reconstruction efforts were helped by the fact that, a few years before the fire, scientist <a href="https://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/sah-newsletter/sah-newsletter-ind/2018/12/06/obituary-prof.-andrew-j.-tallon-1969-2018">Andrew Tallon</a> had used laser scanning to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/laser-scans-could-help-rebuild-notre-dame-cathedral/587230/">create precisely detailed maps</a> of the interior and exterior of the cathedral—an invaluable aid as Paris rebuilds this landmark structure. French acousticians had also made detailed measurements of Notre Dame's "soundscape" that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/acoustic-maps-of-notre-dame-could-help-recreate-the-cathedrals-soundscape/">were instrumental</a> in helping architects factor acoustics into their reconstruction plans. The resulting model even enabled Brian FG Katz, research director of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) at Sorbonne University, to create a <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4987161?dm_i=3Q4Y,KLEO,J2QTD,286II,1">virtual reality version</a> of Notre Dame with all the acoustical parameters in place.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/a-peek-inside-the-restoration-of-the-iconic-notre-dame-cathedral/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the key differences between Apple's Macs and the iPhone and iPad is that the Mac can still boot and run non-Apple operating systems. This is a feature that Apple specifically built for the Mac, one of many features meant to ease the transition from Intel's chips to Apple's own silicon.</p>
<p>The problem, at least at first, was that alternate operating systems like Windows and Linux didn't work natively with Apple's hardware, not least because of missing drivers for basic things like USB ports, GPUs, and power management. Enter the Asahi Linux project, a community-driven effort to make open-source software run on Apple's hardware.</p>
<p>In just a few years, the team has taken Linux on Apple Silicon from "basically bootable" to "plays native Windows games and sounds great doing it." And the team's ultimate goal is to contribute enough code upstream that you no longer need a Linux distribution just for Apple Silicon Macs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/12/join-us-tomorrow-for-ars-live-how-asahi-linux-ports-open-software-to-apples-hardware/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Steam Link was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/steams-living-room-hardware-blitz-gets-off-to-a-muddy-start/#page-3">a little box ahead of its time</a>. It streamed games from a PC to a TV, ran 1,500 0f them natively, offered a strange (if somewhat lovable) little controller, and essentially required a great network, Ethernet cables, and a good deal of fiddling.</p>
<p>Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/valve-quietly-discontinues-steam-link-hardware-production/">quietly discontinued the Steam Link gear in November 2018</a>, but it didn't give up. These days, a Steam Link app can be found on most platforms, and Valve's sustained effort to move Linux-based (i.e., non-Windows-controlled) gaming forward has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">paid real dividends</a>. If you still want a dedicated device to stream Steam games, however? A Raspberry Pi 5 (with some help from Valve) can be a Substitute Steam Link.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/valves-steam-link-on-raspberry-pi/">detailed in the Raspberry Pi blog</a>, there were previously means of getting Steam Link working on Raspberry Pi devices, but the platform's move away from proprietary Broadcom libraries—and from X to Wayland display systems—required "a different approach." <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/slouken">Sam Lantinga from Valve</a> worked with the Raspberry Pi team on optimizing for the Raspberry Pi 5 hardware. As of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/4629231777834100224/">Steam Link 1.3.13</a> for the little board, Raspberry Pi 5 units could support up to 1080p at 144 frames per second (FPS) on the H.264 protocol and 4k at 60 FPS or 1080p at 240 FPS, presuming your primary gaming computer and network can support that.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-raspberry-pi-5-now-works-as-a-smaller-faster-kind-of-steam-link/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is trying to rein in data brokers that sell Americans' personal and financial information with a new rule that would classify the brokers as consumer reporting agencies. But the proposal has a dim future in the Trump administration, and the CFPB itself could face new limits planned by Republican politicians.</p>
<p>Currently, "the data broker industry collects and sells detailed information about Americans' personal lives and financial circumstances to anyone willing to pay," the CFPB <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-stop-data-brokers-from-selling-sensitive-personal-data-to-scammers-stalkers-and-spies/">announcement</a> today said. The agency said it wants to "limit the sale of personal identifiers like Social Security Numbers and phone numbers collected by certain companies and make sure that people's financial data such as income is only shared for legitimate purposes, like facilitating a mortgage approval, and not sold to scammers targeting those in financial distress."</p>
<p>The proposed rule would "treat data brokers just like credit bureaus and background check companies," requiring them to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act regardless of how the information is used. "Companies that sell data about income or financial tier, credit history, credit score, or debt payments would be considered consumer reporting agencies," the CFPB said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/us-plan-to-protect-consumers-from-data-brokers-faces-dim-future-under-trump/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's a common popular science demonstration involving "soap boats," in which liquid soap poured onto the surface of water creates a propulsive flow driven by gradients in surface tension. But it doesn't last very long since the soapy surfactants rapidly saturate the water surface, eliminating that surface tension. Using ethanol to create similar "cocktail boats" can significantly extend the effect because the alcohol evaporates rather than saturating the water.</p>
<p>That simple classroom demonstration could also be used to propel tiny robotic devices across liquid surfaces to carry out various environmental or industrial tasks, according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16011">a preprint</a> posted to the physics arXiv. The authors also exploited the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerios_effect">Cheerios effect</a>" as a means of self-assembly to create clusters of tiny ethanol-powered robots.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/12/physicists-measured-forces-behind-why-cheerios-clump-together-in-your-bowl/">previously reported</a>, those who love their Cheerios for breakfast are well acquainted with how those last few tasty little "O"s tend to clump together in the bowl: either drifting to the center or to the outer edges. The "Cheerios effect is found throughout nature, such as in grains of pollen (or, alternatively, mosquito eggs or beetles) floating on top of a pond; <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Surface_tension_with_coins.JPG">small coins floating</a> in a bowl of water; or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/fire-ant-rafts-form-because-of-the-cheerios-effect-study-concludes/">fire ants</a> clumping together <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.090501">to form</a> life-saving rafts during floods.

              <![CDATA[<p>Software engineer Vishnu Mohandas decided he would quit Google in more ways than one when he learned that the tech giant had briefly helped <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/3-years-maven-uproar-google-warms-pentagon/">the US military develop AI to study drone footage</a>. In 2020 he left his job working on Google Assistant and also stopped backing up all of his images to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-photos-ask-photos-gemini/">Google Photos</a>. He feared that his content could be used to train AI systems, even if they weren’t specifically ones tied to the Pentagon project. “I don't control any of the future outcomes that this will enable,” Mohandas thought. “So now, shouldn't I be more responsible?”</p>
<p>Mohandas, who taught himself programming and is based in Bengaluru, India, decided he wanted to develop an alternative service for storing and sharing photos that is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-open-source-software/">open source</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-end-to-end-encryption/">end-to-end encrypted</a>. Something “more private, wholesome, and trustworthy,” he says. The paid service he designed, Ente, is profitable and says it has more than 100,000 users, many of whom are already part of the privacy-obsessed crowd. But Mohandas struggled to articulate to wider audiences why they should reconsider relying on Google Photos, despite all the conveniences it offers.</p>

                  </div>
      </figure>
Then one weekend in May, an intern at Ente came up with an idea: Give people a sense of what some of Google’s AI models can learn from studying images. Last month, Ente launched <a href="https://theyseeyourphotos.com/">https://Theyseeyourphotos.com</a>, a website and marketing stunt designed to turn Google’s technology against itself. People can upload any photo to the website, which is then sent to a Google Cloud <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-plus-image-feature-openai/">computer vision</a> program that writes a startlingly thorough three-paragraph description of it. (Ente prompts the AI model to document small details in the uploaded images.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/new-website-shows-you-how-much-google-ai-can-learn-from-your-photos/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Bird flu has landed on a California farm that shuns virus-killing pasteurization, leading to a second <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/raw-milk-recalled-for-containing-bird-flu-virus-california-reports/">recall of raw milk</a> and a suspension of operations at the company, Raw Farm in Fresno County.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-042.aspx">a November 27 alert</a> by the California health department, officials in Santa Clara County found evidence of bird flu virus in retail samples of a batch of Raw Farm's milk, which has been recalled. It is the second time that retail testing has turned up positive results for the company and spurred a recall. The first contaminated batch was <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-039.aspx">reported on November 24</a>. The two recalled batches are those with lot codes 20241109 ("Best By" date of November 27, 2024) and 20241119 (Best By date of December 7, 2024).</p>
<p>In an email to Ars on Monday, Raw Farm CEO Mark McAfee said that none of the company's cows are visibly sick but that it appears that asymptomatic cows are shedding the avian influenza virus.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/raw-milk-producer-optimistic-after-being-shut-down-for-bird-flu-detection/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ralph Loya was pretty sure he was going to lose the corn. His farm had been scorched by El Paso’s hottest-ever June and second-hottest August; the West Texas county saw 53 days soar over 100° Fahrenheit in the summer of 2024. The region was also experiencing an ongoing drought, which meant that crops on Loya’s eight-plus acres of melons, okra, cucumbers, and other produce had to be watered more often than normal.</p>
<p>Loya had been irrigating his corn with somewhat salty, or brackish, water pumped from his well, as much as the salt-sensitive crop could tolerate. It wasn’t enough, and the municipal water was expensive; he was using it in moderation, and the corn ears were desiccating where they stood.</p>
<p>Ensuring the survival of agriculture under an increasingly erratic climate is approaching a <a href="https://www.doi.gov/priorities/addressing-the-drought-crisis">crisis</a> in the sere and sweltering Western and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/texas-running-out-water-sid-miller-1952025">Southwestern</a> United States, an area that supplies much of our beef and dairy, alfalfa, tree nuts, and produce. Contending with <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/new-afbf-survey-shows-droughts-increasing-toll-on-farmers-and-ranchers">too little water</a> to support their plants and animals, farmers have tilled under crops, pulled out trees, fallowed fields, and sold off herds. They’ve also used drip irrigation to inject <a href="https://www.globalagtechinitiative.com/in-field-technologies/irrigation/ag-tech-providing-solutions-to-drought-impacted-farms/">smaller doses of water closer to a plant’s roots and installed sensors</a> in soil that tell more precisely when and how much to water.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/can-desalination-quench-agricultures-thirst/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Delaware judge today rejected Elon Musk's bid to reinstate a Tesla pay package that was worth over $50 billion at the beginning of 2024 and has now crossed $100 billion based on Tesla's latest share price. The judge also ordered Tesla to pay $345 million in attorneys' fees to the plaintiff's counsel, who had sought $5.6 billion in fees.</p>
<p>Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/elon-musks-56-billion-pay-plan-voided-as-shareholders-beat-tesla-in-court/">voided the pay plan in January</a>, said today that a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/musk-says-hes-winning-tesla-shareholder-vote-on-pay-plan-by-wide-margin/">June 2024 shareholder vote</a> re-approving the 2018 pay plan is not a compelling reason to reverse the original ruling. Her <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=372420">ruling</a> said that a "large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law."</p>
<p>Musk is thus prevented from accessing a pay package whose potential value has soared along with Tesla's stock price. "As of Monday, the pay package was worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/delaware-judge-rejects-request-restore-elon-musks-56-billion-tesla-compensation-2024-12-02/">Reuters wrote</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/judge-again-rejects-the-elon-musk-tesla-pay-plan-now-valued-at-101-billion/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I hope everyone survived the weekend shopping experience and no one was eaten by ravening bands of deal-hunting nomads as they trekked through Macy's, or whatever people who actually go outside on Black Friday have to endure. Things are mostly quiet here at the Ars Orbiting HQ—the gift shop on the mess deck is still selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/store/">mugs and other merch</a>, if anyone wants some Ars stuff!—but the e-commerce communications panel is beeping and it says we've got more deals to show you guys for Cyber Monday!</p>
<p>Cyber Monday is the thing that happens <em>after</em> Black Friday, where the deals keep going past the weekend and erupt into the next week, like some kind of out-of-control roller coaster of capitalism careening off the rails and into the crowd. Headphones! Power stations! Tablets! More board games! We've got so many things for you to buy!</p>
<p>A couple of quick notes: First, we're going to continue updating this list throughout Monday as things change, so if you don't see anything that tickles your fancy right now, check back in a few hours! Additionally, although we're making every effort to keep our prices accurate, deals are constantly shifting around, and an item's actual price might have drifted from what we list. <em>Caveat emptor</em> and all that.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2024/12/its-black-friday-and-here-are-the-best-shopping-deals-we-could-find/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> is more than just an AI language model with a fancy interface. It's a system consisting of a stack of AI models and content filters that make sure its outputs don't embarrass OpenAI or get the company into legal trouble when its bot occasionally <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">makes up potentially harmful facts</a> about people.</p>
<p>Recently, that reality made the news when <a href="https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1862910201113739328">people discovered</a> that the name "David Mayer" breaks ChatGPT. 404 Media also <a href="https://www.404media.co/not-just-david-mayer-chatgpt-breaks-when-asked-about-two-law-professors/">discovered</a> that the names "Jonathan Zittrain" and "Jonathan Turley" caused ChatGPT to cut conversations short. And we know another name, likely the first, that started the practice last year: Brian Hood. More on that below.</p>
<p>The chat-breaking behavior occurs consistently when users mention these names in any context, and it results from a hard-coded filter that puts the brakes on the AI model's output before returning it to the user.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/certain-names-make-chatgpt-grind-to-a-halt-and-we-know-why/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Some of the most bizarre lifeforms on Earth lurk in the deeper realms of the ocean. There was so little known about one of these creatures that it took 20 years just to figure out what exactly it was. Things only got weirder from there.</p>
<p>The organism’s distinctive, glowing presence was observed by multiple deep-sea missions between 2000 to 2021 but was simply referred to as “mystery mollusk.” A team of Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) researchers has now reviewed extensive footage of past mystery mollusk sightings and used MBARI’s remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to observe it and collect samples. They’ve given it a name and have finally confirmed that it is a nudibranch—the first and only nudibranch known to live at such depths.</p>
<p><i>Bathydevius caudactylus, </i>as this nudibranch is now called, lives 1,000–4,000 meters (3,300–13,100 feet) deep in the ocean’s bathypelagic or midnight zone. It moves like a jellyfish, eats like a Venus flytrap, and is bioluminescent, and its genes are distinct enough for it to be classified as the first member of a new phylogenetic family.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/glowing-sea-slug-behaves-like-a-jellyfish-lizard-and-venus-flytrap/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Rob Bauer, the chair of a NATO military committee, reportedly said, “It is more competent not to wait, but to hit launchers in Russia in case Russia attacks us. We must strike first.” These comments, supposedly made in 2024, were later interpreted as suggesting NATO should attempt a <a href="https://londonlovesbusiness.com/nato-military-chief-warns-we-must-strike-first-in-a-preemptive-attack-against-russia/">preemptive strike</a> against Russia, an idea that lots of people found outrageously dangerous.</p>
<p>But lots of people also missed a thing about the quote: Bauer has never said it. It was made up. Despite that, the purported statement got nearly 250,000 views on X and was mindlessly spread further by the likes of <a href="https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/1861562179024998543">Alex Jones</a>.</p>
<p>Why do stories like this get so many views and shares? “The vast majority of misinformation studies assume people want to be accurate, but certain things distract them,” says William J. Brady, a researcher at Northwestern University. “Maybe it’s the social media environment. Maybe they’re not understanding the news, or the sources are confusing them. But what we found is that when content evokes outrage, people are consistently sharing it without even clicking into the article.” Brady co-authored a study on how misinformation exploits outrage to spread online. When we get outraged, the study suggests, we simply care way less if what’s got us outraged is even real.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/people-will-share-misinformation-that-sparks-moral-outrage/">Read full article</a></p>
