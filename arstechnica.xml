<p>Scientists at the University of Waterloo have identified one of the doomed crew members of Captain Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition">John S. Franklin</a>'s 1846 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition">Arctic expedition</a> to cross the Northwest Passage. According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X24003766">recent paper</a> published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, DNA analysis revealed that a tooth recovered from a mandible at one of the relevant archaeological sites was that of Captain James Fitzjames of the HMS <em>Erebus</em>. His remains show clear signs of cannibalism, confirming early Inuit reports of desperate crew members resorting to eating their dead.</p>
<p>"Concrete evidence of James Fitzjames as the first identified victim of cannibalism lifts the veil of anonymity that for 170 years spared the families of individual members of the 1845 Franklin expedition from the horrific reality of what might have befallen the body of their ancestor," the authors wrote in their paper. "But it also shows that neither rank nor status was the governing principle in the final desperate days of the expedition as they strove to save themselves."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/fresh-images-of-hms-terror-shipwreck-could-clear-up-lingering-mysteries/">previously reported</a>, Franklin's two ships, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Erebus_(1826)">HMS <em>Erebus</em></a> and the HMS <em>Terror</em>, became icebound in the Victoria Strait, and all 129 crew members ultimately died. It's been an enduring mystery that has captured imaginations ever since. Novelist Dan Simmons immortalized the expedition in his 2007 horror novel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_(novel)"><em>The Terror</em></a>, which was later adapted into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_(TV_series)">anthology TV series</a> for AMC in 2018.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053415#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053415&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/ceo-of-health-care-terrorists-faces-contempt-charges-after-senate-no-show/">infamous CEO of a failed hospital system</a> is suing an entire Senate committee after being held in contempt of Congress, with civil and criminal charges <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/senate-holds-rich-ceo-of-third-world-medicine-hospitals-in-contempt/">unanimously approved by the full Senate last week</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.273227/gov.uscourts.dcd.273227.1.0.pdf">a federal lawsuit filed Monday</a>, Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre claimed the senators "bulldozed over [his] constitutional rights" as they tried to "pillory and crucify him as a loathsome criminal" in a "televised circus."</p>
<p>The Senate committee—the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), led by Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)—issued a rare subpoena to de la Torre in July, compelling him to testify before the lawmakers. They sought to question the CEO on the deterioration of his hospital system, which previously included more than 30 hospitals across eight states. Steward filed for bankruptcy in May.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053520#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053520&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A married couple can't sue Uber over severe injuries they suffered in a 2022 car accident because of a mandatory arbitration provision in the ride-sharing company's terms of use, according to a <a href="https://www.njcourts.gov/system/files/court-opinions/2024/a1368-23.pdf">ruling</a> issued by the New Jersey Superior Court appellate division.</p>
<p>In November 2023, a lower court denied Uber's motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the complaint filed by plaintiffs Georgia and John McGinty. But the lower-court ruling was reversed on September 20 in a unanimous decision by three appellate court judges.</p>
<p>Georgia McGinty had agreed to Uber's arbitration clause long before the accident. But the couple challenged the terms in part because they say their minor daughter, then 12, was the one who clicked the most recent terms agreement when the girl ordered food through Uber Eats. Those newer terms were also allegedly less specific about users waiving the right to a jury trial.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053490#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053490&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-reddit-protests-are-winding-down-so-whats-next/">site-wide user protests</a> last year that featured moderators turning thousands of subreddits private or not-safe-for-work (NSFW), Reddit announced that mods now need its permission to make those changes.</p>
<p>Reddit's VP of community, going by Go_JasonWaterfalls, made the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1fsyzjd/a_change_to_community_type_settings/">announcement</a> about what Reddit calls Community Types today. Reddit's permission is also required to make subreddits restricted or to go from NSFW to safe-for-work (SFW). Reddit's employee claimed that requests will be responded to “in under 24 hours.”</p>
<p>Reddit’s employee said that “temporarily going restricted is exempt” from this requirement, adding that “mods can continue to instantly restrict posts and/or comments for up to 7 days using <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/27018580066708-Temporary-events">Temporary Events</a>.” Additionally, if a subreddit has fewer than 5,000 members or is less than 30 days old, the request “will be automatically approved,” per Go_JasonWaterfalls.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053478#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053478&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Public records systems that courts and governments rely on to manage voter registrations and legal filings have been riddled with vulnerabilities that made it possible for attackers to falsify registration databases and add, delete, or modify official documents.</p>
<p>Over the past year, software developer turned security researcher Jason Parker has found and reported dozens of critical vulnerabilities in no fewer than 19 commercial platforms used by hundreds of courts, government agencies, and police departments across the country. Most of the vulnerabilities were critical.</p>
<p><a href="https://govtech.cc/README-2024-09-27-georgia-voter-registration-cancellation.md">One flaw</a> he uncovered in the voter registration cancellation portal for the state of Georgia, for instance, allowed anyone visiting it to cancel the registration of any voter in that state when the visitor knew the name, birthdate, and county of residence of the voter. In another case, document management systems used in local courthouses across the country <a href="https://github.com/qwell/disclosures/blob/main/README-2023-11-30-disorder-in-the-court.md">contained</a> multiple <a href="https://github.com/qwell/disclosures/blob/main/README-2024-05-17-maricopa.md">flaws</a> that allowed unauthorized people to access sensitive filings such as psychiatric evaluations that were under seal. And in one case, unauthorized people could assign themselves privileges that are supposed to be available only to clerks of the court and, from there, create, delete, or modify filings.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053460#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053460&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The arrival of competent electric vehicles is a boon for car enthusiasts as much as those who consider driving a chore and their vehicle a driving appliance. Electric motors can respond faster than the revviest naturally aspirated engines this side of a mid-2000s Formula 1 engine, and with more immediate torque than the mightiest of turbochargers. They are the way forward, for performance as well as energy efficiency. Such is apparent after spending some time behind the wheel of a $128,000 Audi RS7 Performance after a diet of mostly EV performance cars.</p>
<p>For a long time, the RS7 was the Audi to go for if you wanted something with more than two doors, because the R8 doesn't work with your lifestyle. Based on the more humble A7 fastback sedan, it was worked over by Audi Sport, the four rings' racing offshoot based up the road from Ingolstadt in Neckarsulm, Germany. The designers there gave it a restyle, with aggressively flared arches to envelope larger wheels and tires, and new aerodynamic features to keep the car planted at speed. The result is one of the brand's handsomest creations, at least to this observer.</p>
<p>Under the hood, a twin-turbo 4.0L V8 is now even more potent than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/the-2020-audi-rs7-our-all-time-favorite-fastback-just-got-even-better/">when we first drove the RS7</a> in 2019, with 621 hp (463 kW) and 627 lb-ft (850 Nm) at your right foot's beck and call, sent to all four wheels via an eight-speed ZF 8 HP transmission and, at the rear axle, a torque-vectoring rear differential.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053421#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Wireless customers of Verizon and AT&amp;T have found that they cannot make calls, send or receive text messages, or download any mobile data. As of this article's publication, it appears the problem has yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>Users took to social media throughout the morning to complain that their phones were showing "SOS" mode, which allows emergency calls but nothing else. This is what phones sometimes offer when the user has no SIM registered on the device. Resetting the device and other common solutions do not resolve the issue. For much of the morning, Verizon offered no response to the reports.</p>
<p>Within hours, more than 100,000 users reported problems on the website <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/">Downdetector</a>. The problem does not appear isolated to any particular part of the country; users in California reported problems, and so did users on the East Coast and in Chicago, among other places.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053390#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053390&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Monday, the UK will see the closure of its last operational coal power plant, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, which has been operating since 1968. The closure of the plant, which had a capacity of 2,000 megawatts, will bring an end to the history of the country's coal use, which started with the opening of the first coal-fired power station in 1882. Coal played a central part in the UK's power system in the interim, in some years providing over 90 percent of its total electricity.</p>
<p>But a number of factors combined to place coal in a long-term decline: the growth of natural gas-powered plants and renewables, pollution controls, carbon pricing, and a government goal to hit net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p>
<h2>From boom to bust</h2>
<p>It's difficult to overstate the importance of coal to the UK grid. It was providing over 90 percent of the UK's electricity as recently as 1956. The total amount of power generated continued to climb well after that, reaching a peak of 212 terawatt hours of production by 1980. And the construction of new coal plants was under consideration as recently as the late 2000s. According to the organization Carbon Brief's <a href="https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/coal-phaseout-UK/">excellent timeline</a> of coal use in the UK, continuing the use of coal with carbon capture was given consideration.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053388#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053388&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A few weeks back, it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/apple-is-reportedly-trying-to-invest-in-openai/">reported</a> that Apple was exploring investing in OpenAI, the company that makes ChatGPT, the GPT model, and other popular generative AI products. Now, a new <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-no-longer-in-talks-to-join-openai-investment-round-e3be3e66">report</a> from The Wall Street Journal claims that Apple has abandoned those plans.</p>
<p>The article simply says Apple "fell out of the talks to join the round." The round is expected to close in a week or so and may raise as much as $6.5 billion for the growing Silicon Valley company. Had Apple gone through with the move, it would have been a rare event—though not completely unprecedented—for Apple to invest in another company that size.</p>
<p>OpenAI is still expected to raise the funds it seeks from other sources. The report claims Microsoft is expected to invest around $1 billion in this round. Microsoft has already invested substantial sums in OpenAI, whose GPT models power Microsoft AI tools like Copilot and Bing chat.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053378#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053378&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The aquifer from which Joliet, Illinois, sources its drinking water is likely going to run too dry to support the city by 2030—a problem more and more communities are facing as the climate changes and groundwater declines. So Joliet eyed a huge water source 30 miles to the northeast: Lake Michigan.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">its antitrust win against Google last year</a>, Epic is now going after both Samsung and Google for allegedly conspiring to set up what it says is a similarly anti-competitive scheme on its Galaxy smartphones.</p>
<p>Epic's <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/complaint-0c7b21e4a6f4.pdf">newly filed federal lawsuit</a> focuses on Samsung's Auto Blocker feature, a setting designed to prevent Galaxy smartphone users from downloading "unauthorized" apps from third-party sources such as <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile">the recently launched Android version of the Epic Games Store</a>. Introduced last year <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/protect-device-your-way-samsung-auto-blocker/">as an opt-in feature</a>, the Auto Blocker feature <a href="https://www.samsung.com/latin_en/support/mobile-devices/protect-your-galaxy-device-with-the-new-auto-blocker-feature/">is now activated by default</a> during the initial setup of a Samsung phone following a July system update (the feature can be turned off with a simple toggle during setup or in the phone's settings afterward).</p>
<p>Epic's lawsuit takes a particular exception to the fact that Samsung doesn't provide any way for a company like Epic to qualify as an "authorized source" that has been judged as safe under the Auto Blocker. "While Samsung half-heartedly claims Auto Blocker is a security feature, its operation is to block all competing stores, regardless of how safe and secure they may be—and without any assessment of their safety or security or any path for other stores to achieve 'authorization,'" the suit argues.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053366#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053366&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>DirecTV today <a href="https://www.directv.com/insider/directv-and-dish/">announced</a> an agreement to buy the Dish satellite TV and Sling TV streaming business from EchoStar for a nominal fee of $1 in what the companies called a debt exchange transaction. DirecTV will take on $9.75 billion of Dish debt if the deal is completed.</p>
<p>In a related transaction also <a href="https://www.tpg.com/news-and-insights/tpg-to-acquire-atts-70-stake-in-directv/">announced today</a>, private equity firm TPG plans to buy AT&amp;T's 70 percent stake in DirecTV. TPG already owns the other 30 percent of DirecTV.</p>
<p>The pending DirecTV/Dish deal would combine the two major satellite TV companies in the US, removing a choice for satellite users. But DirecTV claims it "will benefit US video consumers by creating a more robust competitive force in a video industry dominated by streaming services owned by large tech companies and programmers." The agreement, which follows years of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/02/dish-calls-directv-merger-inevitable-because-of-threat-from-streaming-tv/">on-again, off-again</a> merger discussions between the companies, needs regulatory approval and is tentatively planned to close in Q4 2025.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053355#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053355&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As of Monday morning, if one wanted to grasp the historic nature of flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Helene in western parts of North Carolina and the surrounding areas, the logical place to begin is at the National Climatic Data Center.</p>
<p>This federal office maintains the world's largest climate data archive and provides historical perspective to put present-day weather conditions and natural disasters into context in a warming world due to climate change.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the National Climatic Data Center is based in Asheville, North Carolina. As I write this, <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">the center's website</a> remains offline. That's because Asheville, a city in North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains, is the epicenter of catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Helene that has played out over the last week. The climate data facility is inoperable because water and electricity services in the region have entirely broken down due to flooding.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053311#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053311&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX is <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">investigating a problem with the Falcon 9 rocket's upper stage that caused it to reenter the atmosphere and fall into the sea outside of its intended disposal area after a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/09/spacex-set-to-launch-mission-to-bring-starliner-astronauts-back-to-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saturday launch</a></span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/09/spacex-set-to-launch-mission-to-bring-starliner-astronauts-back-to-earth/"> with a two-man crew</a> heading to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The upper stage malfunction apparently occurred after the Falcon 9 successfully deployed SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft carrying NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov on SpaceX's Crew-9 mission. Hague and Gorbunov safely arrived at the space station Sunday to begin a five-month stay at the orbiting research complex.</p>
<p>The Falcon 9's second stage Merlin vacuum engine fired for more than six minutes to place the Crew Dragon spacecraft into orbit after liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The engine was supposed to reignite later to steer the upper stage on a trajectory back into Earth's atmosphere for disposal over the South Pacific Ocean, ensuring the rocket doesn't remain in orbit as a piece of space junk.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053306#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053306&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed SB-1047, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/from-sci-fi-to-state-law-californias-plan-to-prevent-ai-catastrophe/">a controversial artificial intelligence regulation</a> that would have required the makers of large AI models to impose safety tests and kill switches to prevent potential "critical harms."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/SB-1047-Veto-Message.pdf">a statement announcing the veto</a> on Sunday evening, Newsom suggested the bill's specific interest in model size was misplaced. "By focusing only on the most expensive and large-scale models, SB-1047 establishes a regulatory framework that could give the public a false sense of security about controlling this fast-moving technology," Newsom wrote. "Smaller, specialized models may emerge as equally or even more dangerous than the models targeted by SB-1047—at the potential expense of curtailing the very innovation that fuels advancement in favor of the public good."</p>
<p>Newsom mentioned specific "rapidly evolving risks" from AI models that could be regulated in a more targeted way, such as "threats to our democratic process, the spread of misinformation and deepfakes, risks to online privacy, threats to critical infrastructure, and disruptions in the workforce." California already has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/29/here-is-whats-illegal-under-californias-18-and-counting-new-ai-laws/">a number of AI laws on the books</a> targeting some of these potential harms, and many other states <a href="https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/us-state-by-state-artificial-intelligence-legislation-snapshot.html">have signed similar laws</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053322#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053322&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This year marks the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1660-dungeons-dragons-turns-50-see-how-were-celebrating">50th anniversary</a> of the tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> (<em><em>D&amp;D</em></em>). A game of creativity and imagination, <em><em>D&amp;D</em></em> lets players weave their own narrative, blending combat and roleplaying in an immersive gaming experience. And now, psychologists and therapists are working to turn it into a tool by exploring its <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/ab3db202-341f-4dd4-a5e7-f455d924ce22">potential benefits</a> as a <a href="https://concept.paloaltou.edu/resources/the-thoughtful-counselor-podcast/lets-roll-play-dd-in-therapy">group therapy</a> technique.</p>
<p>Research is still in progress to determine if there are links between playing <em><em>D&amp;D</em></em> and enhanced empathy and <a href="https://journals.uu.se/IJRP/article/view/224/256">social skills</a>, but the real-life impact of <em>D&amp;D</em> therapy is slowly gaining traction as staff of <a href="https://juliastamman.com/dndtherapygroup/">counseling practices</a> that have embraced <em>D&amp;D</em> group therapy say they are <a href="https://www.wusf.org/2017-08-10/negotiating-with-the-dragon-role-playing-games-as-group-therapy">witnessing</a> these benefits firsthand.</p>
<p>“It seems particularly useful in combating the effects of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J009v09n01_05">social isolation</a> and improving both <a href="https://kotaku.com/therapists-are-using-dungeons-dragons-to-get-kids-to-1794806159">interpersonal skills</a> and intrapersonal skills (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/ab3db202-341f-4dd4-a5e7-f455d924ce22">problem-solving</a>),” explained <a href="https://www.game-therapy.co.uk/gary-colman">Gary Colman</a>, the chairman of <a href="https://www.game-therapy.co.uk/">Game Therapy UK</a>, a registered charity staffed by volunteer professionals who are developing evidence-based therapeutic gaming projects. “In practical terms, it can also be used for a range of purposes, including modeling <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7872422/">positive behavior</a> and teaching soft <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2011.00821.x">social skills</a> and basic <a href="https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/51790/how-dungeons-dragons-primes-students-for-interdisciplinary-learning-including-stem">educational skills</a>, including language and numeracy.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040158#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040158&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Billions of cells die in your body every day. Some go out with a bang, others with a whimper.</p>
<p>They can die by accident if they’re injured or infected. Alternatively, should they outlive their natural lifespan or start to fail, they can carefully arrange for a desirable demise, with their remains neatly tidied away.</p>
<p>Originally, scientists thought those were the only two ways an animal cell could die, by accident or by that neat-and-tidy version. But over the past couple of decades, researchers have<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41418-017-0012-4"> racked up many more novel cellular death</a> scenarios, some specific to certain cell types or situations. Understanding this panoply of death modes could help scientists save good cells and kill bad ones, leading to treatments for infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053130#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053130&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov lifted off Saturday from Florida's Space Coast aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, heading for a five-month expedition on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The two-man crew launched on top of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket at 1:17 pm EDT (17:17 UTC), taking advantage of a break in the stormy weather to begin their climb to space. Nine kerosene-fueled Merlin engines powered the first stage of the flight on a trajectory northeast from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, then the booster detached and returned to landing at Cape Canaveral as the Falcon 9's upper stage accelerated SpaceX's Crew Dragon <em>Freedom </em>spacecraft into orbit.</p>
<p>"It was a sweet ride," Hague said after arriving in space. With a seemingly flawless launch, Hague and Gorbunov are on track to arrive at the space station around 5:30 pm EDT (2130 UTC) Sunday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053288#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053288&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an earlier <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/is-it-time-for-gdpr-2-0/">article</a>, I discussed a few of the flaws in Europe’s flagship data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Building on that critique, I would now like to go further, proposing specifications for developing a robust privacy protection regime in the US.</p>
<p>Writers must overcome several hurdles to have a chance at persuading readers about possible flaws in the GDPR. First, some readers are skeptical of any piece criticizing the GDPR because they believe the law is still too young to evaluate. Second, some are suspicious of any piece criticizing the GDPR because they suspect that the authors might be covert supporters of Big Tech’s anti-GDPR agenda. (I can assure readers that I am not, nor have I ever, worked to support any agenda of Big Tech companies.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053275#p3">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053275&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
