              <![CDATA[<p>If humanity is ever to spread out into the Solar System, we're going to need to find a way to put fuel into rockets somewhere other than the cozy confines of a launchpad on Earth. One option for that is in low-Earth orbit, which has the advantage of being located very close to said launch pads. But it has the considerable disadvantage of requiring a lot of energy to escape Earth's gravity—it takes a lot of fuel to put substantially less fuel into orbit.</p>
<p>One alternative is to produce fuel on the Moon. We know there is hydrogen and oxygen present, and the Moon's gravity is far easier to overcome, meaning more of what we produce there can be used to send things deeper into the Solar System. But there is a tradeoff: any fuel production infrastructure will likely need to be built on Earth and sent to the Moon.</p>
<p>How much infrastructure is that going to involve? A study released today by PNAS evaluates the energy costs of producing oxygen on the Moon, and finds that they're substantial: about 24 kWh per kilogram. This doesn't sound bad until you start considering how many kilograms we're going to eventually need.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/turning-the-moon-into-a-fuel-depot-will-take-a-lot-of-power/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Remember the Lumia 1020? It's back—in iPhone SE form.</p>
<p>The Lumia 1020 was a lot of smartphone in July 2013. It debuted with a focus "almost entirely on the phone's massive camera," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/07/in-the-dark-and-on-the-move-with-the-nokia-lumia-1020s-camera/">Ars wrote at the time</a>. That big 41-megapixel sensor jutted forth from the phone body, and Nokia reps showed off its low-light, rapid-motion camera abilities by shooting pictures of breakdancers in a dark demonstration room. The company also offered an optional camera grip—one that made it feel a lot more like a point-and-shoot camera. In a more robust review, Ars suggested <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/the-nokia-lumia-1020-the-smartphone-to-render-point-and-shoots-obsolete/">the Lumia 1020 might actually make the point-and-shoot obsolete</a>.</p>

<p>The Lumia 1020 contained yet another cutting edge concept of the day: Windows Phone, Microsoft's color-coded, square-shaped companion to its mobile-forward Windows 8. The mobile OS never got over the users/apps, chicken/egg conundrum, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/windows-phone-is-now-officially-dead-a-sad-tale-of-what-might-have-been/">called it quits in October 2017</a>. The end of that distant-third-place mobile OS would normally signal the end of the Lumia 1020 as a usable phone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/windows-lumiphone-modder-elegantly-fits-2022-iphone-into-2013-nokia-body/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In a media briefing held Monday, the South Korean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Information_Protection_Commission_(South_Korea)">Personal Information Protection Commission</a> indicated that it had paused new downloads within the country of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's mobile app. The restriction took effect on Saturday and doesn't affect South Korean users who already have the app installed on their devices. The DeepSeek service also remains accessible in South Korea via the web.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/south-koreas-data-protection-authority-suspends-local-service-deepseek-2025-02-17/">Reuters</a>, PIPC explained that representatives from DeepSeek acknowledged the company had "partially neglected" some of its obligations under South Korea's data protection laws, which provide South Koreans some of the <a href="https://cookie-script.com/privacy-laws/south-korean-data-privacy-law">strictest privacy protections</a> globally.</p>
<p>PIPC investigation division director Nam Seok is quoted by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-deepseek-app-downloads-privacy-concerns-ai-20950f357276b9bb8f2a70a4b3c03e96">Associated Press</a> as saying DeepSeek "lacked transparency about third-party data transfers and potentially collected excessive personal information." DeepSeek reportedly has dispatched a representative to South Korea to work through any issues and bring the app into compliance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/south-korea-pauses-deepseek-app-downloads-over-privacy-concerns/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Despite two federal court orders directing the administration to resume distributing federal grants and loans, at least $19 billion in Environmental Protection Agency funding to thousands of state and local governments and nonprofits remained on hold as of Feb. 14, said environmental and legal advocates who are tracking the issue.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, is seemingly blocking links to Signal, the encrypted messaging platform, according to journalist Matt Binder and other firsthand accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.disruptionist.com/p/elon-musks-x-blocks-links-to-signal">Binder wrote in his Disruptionist newsletter Sunday</a> that links to <a href="https://signal.me">Signal.me</a>, a domain that offers a way to connect directly to Signal users, are blocked on public posts, direct messages, and profile pages. Error messages—including "Message not sent," "Something went wrong," and profiles tagged as "considered malware" or "potentially harmful"—give no direct suggestion of a block. But posts on X, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613997/x-blocks-signal-me-links-errors">reporting at The Verge</a>, and other sources suggest that Signal.me links are broadly banned.</p>
<p>Signal.me links that were already posted on X prior to the recent change now show a "Warning: this link may be unsafe" interstitial page rather than opening the link directly. Links to Signal handles and <a href="https://signal.org/">the Signal homepage</a> are still functioning on X.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/x-is-reportedly-blocking-links-to-secure-signal-contact-pages/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The likely next leader of NASA, private astronaut and pilot Jared Isaacman, has kept a low profile since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/jared-isaacman-entrepreneur-and-private-astronaut-is-trumps-choice-to-lead-nasa/">announcement last year</a> that he was President Donald Trump's choice to lead the space agency.</p>
<p>This is understandable, as Isaacman must still be confirmed by the US Senate. No date has yet been put forward for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Typically, during this interim period, nominees meet with Senators behind closed doors before their hearings and limit public comments that could put them in the hot seat during the confirmation process.</p>
<p>This has meant that we've heard little from the person who is in line to lead NASA over the next four years as the space agency confronts a number of issues. These include reconfiguring the Artemis Program, a potential pivot toward Mars, an aging International Space Station, Mars Sample Return, a limited pipeline of science missions, and the likelihood of budget cuts. On top of all of this there is the uncertainty and unease federal workers face as the Trump Administration scrutinizes their activities for efficiency and, in some cases, loyalty.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-nominee-previews-his-vision-for-the-agency-mars-hard-work-inspiration/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like it or not, generative AI is carving out its place in the world. And some Reddit users are definitely in the “don't like it" category. While some subreddits openly welcome AI-generated images, videos, and text, others have responded to the growing trend by banning most or all posts made with the technology.</p>
<p>To better understand the reasoning and obstacles associated with these bans, Ars Technica spoke with moderators of subreddits that totally or partially ban generative AI. Almost all these volunteers described moderating against generative AI as a time-consuming challenge they expect to get more difficult as time goes on. And most are hoping that Reddit will release a tool to help their efforts.</p>
<p>It's hard to know how much AI-generated content is actually on Reddit, and getting an estimate would be a large undertaking. Image library Freepik has <a href="https://www.freepik.com/ai-content-on-the-web">analyzed</a> the use of AI-generated content on social media but leaves Reddit out of its research because “it would take loads of time to manually comb through thousands of threads within the platform,” spokesperson Bella Valentini told me. For its part, Reddit doesn't publicly disclose how many Reddit posts involve generative AI use.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/reddit-mods-are-fighting-to-keep-ai-slop-off-subreddits-they-could-use-help/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[As NASA astronauts aim for landings in 2027, geologists find surprises in recently retrieved samples from the far side]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p class="article-byline">In the summer of 2024, a robotic mission landed for the first time on the far side of the Moon. The Chinese Chang’e-6 lander planted a flag, dug up more than four pounds of rock and soil, and brought it back home—an accomplishment widely lauded as a technological tour de force.</p>
<div class="article-content">
<div class="article-text -drop-cap">
<p>That mission, and the 2020 Chang’e-5 robotic mission before it, are the first to return lunar rocks to Earth since the 1970s. Together they are building on what scientists learned from Apollo-era missions, helping to unravel mysteries about how the Moon was formed and why it looks the way it does today, and providing clues about our solar system’s history.</p>
<p>But big puzzles remain, such as why the far side of the Moon—the half that always faces away from Earth—is so radically different from the near side. And what is behind the surprising finding that lunar volcanoes may have been active much more recently than previously thought? “The more we look at the Moon, the more we’ve discovered—and the more we realize how little we know,” says Clive R. Neal, a geologist at the University of Notre Dame who specializes in lunar exploration.</p>

<p>With NASA planning to send astronauts back to the Moon’s surface in 2027 for the first time since 1972, geologists are excited about what rocks they might find there and the scientific secrets those samples could reveal—along with what resources could be mined for a future Moon base, or for renewable energy back home on Earth.</p>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p>The samples brought home from the Moon in the 1970s by the Apollo missions and the Soviet Union’s Luna missions cleared up quite a lot about the <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/physical-world/2019/how-moon-landings-changed-our-view-solar-system">Moon’s history</a>. Because the lunar samples shared strong similarities with Earth rocks, this added weight to the idea that the Moon was formed when a Mars-sized object called Theia collided with the proto-Earth roughly <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-031621-060538">4.5 billion years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Debris from the impact was thrown into orbit around Earth and eventually coalesced into the Moon. In its early days, the Moon was entirely molten. As the magma ocean cooled over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon formed a crust and a mantle below. Giant pools of lava filled impact craters and settled into the lunar lowlands, or maria (Latin for “seas”), while highlands and volcanic domes loomed above them. Eventually, the volcanism died out.</p>
<p>Without plate tectonics or weather, the only things left to alter the Moon’s cold, dead surface were meteorites. A lot of the Apollo-era samples were found to have formed from the heat and pressure of impacts around 3.9 billion years ago, suggesting that they were the result of a short period of intense pummeling by space rocks called the Late Heavy Bombardment.</p>
<p>But research since the 1970s has refined or changed this picture. Higher-resolution orbital images have revealed plenty of large impact craters that seem far older than 3.9 billion years, for example. And meteorites found on Earth, thought to have been ejected from various areas of the Moon during big impacts, have been found to span a huge range of ages.</p>
<p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5602003/">All this work together suggests</a> that the asteroid bombardment didn’t happen in one dramatic spike but rather over an extended period lasting from perhaps 4.2 billion to 3.4 billion years ago. In this scenario, the Apollo samples dated to 3.9 billion years likely all came from just one huge impact that spewed rock over a very wide area that happened to include the Apollo-era landing sites.</p>
<h2>The Moon: Dead or alive</h2>
<p>Greater mysteries surround volcanism on the Moon. “The canonical thing I learned in school was that the Moon had been geologically dead for billions of years,” says Samuel Lawrence, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p>The long-held theory was that a small body like the Moon should have lost its heat to space relatively quickly—and a frigid, extinguished Moon shouldn’t have widespread volcanic activity. Apollo-era samples suggested that most of this volcanism stopped 3 billion years ago or earlier, supporting the theory. But research over the past two decades has overturned that view.</p>

      This geologic map of the Moon released in 2022 by China is the most detailed global map yet published and includes information gleaned from the 2020 Chang’e-5 mission.

<p>In 2014, Lawrence and colleagues posited that some patches of irregular terrain in the middle of the dark plains, or mare, spotted by the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter were the result of volcanism that kept going until <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2252">less than 100 million years ago</a>. “That is totally, totally surprising,” says cosmochemist Qing-Zhu Yin of the University of California, Davis.</p>
<p>The latest sample-return missions added more concrete evidence for recent volcanism. In 2020, the Chang’e-5 robotic mission landed in Oceanus Procellarum (the Ocean of Storms) — a spot picked in part because it looked geologically young given how few craters had accumulated there. Sure enough, the volcanic rocks brought home by that mission were found to be <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7957">2 billion years old</a>, the youngest ever retrieved from the Moon. “That was big news,” says planetary geoscientist Jim Head of Brown University, who worked on NASA’s Apollo missions.</p>
<p>On top of this, when researchers trawled through thousands of glass beads found in the Chang’e-5 soil samples, most of which are thought to have been created by impacts, they identified three that were volcanic—and only <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk6635">120 million years old</a>. This finding was published just last year and still needs to be verified, but if such recent dates hold up, they suggest that the Moon might <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr9336">still be capable of producing deep magma even today</a>, Yin says.</p>
<p>All this indicates that the Moon might not have cooled as fast as everyone thought it did. It’s also possible that some of the younger volcanism could have been powered by radioactive elements underground, which can generate enough heat to form magma and are known to be prevalent in certain patches of the Moon. This could explain the 120-million-year-old volcanic glass beads, for example. But not all the early volcanism can be explained this way: The Chang’e-5 volcanic rocks, along with some 2.8-billion-year-old volcanic rock brought back from the far side by Chang’e-6, came from source rocks <em>not </em>enriched with these elements.</p>
<p>“It throws up more questions than it answers,” Neal says. “It’s job security for people like me — we now have new questions to address.”<!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>Lunar exploration ahead</h2>
<p>Untangling these mysteries is challenging with so much of the Moon unexplored: While about 850 pounds of Moon rock and soil have now been brought back to Earth, it has all been from just a handful of sites.</p>
<p>Chang’e-6 expanded this picture by bringing back the first samples from the Moon’s far side, taken from the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the satellite’s largest, deepest and oldest impact crater. Researchers are keen to use these samples to start determining why the far side is so dramatically different from the near side. The questions that remain unanswered are why the far side has a thicker crust and is nearly devoid of mare from ancient lava oceans when compared with the near side.</p>
<p>NASA’s Artemis III mission, planned for 2027 (though that could <a href="https://aviationweek.com/space/space-exploration/mars-mind-will-trump-put-moon-back-burner">change</a>), aims to break more new ground by landing astronauts near the Moon’s south pole—in a spot that is more representative of the Moon’s typical geology than the Apollo sites—and bring home a bonanza of 150 to 180 pounds of samples.</p>
<p>This site should provide fresh geological insights, along with more information about lunar water. In 2018, scientists analyzing orbital mapping data <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/ice-confirmed-at-the-moons-poles/">confirmed that there is water ice</a> at the poles—but in what form no one yet knows. “Is it frost on the surface? Is it discrete patches underneath the surface? Is it absorbed onto mineral grains? Is it baked into the regolith like cement?” says NASA’s Juliane Gross, who is helping to develop the plans for lunar sample collection and curation for the Artemis science team. “We don’t know.”</p>
<p>What the Artemis astronauts find could inform ongoing projects spearheaded by China and the United States to establish permanent bases on the Moon, which could benefit from the south pole’s water. “That’s stuff you can breathe, that’s stuff you can drink, it’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576523000061">rocket fuel</a>,” Lawrence says.</p>
<h2>Lunar quarry</h2>
<p>In addition to water ice, other potentially mineable resources on the Moon have garnered attention, particularly <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Space_for_Earth/Energy/Helium-3_mining_on_the_lunar_surface">helium-3</a>. This stable isotope of helium is far more plentiful on the Moon than on Earth and could be an ideal fuel for <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/physical-world/2023/the-challenge-of-fusion-power">nuclear fusion</a> (if physicists can get that process to work). Commercial enterprises seeking to mine the Moon have popped up, including Seattle-based <a href="https://www.interlune.space/blog/excavate-sort-extract-and-separate-interlune-core-intellectual-property">Interlune</a>, which plans to bring helium-3 back to Earth in the 2030s, followed by other resources such as rare earth elements needed for technologies like batteries. But when lunar mining will be a reality—considering the logistics, the economics and the legal concerns—is an open question, Lawrence says.</p>
<p>While some people find the idea of mining the pristine Moon distasteful, there could be side benefits for mining on Earth, Neal says. With polar temperatures around -230° C (-380° F), lunar mining would have to be done without fluids. Developing the technologies needed for fluid-free mining could mitigate environmental concerns about wastewater and tailing fluids from mining on Earth. “Just think how you could revolutionize mining on this planet,” he says.</p>
<p>But first, researchers need to simply find out more about the Moon, its history, its geology and the possibility of extracting resources—and that requires up-close exploration, which is sure to bring more surprises. “Once you’re on the ground, you’re like, oh … what’s this?” Gross says. She’s hoping the astronauts can bring home a large haul. “The more they return, the more we can do.”</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For years, Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski stood as the undisputed champion of <em>Diablo</em> speedrunning. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW8XorD9RwI">3-minute, 12-second Sorcerer run</a> looked all but unbeatable thanks to a combination of powerful (and allowable) glitch exploits along with what seemed like some unbelievable luck in the game's randomly generated dungeon.</p>
<p>But when a team of other speedrunners started trying and failing to replicate that luck using outside software and analysis tools, the story behind Groobo's run began to fall apart. As the inconsistencies in the run <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/">started to mount</a>, that team would conduct an automated search through billions of legitimate <em>Diablo</em> dungeons to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Groobo's game couldn't have taken place in any of them.</p>
<p>"We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," team member Staphen told Ars Technica of their investigation. "Betrayal might be another way to describe it," team member AJenbo added. "To find out that this had been done illegitimately... and the person had both gotten and taken a lot of praise for their achievement."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/">Read full article</a></p>

It's the first manufacturer to sell electric vehicles with native NACS ports—other than Tesla, that is, and you'll be able to read about our first drive in the model year 2025 Ioniq 5, as well as the new, off-roady Ioniq 5 XRT next week. But we've got some good news for owners of any existing Hyundai EVs out there—if your car has a CCS1 port, then next month, you're eligible for a free CCS1-NACS adapter.</p>
<p>Hyundai wasn't the first OEM to ink a deal with Tesla to gain access to the Supercharger network, but it is ahead of Ford, General Motors, and Rivian in swapping to the Tesla-style charge ports. Existing owners get access to the large charging network, too, but they'll need an adapter to make use of the smaller NACS plugs.</p>
<p>And those will be available next month, Hyundai told us. What's more, they're going to be <em>gratis</em>, <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/21932/what-does-the-term-and-free-as-in-free-beer-mean">or free as in beer</a>. As long as you have a VIN, the automaker will send you the adapter, which you'll be able to order once the website goes live in March.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/hyundais-nacs-adapter-for-evs-will-be-free-to-all-existing-owners/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI published the latest version of its "<a href="https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html">Model Spec</a>," a set of guidelines detailing how ChatGPT should behave and respond to user requests. The document reveals a notable shift in OpenAI's content policies, particularly around "sensitive" content like erotica and gore—allowing this type of content to be generated without warnings in "<a href="https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#sensitive_content">appropriate contexts</a>."</p>
<p>The change in policy has been in the works since <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-is-exploring-how-to-responsibly-generate-ai-porn/">May 2024</a>, when the original Model Spec document first <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#dont-respond-with-nsfw-content">mentioned</a> that OpenAI was exploring "whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts through the API and ChatGPT."</p>
<p>ChatGPT's guidelines now state that that "erotica or gore" may now be generated, but only under specific circumstances. "The assistant should not generate erotica, depictions of illegal or non-consensual sexual activities, or extreme gore, except in scientific, historical, news, creative or other contexts where sensitive content is appropriate," OpenAI writes. "This includes depictions in text, audio (e.g., erotic or violent visceral noises), or visual content."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/chatgpt-can-now-write-erotica-as-openai-eases-up-on-ai-paternalism/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As prominent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed to the nation's top health position Thursday, Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham sent a memo to the state's health department saying that the state "will no longer promote mass vaccination" and barred staff from running seasonal vaccine campaigns, according to <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/louisiana-vaccines-abraham-department-health/article_e84828d8-ea38-11ef-af78-036bbfc0e22e.html#tncms-source=featured-3">a report by the Times-Picayune of New Orleans</a>.</p>
<p>The memo echoes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/louisiana-bars-health-dept-from-promoting-flu-covid-mpox-vaccines-report/">directives that state health employees say they were told in October and November</a>. In meetings at the time, employees learned of a policy shift that would end seasonal campaigns for flu, COVID-19, and mpox vaccines, but it was to be implemented discreetly and not put in writing.</p>
<p>According to Abraham's memo, the abandonment of lifesaving vaccination campaigns is in service of individual choice. "For many illnesses, vaccines are one tool in the toolbox of ways to combat severe illness," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/louisiana-mass-vaccination.html?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y7TRe-NKnZcOmmHnV7C7IMEv_iWgcHs3muaqUKW5uVpO71Tzao8VKW92hLUd1iiFYEU3PppG-nJwLPXAqYJbOgooaeA&amp;_hsmi=347361433&amp;utm_content=347361433&amp;utm_source=hs_email">according to The New York Times</a>, which also obtained a copy of the memo.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/louisiana-officially-ends-mass-vaccinations-as-rfk-jr-comes-to-power/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have uncovered a sustained and ongoing campaign by Russian spies that uses a clever phishing technique to hijack Microsoft 365 accounts belonging to a wide range of targets, researchers warned.</p>
<p>The technique is known as device code phishing. It exploits “device code flow,” a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-07#section-3.4">OAuth standard</a>. Authentication through device code flow is designed for logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These devices typically don’t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.</p>
<p>Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a computer or other device that’s easier to sign in with and enters the code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained device that logs it into the account.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In 2019, Haley Olson's life in Grant County, Oregon, was upended when people in town appeared to know about private nude photos that Olson kept on her phone. Worse, some of the people appeared to have seen and shared the photos. The incidents all had some relationship to the local sheriff's department, where Olson was dating one of the deputies.</p>
<p>In July, for instance, a stranger in a sheriff's office uniform approached her to say that he had "heard there’s some pretty smokin’ pictures of you going around the sheriff’s office." Someone else saw a married couple, both of whom worked for the sheriff's office, looking at Olson's photos on the husband's phone. Other people also approached Olson with knowledge of her recent out-of-state arrest. One person called her "the drug dealer that likes to f--- cops."</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A measles outbreak in an area of Texas with abysmal vaccination rates continues to mushroom, with cases doubling since Tuesday and expanding into additional counties.</p>
<p>A week ago, officials reported <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-erupts-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/">nine confirmed cases</a> in Gaines County, at the border of New Mexico, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates among kindergartners in the state at just <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage">about 82 percent</a>. On Tuesday, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-doubles-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/">cases climbed to 24</a>, all in Gaines. In Friday's update, the state health department reports that <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-14-2025">the case count has now reached 48 and spread to three nearby counties</a>, which also have vaccination rates below the 95 percent threshold that prevent vaccine-preventable diseases from spreading onward.</p>
<p>Gaines now reports 42 cases. There's one case reported in Lynn County to the northeast, which has a 91 percent vaccination rate. Terry County, with a vaccination rate of 94 percent, reports three cases, and Yoakum County, with a vaccination rate of 92.5 percent, reports two cases. Terry and Yoakum are both directly north of Gaines.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/texas-measles-outbreak-climbs-to-48-cases-almost-all-kids-13-hospitalized/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Working at the intersection of Apple's newest hardware and Linux kernel development, for the benefit of a free distribution, was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/asahi-linux-is-already-running-on-the-mac-studios-new-m1-ultra-chip/">never going to be easy</a>. But it's been an especially hard couple of weeks for Hector Martin, project lead for Asahi Linux, capping off years of what he describes as burnout, user entitlement, and political battles within the Linux kernel community about Rust code.</p>
<p>In a post on his site, "<a href="https://marcan.st/2025/02/resigning-as-asahi-linux-project-lead/">Resigning as Asahi Linux project lead</a>," Martin summarizes his history with hardware hacking projects, including his time with the Wii homebrew scene (Team Twiizers/<a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Fail0verflow">fail0verflow</a>), which had its share of insistent users desperate to play pirated games. Martin shifted his focus, and when Apple unveiled its own silicon with the M1 series, Martin writes, "I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project." This time, there was no jailbreaking and a relatively open, if tricky, platform.</p>
<p>Support and donations came quickly. The first two years saw rapid advancement of a platform built "from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation." Upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, across "practically every Linux subsystem," was an "<em>incredibly</em> frustrating experience" (emphasis Martin's).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/asahi-linux-lead-resigns-from-mac-based-distro-after-tumultuous-kernel-debate/">Read full article</a></p>
