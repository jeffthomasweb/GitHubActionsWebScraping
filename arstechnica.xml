                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued a now familiar order: because of a supposed energy emergency, a coal plant scheduled for closure would be forced to remain open. This time, the order targeted one of the three units present at Craig Station in Colorado, which was scheduled to close at the end of this year. The remaining two units were expected to shut in 2028.</p>
<p>The supposed reason for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/documents/federal-power-act-section-202c-craig-order-no-202-25-14">this order</a> is an emergency caused by a shortage of generating capacity. "The reliable supply of power from the coal plant is essential for keeping the region’s electric grid stable," according to a statement issued by the Department of Energy. Yet <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/11/14/tri-state-craig-station-trump-federal-power-act-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">the Colorado Sun notes</a> that Colorado's Public Utilities Commission had already analyzed the impact of its potential closure, and determined, "Craig Unit 1 is not required for reliability or resource adequacy purposes."</p>
<p>The order does not require the plant to actually produce electricity; instead, it is ordered to be available in case a shortfall in production occurs. As noted in the Colorado Sun article, actual operation of the plant would potentially violate Colorado laws, which regulate airborne pollution and set limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The cost of maintaining the plant is likely to fall on the local ratepayers, who <a href="https://www.rmpbs.org/blogs/science-environment/craig-coal-plant-closure">had already adjusted</a> to the closure plans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trump-admin-orders-another-coal-plant-to-stay-open/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/12/the-20-most-read-stories-of-2024-on-ars-technica/">roundup</a> of the top stories of 2024, Ars included a supply-chain attack that came dangerously close to inflicting a catastrophe for thousands—possibly millions—of organizations, which included a large assortment of Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Supply-chain attacks played prominently again this year, as a seemingly unending rash of them hit organizations large and small.</p>
<p>For threat actors, supply-chain attacks are the gift that keeps on giving—or, if you will, the hack that keeps on hacking. By compromising a single target with a large number of downstream users—say a cloud service or maintainers or developers of widely used open source or proprietary software—attackers can infect potentially millions of the target’s downstream users. That’s exactly what threat actors did in 2025.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/backdoor-slips-into-popular-code-library-drains-155k-from-digital-wallets/">such event</a> occurred in December 2024, making it worthy of a ranking for 2025. The hackers behind the campaign pocketed as much as $155,000 from thousands of smart-contract parties on the Solana blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/12/supply-chains-ai-and-the-cloud-the-biggest-failures-and-one-success-of-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Following two years of immense hype in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/a-song-of-hype-and-fire-the-10-biggest-ai-stories-of-2023/">2023</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/">2024</a>, this year felt more like a settling-in period for the LLM-based token prediction industry. After more than two years of public fretting over AI models as future <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/openai-execs-warn-of-risk-of-extinction-from-artificial-intelligence-in-new-open-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threats</a> to human civilization or the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/after-ai-setbacks-meta-bets-billions-on-undefined-superintelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seedlings of future gods</a>, it's starting to look like hype is giving way to pragmatism: Today's AI can be very useful, but it's also clearly imperfect and prone to mistakes.</p>
<p>That view isn't universal, of course. There's a lot of money (and rhetoric) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ars-live-recap-is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-pop-ed-zitron-weighs-in/">betting</a> on a stratospheric, world-rocking trajectory for AI. But the "when" keeps getting pushed back, and that's because nearly everyone agrees that more significant technical breakthroughs are required. The original, lofty <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">claims</a> that we're on the verge of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence (ASI) have not disappeared. Still, there's a growing awareness that such proclaimations are perhaps best viewed as venture capital marketing. And every commercial foundational model builder out there has to grapple with the reality that, if they're going to make money <em>now</em>, they have to sell practical AI-powered solutions that perform as reliable tools.</p>
<p>This has made 2025 a year of wild juxtapositions. For example, in January, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/sam-altman-says-we-are-now-confident-we-know-how-to-build-agi/">claimed</a> that the company knew how to build <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">AGI</a>, but by November, he was publicly celebrating that GPT-5.1 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/forget-agi-sam-altman-celebrates-chatgpt-finally-following-em-dash-formatting-rules/">finally learned</a> to use em dashes correctly when instructed (but not always). Nvidia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/nvidia-hits-record-5-trillion-mark-as-ceo-dismisses-ai-bubble-concerns/">soared</a> past a $5 trillion valuation, with Wall Street still projecting high price targets for that company's stock while some banks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/bank-of-england-warns-ai-stock-bubble-rivals-2000-dotcom-peak/">warned</a> of the potential for an AI bubble that might rival the 2000s dotcom crash.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/from-prophet-to-product-how-ai-came-back-down-to-earth-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Freedom of speech is a foundational principle of healthy democracies and hence a primary target for aspiring authoritarians, who typically try to squash dissent. There is a point where the threat from authorities is sufficiently severe that a population will self-censor rather than risk punishment. Social media has complicated matters, blurring traditional boundaries between public and private speech, while new technologies such as facial recognition and moderation algorithms give authoritarians powerful new tools.</p>
<p>Researchers explored the nuanced dynamics of how people balance their desire to speak out vs their fear of punishment in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508028122">a paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>The authors had previously worked together on a model of political polarization, a project that wrapped up right around the time the social media space was experiencing significant changes in the ways different platforms were handling moderation. Some adopted a decidedly hands-off approach with little to no moderation. Weibo, on the other hand, began releasing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/tech/weibo-user-location-bad-behavior#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWeibo%20has%20always%20been%20committed,of%20the%20user's%20IP%20address.&amp;text=Last%20month%2C%20Weibo%20said%20it,Russia%20over%20the%20ongoing%20war.">the IP addresses</a> of people who posted objectionable commentary, essentially making them targets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/the-science-of-how-and-when-we-decide-to-speak-out-or-self-censor/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/nih-agrees-to-evaluate-and-complete-review-on-stalled-scientific-grant-applications">announced</a> that it and other organizations representing medical researchers had <a href="https://www.aclu.org/documents/apha-v-nih-stipulation-agreement">reached a settlement</a> in their suit against the federal government over grant applications that had been rejected under a policy that has since been voided by the court. The agreement, which still has to be approved by the judge overseeing the case, would see the National Institutes of Health restart reviews of grants that had been blocked on ideological grounds. It doesn't guarantee those grants will ultimately be funded, but it does mean they will go through the standard peer review process.</p>
<p>The grants had previously been rejected without review because their content was ideologically opposed by the Trump administration. That policy has since been declared arbitrary and capricious, and thus in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
<h2>How'd we get here?</h2>
<p>Immediately after taking office, the Trump Administration identified a number of categories of research, some of them extremely vague, that it would not be supporting: climate change, DEI, pandemic preparedness, gender ideology, and more. Shortly thereafter, federal agencies started cancelling grants that they deemed to contain elements of these disfavored topics, and blocking consideration of grant applications for the same reasons. As a result, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/things-well-never-know-science-fair-highlights-us-canceled-research/">grants were cancelled</a> that funded everything from research into antiviral drugs to the incidence of prostate cancer in African Americans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/feds-researchers-settle-suit-over-grants-blocked-by-now-illegal-order/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Determining how "successful" Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) truly was depends on who you ask, but it's increasingly hard to claim that DOGE made any sizable dent in federal spending, which was its primary goal.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, Musk himself notably downplayed DOGE as only being "a little bit successful" on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz5Hjk40FD4">podcast</a>, marking one of the first times that Musk admitted DOGE didn't live up to its promise. Then, more recently, on Monday, Musk revived evidence-free claims he made while campaigning for Donald Trump, insisting that government fraud remained vast and unchecked, seemingly despite DOGE's efforts. On X, he estimated that "my lower bound guess for how much fraud there is nationally is [about 20 percent] of the Federal budget, which would mean $1.5 trillion per year. Probably much higher."</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/elon-musk-to-exit-government-upset-that-trump-bill-undermines-doges-work/">Musk loudly left DOGE</a> in May after clashing with Trump, complaining that a Trump budget bill threatened to undermine DOGE's work. These days, Musk does not appear confident that DOGE was worth the trouble of wading into government. Although he said on the December podcast that he considered DOGE to be his "best side quest" ever, the billionaire confirmed that if given the chance to go back in time, he probably would not have helmed the agency as a special government employee.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/doge-did-not-find-2t-in-fraud-but-that-doesnt-matter-musk-allies-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>MANVILLE, N.J.—Richard Onderko said he will never forget the terrifying Saturday morning back in 1971 when the water rose so swiftly at his childhood home here that he and his brother had to be rescued by boat as the torrential rain from the remnants of Hurricane Doria swept through the neighborhood.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time—or the last—that the town endured horrific downpours. In fact, the working-class town of 11,000, about 25 miles southwest of Newark, has long been known for getting swamped by tropical storms, nor’easters or even just a wicked rain. It was so bad, Onderko recalled, that the constant threat of flooding had strained his parents’ marriage, with his mom wanting to sell and his dad intent on staying.</p>
<p>Eventually, his parents moved to Florida, selling the two-story house on North Second Avenue in 1995. But the new homeowner didn’t do so well either when storms hit, and in 2015, the property was sold one final time: to a state-run program that buys and demolishes houses in flood zones and permanently restores the property to open space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/as-floods-become-more-severe-a-new-jersey-program-provides-a-model/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><em>Stranger Things</em> fans are hyped for the premiere of the hotly anticipated series finale on New Year's Eve: they'll either be glued to their TVs or heading out to watch it in a bona fide theater. Netflix has dropped one last trailer for the finale—not that it really needs to do anything more to boost anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for Vols. 1 and 2 below but no major Vol. 2 reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/stranger-things-s5-trailer-teases-vol-2/">previously reported</a>, in Vol. 1, we found Hawkins under military occupation and Vecna targeting a new group of young children in his human form under the pseudonym “Mr. Whatsit” (a nod to <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em>). He kidnapped Holly Wheeler and took her to the Upside Down, where she found an ally in Max, still in a coma, but with her consciousness hiding in one of Vecna’s old memories. Dustin was struggling to process his grief over losing Eddie Munson in S4, causing a rift with Steve. The rest of the gang was devoted to stockpiling supplies and helping Eleven and Hopper track down Vecna in the Upside Down. They found Kali/Eight, Eleven’s psychic “sister” instead, being held captive in a military laboratory.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/stranger-things-series-finale-trailer-is-here/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, a hacker named Lovely claimed to have breached a Condé Nast user database and released a list of more than <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/WIRED">2.3 million user records from our sister publication WIRED</a>. The released materials contain demographic information (name, email, address, phone, etc.) but no passwords.</p>
<p>The hacker also says that they will release an additional 40 million records for other Condé Nast properties, including our other sister publications <em>Vogue</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and more. Of critical note to our readers, <em>Ars Technica</em> was not affected as we run on our own bespoke tech stack.</p>
<p>The hacker said that they had urged Condé Nast to patch vulnerabilities to no avail. “Condé Nast does not care about the security of their users data,” the hacker wrote. “It took us an entire month to convince them to fix the vulnerabilities on their websites. We will leak more of their users’ data (40+ million) over the next few weeks. Enjoy!”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/conde-nast-user-database-reportedly-breached-ars-unaffected/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Lobsters are generally notable for their large claws, which can serve as a deterrent to any predators. But there's a whole family of spiny lobsters that lack these claws. They tend to ward off predators by forming large groups that collectively can present a lot of pointy bits towards anything attempting to eat them. In fact, studies found that the lobsters can sense the presence of other species-members using molecules emitted into the water, and use that to find peers to congregate with.</p>
<p>A new study, however, finds that this same signal may lure young lobsters to their doom, causing them to try to congregate with older lobsters that are too big to be eaten by nearby predators. The smaller lobsters thus fall victim to a phenomenon called an "ecological trap," which has rarely been seen to occur without human intervention.</p>
<h2>Lobsters vs. groupers</h2>
<p>The study was performed in the waters off Florida, where the seafloor is dotted by what are called "solution holes." These features are the product of lower sea levels such as those that occur during periods of expanded glaciers and ice caps. During these times, much of the area off Florida was above sea level, and water dissolved the limestone rocks unevenly. This created an irregular array of small shallow pits and crevices, many of which have been reshaped by sea life since the area was submerged again.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/looking-for-friends-lobsters-may-stumble-into-an-ecological-trap/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>There were a lot of horrifying things in the news this year—a lot. But some of it was horrifying in a <em>good way</em>.</p>
<p>Extraordinary medical cases—even the grisly and disturbing ones—offer a reprieve from the onslaught of current events and the stresses of our daily lives. With those remarkable reports, we can marvel at the workings, foibles, and resilience of the human body. They can remind us of the shared indignities from our existence in these mortal meatsacks. We can clear our minds of worry by learning about something we never even knew we should worry about—or by counting our blessings for avoiding so far. And sometimes, the reports are just grotesquely fascinating.</p>
<p>Every year, there's a new lineup of such curious clinical conditions. There are always some unfortunate souls to mark medical firsts or present ultra-rare cases. There is also an endless stream of humans making poor life choices—and arriving at an emergency department with the results. This year was no different.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/the-top-5-most-horrifying-and-fascinating-medical-cases-of-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>2025 has been a tumultuous year for the car world. After years of EV optimism, revanchists are pushing back against things like clean energy and fuel economy. Automakers have responded, postponing or canceling new electric vehicles in favor of gasoline-burning ones. It hasn't been all bad, though. Despite the changing winds, EV infrastructure continues to be built out and, anecdotally at least, feels far more reliable. We got to witness a pretty epic Formula 1 season right to the wire, in addition to some great sports car and Formula E racing. And we drove a whole bunch of cars, some of which stood out from the pack.</p>
<p>Here are the 10 best things we sat behind the wheel of in 2025.</p>
<h2>10th: Lotus Emira V6</h2>

<p>Let's be frank: The supposed resurgence of Lotus hasn't exactly gone to plan. When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/lotus-cars-is-saved-being-bought-by-chinas-geely/">Geely bought the British Automaker in 2017</a>, many of us hoped that the Chinese company would do for Lotus what it did for Volvo, only in Hethel instead of Gothenburg. Even before tariffs and other protectionist measures undermined the wisdom of building new Lotuses in China, the fact that most of these new cars were big, heavy EVs had already made them a hard sell. But a more traditional Lotus exists and is still built in Norfolk, England: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/lotus-still-knows-how-to-make-a-drivers-car-the-2025-emira-v6-driven/">the Lotus Emira</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/the-10-best-vehicles-ars-technica-drove-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Yakisugi, a Japanese technique of burning wood surfaces, creates a protective carbonized layer]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Yakisugi is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakisugi">a Japanese architectural technique</a>  for charring the surface of wood. It has become quite popular in bioarchitecture because the carbonized layer protects the wood from water, fire, insects, and fungi, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the wood. Yakisugi techniques were first codified in written form in the 17th and 18th centuries. But it seems Italian Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci wrote about the protective benefits of charring wood surfaces more than 100 years earlier, according to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397379290_Leonardo_da_Vinci_and_the_Science_of_Wood_The_Note_in_the_Madrid_Codex_II_as_a_Foreshadowing_of_Modern_Bioarchitecture">a paper</a> published in Zenodo, an open repository for EU funded research.</p>
<h2>Check the notes</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/leonardo-noted-link-between-gravity-and-acceleration-centuries-before-einstein/">previously reported</a>, Leonardo produced more than 13,000 pages in his notebooks (later gathered into codices), less than a third of which have survived. The notebooks contain all manner of inventions that foreshadow future technologies: flying machines, bicycles, cranes, missiles, machine guns, an “unsinkable” double-hulled ship, dredges for clearing harbors and canals, and floating footwear akin to snowshoes to enable a person to walk on water. Leonardo foresaw the possibility of constructing a telescope in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Atlanticus">Codex Atlanticus</a> </i>(1490)—he wrote of “making glasses to see the moon enlarged” a century before the instrument’s invention.</p>
<p>In 2003, Alessandro Vezzosi, director of Italy’s Museo Ideale, came across <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/leonardo-godfather-of-tupperware">some recipes</a> for mysterious mixtures while flipping through Leonardo’s notes. Vezzosi experimented with the recipes, resulting in a mixture that would harden into a material eerily akin to Bakelite, a synthetic plastic widely used in the early 1900s. So Leonardo may well have invented the first manmade plastic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/did-one-line-in-a-leonardo-codex-anticipate-yakisugi/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The nervous system does an astonishing job of tracking sensory information, and does so using signals that would drive many computer scientists insane: a noisy stream of activity spikes that may be transmitted to hundreds of additional neurons, where they are integrated with similar spike trains coming from still other neurons.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have used spiking circuitry to build an artificial robotic skin, adopting some of the principles of how signals from our sensory neurons are transmitted and integrated. While the system relies on a few decidedly not-neural features, it has the advantage that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/understanding-neuromorphic-computing-and-why-intels-excited-about-it/">we have chips</a> that can run neural networks using spiking signals, which would allow this system to integrate smoothly with some energy-efficient hardware to run <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/scientists-built-an-ai-co-pilot-for-prosthetic-bionic-hands/">AI-based control software</a>.</p>
<h2>Location via spikes</h2>
<p>The nervous system in our skin is remarkably complex. It has specialized sensors for different sensations: heat, cold, pressure, pain, and more. In most areas of the body, these feed into the spinal column, where some preliminary processing takes place, allowing reflex reactions to be triggered without even involving the brain. But signals do make their way along specialized neurons into the brain, allowing further processing and (potentially) conscious awareness.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/researchers-make-neuromorphic-artificial-skin-for-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>China drafted landmark rules to stop AI chatbots from emotionally manipulating users, including what could become the strictest policy worldwide intended to prevent AI-supported suicides, self-harm, and violence.</p>
<p>China's Cyberspace Administration <a href="https://www.cac.gov.cn/2025-12/27/c_1768571207311996.htm">proposed</a> the rules on Saturday. If finalized, they would apply to any AI products or services publicly available in China that use text, images, audio, video, or "other means" to simulate engaging human conversation. Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/29/china-ai-chatbot-rules-emotional-influence-suicide-gambling-zai-minimax-talkie-xingye-zhipu.html">told CNBC</a> that the "planned rules would mark the world’s first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics" at a time when companion bot usage is rising globally.</p>
<h2>Growing awareness of problems</h2>
<p>In 2025, researchers <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/new-research-sheds-light-on-ai-companions/">flagged</a> major harms of AI companions, including promotion of self-harm, violence, and terrorism. Beyond that, chatbots shared harmful misinformation, made unwanted sexual advances, encouraged substance abuse, and verbally abused users. Some psychiatrists are increasingly ready to link psychosis to chatbot use, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-chatbot-psychosis-link-1abf9d57">reporte</a>d this weekend, while the most popular chatbot in the world, ChatGPT, has triggered lawsuits over outputs linked to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">child suicide</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/">murder-suicide</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/china-drafts-worlds-strictest-rules-to-end-ai-encouraged-suicide-violence/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Earthquakes, volcanic eruption, eclipses, meteor showers, and many other natural phenomena have always been part of life on Earth. In ancient cultures that predated science, such events were often memorialized in myths and legends. There is a growing body of research that strives to connect those ancient stories with the real natural events that inspired them. Folklorist and historian <a href="https://hps.stanford.edu/people/adrienne-mayor">Adrienne Mayor</a> has put together a fascinating short compendium of such insights with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mythopedia-Brief-Compendium-Natural-History/dp/0691247862"><em>Mythopedia: A Brief Compendium of Natural History Lore,</em></a> from dry quicksand and rains of frogs to burning lakes, paleoburrows, and Scandinavian "endless winters."</p>
<p>Mayor's work has long straddled multiple disciplines, but one of her specialities is best described as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=2133384&amp;action=edit">geomythology</a>, a term coined in 1968 by Indiana University geologist Dorothy Vitaliano, who was interested in classical legends about Atlantis and other civilizations that were lost due to natural disasters. Her interest resulted in Vitaliano's 1973 book <i>Legends of the Earth: Their Geologic Origins</i>.</p>
<p>Mayor herself became interested in the field when she came across Greek and Roman descriptions of fossils, and that interest expanded over the years to incorporate other examples of "folk science" in cultures around the world. Her books include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poison-King-Legend-Mithradates-Deadliest-ebook/dp/B003V5WKPE"><em>The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates, Rome's Deadliest Enemy</em></a> (2009), as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Greek-Poison-Arrows-Scorpion-Bombs-ebook/dp/B09NCMCH4Z"><i>Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, &amp; the Scorpion Bombs</i></a> (2022), exploring the origins of biological and chemical warfare. Her 2018 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Robots-Machines-Ancient-Technology/dp/0691183511"><em>Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology</em></a>, explored ancient myths and folklore about creating automation, artificial life, and AI, connecting them to the robots and other ingenious mechanical devices actually designed and built during that era.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/a-quirky-guide-to-myths-and-lore-based-in-actual-science/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In September 2025, a Widerøe Airlines flight was trying to land in Vardø, Norway, which sits in the country’s far eastern arm, some 40 miles from the Russian coast. The cloud deck was low, and so was visibility. In such gray situations, pilots use GPS technology to help them land on a runway and not the side of a mountain.</p>
<p>But on this day, GPS systems weren’t working correctly, the airwaves jammed with signals that prevented airplanes from accessing navigation information. The Widerøe flight had taken off during one of Russia’s frequent wargames, in which the country’s military simulates conflict as a preparation exercise. This one involved an imaginary war with a country. It was nicknamed Zapad-2025—translating to “West-2025”—and was happening just across the fjord from Vardø. According to European officials, GPS interference was frequent in the runup to the exercise. Russian forces, they suspected, were using GPS-signal-smashing technology, a tactic used in non-pretend conflict, too. (Russia has denied some allegations of GPS interference in the past.)</p>
<p>Without that guidance from space, and with the cloudy weather, the Widerøe plane had to abort its landing and continue down the coast away from Russia, to Båtsfjord, a fishing village.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/gps-is-vulnerable-to-jamming-heres-how-we-might-fix-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you've been following our coverage for the last few years, you'll already know that 2025 is the year that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-10-support-ends-today-but-its-just-the-first-of-many-deaths/">Windows 10 died</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/how-to-get-another-free-year-of-updates-for-your-windows-10-pc/">Technically</a>.</p>
<p>"Died," because Microsoft's formal end-of-support date came and went on October 14, as the company had been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/microsoft-prepares-another-major-windows-update-for-windows-10/">saying for years</a>. "Technically," because it's trivial for home users to get another free year of security updates with a few minutes of effort, and schools and businesses can get an additional two years of updates on top of that, and because load-bearing system apps like Edge and Windows Defender will keep getting updates through at least 2028 regardless.</p>
<p>But 2025 was undoubtedly a tipping point for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/windows-10-to-be-the-last-version-of-windows-until-the-next-version/">so-called</a> "last version of Windows." StatCounter data says Windows 11 has overtaken Windows 10 as the most-used version of Windows both in the US (February 2025) and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide">worldwide</a> (July 2025). Its market share slid from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250219180130/https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">just over 44 percent</a> to just under 31 percent in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>.

                            <![CDATA[<p>SIM cards, the small slips of plastic that have held your mobile subscriber information since time immemorial, are on the verge of extinction. In an effort to save space for other components, device makers are finally dropping the SIM slot, and Google is the latest to move to embedded SIMs with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-pixel-10-series-review-dont-call-it-an-android/">Pixel 10 series</a>. After long avoiding eSIM, I had no choice but to take the plunge when the time came to review Google's new phones. And boy, do I regret it.</p>
<h2>The journey to eSIM</h2>
<p>SIM cards have existed in some form since the '90s. Back then, they were credit card-sized chunks of plastic that occupied a lot of space inside the clunky phones of the era. They <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/isim-vs-esim-vs-sim-the-constantly-shrinking-ways-carriers-id-your-phone/">slimmed down over time</a>, going through the miniSIM, microSIM, and finally nanoSIM eras. A modern nanoSIM is about the size of your pinky nail, but space is at a premium inside smartphones. Enter, eSIM.</p>
<p>The eSIM standard was introduced in 2016, slowly gaining support as a secondary option in smartphones. Rather than holding your phone number on a removable card, an eSIM is a programmable, non-removable component soldered to the circuit board. This allows you to store multiple SIMs and swap between them in software, and no one can swipe your SIM card from the phone. They also take up half as much space compared to a removable card, which is why OEMs have begun dropping the physical slot.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/">Read full article</a></p>
