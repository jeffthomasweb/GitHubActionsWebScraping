      <p><em>Ars Technica AI Reporter and tech historian Benj Edwards has co-written a book on the Virtual Boy with Dr. Jose Zagal. In this exclusive excerpt, Benj and Jose take you back to Nintendo of the early '90s, where a unique 3D display technology captured the imagination of legendary designer Gunpei Yokoi and set the stage for a daring, if ultimately ill-fated, foray into the world of stereoscopic gaming.

<p>Nearly 30 years after the launch of the Virtual Boy, not much is publicly known about how, exactly, Nintendo came to be interested in developing what would ultimately become its ill-fated console. Was Nintendo committed to VR as a future for video games and looking for technological solutions that made business sense? Or was the Virtual Boy primarily the result of Nintendo going “off script” and seizing a unique, and possibly risky, opportunity that presented itself? The answer is probably a little bit of both.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the Virtual Boy was not an anomaly in Nintendo’s history with video game platforms. Rather, it was the result of a deliberate strategy that was consistent with Nintendo’s way of doing things and informed by its lead creator Gunpei Yokoi’s design philosophy.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017218#p3">Read 47 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017218&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday evening, OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322">announced</a> that he is leaving the company he co-founded, six months since he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/report-sutskever-led-board-coup-at-openai-that-ousted-altman-over-ai-safety-concerns/">participated in the coup</a> that temporarily ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. <span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Jan Leike</span>, a fellow member of Sutskever's <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/14/1085344/openai-super-alignment-rogue-agi-gpt-4/">Superalignment</a> team, is reportedly <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openais-chief-scientist-a-former-foe-of-ceo-altman-resigns-with-key-ally">resigning with him</a>.</p>

<p>"After almost a decade, I have made the decision to leave OpenAI," Sutskever <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322">tweeted</a>. "The company’s trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I’m confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial under the leadership of @sama, @gdb, @miramurati and now, under the excellent research leadership of @merettm. It was an honor and a privilege to have worked together, and I will miss everyone dearly."</p>
<p>Sutskever has been with the company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211006105333/https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/">since its founding</a> in 2015 and is widely seen as one of the key engineers behind some of OpenAI's biggest technical breakthroughs. As a former OpenAI board member, he played a key role in the removal of Sam Altman as CEO in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/11/openai-fires-ceo-sam-altman-citing-less-than-candid-communications/">shock firing</a> last November. While it later emerged that Altman's firing primarily stemmed from a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-conduct-did-not-mandate-removal-says-independent-review/">power struggle</a> with former board member Helen Toner, Sutskever sided with Toner and personally delivered the news to Altman that he was being fired on behalf of the board.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024533#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024533&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A large, long-term trial of the weight-loss medication Wegovy (semaglutide) found that people tended to lose weight over the first 65 weeks on the drug—about one year and three months—but then hit a plateau or "set point." But that early weight loss was generally maintained for up to four years while people continued taking the weekly injections.</p>
<p>The findings, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02996-7">published Monday in Nature Medicine</a>, come from a fresh analysis of data from the SELECT trial, which was designed to look at the drug's effects on cardiovascular health. The trial—a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trail—specifically enrolled people with existing cardiovascular disease who also had overweight or obesity, but did not have diabetes. In all, the trial included 17,604 people from 41 countries. Seventy-two percent of them were male, 84 percent were white, and the average age was about 62 years old.</p>
<p>Last year, researchers <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563">published the trial's primary results</a>, which showed that semaglutide reduced participants' risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular-related deaths <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/11/obesity-drug-wegovy-reduces-cardiovascular-risks-for-those-at-high-risk/">by 20 percent</a> over the span of a little over three years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024518#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024518&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YN2H_sKcmGw?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>House of the Dragon</em> returns to HBO Max for an action-packed second season next month. </p></div>
<p>The second season of <em>House of the Dragon</em> premieres in about a month and we've got one final action-packed trailer to boost anticipation. While the first season felt smaller and quieter—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-house-of-the-dragon-prequel-series-makes-a-solid-debut/">in a good way</a>, more focused on character relationships and political maneuvering—the show seems to be pulling out all the stops in S2 as all-out war breaks out in the legendary "Dance of Dragons."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tensions-rise-between-targaryens-in-first-teaser-for-house-of-the-dragon-s2/">previously reported</a>, the series is set nearly 200 years before the events of <em>Game of Thrones </em>and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen's reign. The primary source material is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-uri="1e4524e735173b30ff50f2f666a28acc"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a>, a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap">





<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCwmXY_f-e0?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Charlie Vicker's Sauron is front and center in the teaser for S2 of <em>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em>. </p></div>
<p>Amazon's Prime Video made a major investment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power"><em>The Rings of Power</em></a> when it acquired the rights to the source material from the Tolkien estate, even committing to multiple seasons upfront. The casting was strong and the visuals were quite spectacular (including the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/this-youtube-star-re-created-rings-of-power-title-sequence-in-chladni-figures/">opening credits</a>). But while the first season had its moments, personally I found it a bit plodding, often more concerned with establishing this rich fictional world and the characters within it than moving the story forward.</p>
<p>Showrunners J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/10-burning-questions-about-amazons-the-rings-of-power">have said</a> that this was deliberate. They wanted to avoid a "villain-centric" story in S1 but promised they would be delving more deeply into "the lore and the stories people have been waiting to hear." That would be the rise of Sauron (Charlie Vickers), the forging of the titular rings of power, and the last alliance between elves and men to defeat Sauron's evil machinations. Judging by the teaser that dropped today, we'll be getting lots more action in S2, with the shape-shifting Sauron now handily disguised as an elf. Bonus: There's an accompanying behind-the-scenes preview of the second season.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>After backlash over Google's search engine becoming the primary traffic source for deepfake porn websites, Google has started burying these links in search results, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-14/google-moves-deepfake-porn-sites-lower-in-its-search-rankings">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Google has been driving millions to controversial sites distributing AI-generated pornography depicting real people in fake sex videos that were created without their consent, Similarweb found. While anyone can be targeted—police already are bogged down with dealing with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/surge-of-fake-ai-child-sex-images-thwarts-investigations-into-real-child-abuse/">flood of fake AI child sex images</a>—female celebrities are the most common victims. And their fake non-consensual intimate imagery is more easily discoverable on Google by searching just about any famous name with the keyword "deepfake," Bloomberg noted.</p>
<p>Google refers to this content as "involuntary fake" or "synthetic pornography." The search engine provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9116649?hl=en">path</a> for victims to report that content whenever it appears in search results. And when processing these requests, Google also removes duplicates of any flagged deepfakes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024472#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024472&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Starting in June of last year, global temperatures went from very hot to extreme. Every single month since June, the globe has experienced the hottest temperatures for that month on record—that's 11 months in a row now, enough to ensure that 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 will likely be similarly extreme.</p>
<p>There's been nothing like this in the temperature record, and it acts as an unmistakable indication of human-driven warming. But how unusual is that warming compared to what nature has thrown at us in the past? While it's not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to that question, three European researchers (Jan Esper, Max Torbenson, and Ulf Büntgen) have provided a partial answer: the Northern Hemisphere hasn't seen anything like this in over 2,000 years.</p>
<h2>Tracking past temperatures</h2>
<p>Current temperature records are based on a global network of data-gathering hardware. But, as you move back in time, gaps in that network go from rare to ever more common. Moving backward from 1900, the network shrinks to just a few dozen land-based thermometers, almost all of them in Europe.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024443#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024443&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google's "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/fearing-chatgpt-google-enlists-founders-brin-and-page-in-ai-fight/">code red</a>" demands that AI be part of every single Google product and that includes Android. At Google I/O, the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/#gemini-on-android">announced</a> a "multi-year journey to reimagine Android with AI at the core" but only demoed a few minor AI enhancements.</p>
<p>Gemini can soon be brought up via the power button as an overlay panel, where it will have access to whatever's on your screen. The demo involved opening a PDF in Android's PDF reader, summarizing it, and answering questions based on the content. You can do something similar with a YouTube video. The demo also showed generating images based on a text prompt and then sending those images in a text message. Another demo involved Gemini understanding a chat log and suggesting future actions.</p>
<p>Talkback, Android's system for low-vision users, will soon be able to use AI to describe images that lack descriptive text.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024371#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024371&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Boeing is taking a few extra days to resolve a small helium leak on the Starliner spacecraft slated to ferry two NASA astronauts on a test flight to the International Space Station, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>This means the first crew launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/the-surprise-is-not-that-boeing-lost-commercial-crew-but-that-it-finished-at-all/">running years behind schedule</a> and more than $1.4 billion over budget, won't happen before next Tuesday, May 21, at 4:43 pm EDT (20:43 UTC). Meeting this schedule assumes engineers can get comfortable with the helium leak. Officials from Boeing and NASA, which manages Boeing's multibillion-dollar Starliner commercial crew contract, previously targeted Friday, May 17, for the spacecraft's first launch with astronauts onboard.</p>
<p>Boeing's ground team traced the leak to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster on the spacecraft's service module.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024298#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024298&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US government has provided more detail on how a former AT&amp;T executive allegedly bribed a powerful state lawmaker's ally in order to obtain legislation favorable to AT&amp;T's business.</p>
<p>Former AT&amp;T Illinois President Paul La Schiazza is set to go on trial in September 2024 after being <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/former-president-att-illinois-charged-conspiracy-unlawfully-influence-former-illinois-0">indicted on charges</a> of conspiracy to unlawfully influence then-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. AT&amp;T itself <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/att-to-pay-23m-fine-for-bribing-powerful-lawmakers-ally-in-exchange-for-vote/">agreed to pay a $23 million fine</a> in October 2022 in connection with the alleged illegal influence campaign and said it was "committed to ensuring that this never happens again."</p>
<p>US government prosecutors offered a preview of their case against La Schiazza in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.422427/gov.uscourts.ilnd.422427.36.0.pdf">filing</a> on Friday in US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. A contract lobbyist hired by AT&amp;T "is expected to testify that AT&amp;T successfully passed two major pieces of legislation after the company started making payments to Individual FR-1."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024366#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024366&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Just one day after OpenAI revealed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">GPT-4o</a>, which it bills as being able to understand what's taking place in a video feed and converse about it, Google announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI">Project Astra</a>, a research prototype that features similar video comprehension capabilities. It was announced by Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis on Tuesday at the Google I/O conference keynote in Mountain View, California.</p>

<p>Hassabis called Astra "a universal agent helpful in everyday life." During a demonstration, the research model showcased its capabilities by identifying sound-producing objects, providing creative alliterations, explaining code on a monitor, and locating misplaced items. The AI assistant also exhibited its potential in wearable devices, such as smart glasses, where it could analyze diagrams, suggest improvements, and generate witty responses to visual prompts.</p>
<p>Google says that Astra uses the camera and microphone on a user's device to provide assistance in everyday life. By continuously processing and encoding video frames and speech input, Astra creates a timeline of events and caches the information for quick recall. The company says that this enables the AI to identify objects, answer questions, and remember things it has seen that are no longer in the camera's frame.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024268#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024268&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Search is still important to Google, but soon it will change. At its all-in-one AI Google I/O event Tuesday, the company introduced <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">a host of AI-enabled features coming to Google Search</a> at various points in the near future, which will "do more for you than you ever imagined."</p>
<p>"Google will do the Googling for you," said Liz Reid, Google's head of Search.</p>
<p>It's not AI in every search, but it will seemingly be hard to avoid a lot of offers to help you find, plan, and brainstorm things. "AI Overviews," the successor to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-search-will-start-automatically-showing-a-chatbot-to-some-users/">Search Generative Experience</a>, will provide summary answers to questions, along with links to sources. You can also soon submit a video as a search query, perhaps to identify objects or provide your own prompts by voice.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024337#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024337&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            AI in Gmail summarizes recent emails.                           [credit:

      </ul>

<p>Google's Gemini AI often just feels like a chatbot built into a text-input field, but you can really start to do special things when you give it access to a ton of data. Gemini in Gmail will soon be able to search through your entire backlog of emails and show a summary in a sidebar.</p>
<p>That's simple to describe but solves a huge problem with email: even searching brings up a list of email subjects, and you have to click-through to each one just to read it. Having an AI sift through a bunch of emails and provide a summary sounds like a huge time saver and something you can't do with any other interface.</p>
<p>Google's one-minute demo of this feature showed a big blue Gemini button at the top right of the Gmail web app. Tapping it opens the normal chatbot sidebar you can type in. Asking for a summary of emails from a certain contact will get you a bullet-point list of what has been happening, with a list of "sources" at the bottom that will jump you right to a certain email. In the last second of the demo, the user types, "Reply saying I want to volunteer for the parent's group event," hits "enter," and then the chatbot instantly sends an email. We thought it was interesting that the demo never showed a confirmation step, but a Google rep contacted us later to say the production version would show you the message before sending it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024267#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024267&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sauron, Base Master of Treachery, will keep his Eye on you from atop the tower, which will actually glow thanks to a built-in light brick. The tower includes a minifig of Sauron himself, plus the <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Mouth_of_Sauron">Mouth of Sauron</a>, Gollum, and a handful of Orcs.</p>
<p>The Lego Barad-dûr set <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2024/may/the-new-lego-lego-icons-lord-of-the-rings-barad-d-r-set">will launch</a> on June 1 for Lego Insiders and June 4 for everybody else. If you buy it between June 1 and June 7, you'll also get the "Fell Beast" bonus set, with pose-able wings and a Nazgûl minifig. It doesn't seem as though this bonus set will be sold separately, making it much harder to buy the nine Nazgûl you would need to make your collection story-accurate.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024228#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024228&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crashing into parked cars, drifting over into oncoming traffic, intruding into construction zones—all this "unexpected behavior" from Waymo's self-driving vehicles may be violating traffic laws, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2024/INOA-PE24016-12382.pdf">said</a> Monday.</p>
<p>To better understand Waymo's potential safety risks, NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is now looking into 22 incident reports involving cars equipped with Waymo’s fifth-generation automated driving system. Seventeen incidents involved collisions, but none involved injuries.</p>
<p>Some of the reports came directly from Waymo, while others "were identified based on publicly available reports," NHTSA said. The reports document single-party crashes into "stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains" as well as instances in which Waymo cars "appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024231#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024231&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A study analyzing Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX suggests that return to office (RTO) mandates can lead to a higher rate of employees, especially senior-level ones, leaving the company, often to work at competitors.</p>
<p>The study (<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RTO.pdf">PDF</a>), published this month by University of Chicago and University of Michigan researchers and reported by<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/12/rto-microsoft-apple-spacex/"> The Washington Post</a> on Sunday, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this paper, we provide causal evidence that RTO mandates at three large tech companies—Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple—had a negative effect on the tenure and seniority of their respective workforce. In particular, we find the strongest negative effects at the top of the respective distributions, implying a more pronounced exodus of relatively senior personnel.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study looked at résumé data from People Data Labs and used "260 million résumés matched to company data." It only examined three companies, but the report's authors noted that Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX represent 30 percent of the tech industry's revenue and over 2 percent of the technology industry's workforce. The three companies have also been influential in setting RTO standards beyond their own companies. Robert Ployhart, a professor of business administration and management at the University of South Carolina and scholar at the<a href="https://aom.org/"> Academy of Management</a>, told the Post that despite the study being limited to three companies, its conclusions are a broader reflection of the effects of RTO policies in the US.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024094#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024094&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Billy Restey is a digital artist who runs a studio in Seattle. But after hours, he hunts for rare chunks of bitcoin. He does it for the thrill. “It’s like collecting <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> or <i>Pokémon</i> cards,” says Restey. “It’s that excitement of, like, what if I catch something rare?”</p>
<p>In the same way a dollar is made up of 100 cents, one bitcoin is composed of 100 million satoshis—or sats, for short. But not all sats are made equal. Those produced in the year bitcoin was created are considered vintage, like a fine wine. Other coveted sats were part of transactions made by bitcoin’s inventor. Some correspond with a particular transaction milestone. These and <a href="https://magisat.io/categories">various other properties</a> make some sats more scarce than others—and therefore more valuable. The very rarest can sell for tens of millions of times their face value; in April, a single sat, normally worth $0.0006, <a href="https://decrypt.co/228084/bitcoin-epic-sat-halving-sells-over-2-1-million">sold for $2.1 million</a>.</p>

<p>To drink raw milk at any time is to flirt with dangerous germs. But, amid an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in US dairy cows, the risks have ratcheted up considerably. Health experts have stepped up warnings against drinking raw milk during the outbreak, the scope of which is still unknown.</p>
<p>Yet, raw milk enthusiasts are undaunted by the heightened risk. The California-based Raw Milk Institute called the warnings "<a href="https://www.rawmilkinstitute.org/updates/avian-flu-and-raw-milk-a-common-sense-approach">clearly fearmongering</a>." The institute's founder, Mark McAfee, told the Los Angeles Times this weekend that his customers are, in fact, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-05-12/raw-milk-enthusiasts-uncowed-by-bird-flu-risk-in-dairy">specifically requesting raw milk from H5N1-infected cows</a>. According to McAfee, his customers believe, without evidence, that directly drinking high levels of the avian influenza virus will give them immunity to the deadly pathogen.</p>
<p>Expert Michael Payne told the LA Times that the idea amounts to "playing Russian roulette with your health." Payne, a researcher and dairy outreach coordinator at the Western Institute for Food Safety and Security at UC Davis, added, "Deliberately trying to infect yourself with a known pathogen flies in the face of all medical knowledge and common sense."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024168#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024168&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been nearly four years since the US Air Force made its selections for companies to launch military payloads during the mid-2020s. The military chose United Launch Alliance, and its Vulcan rocket, to launch 60 percent of these missions; and it chose SpaceX, with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, to launch 40 percent.</p>
<p>Although the large Vulcan rocket was still in development at the time, it was expected to take flight within the next year or so. Upon making the award, an Air Force official said the military believed Vulcan would soon be ready to take flight. United Launch Alliance was developing the Vulcan rocket in order to no longer be reliant on RD-180 engines that are built in Russia and used by its Atlas V rocket.</p>
<p>"I am very confident with the selection that we have made today," William Roper, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology, and logistics, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/the-air-force-selects-ula-and-spacex-for-mid-2020s-launches/">said at the time</a>. "We have a very low-risk path to get off the RD-180 engines."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024049#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024049&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>At this point, anyone with even a passing interest in AI is very familiar with the process of typing out messages to a chatbot and getting back long streams of text in response. Today's announcement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">ChatGPT-4o</a>—which lets users converse with a chatbot using real-time audio and video—might seem like a mere lateral evolution of that basic interaction model.</p>
<p>After looking through <a href="https://vimeo.com/openai">over a dozen video demos</a> OpenAI posted alongside today's announcement, though, I think we're on the verge of something more like a sea change in how we think of and work with large language models. While we don't yet have access to ChatGPT-4o's audio-visual features ourselves, the important non-verbal cues on display here—both from GPT-4o and from the users—make the chatbot instantly feel much more human. And I'm not sure the average user is fully ready for how they might feel about that.</p>
<h2>It thinks it’s people</h2>
<p>Take <a href="https://vimeo.com/945587876">this video</a>, where a newly expectant father looks to ChatGPT-4o for an opinion on a dad joke ("What do you call a giant pile of kittens? A meow-ntain!"). The old ChatGPT4 could easily type out the same responses of "Congrats on the upcoming addition to your family!" and "That's perfectly hilarious. Definitely a top-tier dad joke." But there's much more impact to <em>hearing</em> GPT-4o give that same information in the video, complete with the gentle laughter and rising and falling vocal intonations of a lifelong friend.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024129#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024129&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
