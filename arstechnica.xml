                        <![CDATA[GameHub's existing Windows emulator on Android has its fair share of issues.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>For a while now, Mac owners have been able to use tools like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/directx-12-support-comes-to-crossover-on-mac-with-latest-update/">CrossOver</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Game Porting Toolkit</a> to get many Windows games running on their operating system of choice. Now, GameSir plans to add its own potential solution to the mix, announcing that a version of its existing Windows emulation tool for Android will be coming to macOS.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-based GameSir has primarily made a name for itself as a manufacturer of gaming peripherals—the company's <a href="https://x.com/mygamesir/">social media profile</a> includes a self-description as "the Anti-Stick Drift Experts." Early last year, though, GameSir rolled out <a href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/">the Android GameHub app</a>, which includes a GameFusion emulator that the company claims "provides complete support for Windows games to run on Android through high-precision compatibility design."</p>
<p>In practice, GameHub and GameFusion for Android haven't quite lived up to that promise. Testers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retroid/comments/1poztuy/gamehub_lite_compatibility_chart_for_rp5_50_games/">on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.emuready.com/listings?deviceIds=%5B%22767ae07b-86c4-441d-8a72-fe8a5e625502%22%2C%226313f4b5-5a26-40c3-b223-2d2ddaa8386b%22%5D&amp;page=1&amp;emulatorIds=%5B%2209203574-33b7-4f56-85b1-851b51e0ab2a%22%2C%22062c86d7-d1a8-4e73-bb15-0f76f0e64610%22%5D">sites like EmuReady</a> report hit-or-miss compatibility for popular Steam titles on various Android-based handhelds. At least one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1pdjmzc/comment/ns5rmoi/">suggests</a> that "any Unity, Godot, or Game Maker game tends to just work" through the app, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1nlg5j6/gamehub_really_has_terrible_compatibility/">another reports "terrible compatibility"</a> across a wide range of games.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/gamehub-will-give-mac-owners-another-imperfect-way-to-play-windows-games/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Contrary to what password managers say, a server compromise can mean game over.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the past 15 years, password managers have grown from a niche security tool used by the technology savvy into an indispensable security tool for the masses, with an <a href="https://www.security.org/digital-safety/password-manager-annual-report/">estimated</a> 94 million US adults—or roughly 36 percent of them—having adopted them. They store not only passwords for pension, financial, and email accounts, but also cryptocurrency credentials, payment card numbers, and other sensitive data.</p>
<p>All eight of the top password managers have adopted the term “zero knowledge” to describe the complex encryption system they use to protect the data vaults that users store on their servers. The definitions vary slightly from vendor to vendor, but they generally boil down to one bold assurance: that there is no way for malicious insiders or hackers who manage to compromise the cloud infrastructure to steal vaults or data stored in them. These promises make sense, given <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/lastpass-says-hackers-have-obtained-vault-data-and-a-wealth-of-customer-info/">previous</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/lastpass-hackers-infected-employees-home-computer-and-stole-corporate-vault/">breaches</a> of LastPass and the reasonable expectation that state-level hackers have both the motive and capability to obtain password vaults belonging to high-value targets.</p>
<h2>A bold assurance debunked</h2>
<p>Typical of these claims are those made by Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, which together are used by roughly 60 million people. Bitwarden, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/pdf/resources-zero-knowledge-encryption-white-paper.pdf">for example</a>, says that “not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data (even if we wanted to).” Dashlane, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/download/whitepaper-en.pdf">says</a> that without a user’s master password, “malicious actors can’t steal the information, even if Dashlane’s servers are compromised.” LastPass <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/how-zero-knowledge-keeps-passwords-safe">says</a> that no one can access the “data stored in your LastPass vault, except you (not even LastPass).”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/password-managers-promise-that-they-cant-see-your-vaults-isnt-always-true/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Talk show host Stephen Colbert said CBS forbade him from interviewing Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico because of a Federal Communications Commission threat to enforce the equal-time rule on late-night and daytime talk shows.</p>
<p>Talarico "was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast," Colbert <a href="https://youtu.be/oh7DPSP65JA?t=95">said on last night's episode</a> of <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>. "Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on, and because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this."</p>
<p>Colbert went on to describe some of the background Ars readers are already familiar with. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/trump-fcc-tries-to-get-more-republicans-on-late-night-and-daytime-talk-shows/">issued a warning</a> to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the <em>bona fide</em> news exemption to the equal-time rule, and subsequently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">opened an investigation</a> into ABC’s <em>The View</em> after an interview with Talarico.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/stephen-colbert-says-cbs-forbid-interview-of-democrat-because-of-fcc-threat/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>More than two years after Broadcom took over VMware, the virtualization company’s customers are still grappling with higher prices, uncertainty, and the challenges of reducing vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>Today, CloudBolt Software released a report, "<a href="https://www.cloudbolt.io/cii-report-the-mass-exodus-that-never-was/">The Mass Exodus That Never Was: The Squeeze Is Just Beginning,</a>" that provides insight into those struggles. CloudBolt is a hybrid cloud management platform provider that aims to identify VMware customers’ pain points so it can <a href="https://www.cloudbolt.io/cloud-provider/vmware/">sell them</a> relevant solutions. In the report, CloudBolt said it surveyed 302 IT decision-makers (director-level or higher) at North American companies with at least 1,000 employees in January. The survey is far from comprehensive, but it offers a look at the obstacles these users face.</p>
<p>Broadcom closed its VMware acquisition in November 2023, and last month, 88 percent of survey respondents still described the change as “disruptive.” Per the survey, the most cited drivers of disruption were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/broadcoms-prohibitive-vmware-prices-create-a-learning-barrier-it-pro-says/">price increases</a> (named by 89 percent of respondents), followed by uncertainty about Broadcom’s plans (85 percent), support quality concerns (78 percent), Broadcom shifting VMware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/some-vmware-perpetual-license-owners-are-unable-to-download-security-patches/">from perpetual licenses to subscriptions</a> (72 percent), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/more-vmware-cloud-partners-axed-as-broadcom-launches-new-invite-only-program/">changes to VMware’s partner program</a> (68 percent), and the forced bundling of products (65 percent).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/most-vmware-users-still-actively-reducing-their-vmware-footprint-survey-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Imagine turning the key or pressing the start button of your car—and nothing happens. Not because the battery is dead or the engine is broken but because a server no longer answers. For a growing number of cars, that scenario isn’t hypothetical.</p>
<p>As vehicles become platforms for software and subscriptions, their longevity is increasingly tied to the survival of the companies behind their code. When those companies fail, the consequences ripple far beyond a bad app update and into the basic question of whether a car still functions as a car.</p>
<p>Over the years, automotive software has expanded from performing rudimentary engine management and onboard diagnostics to powering today’s interconnected, software-defined vehicles. Smartphone apps can now handle tasks like unlocking doors, flashing headlights, and preconditioning cabins—and some models won’t unlock at all unless a phone running the manufacturer’s app is within range.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/what-happens-to-a-car-when-the-company-behind-its-software-goes-under/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ram-shortage-delays-valves-steam-machine-desktop-and-steam-frame-headset/">announced</a> it was delaying the release of its new Steam Machine desktop and Steam Frame VR headset due to memory and storage shortages that have been cascading across the PC industry since late 2025. But those shortages are also coming for products that have already launched.</p>
<p>Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">noting</a> that the device would be "out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages." None of Valve's three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished">certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations</a> that Valve sometimes offers.</p>
<p>Valve hasn't announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck's de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344310/valve-discontinues-steam-deck-lcd-oled-versions-remain#g344310-2">announced in December</a> that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn't be restocked once it sold out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/valves-steam-deck-intermittently-out-of-stock-as-ram-shortage-drags-on/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Officially, Warner Bros. is still committed to Netflix. The company today scheduled a special meeting date of March 20 and recommended that shareholders vote for the Netflix merger. But Warner Bros. is simultaneously opening negotiations with Paramount despite calling all of its previous offers deficient.</p>
<p>"Netflix has provided WBD a limited waiver under the terms of WBD’s merger agreement with Netflix, permitting WBD to engage in discussions with Paramount Skydance for a seven-day period ending on February 23, 2026 to seek clarity for WBD stockholders and provide PSKY the ability to make its best and final offer," Warner Bros. <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001437107/649b516f-3377-4625-b31f-1263ec96869c.pdf">said today</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/warner-bros-gives-paramount-one-more-week-to-beat-netflix-merger-offer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>No one will supplant American and Chinese dominance in the space launch arena anytime soon, but several longtime US allies now see sovereign access to space as a national security imperative.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of private launch initiatives already underway within their own borders, several middle and regional powers have approved substantial government funding for commercial startups to help them reach the launch pad. Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are among the nations that currently lack the ability to independently put their own satellites into orbit but which are now spending money to establish a domestic launch industry. Others talk a big game but haven't committed the cash to back up their ambitions.</p>
<p>The moves are part of a wider trend among US allies to increase defense spending amid strained relations with the Trump administration. Tariffs, trade wars, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/15/us/politics/munich-democrats-cortez-greenland-trump.html">threats to invade the territory of a NATO ally</a> have changed the tune of many foreign leaders. In Europe, there's even talk of <a href="http://politico.eu/article/european-nuclear-deterrence-gathers-steam-munich-security-conference/">fielding a nuclear deterrent</a> independent of the nuclear umbrella provided by the US military.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/which-countries-are-actually-serious-about-developing-their-own-rockets/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>At long last, we have the official full trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_and_Grogu"><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em></a>, a feature film spinoff from Disney's megahit Star Wars series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/reunited-din-djarin-and-grogu-face-new-battles-in-the-mandalorian-s3-trailer/"><em>The</em> <em>Mandalorian</em></a>.</p>
<p>Grogu (fka "Baby Yoda") <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/our-fave-star-wars-duo-is-back-in-mandalorian-and-grogu-teaser/">won viewers’ hearts</a> from the moment he first appeared onscreen in the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, and the relationship between the little green creature and his father-figure bounty hunter, the titular Mandalorian, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), has only gotten stronger. With the 2023 Hollywood strikes delaying production on season 4 of the series, director Jon Favreau got the green light to make this spinoff film.</p>

The company seems serious about the idea, having created <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/ford-rethinks-ev-strategy-is-working-on-a-smaller-cheaper-ev-platform/">an internal "skunkworks"</a> several years ago to design this new affordable platform from first principles.</p>
<p>Doing more with less is the key: fewer components and using less energy to go the same distance. Now, the company has given us a clearer picture of how it plans to make that happen.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Ford and its crosstown rival bet that full-size pickup truck customers would be wowed enough by instant torque and minuscule running costs to overlook how towing heavily diminished range. They created electric versions of their bestselling behemoths, packed with clever features like power sockets for job sites and the ability to power a home during an emergency.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/ford-is-focusing-on-efficiency-to-make-its-2027-30000-ev-pickup-affordable/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, said late on Monday that it had opened a probe into the creation and publication of “potentially harmful” sexualised images by Grok that contained or involved the processing of EU user data.</p>
<p>The Grok chatbot is integrated into X’s social media feeds and developed by Musk’s AI startup xAI, which last year acquired X. Earlier this month, xAI merged with Musk’s rocket maker SpaceX to create a $1.5 trillion behemoth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/eu-launches-probe-into-xai-over-sexualized-images/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a recent study, University of Alaska Fairbanks paleontologist Matthew Wooller and his colleagues radiocarbon-dated what they thought were pieces of two mammoth vertebrae, only to get a whale of a surprise and a whole new mystery.</p>
<p>At first glance, it looked like Wooller and his colleagues might have found evidence that mammoths lived in central Alaska just 2,000 years ago. But ancient DNA revealed that two “mammoth” bones actually belonged to a North Pacific right whale and a minke whale—which raised a whole new set of questions. The team’s hunt for Alaska’s last mammoth had turned into an epic case of mistaken identity, starring two whale species and a mid-century fossil hunter.</p>
<h2>“<b>The first signs that something was amiss”</b></h2>
<p>The aptly named Wooller and his team have radiocarbon-dated more than 300 mammoth fossils over the last four years, looking for the last survivors of the wave of extinctions that wiped out woolly mammoths and other Pleistocene megafauna at the end of the last Ice Age. Two specimens stood out immediately. Based on the radiocarbon dates, two mammoths had lived near Fairbanks as recently as 2,800 and 1,900 years ago. Wooller and his colleagues had been looking for the youngest woolly mammoth specimen in Alaska but were completely mystified.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/scientists-hunting-mammoth-fossils-found-whales-400-km-inland/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth"><em>Toyota provided flights from Columbus, Ohio to Santa Barbara, California and accommodation so Ars could drive the Woodland bZ. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</em></aside>
<p>When you think about what makes a perfect single-car garage—occupied solely by a vehicle that can do it all—you probably think of some crossover or SUV like the Toyota RAV4 or BMW X5. Something that can handle the snow and weekend camping trips with a decent-sized cargo capacity. If you're European, you might gravitate toward a wagon like any of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/more-bounce-to-the-ounce-the-2025-volvo-v60-cross-country-review/">Volvo Cross Country</a> models or an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/11/2017-audi-a4-allroad-put-to-use-in-the-real-world/">Allroad from Audi</a>. For a long time, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/typical-subaru-and-thats-good-the-2020-outback-reviewed/">Subaru offered a near-perfect solution in the Outback,</a> but the new one is much more SUV than wagon.</p>
<p>That left an opening for Toyota to swoop in, and the bZ Woodland is not only the best take on the Subaru Outback I've driven, but the nearly perfect single-car solution for the electric age.</p>
<h2>What makes it a Woodland?</h2>
<p>The bZ Woodland is a lifted wagon electric vehicle that is 6 inches longer than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/toyota-and-lexus-tweak-their-evs-for-eu-and-likely-the-us/">the non-Woodland bZ</a> and has 33.8 cubic feet (957 L) of rear cargo space. That, on paper, is 6.1 more cubes (173 L) of storage with the second row in place but in practice feels even more spacious. The Woodland also has 8.3 inches (211 mm) of ground clearance, which is up one-tenth (2.5 mm) over the normal bZ. But like the cargo space, how the bZ Woodland uses those extra numbers is what makes it feel so different.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/looks-a-lot-like-an-electric-station-wagon-the-2026-toyota-bz-woodland/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a study published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2844659">JAMA Internal Medicine</a> this week, 99 percent of adults over 40 were found to have at least one abnormality in a rotator cuff on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/rotatorcuffinjuries.html">rotator cuff</a> is the group of muscles and tendons in a shoulder joint that keeps the upper arm bone securely in the shoulder socket—and is often blamed for pain and other symptoms. The trouble is, the vast majority of people in the study had no shoulder problems.</p>
<p>The finding calls into question the growing use of MRIs to try to diagnose shoulder pain—and, in turn, the growing problem of overtreatment of rotator cuff (RC) abnormalities, which includes partial- and full-thickness tears as well as signs of tendinopathy (tendon swelling and thickening).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/99-of-adults-over-40-have-shoulder-abnormalities-on-an-mri-study-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

Also in usual Apple fashion, it has not come out and said what it's going to be announcing. We have a pretty good idea, though.</p>
<p>The event will kick off at 9AM ET on March 4—Ars will be on the ground in New York City to cover Apple's latest unveiling, whatever form it may take. Apple doesn't release most products on a set schedule, but some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/report-imminent-apple-hardware-updates-include-macbook-pro-ipads-and-iphone-17e/">recent speculation</a> about likely hardware updates can point us in the right direction.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/report-imminent-apple-hardware-updates-include-macbook-pro-ipads-and-iphone-17e/">reported</a> recently, the iPhone 17e may be making an appearance in Apple's lineup soon. This updated version of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/iphone-16e-review-the-most-expensive-cheap-iphone-yet/">budget-oriented iPhone</a> will have an A19 chip inside, similar to the one powering the base model iPhone 17. It may also add MagSafe charging. Don't expect to see a multi-camera array like you'd get on the more expensive Apple phones, though. Pricing will be the most important thing to watch for should Apple announce this phone. Right now, the non-Pro iPhone 16 and 17 (including the 16e) are all clustered in the $600-800 range. Another $599 budget iPhone won't make waves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/get-ready-for-new-macs-and-ipads-apple-announces-special-experience-on-march-4/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Best Buy employee in Florida was charged with fraud after allegedly using his manager's code to heavily discount nearly 150 items that he and his accomplices purchased and pawned.</p>
<p>It seems that the manager first started growing suspicious about "strange sales numbers" in December 2024, an ABC News affiliate in West Palm Beach <a href="https://www.wpbf.com/article/best-buy-employee-charged-fraud-palm-beach-gardens/70311367">reported</a>. Private investigators traced the weird sales back to a 36-year-old employee, Matthew Lettera, who allegedly conducted 97 discounted purchases for himself and 52 additional transactions for others. Some MacBooks were discounted as much as 99 percent, a local CW affiliate <a href="https://cw34.com/news/local/palm-beach-gardens-best-buy-employee-accused-of-118k-discount-scheme-loss-electronics-pawned-laptops-police-crime-retail-scam-six-figure-insider-theft-manager-code-investigation-news">reported</a>. In total, Best Buy lost more than $118,000 from the scheme.</p>
<p>According to a LinkedIn profile that matches Lettera's information, he started working at Best Buy in January 2020 after pivoting from career training as a chef.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/best-buy-worker-used-managers-code-to-get-99-off-macbooks-cops-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>ByteDance says that it's rushing to add safeguards to block Seedance 2.0 from generating iconic characters and deepfaking celebrities, after substantial Hollywood backlash after launching the latest version of its AI video tool.</p>
<p>The changes come after Disney and Paramount Skydance sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance urging the Chinese company to promptly end the allegedly vast and blatant infringement.</p>
<p>Studios claimed the infringement was widescale and immediate, with Seedance 2.0 users across social media sharing AI videos featuring copyrighted characters like Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and SpongeBob Square Pants. In its letter, Disney fumed that Seedance was "hijacking" its characters, accusing ByteDance of treating Disney characters like they were "free public domain clip art," Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/disney-bytedance-seedance">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/bytedance-backpedals-after-seedance-2-0-turned-hollywood-icons-into-ai-clip-art/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Heating accounts for nearly half of the global energy demand, and two-thirds of that is met by burning fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar energy is a possible alternative, but while we have become reasonably good at storing solar electricity in lithium-ion batteries, we’re not nearly as good at storing heat.</p>
<p>To store heat for days, weeks, or months, you need to trap the energy in the bonds of a molecule that can later release heat on demand. The approach to this particular chemistry problem is called molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. While it has been the next big thing for decades, it never really took off.</p>
<p>In a recent <em>Science</em> paper, a team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and UCLA demonstrate a breakthrough that might finally make MOST energy storage effective.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/dna-inspired-molecule-breaks-records-for-storing-solar-heat/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Michigan is taking on major oil and gas companies in court, joining nearly a dozen other states that have brought climate-related lawsuits against ExxonMobil and its industry peers. But Michigan’s approach is different: accusing Big Oil not of deceiving consumers or misrepresenting climate change risks, but of driving up energy costs by colluding to suppress competition from cleaner and cheaper technologies like solar power and electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The strategy is risky and might run into challenges, but it could potentially be a game changer if the state can overcome initial dismissal attempts by the industry defendants, legal experts say.</p>
<p>Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed the lawsuit last month in federal District Court against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute.

<p>SAARISELKÄ, FINLAND—If you're expecting it, the feeling in the pit of your stomach when the rear of your car breaks traction and begins to slide is rather pleasant. It's the same exhilaration we get from roller coasters, but when you're in the driver's seat, you're in charge of the ride.</p>
<p>When you're not expecting it, though, there's anxiety instead of excitement and, should the slide end with a crunch, a lot more negative emotions, too.</p>
<p>Thankfully, fewer and fewer drivers will have to experience that kind of scare thanks to the proliferation and sophistication of modern electronic stability and traction control systems. For more than 30 years, these electronic safety nets have grown in capability and became mandatory in the early 2010s, saving countless crashes in the process.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/02/learning-the-limits-of-stability-control-on-a-frozen-lake-in-a-mclaren/">Read full article</a></p>
