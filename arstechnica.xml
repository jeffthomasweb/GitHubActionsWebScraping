                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>With federal research funding imperiled by brutal cuts under the Trump administration, biomedical graduate programs nationwide are making tough decisions that will scale back the next generation of scientists.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, news broke that UMass Chan Medical School—a public school in the University of Massachusetts system—has rescinded all offers of admission to biomedical graduate students for the 2025–2026 school year. That means an entire class of future scientists has been wiped out. Those who were initially accepted to the program can try to join again in a future cycle under a priority consideration that won't require them to reapply, according to a letter sent to a previously admitted student that was<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/klab.bsky.social/post/3lk7bch2osk2r"> shared on social media</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/umass-chan-rescinds-admission-for-biomedical-sciences-phd-program-amid-funding-cuts/3657096/">a statement provided to NBC10 Boston</a>, a spokesperson for the school confirmed that several dozen applicants had their acceptance offers rescinded. "With uncertainties related to the funding of biomedical research in this country, this difficult decision was made to ensure that our current students’ progress is not disrupted by the funding cuts and that we avoid matriculating students who may not have robust opportunities for dissertation research," the statement reads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/umass-disbands-its-entering-biomed-graduate-class-over-trump-funding-chaos/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/we-compared-eight-ai-search-engines-theyre-all-bad-at-citing-news.php">new study</a> from Columbia Journalism Review's Tow Center for Digital Journalism finds serious accuracy issues with generative AI models used for news searches. The research tested eight AI-driven search tools equipped with live search functionality and discovered that the AI models incorrectly answered more than 60 percent of queries about news content.</p>
<p>Researchers Klaudia Jaźwińska and Aisvarya Chandrasekar noted in their report that roughly 1 in 4 Americans now uses AI models as alternatives to traditional search engines. This raises serious concerns about reliability, given the substantial error rate uncovered in the study.</p>
<p>Error rates varied notably among the tested platforms. Perplexity provided incorrect information in 37 percent of the queries tested, whereas <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openai-launches-chatgpt-with-search-taking-google-head-on/">ChatGPT Search</a> incorrectly identified 67 percent (134 out of 200) of articles queried. Grok 3 demonstrated the highest error rate, at 94 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-search-engines-give-incorrect-answers-at-an-alarming-60-rate-study-says/">Read full article</a></p>

The software on board did a credible job of recognizing nearby craters, even with elongated shadows over the terrain. However, the lander's altimeter had failed.</p>
<p>So while <em>Athena</em> knew where it was relative to the surface of the Moon, the lander did not know how far it was above the surface.</p>
<p>An important detail, that. As a result, the privately built spacecraft struck the lunar surface on a plateau, toppled over, and began to skid across the surface. As it did so, the lander rotated at least once or twice before coming to a stop in a small, shadowed crater.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/athena-landed-in-a-dark-crater-where-the-temperature-was-minus-280-f/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google's venerable 2015 Chromecast <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/googles-10-year-old-chromecast-is-busted-but-a-fix-is-coming/">attempted to self-destruct</a> earlier this week, upsetting a huge number of people who were still using the decade-old streaming dongles. Google was seemingly caught off guard by the devices glitching out all at the same time, but it promised to address the problem, and it has. Google says it has a fix ready to roll out, and most affected devices should be right as rain in the coming days.</p>
<p>Google is still not confirming the cause of the Chromecast outage, but it was almost certainly the result of a certificate expiring after 10 years. It would seem there was no one keeping an eye on the Chromecast's ticking time bomb, which isn't exactly surprising—Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/google-kills-chromecast-replaces-it-with-apple-tv-and-roku-ultra-competitor/">moved on from the Chromecast brand</a>, focusing instead on the more capable Google TV streamer. Even if Google is done with the Chromecast, its customers aren't.</p>
<p>If you left your <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/the-2015-chromecast-and-chromecast-audio-small-blips-in-the-stream/">2015 Chromecast</a> or Chromecast Audio alone to await a fix, you're in good shape. The update should be delivered automatically to the device soon. "We’ve started rolling out a fix for the problem with Chromecast (2nd gen) and Chromecast Audio devices, which will be completed over the next few days. Users must ensure their device is connected to WiFi to receive the update," says Google.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-has-a-fix-for-your-broken-chromecast-v2-unless-you-factory-reset/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meta plans to test out X's algorithm for Community Notes to crowdsource fact-checks that will appear across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/testing-begins-community-notes-facebook-instagram-threads/">blog</a>, Meta said the testing in the US would begin March 18, with about 200,000 potential contributors already signed up. Anyone over 18 with a Meta account more than six months old can also join a waitlist of users who will "gradually" and "randomly" be admitted to write and rate cross-platform notes during initial beta testing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meta claimed that borrowing X's approach would result in "less biased" fact-checking than relying on experts alone. But the social media company will delay publicly posting any notes until it's confident that the system is working.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/meta-plans-to-test-and-tinker-with-xs-community-notes-algorithm/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Labrador retrievers are common pets, but they also work as service dogs, aiding people with sight or hearing impairments. Unfortunately, the breed is particularly prone to getting overweight, and this tendency apparently is more severe in Labradors purpose-bred for service. To figure out the reasons behind this, researchers at Cambridge University investigated potential obesity genes in Labrador retrievers’ DNA.</p>
<p>It turned out increased obesity risk in Labradors was linked to the same genes and mechanisms that cause obesity in humans. These gene variants were more common in purpose-bred dogs we carefully selected, generation after generation, to maximize the results of the demanding training programs service animals must go through.</p>
<p>We thought we were picking the smartest Labradors to become guide dogs. But we might have been picking the ones that just wanted the snacks given as rewards the most.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/have-we-accidentally-bred-some-dogs-for-obesity/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google is continuing its quest to get more people to use Gemini, and it's doing that by giving away even more AI computing. Today, Google is releasing a raft of improvements for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Gemini 2.0 models</a>, and as part of that upgrade, some of the AI's most advanced features are now available to free users. You'll be able to use the improved Deep Research to get in-depth information on a topic, and Google's newest reasoning model can peruse your search history to improve its understanding of you as a person. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Like most big AI players, Google has a number of different models available. Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is the company's most capable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">multistep reasoning model</a>, which can consider complex topics and gives you a window into its "thought" process. Google is adding a lot to this model in its latest round of updates, enabling a much larger 1-million-token context window, file uploads, and faster output. It also supports more Google apps with connections to Calendar, Notes, Tasks, and Photos.</p>
<p>With the aim of making Gemini more personal to you, Google is also plugging Flash Thinking Experimental into a new source of data: your search history. <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-personalization/">Google stresses</a> that you have to opt in to this feature, and it can be disabled at any time. Gemini will even display a banner to remind you it's connected to your search history so you don't forget. If you grant access, the AI can allegedly understand you better and offer more relevant recommendations. It feels a bit strange to turn Gemini loose on such personal data, but Google already knows what you look up on the Internet. You're not giving up much more if you let the robot have a peek. This is apparently just the start of Google's efforts to personalize the AI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-gemini-ai-can-now-see-your-search-history/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">OpenAI is hoping that Donald Trump's AI Action Plan, due out this July, will settle copyright debates by declaring AI training fair use—paving the way for AI companies' unfettered access to training data that OpenAI claims is critical to defeat China in the AI race.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, courts are mulling whether AI training is fair use, as rights holders say that AI models trained on creative works threaten to replace them in markets and water down humanity's creative output overall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">OpenAI is just one AI company fighting with rights holders in several dozen lawsuits, arguing that AI transforms copyrighted works it trains on and alleging that AI outputs aren't substitutes for original works.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/openai-urges-trump-either-settle-ai-copyright-debate-or-lose-ai-race-to-china/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The annual Game Developers Conference is about to kick off, and even though Stadia is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">dead and buried</a>, Google has a lot of plans for games. It's expanding tools that help PC developers bring premium games to Android, and games are heading in the other direction, too. The PC-based Play Games platform is expanding to bring every single Android game to Windows. Google doesn't have a firm timeline for all these changes, but 2025 will be an interesting year for the company's gaming efforts.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/google-play-games-beta-now-on-windows-desktops-if-thats-your-thing/">released the first beta</a> of Google Play Games on PC back in 2022, allowing you to play Android games on a PC. It has chugged along quietly ever since, mostly because of the anemic and largely uninteresting game catalog. While there are hundreds of thousands of Android games, only a handful were made available in the PC client. That's changing in a big way now that Google is bringing over every Android game from Google Play.</p>
<p>Starting today, you'll see thousands of new games in Google Play Games on PC. Developers actually have to <a href="https://developer.android.com/games/playgames/development-submit#distribution-opt-in">opt out</a> if they don't want their games available on Windows machines via Google Play Games. Google says this is possible thanks to improved custom controls, making it easy to map keyboard and gamepad controls onto games that were designed for touchscreens (see below). The usability of these mapped controls will probably vary dramatically from game to game.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/at-gdc-google-promises-more-pc-games-on-android-more-android-games-on-pc/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, a developer using Cursor AI for a racing game project hit an unexpected roadblock when the programming assistant abruptly refused to continue generating code, instead offering some unsolicited career advice.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-told-me-i-should-learn-coding-instead-of-asking-it-to-generate-it-limit-of-800-locs/61132">bug report</a> on Cursor's official forum, after producing approximately 750 to 800 lines of code (what the user calls "locs"), the AI assistant halted work and delivered a refusal message: "I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work. The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly."</p>
<p>The AI didn't stop at merely refusing—it offered a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/chatgpt-can-now-write-erotica-as-openai-eases-up-on-ai-paternalism/">paternalistic</a> justification for its decision, stating that "Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-coding-assistant-refuses-to-write-code-tells-user-to-learn-programming-instead/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last year, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/hey-listen-new-minecraft-ai-guide-offers-tips-while-watching-you-play/">showed off a pair of concept videos</a> highlighting how "real-time conversations with your AI companion copilot" might one day provide personalized guidance and companionship while playing a solo game of <em>Minecraft</em>. Now, Microsoft is announcing that it will roll out "Copilot for Gaming" as an "ultimate gaming sidekick" that will be available via mobile app preview for Xbox Insiders starting in April.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the current version of Microsoft's gaming "copilot" seems to fall well short of last year's demo, providing some bare-bones automation of functions that can mostly be achieved pretty easily today without the aid of AI. The new app feels less like a revolutionary new use case for conversational AI and more like a glorified, Xbox-branded version of Apple's Siri.</p>
<h2>Wait, is that it?</h2>
<p>Watching a short, livestreamed demo of the new Copilot for Gaming app, my reactions quickly shifted from "that's kind of neat" to "wait, is that it?" That process started from the very first moment, when a player asked, "I want to get back into <em>Age of Empires</em>... Can you install it?" Conversational installation prompts could be a bit more convenient than simply clicking the handful of buttons needed to start a game install without AI, but it's not the most exciting use case to lead off with.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/microsofts-new-ai-copilot-for-gaming-struggles-to-justify-its-existence/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Using a Windows PC with an Arm-based Snapdragon processor in it feels a lot like using a regular-old Intel or AMD PC these days, thanks to the work developers have put in to get their apps running natively on Arm chips and the work Microsoft has done on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsoft-says-prism-translation-layer-does-for-arm-pcs-what-rosetta-did-for-macs/">Windows' Prism technology for translating x86 apps to run on Arm processors</a>. But some of the old compatibility gaps remain.</p>
<p>For example, while many PC games will run well enough on an Arm PC without any changes from the game's developer, online multiplayer games that rely on kernel-level anti-cheat software generally don't work. Drivers and other lower-level Windows software can't be translated by Prism, and in many cases, the Arm PC user base is still small enough that developers haven't put in the work to get Arm versions of their software up and running.</p>
<p>Epic Games is taking a step in that direction later this year—today, the company <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite">announced</a> that it's bringing its <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/services-games">Epic Online Services Easy Anti-Cheat</a> software to Arm PCs, along with official Windows-on-Arm support for <em>Fortnite</em>. Both are coming to Arm PCs "later this year."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/epic-games-is-addressing-one-of-windows-on-arms-last-big-app-compatibility-gaps/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If there can be such a thing as bureaucratic “shock and awe,” Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin tried to unleash it Wednesday.</p>
<p>He unveiled the Trump administration’s widely anticipated assault on regulation on all fronts at once, announcing 31 separate actions to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution, hand over more authority to states and relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.</p>
<p>“These announcements represent the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in the history of the United States,” an EPA representative wrote in one of a slew of press releases. Zeldin said the moves would lower the cost of living, create jobs, and revitalize the economy. In <a href="https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1899876025363837292">a video</a> posted on the social media site X, Zeldin exulted over the plan to rescind the EPA’s 16-year-old determination that <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02032025/trump-epa-greenhouse-gas-pollution-endangerment-finding/">greenhouse gases are a danger</a> to public health and welfare, known as the endangerment finding.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/epa-launches-full-assault-on-environmental-protection/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency is throwing out fuel economy regulations that were planned <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/new-epa-doe-fuel-regs-give-automakers-longer-to-reduce-co2-emissions/">to go into effect</a> from 2026 through 2032. The new regulations would have required automakers to sell <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/automakers-may-have-to-sell-4x-more-evs-under-new-proposed-cafe-rules/">many more electric vehicles</a> than they currently do, although due to lobbying, the previous administration softened the rules to allow for more plug-in hybrid EVs alongside battery EVs.</p>
<p>This was widely expected to happen; the first Trump administration was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/trump-epa-sidelined-its-own-scientists-when-rewriting-fuel-economy-rules/">tireless</a> in its attempts to roll back vehicle pollution controls. Then, its argument in favor of more pollution was that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/08/epas-rationale-for-slicing-fuel-standards-rife-with-logical-fallacies/">fuel economy standards would kill people</a>. Now, things are less strident: We will suffer more smog and climate change in the name of consumer freedom.</p>
<p>"The American auto industry has been hamstrung by the crushing regulatory regime of the last administration. As we reconsider nearly one trillion dollars of regulatory costs, we will abide by the rule of law to protect consumer choice and the environment," said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-epa-is-scrapping-fuel-economy-regs-claiming-it-will-bring-back-us-jobs/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Take a look at the Civilization subreddit, and you’ll see a general consensus: The bones of this game are great, and even most of the radical changes to the classic formula (like breaking the game into much more distinct ages) are a welcome refresh.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there’s a sentiment that players are disappointed that some expected features are missing, some gameplay elements need additional polish, and most of all, the user interface was a bit of a mess at launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/civilization-vii-one-month-later-the-community-and-developers-chime-in/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1j8sjcd/should_ai_have_a_i_quit_this_job_button_dario/">raised a few eyebrows</a> on Monday after suggesting that advanced AI models might someday be provided with the ability to push a "button" to quit tasks they might find unpleasant. Amodei made the provocative remarks <a href="https://www.cfr.org/event/ceo-speaker-series-dario-amodei-anthropic">during an interview</a> at the Council on Foreign Relations, acknowledging that the idea "sounds crazy."</p>
<p>"So this is—this is another one of those topics that’s going to make me sound completely insane," Amodei said during the interview. "I think we should at least consider the question of, if we are building these systems and they do all kinds of things like humans as well as humans, and seem to have a lot of the same cognitive capacities, if it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck."</p>
<p>Amodei's comments came in response to an audience question from data scientist Carmem Domingues about Anthropic's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/anthropic-hires-its-first-ai-welfare-researcher/">late-2024 hiring</a> of AI welfare researcher Kyle Fish "to look at, you know, sentience or lack of thereof of future AI models, and whether they might deserve moral consideration and protections in the future." Fish currently investigates the highly contentious topic of whether AI models could possess sentience or otherwise merit moral consideration.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/anthropics-ceo-wonders-if-future-ai-should-have-option-to-quit-unpleasant-tasks/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Gen. Chance Saltzman, the Space Force's chief of space operations, told reporters at the Air &amp; Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium last week that he wants more options to present to national leaders if an adversary threatens the US fleet of national security satellites used for surveillance, communication, navigation, missile warning, and perhaps soon, missile defense.</p>
<p>In prepared remarks, Saltzman outlined in new detail why the Space Force should be able to go on the offense in an era of orbital warfare.

              <![CDATA[<p>Satellites come in all shapes and sizes, but there aren't any that look quite like SPHEREx, an infrared observatory NASA launched Tuesday night in search of answers to simmering questions about how the Universe, and ultimately life, came to be.</p>
<p>The mission launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 8:10 pm local time (11:10 pm EDT) Tuesday. Less than 45 minutes later, the Falcon 9's upper stage released SPHEREx into a polar orbit at an altitude of roughly 420 miles (675 kilometers). Ground controllers received the first signals from the spacecraft, confirming its health after reaching space.</p>
<p>As soon as next month, once engineers verify the observatory is ready, SPHEREx will begin a two-year science mission surveying the sky in 102 colors invisible to the human eye. The observatory's infrared detectors will collect data on the chemical composition of asteroids, hazy star-forming clouds, and faraway galaxies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/no-thats-not-a-cosmic-cone-of-shame-its-nasas-newest-space-telescope/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Drinking alcohol is bad in many ways; raising a glass can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/more-cancer-less-death-new-alcohol-risk-reviews-offer-conflicting-takeaways/">raise your risks of various health problems</a>, such as accidental injuries, liver diseases, high blood pressure, and several types of cancers. But, it's not all bad—in fact, it's surprisingly good for your cholesterol levels, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831319">a study published today in JAMA Network Open</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers at Harvard University led the study, and it included nearly 58,000 adults in Japan who were followed for up to a year using a database of medical records from routine checkups. Researchers found that when people switched from being nondrinkers to drinkers during the study, they saw a drop in their "bad" cholesterol—aka low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or LDL.  Meanwhile, their "good" cholesterol—aka high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or HDL—went up when they began imbibing. HDL levels went up so much, that it actually beat out improvements typically seen with medications, the researchers noted.</p>
<p>On the other hand, drinkers who stopped drinking during the study saw the opposite effect: Upon giving up booze, their bad cholesterol went up and their good cholesterol went down.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/large-study-shows-drinking-alcohol-is-good-for-your-cholesterol-levels/">Read full article</a></p>
