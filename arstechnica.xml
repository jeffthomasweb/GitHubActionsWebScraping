<p>This mission, named OSIRIS-APEX, was one of 19 operating NASA science missions the White House proposed canceling in a budget blueprint released earlier this year.</p>
<p>"We were called for cancellation as part to the president's budget request, and we were reinstated and given a plan to move ahead in FY26 (Fiscal Year 2026) just two weeks ago," said Dani DellaGiustina, principal investigator for OSIRIS-APEX at the University of Arizona. "Our spacecraft appears happy and healthy."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/one-nasa-science-mission-saved-from-trumps-cuts-but-others-still-in-limbo/">Read full article</a></p>

The new financing doubles the total capital raised by Stoke Space, founded in 2020, to $990 million.</p>
<p>The infusion of money will provide the company with "the runway to complete development" of the Nova rocket and demonstrate its capability through its first flights, said Andy Lapsa, the company's co-founder and chief executive, in a news release characterizing the new funding.</p>
<p>Stoke is working toward a 2026 launch of the medium-lift <a href="https://www.stokespace.com/nova/">Nova rocket</a>. The rocket's innovative design is intended to be fully reusable from the payload fairing on down, with a regeneratively cooled heat shield on the vehicle's second stage. In fully reusable mode, Nova will have a payload capacity of 3 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, and up to 7 tons in fully expendable mode.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/stoke-space-gives-us-another-reason-to-take-it-very-seriously/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A 36-year-old man showed up to the emergency department of the Massachusetts General Hospital, severely unwell from a puzzling set of conditions. He had abnormalities in his lungs, intestines, blood, liver, and lymphatic system—and, of course, no single clear explanation. His case was such a riddle that a master clinician with an expertise in clinical reasoning was called in to help unravel it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412539">a case report</a> published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, the expert and the man's other doctors lay out the masterful medical deduction that explained his remarkable case—which had an entirely unremarkable cause.</p>
<p>It all started about two weeks before his hospital visit. A mild, dull pain had developed in the patient's right lower abdomen and back. Nine days later, a fever and body aches also developed. The next day, he went to urgent care, where clinicians gave him intravenous fluids and an intravenous pain reliever. His abdominal pain went away, and he was discharged. But the pain returned over the next few days, and with it came nausea and vomiting. He then started coughing and having trouble breathing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/man-gets-drunk-wakes-up-with-a-medical-mystery-that-nearly-kills-him/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The UK central bank said US stock valuations resemble those seen near the peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dotcom bubble</a> on some measures, with AI-focused companies making up an unprecedented portion of market value.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/october-2025">quarterly report</a> derived from a meeting of its Financial Policy Committee that took place last week, BoE wrote that "the risk of a sharp market correction has increased." Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/markets-face-sharp-correction-if-mood-sours-ai-or-fed-freedom-bank-england-says-2025-10-08/">notes</a> that it's the BoE's strongest warning to date about potential AI-driven market declines.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr says Internet service providers shouldn't have to list every fee they charge. Responding to a request from cable and telecom lobby groups, he is proposing to eliminate a rule that requires ISPs to itemize various fees in broadband price labels that must be made available to consumers.</p>
<p>The rule took effect in April 2024 after the FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/fcc-says-too-bad-to-isps-complaining-that-listing-every-fee-is-too-hard/">rejected</a> ISPs' complaints that listing every fee they created would be too difficult. The rule applies specifically to recurring monthly fees "that providers impose at their discretion, <em>i.e.</em>, charges not mandated by a government."</p>
<p>ISPs could comply with the rule either by listing the fees or by dropping the fees altogether and, if they choose, raising their overall prices by a corresponding amount. But the latter option wouldn't fit with the strategy of enticing customers with a low advertised price and hitting them with the real price on their monthly bills. The broadband price label rules were created to stop ISPs from advertising misleadingly low prices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/isps-created-so-many-fees-that-fcc-will-kill-requirement-to-list-them-all/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><em>Cards Against Humanity</em>, the often-vulgar card game, has launched a limited edition of its namesake product without any instructions and with a detailed explanation of each joke, "why it’s funny, and any relevant social, political, or historical context."</p>
<p>Why? Because, produced in this form, "Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke" is not a game at all, which would be subject to tariffs as the cards are produced overseas. Instead, the product is "information material" and thus not sanctionable under the law Trump has been using—and CAH says it has obtained a ruling to this effect from Customs and Border Patrol.</p>
<p>"What if DHS Secretary and Dog Murderer Kristi Noem gets mad and decides that Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke is not informational material?" the company asks in an FAQ about the new edition. (If you don't follow US politics, Noem <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/02/kristi-noem-dog-cricket-00155700">really did kill her dog Cricket</a>.) Answer: "She can fuck right off, because we got a binding ruling from Trump’s own government that confirms this product is informational and 100% exempt from his stupid tariffs."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/to-avoid-tariffs-cards-against-humanity-becomes-information-material-not-a-game/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Salesforce says it’s refusing to pay an extortion demand made by a crime syndicate that claims to have stolen roughly 1 billion records from dozens of Salesforce customers.</p>
<p>The threat group making the demands began their campaign in May, when they made voice calls to organizations storing data on the Salesforce platform, Google-owned Mandiant <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/voice-phishing-data-extortion">said</a> in June. The English-speaking callers would provide a pretense that necessitated the target connect an attacker-controlled app to their Salesforce portal. Amazingly—but not surprisingly—many of the people who received the calls complied.</p>
<h2>It’s becoming a real mess</h2>
<p>The threat group behind the campaign is calling itself Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters, a mashup of three prolific data-extortion actors: Scattered Spider, LAPSuS$, and ShinyHunters. Mandiant, meanwhile, tracks the group as UNC6040, because the researchers so far have been unable to positively identify the connections.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/salesforce-says-it-wont-pay-extortion-demand-in-1-billion-records-breach/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In another loss for early smart home adopters, Logitech has announced that it will brick all Pop switches on October 15.</p>
<p>In August of 2016, Logitech launched Pop switches, which provide quick access to a range of smart home actions, including third-party gadgets. For example, people could set their Pop buttons to launch <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/philips-hue-update-includes-a-new-hub-light-strips-and-finally-budget-bulbs/">Philips Hue</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/insteon-smart-homes-resurrected-as-abruptly-as-they-were-bricked/">Insteon lighting</a> presets, play a playlist from their Sonos speaker, or control Lutron smart blinds. Each button could store three actions, worked by identifying smart home devices on a shared Wi-Fi network, and was controllable via a dedicated Android or iOS app. The Pop Home Switch Starter Pack launched at $100, and individual Pop Add-on Home Switches debuted at $40 each.</p>
<p>A company spokesperson told Ars Technica that Logitech informed customers on September 29 that their Pop switches would soon become e-waste. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Flogitech-pop-smart-buttons-end-of-life-as-of-october-15th-v0-7wbm9pl3yrsf1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D2020%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D49ba5b24e8bcc9980a4e141f404814bf8299a1cc">copies</a> of the email shared via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1nu2u7g/logitech_pop_buttons_ejunk_in_2_weeks/">Reddit</a>, Logitech’s notice said:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/logitech-will-brick-its-100-pop-smart-home-buttons-on-october-15/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>When the first foldable phones came along, they seemed like a cool evolution of the traditional smartphone form factor and, if they got smaller and cheaper, like something people might <em>actually</em> want. After more than five years of foldable phones, we can probably give up on the latter. Google's new Pixel 10 Pro Fold retains the $1,800 price tag of last year's model, and while it's improved in several key ways, spending almost two grand on any phone remains hard to justify.</p>
<p>For those whose phones are a primary computing device or who simply love gadgets, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is still appealing. It offers the same refined Android experience as the rest of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-pixel-10-series-review-dont-call-it-an-android/">Pixel 10 lineup</a>, with much more screen real estate on which to enjoy it. Google also improved the hinge for better durability, shaved off some bezel, and boosted both charging speed and battery capacity. However, the form factor hasn't taken the same <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-the-foldable-we-deserve-but-not-the-one-we-can-afford/">quantum leap</a> as Samsung's latest foldable.</p>
<h2>An iterative (but good) design</h2>
<p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't reinvent the wheel—it looks and feels almost exactly like last year's foldable, with a few minor tweaks centered around a new "gearless" hinge. Dropping the internal gears allegedly helps make the mechanism twice as durable. Google claims the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's hinge will last for more than 10 years of folding and unfolding.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-the-ultimate-google-phone/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>If you were considering the purchase of a Synology NAS but were leery of the unreasonably high cost of populating it with special Synology-branded hard disk drives, you can breathe a little easier today. In <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/company/news/article/dsm73/Synology%C2%AE%20Releases%20DiskStation%20Manager%207.3%2C%20Bringing%20Efficient%20Data%20Tiering%2C%20Enhanced%20Security%2C%20and%20AI-Powered%20Collaboration">a press release dated October 8</a>, Synology noted that with the release of its latest Disk Station Manager (DSM) update, some of its 2025 model-year products—specifically, the Plus, Value, and J-series DiskStation NAS devices—would "support the installation and storage pool creation of non-validated third-party drives."</p>
<p>This unexpected move comes just a few months after Synology <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/synology-confirms-need-for-synology-branded-drives-in-newer-plus-series-nas/">aggressively expanded its "verified drive" policy down-market</a> to the entire Plus line of DiskStations. Prior to today, the network-attached storage vendor had shown no signs of swerving from the decision, painting it as a pro-consumer move intended to enhance reliability. "Extensive internal testing has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and ongoing compatibility issues," Synology previously claimed in an email to Ars.</p>
<h2>What is a “verified” or “validated” drive?</h2>
<p>Synology first released its own brand of hard disk drives <a href="https://www.blackvoid.club/synology-hdd-compatibility-policy-explained/">back in 2021</a> and began requiring their use in a small but soon-to-increase number of its higher-end NAS products. Although the drives were rebadged offerings from other manufacturers—there are very few hard disk drive OEMs, and Synology isn't one of them—the company claimed that its branded disks <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/drives/hdd/enterprise-hat">underwent significant additional validation and testing</a> that, when coupled with customized firmware, yielded reliability and performance improvements over off-the-shelf components.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/synology-caves-walks-back-some-drive-restrictions-on-upcoming-nas-models/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This act of vandalism is now part of a <a href="https://nyc-friends.vercel.app/">huge online archive</a> collecting defaced ads that the Friend campaign inspired, as many New Yorkers responded with vitriol to marketing claims that the AI "friend" would never "bail on dinner" or abandon you to ride the subway alone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/vandals-deface-ads-for-ai-necklaces-that-listen-to-all-your-conversations/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The polymers around us are basically a disordered mess, with long chains of atoms tangled around each other. But starting around 1990, chemists began developing techniques that allow us to build polymers with precisely defined structures. These polymers, called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have distinct chemical properties: large pores that can be used to filter or store gases, catalytic centers within the polymer, and more.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Nobel Prize Committee honored three researchers for their role in developing MOFs: Richard Robson for demonstrating the first MOF, and Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi for developing them to their full potential.</p>
<h2>Building a structure</h2>
<p>Most polymers are built from individual molecules that are linked together by flexible bonds, allowing the molecules to flop around. As a result, in their final form as something like a plastic bag or a bike tire, the polymers are a complicated tangle, with molecules wrapped around each other in no particular order. We can still control some aspects of the resulting polymer by manipulating its bulk properties or changing the molecules it's built from, but there's not a lot of chemistry we can do beyond that.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/building-ordered-polymers-with-metal/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In sharing video of the rollout to Launch Complex-36 on Wednesday <a href="https://x.com/blueorigin/status/1975900484943671738">online</a>, the space company did not provide a launch target for the mission, which seeks to put two small Mars-bound payloads into orbit. The pair of identical spacecraft to study the solar wind at Mars is known as ESCAPADE.</p>
<p>However, sources told Ars that on the current timeline, Blue Origin is targeting a launch window of November 9 to November 11. This assumes pre-launch activities, including a static-fire test of the first stage, go well.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/the-second-new-glenn-rolls-to-the-launch-pad-and-they-expect-to-recover-this-one/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI and Anthropic are considering using investor funds to settle potential claims from multibillion-dollar lawsuits, as insurers balk at providing comprehensive coverage for the risks associated with artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The two US-based AI start-ups have traditional business insurance coverage in place, but insurance professionals said AI model providers will struggle to secure protection for the full scale of damages they may need to pay out in the future.</p>
<p>OpenAI, which has tapped the world’s second-largest insurance broker Aon for help, has secured cover of up to $300 million for emerging AI risks, according to people familiar with the company’s policy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/insurers-balk-at-paying-out-huge-settlements-for-claims-against-ai-firms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>By now, a handful of technologies are leading contenders for producing a useful quantum computer. Companies have used them to build machines with dozens to hundreds of qubits, the error rates are coming down, and they've largely shifted from worrying about basic scientific problems to dealing with engineering challenges.</p>
<p>Yet even at this apparently late date in the field's development, there are companies that are still developing entirely new qubit technologies, betting the company that they have identified something that will let them scale in ways that enable a come-from-behind story. Recently, one of those companies published a paper that describes the physics of their qubit system, which involves lone electrons floating on top of liquid helium.</p>
<h2>Trapping single electrons</h2>
<p>So how do you get an electron to float on top of helium? To find out, Ars spoke with Johannes Pollanen, the chief scientific officer of EeroQ, the company that accomplished the new work. He said that it's actually old physics, with the first demonstrations of it having been done half a century ago.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/new-qubit-tech-traps-single-electrons-on-liquid-helium/">Read full article</a></p>

Tesla fans have long-awaited a cheaper entry-level model; this was supposed to be the $25,000 Model 2. But the development of that electric vehicle was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-scraps-its-plan-for-a-25000-model-2-ev/">shelved earlier last year</a> as CEO Elon Musk began to lose interest with car-making <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/tesla-has-a-new-master-plan-it-just-doesnt-have-any-specifics/">in favor of humanoid robots</a>.</p>
<p>However, car sales still make up the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-q2-2025-sell-fewer-cars-and-carbon-credits-make-less-money/">overwhelming majority</a> of Tesla's revenue, and the removal of the IRS clean vehicle tax credit at the end of September may have juiced US EV sales in Q3 2025, but sales are expected to dip significantly in the current quarter.</p>
<p>The new Standard Range Model Y starts at $39,990, with 321 miles (516 km) of range from its rear-wheel drive powertrain, compared to the now-Premium rear-wheel drive Model Y, which has an EPA range of 357 miles (574 km). In the past, Tesla has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/tesla-remotely-extends-the-range-of-some-cars-to-help-with-irma/">software-locked</a> batteries to a smaller configuration; however, here we believe the Standard Range Model Y uses a 69 kWh pack.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/teslas-new-cut-price-evs-a-39990-model-y-and-36990-model-3/">Read full article</a></p>

<h2>Here’s what to know</h2>
<p><strong>You still have access and coverage</strong>: For this year, anyone age 6 months and older will still have access to the shots, and the shots should be fully covered under private insurance plans and federal programs—including Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Vaccines for Children Program, and insurance plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>In fact, for private insurance plans, AHIP—the trade organization that represents major insurers—had already stated that regardless of how this year's messy federal recommendations ended up, private insurance plans would <a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage">maintain their previous coverage</a> with no cost sharing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/after-rfk-jr-s-shenanigans-covid-shot-access-will-be-a-lot-like-last-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/summary/">has been awarded</a> to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis "for the discovery of macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy quantization in an electrical circuit." The Nobel committee said during a media briefing that the laureates' work provides opportunities to develop "the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors." The three men will split the $1.1 million (11 million Swedish kronor) prize money. The presentation ceremony will take place in Stockholm on December 10, 2025.</p>
<p>"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life," Clarke told reporters by phone during this morning's press conference. "Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me. One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work."</p>
<p>When physicists began delving into the strange new realm of subatomic particles in the early 20th century, they discovered a realm where the old, deterministic laws of classical physics no longer apply. Instead, uncertainty reigns supreme. It is a world governed not by absolutes, but by probabilities, where events that would seem impossible on the macroscale occur on a regular basis.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/2025-nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-for-macroscale-quantum-tunneling/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The letter from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/ted-cruz-picks-a-fight-with-wikipedia-accusing-platform-of-left-wing-bias/">accusing Wikipedia of left-wing bias</a> seems to be based on fundamental misunderstandings of how the platform works, according to a lawyer for the nonprofit foundation that operates the online encyclopedia.</p>
<p>"The foundation is very much taking the approach that Wikipedia is actually pretty great and a lot of what's in this letter is actually misunderstandings," <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/profile/jacob-rogers/?referer=2279">Jacob Rogers</a>, associate general counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, told Ars in an interview. "And so we are more than happy, despite the pressure that comes from these things, to help people better understand how Wikipedia works."</p>
<p>Cruz's letter to Wikimedia Foundation CEO Maryana Iskander expressed concern "about ideological bias on the Wikipedia platform and at the Wikimedia Foundation." Cruz alleged that Wikipedia articles "often reflect a left-wing bias." He asked the foundation for "documents sufficient to show what supervision, oversight, or influence, if any, the Wikimedia Foundation has over the editing community," and "documents sufficient to show how the Wikimedia Foundation addresses political or ideological bias."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/wikipedia-rebuts-ted-cruz-attack-says-cruz-just-doesnt-understand-the-site/">Read full article</a></p>
