                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's most famous chips are the A- and M-series processors that power its iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but this year, its effort to build its own wireless chips is starting to bear fruit. Earlier this spring, the iPhone 16e included Apple's C1 modem, furthering Apple's ambitions to shed its dependence on Qualcomm, and today's iPhone Air brought a faster Apple C1X variant, plus something new: the Apple N1, a chip that provides Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support for all of today's new iPhones.</p>
<p>Apple didn't dive deep into the capabilities of the N1, or why it had switched from using third-party suppliers (historically, Apple has mostly leaned on Broadcom for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). However, the company's press releases say that it should make Continuity features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop more reliable—these features use Bluetooth for initial communication and then Wi-Fi to establish a high-speed local link between two devices. Other features that use a similar combination of wireless technologies, like using an iPad as an extended Mac display, should also benefit.</p>
<p>These aren't Apple's first chips to integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth technology. The Apple Watches rely on W-series chips to provide their Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity; the Apple H1 and H2 chips also provide Bluetooth connectivity for many of Apple's wireless headphones. But this is the first time that Apple has switched to its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip in one of its iPhones, suggesting that the chips have matured enough to provide higher connectivity speeds for more demanding devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/apples-n1-chip-extends-its-custom-silicon-into-wi-fi-bluetooth-and-thread/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Reddit has addressed a problem where the description of subreddits originally written by moderators appeared differently—and, often, inaccurately—on Reddit’s Android app. For weeks, the problem was largely suspected to be caused by Reddit clumsily using generative AI to create new subreddit descriptions. However, Reddit says that the changes were the fault of a bug tied to its AI-powered translation technology.</p>
<p>Reports of subreddits suddenly having inaccurate summaries when viewed on Reddit’s Android app started surfacing on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticParents/comments/1mxlvdc/has_this_subreddit_changed/">a couple of weeks ago</a>. On August 29, a moderator <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1n2zo33/comment/nbcdyxe/?context=3">reported</a> on the r/ModSupport subreddit for moderators that the r/ThronesAndDominions subreddit's description changed from “The wayward adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth” to “The crazy adventures of Dylan Carlson and the band Earth.” The problem got more attention when r/actuallesbians’ Android app description <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1nb7r43/why_does_the_subs_description_say_straight/?share_id=-7RsDHvw9KgB6OYfk0ymn&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">described</a> the community as “a place for straight and transgender lesbians …” instead of “a place for cis and trans lesbians …”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1nb916s/some_users_are_seeing_different_subreddit/">Other complaints</a> followed, including from r/autisticparents, a subreddit for parents with autism whose description <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticParents/comments/1mxp16u/how_the_sub_description_looks_for_me_on_mobile/">was changed</a> to say that it is a group for “parents of autistic children.” A moderator who asked to be referred to by their Reddit username, Paige_Railstone, described the confusion that the changes brought to their subreddit:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/reddit-bug-caused-lesbian-subreddit-to-be-labeled-as-a-place-for-straight-women/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—We're a long way from the days when a new iPhone launch just meant one new phone. It shifted to "basically the same phone in two sizes" a decade or so ago, and then to a version of "one lineup of regular phones and one lineup of Pro phones" in 2017 when the iPhone 8 was introduced next to the iPhone X.</p>
<p>But thanks to Apple's newly introduced iPhone Air, the iPhone 17 lineup gives new phone buyers more choices and trade-offs than they've ever had before. Apple's phones are now available in a spectrum of sizes, weights, speeds, costs, and camera configurations. And while options are great to have, it also means you need to know more about which one to pick.</p>
<p>We've gone hands-on with all four of Apple's new phones, and while more extensive tire-kicking will be required, we can at least try to nail down exactly what kind of person each of these phones is for.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/hands-on-with-the-iphone-17-lineup-including-the-wispy-air-and-the-lumpy-pro/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Pfizer and BioNTech report that their <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-topline-data-demonstrating">updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for the 2025–2026 season</a> produced strong immune responses, boosting neutralizing antibody levels by at least fourfold in older people and those with underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>The positive results come as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/who-can-get-a-covid-vaccine-and-how-its-complicated/">Americans face a confusing, state-by-state patchwork of access to the shots</a> under the health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an ardent anti-vaccine activist who has unilaterally restricted access. Prior to the second Trump administration, all Americans ages 6 months and older had access to the vaccines. But under Kennedy, the Food and Drug Administration limited COVID-19 vaccine approvals to people 65 and older, and people under 64 years only if they have an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>In Pfizer and BioNTech's latest trial, the companies limited enrollment to these groups. The phase 3 trial included 100 people total, 50 people aged 65 or older and 50 people aged 18 to 64 with an underlying condition. <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07069309">Those conditions</a> included asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, HIV, mental health conditions, Parkinson's disease, obesity, or smoking. All participants had gotten last season's COVID shot at least six months prior to the trial and had not gotten any other COVID-19 vaccines or a COVID-19 infection since then.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/pfizer-reports-positive-covid-shot-results-despite-government-fueled-chaos/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The feature, awkwardly named "Upgraded file creation and analysis," is basically Anthropic's version of ChatGPT's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-eyes-and-ears-with-plugins-that-can-interface-ai-with-the-world/">Code Interpreter</a> and an upgraded version of Anthropic's <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/analysis-tool">"analysis" tool</a>. It's currently available as a preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan users, with Pro users scheduled to receive access "in the coming weeks," according to the announcement.</p>
<p>The security issue comes from the fact that the new feature gives Claude access to a sandbox computing environment, which enables it to download packages and run code to create files. "This feature gives Claude Internet access to create and analyze files, which may put your data at risk," Anthropic writes in its blog announcement. "Monitor chats closely when using this feature."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/anthropics-new-claude-feature-can-leak-data-users-told-to-monitor-chats-closely/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A new independent report finds that although NASA's ambitious mission to fly across the surface of Titan is delayed and over budget, the fault is due to the space agency's management rather than the program itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/office-of-inspector-general-oig/audit-reports/nasas-management-of-the-dragonfly-project/">Released Tuesday by NASA's Office of Inspector General</a>, the report found that the mission's budget has soared from an initial figure of $850 million upon its selection in 2019 to $3.35 billion today. Additionally, the launch target has slipped from the year 2026 to 2028.</p>
<p>However, the cost increase and schedule slippages are not new. The space agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/nasa-officially-greenlights-3-35-billion-mission-to-saturns-moon-titan/">disclosed these issues</a> nearly a year and a half ago. What is notable about the new report from NASA's inspector general is that the cause of these problems was not a serious technical problem or a flawed design of a vehicle intended to spend years flying across Titan.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/after-early-struggles-nasas-ambitious-mission-to-titan-is-on-track-for-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As hackers exploit a high-severity vulnerability in SAP’s flagship Enterprise Resource Planning software product, the software maker is warning users of more than two dozen newly detected vulnerabilities in its other widely used products, including a security flaw with a maximum-severity rating of 10.</p>
<p>SAP on Tuesday <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/september-2025.html">said</a> the highest-severity vulnerability—with a rating of 10 out of a possible 10—was found in NetWeaver, a platform that serves as the technical foundation for many of the company’s other enterprise applications. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-42944, makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute commands by submitting malicious payloads to an open port.</p>
<p>The maximum-severity threat stems from a deserialization vulnerability. Serialization is a coding process that translates data structures and object states into formats that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. Deserialization is the process in reverse.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/as-hackers-exploit-one-high-severity-sap-flaw-company-warns-of-3-more/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The 6.5-inch iPhone 17 Air combines the CPU and GPU of an iPhone Pro with the camera system of a regular iPhone, all in an extra-thin design (5.6 mm), with a treated titanium frame that is likely to appeal to style-conscious users and some business consumers.</p>
<p>Like the iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Air has a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate up to 120 Hz—something that was reserved for only the Pro iPhones up until this year. The Air's display also has always-on functionality and claims 3,000 nits of peak brightness. It has Apple's new Ceramic Shield 2 protective coating on both the front and the back, which the company claims will make it more durable and anti-reflective.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/iphone-17-air-is-real-heres-whats-new-in-apples-extra-thin-handset/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—If you’re buying one of the new iPhones or the other hardware that Apple announced today, your new devices will ship with Apple’s latest operating system updates already installed. But if you’re not looking to spend a bunch of money on Apple’s latest and greatest, the new updates will land on Apple’s other supported devices on September 15.</p>
<p>Apple is shifting to a year-based numbering system starting this year, wiping away the previous grab bag of all-over-the-place version numbers. No corner of Apple’s ecosystem is going untouched: we’re getting iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and even version 26 of whatever Apple is calling the HomePod’s software these days, all on the same day.</p>
<p>The headliner across all of the updates is Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” UI overhaul, which adds glass-inspired transparency and translucency and bouncy animations throughout all of Apple’s software. Inspired in part by the way that UI elements in visionOS float over top of your real-world surroundings, Liquid Glass is Apple’s most comprehensive UI overhaul since the release of iOS 7 back in 2013.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/ios-26-ipados-26-macos-26-tahoe-and-apples-other-os-updates-launch-september-15/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—Apple's basic iPhone 17 is the one most people will use, and the new iPhone Air will get attention for its thin design and novelty. But the iPhone Pro series is still the absolute best the company has to offer, and that continues to be true of the new iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max that Apple announced today.</p>
<p>The new phones start at $1,099 and $1,199 for the Pro and Pro Max, respectively, each with 256GB of storage. Preorders start this Friday, and the phones will be available on September 19.</p>
<p>While the best feature of the iPhone 17 is its screen, the screens are virtually the only thing not to be overhauled for the iPhone 17 Pro, though they do get the more scratch-resistant, anti-reflective Ceramic Shield 2 coating. The new designs have a new aluminum unibody enclosure, with a glass cutout on the back to allow for wireless charging and a huge new camera bump that Apple calls the "camera plateau," stretching all the way across the back.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/apple-started-from-scratch-to-design-all-new-iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Apple Watch 11 is supposed to be able to alert users about "possible hypertension" by using data from an optical heart rate sensor "to analyze how a user’s blood vessels respond to the beats of the heart," per its announcement.</p>
<p>According to Apple's presentation, the smartwatch will look for chronic hypertension over 30-day periods. Apple's presentation noted that the Watch Series 11 won't be able to identify all hypertension, but the company said that it expects to notify over 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension during the feature's first year of availability.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/apple-adds-hypertension-and-sleep-quality-monitoring-to-watch-ultra-3-series-11/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—September means iPhones, and as expected, Apple has taken the wraps off a new iPhone 17 at its event today. The iPhone 17 will start at $799 for a 256GB model. Pre-orders start Friday, and the phones will be available on September 19.</p>
<p>The updated OLED screen is the hero of the iPhone 17, bringing several features to the base iPhone that the iPhone Pro has enjoyed for years. The iPhone 17 steps up from a 6.1-inch to a 6.3-inch display, the same increase that came to the iPhone 16 Pro last year, and Apple has also added 120 Hz ProMotion support to the basic iPhone for the first time.</p>

<p>The refresh rate adjusts dynamically based on what you're doing, and can go as low as 1 Hz in the low-power always-on display mode. Apple has also improved the scratch-resistance of the display with Ceramic Shield 2, which the company says is three times as scratch-resistant as the old screen. The screen can also hit 3,000 nits of peak outdoor brightness.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/apple-announces-iphone-17-with-bigger-6-3-inch-always-on-promotion-screen-a19-chip/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's popular AirPods Pro in-ear headphones are getting a substantial upgrade. The new model, dubbed AirPods Pro 3, greatly improves active noise cancellation (ANC), performs live translations, and tracks your heart rate like a fitness wearable.</p>
<p>This will have to be subjected to third-party testing, but Apple made some intriguing claims about AirPods Pro 3's performance during its iPhone and Apple Watch announcement today. Namely, that they'll have twice the ANC performance as AirPods Pro 2 and four times as much as the original AirPods Pro.</p>
<p>Additionally, Apple claims that voices will sound "more natural" in Transparency, the mode meant to allow nearby sounds to be heard even while you have the earbuds in. Those who've used earlier iterations of Transparency will likely note that voices can sound a little bit filtered, so that could be a nice-to-have improvement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/new-airpods-pro-3-turn-apples-earbuds-into-fitness-tracker-universal-translator/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>GirlsDoPorn owner Michael Pratt was sentenced to 27 years in prison yesterday after pleading guilty to sex trafficking charges. Pratt, who spent several years <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/girlsdoporn-founder-on-the-run-for-3-years-now-on-fbis-ten-most-wanted-list/">as a fugitive</a> before being arrested in Spain and extradited to the US, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/girlsdoporn-owner-michael-pratt-pleads-guilty-sex-trafficking">pleaded guilty in June</a> to a charge of sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion, and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.</p>
<p>"Pratt, the owner and operator of GirlsDoPorn.com and GirlsDoToys.com, built a multimillion-dollar criminal empire by luring young women into pornography through lies, coercion, and manipulation, and then broadcasting their abuse to millions online," the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/girlsdoporn-owner-michael-pratt-sentenced-27-years-sex-trafficking-hundreds-women">said yesterday</a> after the sentencing in US District Court for the Southern District of California.</p>
<p>The DOJ said Pratt "exploited hundreds of women," and that 40 of them spoke at the sentencing hearing. Pratt, 42, faced a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum of life in prison.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/girlsdoporn-owner-michael-pratt-gets-27-years-for-sex-trafficking-conspiracy/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At a hearing Monday, US District Judge William Alsup blasted a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/first-of-its-kind-ai-settlement-anthropic-to-pay-authors-1-5-billion/">proposed $1.5 billion settlement</a> over Anthropic's rampant piracy of books to train AI.</p>
<p>The proposed settlement comes in a case where Anthropic could have owed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-settles-copyright-lawsuit-authors/">more than $1 trillion</a> in damages after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/ai-industry-horrified-to-face-largest-copyright-class-action-ever-certified/">Alsup certified a class</a> that included up to 7 million claimants whose works were illegally downloaded by the AI company.</p>
<p>Instead, critics fear Anthropic will get off cheaply, striking a deal with authors suing that covers less than 500,000 works and paying a small fraction of its total valuation (currently <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation">$183 billion</a>) to get away with the massive theft. Defector <a href="https://defector.com/if-the-thieving-ai-company-can-survive-the-legal-settlement-then-it-is-not-big-enough">noted</a> that the settlement doesn't even require Anthropic to admit wrongdoing, while the company continues raising billions based on models trained on authors' works. Most recently, Anthropic raised $13 billion in a funding round, making back about 10 times the proposed settlement amount after announcing the deal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/judge-anthropics-1-5b-settlement-is-being-shoved-down-the-throat-of-authors/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nintendo-watchers may remember when little-known accessory-maker Genki <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/our-best-look-yet-at-the-switch-2s-expanded-size-and-snap-on-joy-cons/">showed the world an extremely accurate 3D-printed mockup of the Switch 2</a> in January, about a week before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">Nintendo's own "first look" teaser video</a> and months before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">the system's wider unveiling</a>. Now, in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.30.1.pdf">a newly filed settlement agreement,</a> Genki has agreed to pay Nintendo unspecified damages for "trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising" in connection with that promotional stunt.</p>
<p>The controversy started at the Consumer Electronics Show, where Genki showed off <a href="https://www.netzwelt.de/news/237827-nintendo-switch-2dummy-ces-angefasst-bestaetigt-geruechte.html">to press and attendees </a>a 3D mockup of the then-unseen Switch 2 sporting the company's accessories. Genki also <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories">posted a video</a> showing a detailed mockup of the system from various angles. By April, Genki was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/genkithings/photos/tune-in-on-tuesday-april-2nd-at-9-am-pt-12-pm-et-for-a-livestreamed-genki-direct/1172249991578512/">promoting a "Genki Direct" livestream</a> focused on "upcoming accessories for Genki Glitch 2" (no, that isn't a typo).</p>
<p>Nintendo's lawyers <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawyers-genki-switch-2-mockup-ces-2025/">reportedly visited Genki's CES booth</a> once reports of the Switch 2 mockup started going viral. But a Genki representative <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1878127444483584198">asserted at the time</a> that the company did not sign an NDA with Nintendo and therefore "has nothing to worry about."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/accessory-maker-will-pay-nintendo-after-showing-illicit-switch-2-mockups-at-ces/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It has often been said that <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/07/30/lawyer/">the lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client</a>. That truism apparently extends to Switch modders as well, at least in the case of Ryan Daly. The operator of the now-defunct moddedhardware.com (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504061109/https://www.moddedhardware.com/">archived</a>) now owes Nintendo $2 million after <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725.30.0.pdf">a recent settlement</a> filed in a Washington state District Court.</p>
<p>The final judgement, which was jointly agreed to by both parties, asserts that Daly knowingly sold devices such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/playing-personal-game-backups-could-get-your-switch-2-banned-by-nintendo/">the MIG Switch</a> and MIG Dumper that "are primarily designed for the purpose of circumventing the [technological protection measures, and] have limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent the TPMs." Daly also sold and installed mod chips to get around Switch DRM and "copied and distributed certain copyrighted Nintendo games to his customers," according to the judgment.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/accused-switch-modder-represents-himself-as-nintendo-lawsuit-moves-forward/">Nintendo's lawsuit</a> alleged that the company initially approached Daly about the sale of these devices in March 2024, and that Daly agreed at the time "both verbally and in signed writing" to refrain from further sales. After Daly continued to sell the devices, though, Nintendo took the further step of bringing this lawsuit last June.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/switch-modder-who-acted-as-his-own-lawyer-now-owes-nintendo-2-million/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A team of the world’s best ice and climate researchers studied a handful of recently publicized engineering concepts for protecting Earth’s polar ice caps and found that none of them are likely to work.</p>
<p>Their peer-reviewed research, published Tuesday, shows some of the untested ideas, such as dispersing particles in the atmosphere to dim sunlight or trying to refreeze ice sheets with pumped water, could have unintended and dangerous consequences.</p>
<p>The various speculative notions that have been floated, mainly via public relations efforts, include things such as spreading reflective particles over newly formed sea ice to promote its persistence and growth; building giant ocean-bottom sea walls or curtains to deflect warmer streams of water away from ice shelves; pumping water from the base of glaciers to the surface to refreeze it, and even intentionally polluting the upper atmosphere with sulfur-based or other reflective particles to dim sunlight.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/geoengineering-will-not-save-humankind-from-climate-change/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While tech companies market AI as a productivity tool for everyone, a UK government study reveals an unexpected result: Neurodiverse employees may be benefiting far more from chatbots than their neurotypical colleagues.</p>
<p>The UK's Department for Business and Trade recently <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68adbe409e1cebdd2c96a19d/dbt-microsoft-365-copilot-evaluation.pdf">released</a> evaluation results from its Microsoft 365 Copilot trial showing that while overall satisfaction was 72 percent, neurodiverse employees reported statistically higher satisfaction (at a 90 percent confidence level) and were more likely to recommend the tool (at a 95 percent confidence level) than other respondents.</p>
<p>"It's leveled the playing field," one participant with ADHD told researchers during follow-up interviews. One user with dyslexia said that the tool "empowered" them to perform tasks with confidence they previously lacked, particularly in report writing. Another dyslexic participant drew direct comparisons to existing accessibility software, noting that Copilot "does a hell of a lot more" than traditional assistive technology while being "embedded in your applications" rather than requiring separate programs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/study-finds-neurodiverse-workers-more-satisfied-with-ai-assistants/">Read full article</a></p>
