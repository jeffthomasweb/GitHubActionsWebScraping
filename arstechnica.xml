                            <![CDATA[<p><em>In 1965, Ted Nelson submitted a <a href="https://archive.org/details/hartoriginal1965/mode/2up">paper</a> to the Association for Computing Machinery. He wrote: “Let me introduce the word ‘hypertext’ to mean a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.” The paper was part of a grand vision he called Xanadu, after the poem by Samuel Coleridge. </em></p>
<p><em>A decade later, in his book “Dream Machines/Computer Lib,” he described Xanadu thusly: “To give you a screen in your home from which you can see into the world’s hypertext libraries.” He admitted that the world didn’t have any hypertext libraries yet, but that wasn’t the point. One day, maybe soon, it would. And he was going to dedicate his life to making it happen.</em></p>
<p>As the Internet grew, it became more and more difficult to find things on it. There were lots of cool documents like the <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/internet/hitchhik.gui">Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Internet</a>, but to read them, you first had to know where they were.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/a-history-of-the-internet-part-2-the-high-tech-gold-rush-begins/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The support list for macOS Tahoe still includes Intel Macs, but it's been whittled down to just four models, all released in 2019 or 2020. We speculated that this meant that the end was near for Intel Macs, and now we can confirm just <em>how</em> near it is: macOS Tahoe will be the last new macOS release to support any Intel Macs. All new releases starting with macOS 27 will require an Apple Silicon Mac.</p>
<p>Apple will provide additional security updates for Tahoe until fall 2028, two years after it is replaced with macOS 27. That's a typical schedule for older macOS versions, which all get one year of major point updates that include security fixes and new features, followed by two years of security-only updates to keep them patched but without adding significant new features.</p>
<p>Apple is also planning changes to Rosetta 2, the Intel-to-Arm app translation technology created to ease the transition between the Intel and Apple Silicon eras. Rosetta will continue to work as a general-purpose app translation tool in both macOS 26 and macOS 27.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apple-details-the-end-of-intel-mac-support-and-a-phaseout-for-rosetta-2/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Mercedes-Benz provided flights from Detroit to Stuttgart and accommodation so Ars could drive the GLC prototype at its test track. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>IMMENDINGEN, Germany—The Mercedes-Benz Testing and Technology Center in Immendingen, Germany, isn't a top-secret facility because of its location. It's top secret because of what happens on the 520 hectares of land. Its 62-kilometer track is where Mercedes engineers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/we-test-an-electric-mercedes-that-can-can-go-747-miles-on-a-single-charge/">can develop and hone</a> every new vehicle in conditions experienced all around the world. Experiencing those conditions in a prototype is why I was there on an annoyingly rainy day.</p>
<p>After receiving the tour in a new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, I settled into the driving seat of the all-new Mercedes-Benz GLC with EQ Technology—that's the electric one. Being a prototype, it was still wearing camouflage, and the interior was covered in black fabric, so I couldn't see everything. But I was assured that the ride, handling, and performance are all sorted. The infotainment software and interior details are still being finalized.</p>
<p>The upcoming GLC is slightly longer than its gasoline-powered counterpart to accommodate the 94.5 kWh battery pack. Mercedes is estimating 650 kilometers of range on the optimistic WLTP testing cycle. Based on some rough math, 330 miles on the EPA cycle seems about right.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/mercedes-next-electric-glc-rides-great-weve-driven-the-prototype/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Apple announced a series of incremental Apple Intelligence updates at its annual <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>, focusing on practical features like live phone call translation and visual search rather than the ambitious <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/google-deepmind-releases-its-plan-to-keep-agi-from-running-wild/">race for AI breakthroughs</a> that rivals have been promoting.</p>
<p>Notably absent was any concrete update on the much-needed "more personalized" Siri that Apple first announced at last year's WWDC but has yet to demo publicly or provide specifics about. (Siri still feels woefully outdated after using ChatGPT's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a>, for example.)</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/what-to-expect-from-apples-worldwide-developers-conference-next-week/">WWDC keynote preview</a> from last week, we pointed out that Apple has faced intense pressure to deliver on AI after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/">overpromising features</a> it wasn't ready to launch—a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/despite-unforced-errors-the-future-of-apple-intelligence-could-be-bright/">controversy</a> that led to an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-reportedly-planning-executive-shake-up-to-address-siri-delays/">executive reshuffle</a> of those handling Apple's AI efforts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/apple-tiptoes-with-modest-ai-updates-while-rivals-race-ahead/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, the chief executive of Blue Origin, Dave Limp, convened an all-hands meeting for the more than 12,000 employees at the company. Among the most critical items he discussed was the launch rate for the New Glenn rocket and how the company would fall significantly short of its goal for this year.</p>
<p>Before 2025 began, Limp had set expectations alongside Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos: New Glenn would launch eight times this year.</p>
<p>However, since the rocket's mostly successful debut in January, five months have passed. At one point the company targeted "late spring" for the second launch of the rocket. However, on Monday, Limp acknowledged on social media that the rocket's next flight will now no longer take place until at least August 15. Although he did not say so, this may well be the only other New Glenn launch this year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/second-new-glenn-launch-slips-toward-fall-as-program-leadership-departs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Every year, Apple releases new versions of iOS and iPadOS, and most years those updates also end support for a handful of devices that are too old or too slow or otherwise incapable of running the new software.</p>
<p>Though this year's macOS 26 Tahoe release was unkind to Intel Macs, the iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 releases are more generous, dropping support for just two iPhone models and a single iPad. The iOS 26 update won't run on 2018's iPhone XR or XS, and iPadOS 26 won't run on 2019's 7th-generation iPad. Any other device that can currently run iOS or iPadOS 18 will be able to upgrade to the new versions and pick up the new Liquid Glass look, among other features.</p>

<p>Apple never provides explicit reasoning for why it drops the devices it drops, though they can usually be explained by some combination of age and technical capability. The 7th-gen iPad, for example, was still using a 2017-vintage Apple A10X chip despite being introduced a number of years later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/ios-and-ipados-26-will-run-on-most-things-that-support-ios-and-ipados-18/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>A <a href="https://spaceforcestarshipeis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Draft-SpaceX-Starship-Super-Heavy-CCSFS-Environmental-Impact-Statement.pdf">draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)</a> released this week by the Department of the Air Force, which includes the Space Force, found SpaceX's planned use of Space Launch Complex 37 (SLC-37) at Cape Canaveral would have no significant negative impacts on local environmental, historical, social, and cultural interests. The Air Force also found SpaceX's plans at SLC-37 will have no significant impact on the company's competitors in the launch industry.</p>
<p>The Defense Department is leading the environmental review and approval process for SpaceX to take over the launch site, which the Space Force previously leased to United Launch Alliance, one of SpaceX's chief rivals in the US launch industry.

The macOS 26 update will support just four Intel Macs, all released in 2019 or 2020, and it entirely drops support for all Intel versions of the MacBook Air and Mac mini.</p>
<p>Other models that run the current macOS 15 Sequoia release that <em>won't</em> support macOS Tahoe include all 15-inch MacBook Pros, all 13-inch MacBook Pros with two Thunderbolt ports, and the 4K and 5K versions of the 2019 iMac.</p>

<p>Apple has generally been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-case-for-and-against-macos-15-sequoia-being-the-final-release-for-intel-macs/">pulling support for new macOS releases</a> from Intel Macs more aggressively than it was in the mid-to-late 2010s, giving most systems six-ish years of new macOS releases followed by another two years of security updates. Some models fared better than others; for example, Intel MacBook Air models have been getting dropped more aggressively than MacBook Pros.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/macos-tahoe-signals-that-the-end-is-near-for-intel-macs-dumping-all-but-four-models/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>visionOS 26 will reach Vision Pro users later this year, and it focuses on refining the focus of the device based on how users are actually using it rather than whatever wild ideas the company had during its initial development—including addressing common complaints about how the Vision Pro doesn't support some features of popular competing mixed-reality headsets.</p>
<p>For example, the headset will soon support native playback of 3D video recorded by people other than Apple and downloaded from anywhere on the Internet—something you had to use a few, somewhat janky third-party apps to do until now, but which is an easier-to-access feature of some other mixed-reality headsets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/06/visionos-26-adds-a-plethora-of-features-that-were-already-on-other-headsets/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple unveiled the next version of macOS today during the Worldwide Developers Conference. Codenamed Tahoe, macOS 26 gets a visual refresh with the same "Liquid Glass" look that Apple is introducing across all of its operating systems this year. Apple has also changed the version number, jumping directly from version 14 to version 26 as it shifts to unified year-based version numbering across all of its operating systems.</p>
<p>Liquid Glass goes all-in on translucency and transparency, changing the look of icons and windows across the operating system. Most significantly, the macOS menu bar has become entirely invisible, and the Control Center has adopted a new, glassy, translucent appearance. The same color-tinting customization features available on iOS and iPadOS are coming to the Mac this year, giving users multiple customization options on top of the standard light and dark modes and accent colors.</p>

<p>The new look will probably define the release in the minds of most users, but it's bringing the standard handful of new features and refinements across the built-in apps. For the Finder, folders can be customized with colors and emoji labels to help them stand out from a big list of folders.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apples-macos-26-tahoe-has-new-liquid-glass-look-customizable-folders-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At its Worldwide Developer Conference today, Apple unveiled a new iOS Games App that Apple Senior Director of Marketplace Platforms and Technologies Ann Thai promoted as "a new destination to help you get more out of your games."</p>
<p>The most relevant new social feature in the app comes in the "Play Together" tab, which provides a quick look at what your friends are playing on iOS. That tab will also integrate a new Challenges feature, which game developers can use to turn single-player games into score-based competitions between friends. These interpersonal Challenges come on top of the standard game leaderboards already common through iOS's Game Center, allowing for a new way to compete socially.</p>
<p>Other than that, the new Games app seems to consolidate several features that were previously split between <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/gaming-on-apple-platforms-is-set-for-some-big-changes-here-are-a-few/">Game Center</a> and the App Store. On the Home tab, the Games app will let you see games with new update, time-sensitive in-game events, and recommendations for new games to try. A Library tab will show every iOS game you've ever downloaded in a single place, while the Apple Arcade tab shows subscribers what's available to download. The Games app will work in both portrait and landscape mode and be navigable via controller.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/apple-consolidates-ios-gaming-features-in-new-games-app/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>YouTube videos may be getting a bit more pernicious soon. Google's dominant video platform has spent years removing discriminatory and conspiracy content from its platform in accordance with its usage guidelines, but the site is now reportedly adopting a lighter-touch approach to moderation. A higher bar for content removal will allow more potentially inflammatory content to remain up in the "public interest."</p>
<p>YouTube has previously attracted the ire of conservatives for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/youtube-cracks-down-on-qanon-conspiracists/">removal of QAnon and anti-vaccine content</a>. According to The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/technology/youtube-videos-content-moderation.html">New York Times</a>, YouTube's content moderators have been provided with new guidelines and training on how to handle the deluge of provocative content on the platform. The changes urge reviewers to pull back on removing certain videos, a continuation of a trend not just at YouTube, but on numerous platforms that host user-created content.</p>
<p>Beginning late last year, YouTube began informing moderators they should err on the side of caution when removing videos that are in the public interest. That includes user uploads that discuss issues like elections, race, gender, sexuality, abortion, immigration, and censorship. Previously, YouTube's policy told moderators to remove videos if one-quarter or more of the content violated policies. Now, the exception cutoff has been increased to half. In addition, staff are now told to bring issues to managers if they are uncertain rather than removing the content themselves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/youtube-adopts-looser-moderation-policy-for-videos-about-elections-gender-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At the Worldwide Developers Conference today, Apple unveiled iOS 26, its next iPhone operating system (OS), which is centered on Apple's new Liquid Glass design for its software platform.</p>
<p>Available across Apple's other upcoming OSes, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apples-macos-26-tahoe-has-new-liquid-glass-look-customizable-folders-and-more/">macOS 26 Tahoe</a>, Liquid Glass aims to make the software look and operate as if it has glass edges. You can see this approach throughout iOS 26 in things like the app icon's appearance, which includes softer edges and the option to be translucent.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court allowed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to access Social Security Administration (SSA) records on Friday, overturning lower-court decisions that imposed some limits on DOGE's data access.</p>
<p>"We conclude that, under the present circumstances, SSA may proceed to afford members of the SSA DOGE Team access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work," the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1063_6j37.pdf">order</a> said. The court also sided with the Trump administration in a different DOGE case, finding that a lower court's discovery order requiring DOGE to provide information about its government cost-cutting operations was too broad (more on that ruling later in this article).</p>
<p>The data-access ruling was in a case filed by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the Alliance for Retired Americans; and American Federation of Teachers. US District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/judge-orders-musk-and-doge-to-delete-personal-data-taken-from-social-security/">issued a preliminary injunction</a>, writing that DOGE "is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion." The District of Maryland judge found that plaintiffs are likely to win their case alleging that the government violated the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/supreme-court-gives-doge-unfettered-access-to-sensitive-social-security-data/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, acting FAA <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Administrator Chris Rocheleau <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CIYNZJoosc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the House Appropriations Committee that the Federal Aviation Administration plans to replace its aging air traffic control systems, which</span> still rely on floppy disks and Windows 95 computers, Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/the-faa-seeks-to-eliminate-floppy-disk-usage-in-air-traffic-control-systems">reports</a>. The agency has issued a Request For Information to gather proposals from companies willing to tackle the massive infrastructure overhaul.</p>
<p>"The whole idea is to replace the system. No more floppy disks or paper strips," Rocheleau said during the committee hearing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the project "the most important infrastructure project that we've had in this country for decades," describing it as a bipartisan priority.</p>
<p>Most air traffic control towers and facilities across the US currently operate with technology that seems frozen in the 20th century, although that isn't necessarily a bad thing—when it works. Some controllers currently use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_progress_strip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper strips</a> to track aircraft movements and transfer data between systems using floppy disks, while their computers run Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/windows-95-turns-20-and-ars-reminisces-on-a-simpler-age-long-gone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows 95</a> operating system, which launched in 1995.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/faa-to-retire-floppy-disks-and-windows-95-amid-air-traffic-control-overhaul/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>One weakness of Valve's Steam Deck gaming handheld and SteamOS is that, by default, they will only run Windows games from Steam that are supported by the platform's Proton compatibility layer (plus the subset of games that run natively on Linux). It's possible to install alternative game stores, and Proton's compatibility is generally impressive, but SteamOS still isn't a true drop-in replacement for Windows.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Asus' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">co-developed ROG Xbox Ally</a> is trying to offer PC gamers a more comprehensive compatibility solution that also preserves a SteamOS-like handheld UI by putting a new Xbox-branded user interface on top of traditional Windows. And while this interface will roll out to the ROG Xbox Ally first, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">told The Verge</a> that the interface would come to other Ally handhelds next and that something "similar" would be "rolling out to other Windows handhelds starting next year."</p>
<p>Bringing a Steam Deck-style handheld-optimized user interface to Windows is something Microsoft has been experimenting with internally since at least 2022, when employees at an internal hackathon identified most of Windows' handheld deficiencies in a slide deck about a proposed "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/handheld-mode-for-windows-could-make-it-work-better-on-steam-deck-style-pcs/">Windows Handheld Mode</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/full-screen-xbox-handheld-ui-is-coming-to-all-windows-pcs-starting-next-year/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"We are compelled to speak up when our leadership <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5381022/rfk-hhs-layoffs-restructuring-trump-budget">prioritizes political momentum</a> over <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/trump-nih-clinical-trials-patient-safey/682217/">human safety</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/are-terminations-nih-grants-wasting-billions-taxpayer-dollars">faithful stewardship of public resources</a>," the letter states, linking to independent news reports on the harms of NIH trials being halted and that the administration's cuts to the agency have cost, rather than saved, taxpayer money. Since January, the Trump administration has terminated 2,100 NIH research grants totaling around $9.5 billion and $2.6 billion in contracts, the letter notes. The researchers also accuse the administration of creating "a culture of fear and suppression" among federal researchers.</p>
<p>The letter describes the researchers' action as "dissent" from the administration's policies, quoting NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya in his congressional confirmation hearing as saying, "Dissent is the very essence of science."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/culture-of-fear-and-suppression-nih-staff-speak-out-against-trump-admin/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The protesters in Los Angeles were outraged after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/los-angeles-trump-immigration">ICE, using brutal tactics, began detaining people</a> in raids across the city. Thousands of Angelenos took to the streets over the weekend to confront the masked federal enforcers and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/los-angeles-protester-throws-large-rocks-at-ice-cars-as-officials-arrest-locals-in-paramount-watch-101749331032908.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced them away</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/robotaxis-burn-in-los-angeles-in-backlash-to-immigration-raids/">Read full article</a></p>
