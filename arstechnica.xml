<p>A key aspect of humans' evolutionary success is the fact that we don't have to learn how to do things from scratch. Our societies have developed various ways—from formal education to YouTube videos—to convey what others have learned. This makes learning how to do things far easier than learning by doing, and it gives us more space to experiment; we can learn to build new things or handle tasks more efficiently, then pass information on how to do so on to others.</p>
<p>Some of our closer relatives, like chimps and bonobos, learn from their fellow species-members. They don't seem to engage in this iterative process of improvement—they don't, in technical terms, have a cumulative culture where new technologies are built on past knowledge. So, when did humans develop this ability?</p>
<p>Based on a new analysis of stone toolmaking, two researchers are arguing that the ability is relatively recent, dating to just 600,000 years ago. That's roughly the same time our ancestors and the Neanderthals went their separate ways.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032454#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032454&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Meta got hit Tuesday with a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smith-v-Meta-Complaint-6-18-2024.pdf">lawsuit</a> alleging that the company knowingly overlooks sexist treatment of female employees. That includes an apparent practice of hiring and promoting less qualified men to roles over more qualified female applicants.</p>
<p>The complaint was filed in a US district court in New York by Jeffrey Smith, an engineer who joined Meta in 2018. Smith alleged that Meta was on the brink of promoting him when suddenly his "upward trajectory stopped" after he started speaking up about allegedly misogynistic management practices at Meta.</p>
<p>Smith claimed that instead of a promotion, his Meta manager, Sacha Arnaud, suggested that he resign shortly after delivering Smith's first-ever negative performance review, which reduced his bonus payout and impacted his company stock. Smith has alleged he suffered emotional distress and economic injury due to this alleged retaliation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032420#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032420&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Sunday, Runway announced a new AI video synthesis model called <a href="https://runwayml.com/blog/introducing-gen-3-alpha/">Gen-3 Alpha</a> that's still under development, but it appears to create video of similar quality to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">OpenAI's Sora</a>, which debuted earlier this year (and has also not yet been released). It can generate novel, high-definition video from text prompts that range from realistic humans to surrealistic monsters stomping the countryside.</p>

<p>Unlike Runway's <a href="https://research.runwayml.com/gen2">previous best model</a> from June 2023, which could only create two-second-long clips, Gen-3 Alpha can reportedly create 10-second-long video segments of people, places, and things that have a consistency and coherency that easily surpasses Gen-2. If 10 seconds sounds short compared to Sora's full minute of video, consider that the company is working with a shoestring budget of compute compared to more lavishly funded OpenAI—and actually has a history of shipping video generation capability to commercial users.</p>
<p>Gen-3 Alpha does not generate audio to accompany the video clips, and it's highly likely that temporally coherent generations (those that keep a character consistent over time) are dependent on <a href="https://x.com/bcmerchant/status/1758537510618304669">similar high-quality training material</a>. But Runway's improvement in visual fidelity over the past year is difficult to ignore.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032130#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032130&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T is imposing $10 and $20 monthly price hikes on users of older unlimited wireless plans starting in August 2024, the company <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1483936">announced</a>. The single-line price of these 10 "retired" plans will increase by $10 per month, while customers with multiple lines on a plan will be hit with a total monthly increase of $20.</p>
<p>"If you have a single line of service on your plan, your monthly plan charge will increase by $10. If you have multiple lines on your plan, your monthly plan charge will increase by a total of $20. This is the total monthly increase, not per line increase," AT&amp;T said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has offered a dizzying array of "unlimited" data plans over the years, all with different limits and perks. While unlimited plans let customers avoid overage fees, speeds can be slowed once customers hit their high-speed data limit. There are also limits on the usage of hotspot data.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032366#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032366&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Fisker, the second EV firm started by legendary BMW and Aston Martin designer Henrik Fisker, has filed for bankruptcy and intends to sell its assets and restructure its debt. The almost inevitable outcome comes months after it paused manufacturing amid cash flow shortages, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/troubled-ev-maker-fisker-faces-new-federal-probe-for-phantom-braking/">safety probes</a>, and devastating reviews of its only product, the Fisker Ocean SUV.</p>
<p>Fisker's <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/cghen8gr8e1n/6W19OiEBJDVIFVEmo4feHA/df902c5cb2b067251a300efb0b35f611/Fisker-Filing-FINAL.pdf">statement about the filing</a> notes the firm's production of the Ocean "twice as fast as expected in the auto industry" and delivering "the most sustainable vehicle in the world." However, a Fisker spokesperson writes, "[L]ike other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently."</p>
<p>Rumors of Fisker's bankruptcy have been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/electric-vehicle-startup-fisker-prepares-for-possible-bankruptcy-filing-26e63d32">circulating</a> since March when the company <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fisker-suspends-electric-vehicle-production/">suspended production of its Ocean</a> for initially six weeks and then indefinitely. A month earlier, the company reported $273 million in 2023 sales but more than $1 billion in debt. Fisker's stock was <a href="https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2024/NYSE-to-Commence-Delisting-Proceedings-Against-Fisker-Inc.-FSR/default.aspx">pulled from the New York Stock Exchange</a> in late March. Amid what many saw as a generalized weakening of EV demand, Fisker was particularly vulnerable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032294#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032294&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two men have pleaded guilty to charges of computer intrusion and aggravated identity theft tied to their theft of records from a law enforcement database for use in doxxing and extorting multiple individuals.</p>
<p>Sagar Steven Singh, 20, and Nicholas Ceraolo, 26, admitted to being members of ViLE, a group that specializes in obtaining personal information of individuals and using it to extort or harass them. Members use various methods to collect social security numbers, cell phone numbers, and other personal data and post it, or threaten to post it, to a website administered by the group. Victims had to pay to have their information removed or kept off the website. Singh pled guilty on Monday, June 17, and Ceraolo pled guilty on May 30.</p>
<h2>Impersonating a police officer</h2>
<p>The men gained access to the law enforcement portal by stealing the password of an officer’s account and using it to log in. The portal, maintained by an unnamed US federal law enforcement agency, was restricted to members of various law enforcement agencies to share intelligence from government databases with state and local officials. The site provided access to detailed nonpublic records involving narcotics and currency seizures and to law enforcement intelligence reports.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032310#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032310&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Elon Musk is still frantically pushing to launch X payment services in the US by the end of 2024, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-18/documents-show-how-musk-s-x-plans-to-become-the-next-venmo">reported</a> Tuesday.</p>
<p>Launching payment services is arguably one of the reasons why Musk paid so much to acquire Twitter in 2022. His rebranding of the social platform into X revives <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/fast-moving-musk-makes-very-slow-progress-turning-twitter-into-everything-app/">a former dream he had as a PayPal co-founder </a>who fought and failed to name the now-ubiquitous payments app X. Musk has told X staff that transforming the company into a payments provider would be critical to achieving his goal of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/elon-musks-improbable-path-to-making-x-an-everything-app/">turning X into a so-called everything app</a> "within three to five years."</p>
<p>Late last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/elon-musk-wants-your-entire-financial-life-on-x-by-2024/">Musk said it would "blow" his "mind"</a> if X didn't roll out payments by the end of 2024, so Bloomberg's report likely comes as no big surprise to Musk's biggest fans who believe in his vision. At that time, Musk said he wanted X users' "entire financial lives" on the platform before 2024 ended, and a Bloomberg review of "more than 350 pages of documents and emails related to money transmitter licenses that X Payments submitted in 11 states" shows approximately how close he is to making that dream a reality on his platform.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032306#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032306&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, during our inaugural Ars Live event, Quilty Space director of research Caleb Henry joined Ars space editor Eric Berger for a discussion of SpaceX's Starlink and other satellite internet systems. We discussed Starlink's rapid road to profitability—it took just five years from the first launch of operational satellites—and the future of the technology.</p>
<p>One of the keys to Starlink's success is its vertical integration as a core business at SpaceX, which operates the world's only reusable rocket, the Falcon 9. This has allowed the company not just to launch a constellation of 6,000 satellites—but to do so at relatively low cost.</p>
<p>"At one point, SpaceX had publicly said that it was $28 million," Henry said of the company's target for a Falcon 9 launch cost. "We believe today that they are below $20 million per launch and actually lower than that... I would put it in the mid teens for how much it costs them internally. And that's going down as they increase the reuse of the vehicle. Recently, they've launched their 20th, maybe 21st, use of a first-stage rocket. And as they can amortize the cost of the booster over a greater number of missions, that only helps them with their business case."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032253#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032253&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA and Boeing will take an additional four days to review all available data about the performance of the Starliner spacecraft before clearing the vehicle to return to Earth, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Based on the new schedule, which remains pending ahead of final review meetings later this week, Starliner would undock at 10:10 pm ET on Tuesday, June 25, from the International Space Station (02:10 UTC on June 26). This would set up a landing at 4:51 ET on June 26 (08:51 UTC) at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico.</p>
<p>During a news conference on Tuesday, the program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Steve Stich, said the four-day delay in the spacecraft's return would "give our team a little bit more time to look at the data, do some analysis, and make sure we're really ready to come home."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032204#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032204&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-suspends-work-on-next-high-end-headset-focused-on-releasing-cheaper-model-in-late-2025">report by tech news site The Information</a> suggests that Apple is shifting its augmented reality priorities. The next high-end version of the Vision Pro has purportedly been canceled while work continues on a more affordable version with a reduced feature set.</p>
<p>Citing both an employee in Apple's headset supply chain and one working in headset manufacturing for Apple, the report claims that the cheaper Vision product—perhaps around the $1,600 mark—is due before the end of 2025. Apple had originally intended to present this headset alongside the Vision Pro, similar to the models available in each iPhone release. The more affordable model would likely have fewer cameras, smaller speakers, and weigh less, though Apple has struggled to bring down the cost of the unit's displays.</p>
<p>Apple's efforts in augmented reality are closely watched by other players in the headset space, so even a momentary, situational step back from high-end headsets could have significant repercussions. The Information cites current and former Meta employees in describing how the company had killed plans for its own higher-end headset in January 2023, but it then began work on a new premium model five months after Apple's Vision Pro debut.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032241#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032241&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the vast majority of compatible PCs, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/microsoft-starts-testing-windows-11-24h2-as-this-years-big-update-takes-shape/">Microsoft’s Windows 11 24H2 update</a> still isn’t officially available as anything other than a preview (a revised version of the update is available to Windows Insiders again <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/microsoft-pulls-release-preview-build-of-windows-11-24h2-after-recall-controversy/">after briefly being pulled early last week</a>).

<p>For now, this means a bifurcated Windows 11 install base: one (the vast majority) that’s still mostly on version 23H2 and one (a tiny, Arm-powered minority) that’s running 24H2.</p>
<p>Although Microsoft hasn’t been specific about its release plans for Windows 11 24H2 to the wider user base, most PCs should still start getting the update later this fall. The Copilot+ parts won’t run on those current PCs, but they’ll still get new features and benefit from Microsoft’s work on the operating system’s underpinnings.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032110#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032110&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>T-Mobile has agreed to change its advertising for the "Price Lock" guarantee that doesn't actually lock in a customer's price, but continues to defend the offer.</p>
<p>T-Mobile users expressed their displeasure about being hit with up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/t-mobile-imposes-5-monthly-price-hike-on-customers-using-older-plans/">$5 per-line price hikes on plans</a> that seemed to have a lifetime price guarantee, but it was a challenge by AT&amp;T that forced T-Mobile to agree to change its advertising. AT&amp;T filed the challenge with the advertising industry's self-regulatory group, which ruled that T-Mobile's Price Lock ads were misleading.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/t-mobile-users-thought-they-had-a-lifetime-price-lock-guess-what-happened-next/">As we've reported</a>, T-Mobile's guarantee (currently called "Price Lock" and previously the "Un-contract") is simply a promise that T-Mobile will pay your final month's bill if the carrier raises your price and you decide to cancel. Despite that, T-Mobile promised users that it "will never change the price you pay" if you're on a plan with the provision.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032223#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032223&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Japanese telecommunications giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group">SoftBank</a> recently <a href="https://www.softbank.jp/en/sbnews/entry/20240607_01">announced</a> that it has been developing "emotion-canceling" technology powered by AI that will alter the voices of angry customers to sound calmer during phone calls with customer service representatives. The project aims to reduce the psychological burden on operators suffering from harassment and has been in development for three years. Softbank plans to launch it by March 2026, but the idea is receiving mixed reactions online.</p>

<p>According to a report from the Japanese news site <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15300914">The Asahi Shimbun</a>, SoftBank's project relies on an AI model to alter the tone and pitch of a customer's voice in real-time during a phone call. SoftBank's developers, led by employee Toshiyuki Nakatani, trained the system using a dataset of over 10,000 voice samples, which were performed by 10 Japanese actors expressing more than 100 phrases with various emotions, including yelling and accusatory tones.</p>
<p>Voice cloning and synthesis technology has made massive strides in the past three years. We've previously covered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">technology from Microsoft</a> that can clone a voice with a three-second audio sample and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/make-a-bathroom-sound-like-a-pro-audio-booth-with-adobes-free-ai-tool/">audio-processing technology</a> from Adobe that cleans up audio by re-synthesizing a person's voice, so SoftBank's technology is well within the realm of plausibility.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032137#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032137&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has abruptly discontinued its "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) service, Apple Pay Later, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/apple-pay-later-turns-apple-into-a-full-on-money-lender/">turned Apple into a money lender</a> when it launched last March in the US and became widely available in October.</p>
<p>The service previously allowed users to split the cost of purchases of up to $1,000 into four installments that were repaid over six weeks without worrying about extra fees or paying interest. For Apple, it was likely a move to increase total Apple Pay users as the company sought to offer more core financial services through its devices.</p>
<p>Now, it appears that Apple has found a different route to offer short-term loans at checkout in Apple Pay. An Apple spokesperson <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/17/apple-pay-later-united-states-ending/">told 9to5Mac</a> that the decision to end Apple Pay Later came ahead of the company's plan to start offering new types of installment loans globally.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032164#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032164&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpkZB-BaFJ4?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Artist’s animation of the black hole at the center of SDSS1335+0728 awakening in real time—a first for astronomers. </p></div>
<p>In December 2019, astronomers were surprised to observe a long-quiet galaxy, 300 million light-years away, suddenly come alive, emitting ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light into space. Far from quieting down again, by February of this year, the galaxy had begun emitting X-ray light; it is becoming <em>more</em> active. Astronomers think it is most likely an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus" data-uri="a89d2d3e16b582597a98ea55b254cc5c">active galactic nucleus</a> (AGN), which gets its energy from supermassive black holes at the galaxy's center and/or from the black hole's spin. That's the conclusion of a <a href="https://aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202347957">new paper</a> accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, although the authors acknowledge the possibility that it might also be some kind of rare <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/black-hole-belches-out-remnants-of-gobbled-star-years-after-initial-meal/">tidal disruption event</a> (TDE).</p>
<p>The brightening of SDSS1335_0728 in the constellation Virgo, after decades of quietude, was first detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility telescope. Its supermassive black hole is estimated to be about 1 million solar masses. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, the authors combed through archival data and combined that with data from new observations from various instruments, including <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/x-shooter/">the X-shooter</a>, part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Telescope">Very Large Telescope</a> (VLT) in Chile's Atacama Desert.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why a normally quiet galaxy might suddenly brighten, including supernovae or a TDE, in which part of the shredded star's original mass is ejected violently outward. This, in turn, can form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk" data-uri="f722f480fd2d1ab2c88c265811454cae">accretion disk</a> around the black hole that emits powerful X-rays and visible light. But these events don't last nearly five years—usually not more than a few hundred days.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031926#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031926&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[2025 release could launch on the still-mysterious "Switch 2."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap">

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMAgmdR8jwU?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>It has now been almost exactly seven years since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">Nintendo first announced <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and over five years since the company said it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/nintendo-throws-out-metroid-prime-4-work-restarts-with-retro-studios/">restarting work on the game</a> with series mainstay Retro Studios. Now, Nintendo has finally shared the first glimpse of gameplay for the renamed <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which is now planned for a 2025 release.</p>
<p>"After a very long time, we are finally able to share more information about this title," Nintendo executive Shinya Takahashi said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM">today's livestreamed Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, showing a remarkable talent for understatement. Takahashi went on to also ask that fans "please wait a little bit longer" for additional information before the game's planned release next year.</p>
<p>That "additional information" should include whether the highly anticipated game will launch for the Switch—as was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">promised in 2017</a>—or for Nintendo's next console, which the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/">recently teased via a pre-announcement announcement</a>. Nintendo <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1802702745276662114">kept its promise</a> that "there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor" during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, but a major first-party franchise game launching in 2025 definitely seems well-positioned to serve as a showcase for new hardware that Nintendo seems to be planning for around the same time frame.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032147#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032147&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Over more than 200 hours, I ate up the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-trailer-gives-us-more-elden-ring-lore-to-get-wrong/">cryptic lore</a>, learned lots of timings, and came to appreciate the feeling of achievement through perseverance.</p>
<p>Months ago, in preparation for <em>Elden Ring's</em> expansion, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> (also on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA04610_00-ELDENRINGDLC0000">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9n5p5sc2rz7k">Xbox, </a>arriving June 21), I ditched the save file with which I had beaten the game and started over. I wanted to try out big swords and magic casting. I wanted to try a few new side quests. And I wanted to have a fresh experience with the game before <em>Shadow</em> arrived.</p>
<p>I have had a <em>very</em> fresh experience, in that this DLC has made me feel like I'm still in the first hour of my first game. Reader, this expansion is mopping the floor with me. It looked at my resume, which has "Elden Lord" as its most recent job title, and has tossed it into the slush pile. If you're wondering whether <em>Shadow</em> would, like <em>Elden Ring</em>, provide <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">a different kind of challenge</a> and offer, like the base game, easier paths for <em>Souls</em> newcomers: No, not really. At least not until you're already far along. This DLC is for people who beat <em>Elden Ring</em>, or all but beat it, and want capital-M More.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031994#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031994&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hackers who stole terabytes of data <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/snowflake-breach-advanced-auto-parts-lendingtree/">from Ticketmaster and other customers of the cloud storage firm Snowflake</a> claim they obtained access to some of the Snowflake accounts by first breaching a Belarusian-founded contractor that works with those customers.</p>
<p>About 165 customer accounts were potentially affected in the recent hacking campaign targeting Snowflake’s customers, but only a few of these have been identified so far. In addition to Ticketmaster, the banking firm <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6ppv06e3n8o">Santander</a> has also acknowledged that their data was stolen but declined to identify the account from which it was stolen. Wired, however, has independently confirmed that it was a Snowflake account; the stolen data included bank account details for 30 million customers, including 6 million account numbers and balances, 28 million credit card numbers, and human resources information about staff, according to a post published by the hackers. Lending Tree and Advance Auto Parts have also said they might be victims as well.</p>
<p>Snowflake has not revealed details about how the hackers accessed the accounts, saying only that the intruders did not directly breach Snowflake’s network. This week, Google-owned security firm Mandiant, one of the companies engaged by Snowflake to investigate the breaches, revealed in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion">a blog post</a> that in some cases the hackers first obtained access through third-party contractors, without identifying the contractors or stating how this access aided the hackers in breaching the Snowflake accounts.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032105#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032105&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the Intel Mac era has wound down over the last couple of years, we've been painstakingly tracking the amount of software support that each outgoing model is getting. We did this to establish, with over 20 years' worth of hard data, whether Intel Mac owners were getting short shrift as Apple shifted its focus to Apple Silicon hardware and to software that leveraged Apple Silicon-exclusive capabilities.</p>
<p>So far, we've found that owners of Intel Macs made in the mid-to-late 2010s are definitely getting fewer major macOS updates and fewer years' worth of security updates than owners of Intel Macs made in the late 2000s and early 2010s but that these systems are still getting more generous support than old PowerPC Macs did after Apple switched to Intel's processors.</p>
<p>The good news with the macOS 15 Sequoia release is that Apple is dropping very few Intel Mac models this year, a much-needed pause that slows the steady acceleration of support-dropping we've seen over the last few macOS releases.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028991#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028991&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ryan Gosling plays a Hollywood stuntman in the new action comedy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/watch-ryan-gosling-and-the-fall-guy-stuntmen-have-fun-with-carpool-karaoke/"><em>The Fall Guy</em></a>, a loose adaptation of the popular 1980s TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_Guy">of the same name</a> starring Lee Majors. Gosling even did a few of his own stunts, although professional stunt performers handled the most dangerous sequences. It's their job to assume the risk so the stars don't get injured but that can translate into a high rate of head injuries in particular. According to <a href="https://occup-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12995-024-00401-0">a study</a> published in the Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology, a significant fraction of stunt performers never report such injuries, largely because it's a competitive industry, and they are afraid of losing work. The impacts can lead to more serious cognitive issues later in life.</p>
<p>“Many stunt performers are afraid to report their injuries, especially head trauma, in fear they will be put on a do-not-hire list or looked at as a liability,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1047768">said co-author Jeffrey Russell</a> of Ohio University. “The more injuries or trauma, the harder it may be to find work. But that should not be how it is; production companies and their unions should be ensuring stunt performers are taken care of and not reprimanded for any injuries sustained on the job.”</p>
<p>The work builds on Russell's prior research, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9835670/#:~:text=One%20hundred%20seventy%2Dthree%20performers,working%20with%20concussion%2Dlike%20symptoms.">published last year</a>, looking at the prevalence of head trauma and concussion in stunt performers and how well such injuries are managed. The prevalence of such injuries means that stunt performers are at high risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)—a degenerative brain disease associated with a history of repetitive head impacts that is a cause of much concern in collision sports like football and ice hockey—over the course of their careers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030783#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030783&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
