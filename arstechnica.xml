              <![CDATA[<p>The US Commerce Department announced Thursday it is easing restrictions on exports of space-related technology, answering a yearslong call from space companies to reform regulations governing international trade.</p>
<p>This is the most significant update to space-related export regulations in a decade and opens more opportunities for US companies to sell their satellite hardware abroad.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about this rollout," a senior Commerce official said during a background call with reporters. "It’s been a long time coming, and I think it’s going to be very meaningful for our national security and foreign policy interests and certainly facilitate secure trade with our partners."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/biden-administration-curtails-controls-on-some-space-related-exports/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's been a big year for Windows running on Arm chips, something that Microsoft and Arm chipmakers have been trying to get off the ground for well over a decade. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are at the heart of dozens of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">Copilot+ Windows PCs</a>, which promise unique AI features and good battery life without as many of the app and hardware compatibility problems that have plagued Windows-on-Arm in the past.</p>
<p>Part of the initial wave of Copilot+ PCs was a single desktop, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/snapdragon-dev-kit-for-windows-is-a-next-gen-mini-desktop-with-snapdragon-x-elite/">an $899 developer kit from Qualcomm itself</a> that would give developers and testers a slightly cheaper way to buy into the Copilot+ ecosystem. Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/project-volterra-review-microsofts-600-arm-pc-that-almost-doesnt-suck/">put out a similar Arm-powered dev kit</a> two years ago.</p>
<p>But Qualcomm has unceremoniously canceled the dev kit and is sending out refunds to those who ordered them. That's according to a note received by developer and YouTuber Jeff Geerling, who had already received the Snapdragon Dev Kit and given it a middling review <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/snapdragon-dev-kit-windows-fastest-x-elite-tested">a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/qualcomm-cancels-windows-dev-kit-pc-for-comprehensively-failing-to-meet-standards/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Recently, AI researcher Simon Willison wanted to add up his charges from using a cloud service, but the payment values and dates he needed were scattered among a dozen separate emails. Inputting them manually would have been tedious, so he turned to a technique he calls "video scraping," which involves feeding a screen recording video into an AI model, similar to ChatGPT, for data extraction purposes.</p>
<p>What he discovered seems simple on its surface, but the quality of the result has deeper implications for the future of AI assistants, which may soon be able to see and interact with what we're doing on our computer screens.</p>
<p>"The other day I found myself needing to add up some numeric values that were scattered across twelve different emails," Willison wrote in a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/">detailed post</a> on his blog. He recorded a 35-second video scrolling through the relevant emails, then fed that video into <a href="https://aistudio.google.com">Google's AI Studio</a> tool, which allows people to experiment with several versions of Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/">Gemini 1.5 Pro</a> and Gemini 1.5 Flash AI models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/cheap-ai-video-scraping-can-now-extract-data-from-any-screen-recording/">Read full article</a></p>

      <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> will premiere on HBO and Max on November 17, 2024.

</div>
<p>New York Comic-Con kicked off today and among the highlights was an HBO panel devoted to the platform's forthcoming new series, <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>—including the release of a two-and-a-half-minute trailer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/tantalizing-teaser-for-dune-prophecy-promises-plenty-of-political-intrigue/">previously reported</a>, the series was announced in 2019, with director Denis Villeneuve serving as an executive producer and Alison Schapker (<em>Alias, Fringe, Altered Carbon</em>) serving as showrunner. It's a prequel series inspired by the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisterhood_of_Dune"><em>Sisterhood of Dune</em></a>, written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, exploring the origins of the <a title="Bene Gesserit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit">Bene Gesserit.</a>  The first season will have six episodes, and it's unclear how closely the series will adhere to the source material. Per the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Set 10,000 years before the ascension of Paul Atreides, <em>Dune: Prophecy </em>follows two Harkonnen sisters as they combat forces that threaten the future of humankind, and establish the fabled sect that will become known as the Bene Gesserit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emily Watson co-stars as Valya Harkonnen, leader of the Sisterhood, with Olivia Williams playing her sister, Tula Harkonnen. Mark Strong plays Emperor Javicco Corrino, while Jodhi May plays Empress Natalya, and Sarah-Sofie Boussnina plays Princess Ynez.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/the-sisterhood-faces-a-powerful-foe-in-dune-prophecy-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/dvds-are-dying-right-as-streaming-has-made-them-appealing-again/">Redbox went bankrupt</a>, many have wondered what will happen to those red kiosks and DVDs. Another question worth examining is: What will happen to all the data stored inside the Redboxes?</p>
<p>Redbox parent company Chicken Soup for the Soul filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June and is in the process of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/redbox-app-starts-going-away-removing-purchased-content-from-owners/">liquidating its assets</a>. Meanwhile, stores with Redboxes are eager to remove the obsolete hardware. And tinkerers have reported getting their hands on Redbox kiosks and doing <a href="https://www.404media.co/tinkerers-are-taking-old-redbox-kiosks-home-and-reverse-engineering-them/">all sorts of things with them</a>, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Redbox/comments/1g26vq5/by_popular_demand/">running <em>Doom</em></a>.</p>
<p>But Redboxes falling into technologists' hands can also result in the uncovering of customer data from kiosks' hard drives. As spotted by <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/redbox-privacy-credit-card-numbers-rental-history?_bhlid=a334d2cbf657d2ade2d79af074f9d21f9736190d">Lowpass </a>today, programmer and expert reverse engineer <a href="https://wiki.foone.org/w/My_Resume">Foone Turing</a> reported via <a href="https://digipres.club/@foone/113313967759861054?utm_source=www.lowpass.cc&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=redbox-s-privacy-nightmare-revealed">Mastodon</a> that she was able to retrieve records for 2,471 transactions from the disk image of a Redbox hard drive.

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Between 1400 and 1775, a significant upsurge of witch trials <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_trials_in_the_early_modern_period">swept across</a> early-modern Europe, resulting in the execution of an estimated 40,000–60,000 accused witches. Historians and social scientists have long studied this period in hopes of learning more about how large-scale social changes occur. Some have pointed to the invention of the printing press and the publication of witch-hunting manuals—most notably the highly influential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum"><em>Malleus maleficarum</em></a>—as a major factor, making it easier for the witch-hunting hysteria to spread across the continent.</p>
<p>The abrupt emergence of the craze and its rapid spread, resulting in a pronounced shift in social behaviors—namely, the often brutal persecution of suspected witches—is consistent with a theory of social change dubbed "ideational diffusion," according to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11186-024-09576-1">new paper</a> published in the journal Theory and Society. There is the introduction of new ideas, reinforced by social networks, that eventually take root and lead to widespread behavioral changes in a society.</p>
<p>The authors had already been thinking about cultural change and the driving forces by which it occurs, including social contagion—especially large cultural shifts like the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, for example. One co-author, Steve Pfaff, a sociologist at Chapman University, was working on a project about witch trials in Scotland and was particularly interested in the role the <em>Malleus maleficarum</em> might have played.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-the-malleus-maleficarum-fueled-the-witch-trial-craze/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Measles, whopping cough, polio, tetanus—devastating and sometimes deadly diseases await comebacks in the US as more and more parents are declining routine childhood vaccines that have proved safe and effective.</p>
<p>The vaccination rates among kindergartners have fallen once again, dipping into the range of 92 percent in the 2023–2024 school year, down from about 93 percent the previous school year and 95 percent in 2019–2020. That's according to an analysis of the latest <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm?s_cid=mm7341a3_w">vaccination data published today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>The analysis also found that vaccination exemptions rose to an all-time high of 3.3 percent, up from 3 percent in the previous school year. The rise in exemptions is nearly entirely driven by non-medical exemptions—in other words, religious or philosophical exemptions. Only 0.2 percent of all vaccination exemptions are medically justified.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/us-vaccinations-fall-again-as-more-parents-refuse-lifesaving-shots-for-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>US officials charged a man with compromising the official Twitter/X account of the Securities and Exchange Commission for purposes of posting false information that caused the price of bitcoin to spike.</p>
<p>The January attack, federal prosecutors said, started with a SIM swap, a form of fraud that takes control of a cell phone number by assuming the identity of the person the number belongs to. The attacker then uses the false identity to induce an employee of the cellular carrier to move the phone number off the current Subscriber Identity Module card, a small chip that connects a device to a specific carrier account. Then, the attacker has the number transferred to a new SIM card, usually under the pretense that the fraudulent account holder has just obtained a new device.</p>
<h2>Not the SEC announcement you think it is</h2>
<p>The number at issue in the SIM swap, an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1373721/dl?inline">indictment</a> unsealed on Thursday said, was used to provide two-factor authentication for the SEC X account, which authorized commission personnel to post official communications. One of the people connected to the conspiracy then used the 2FA code to compromise the X account to tweet false information that caused the price of a single bitcoin to increase by $1,000.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/how-alleged-sim-swap-and-hacked-x-account-drove-up-price-of-bitcoin-by-1k/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>We have had reason to doubt the official September 2025 launch date for the mission, the first crewed flight into deep space in more than five decades, for a while now. This is principally because NASA is continuing to mull the implications of damage to the Orion spacecraft's heat shield from the Artemis I mission nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that there are now other problems with holding to this date as well.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/artemis-ii-almost-certainly-will-miss-its-september-2025-launch-date/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>European Union regulators warned Elon Musk's X platform that it may calculate fines by including revenue from Musk's other companies, including SpaceX, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-17/musk-s-empire-risks-being-targeted-by-eu-for-potential-x-fines">Bloomberg article</a> published today.</p>
<p>X was previously accused of violating the Digital Services Act (DSA), which could result in fines of up to 6 percent of total worldwide annual turnover. That fine would be levied on the "provider" of X, which could be defined to include other Musk-led firms.</p>
<p>Bloomberg writes that "regulators are considering whether sales from SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Company, in addition to revenue generated from the social network, should be included to determine potential fines against X, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the information isn't public." Bloomberg's report says that Tesla "sales would be exempt from this calculation because it's publicly traded and not under Musk's full control."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/eu-considers-calculating-x-fines-by-including-revenue-from-musks-other-firms/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Android 15 started rolling out to Pixel devices Tuesday and will arrive, through various third-party efforts, on other Android devices at some point. There is always a bunch of little changes to discover in an Android release, whether by reading, poking around, or letting your phone show you 25 new things after it restarts.</p>
<p>In Android 15, some of the most notable involve making your device less appealing to snoops and thieves and more secure against the kids to whom you hand your phone to keep them quiet at dinner. There are also smart fixes for screen sharing, OTP codes, and cellular hacking prevention, but details about them are spread across Google's own docs and blogs and various news site's reports.</p>
<p>Here's what is notable and new in how Android 15 handles privacy and security.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/android-15s-security-and-privacy-features-are-the-updates-highlight/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Last year, child safety experts <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/thousands-of-realistic-but-fake-ai-child-sex-images-found-online-report-says/">warned of thousands of "AI-generated child sex images"</a> rapidly spreading on the dark web around the same time the FBI issued a warning that "benign photos" of children posted online could be easily manipulated to exploit and harm kids.</p>
<p>So far, US prosecutors have only brought two criminal cases in 2024 attempting to use existing child pornography and obscenity laws to combat the threat, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-prosecutors-see-rising-threat-ai-generated-child-sex-abuse-imagery-2024-10-17/">reported</a> on Thursday.

              <![CDATA[<p>When the exhaust nozzle on one of the Vulcan rocket's strap-on boosters failed shortly after liftoff earlier this month, it scattered debris across the beachfront landscape just east of the launch pad on Florida's Space Coast.</p>
<p>United Launch Alliance, the company that builds and launches the Vulcan rocket, is investigating the cause of the booster anomaly before resuming Vulcan flights. Despite the nozzle failure, the rocket <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/ulas-second-vulcan-rocket-lost-part-of-its-booster-and-kept-going/">continued its climb</a> and ended up reaching its planned trajectory heading into deep space.</p>
<p>The nozzle fell off one of Vulcan's two solid rocket boosters around 37 seconds after taking off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on October 4. There were some indications of a problem with the booster a few seconds earlier, as tracking cameras observed hot exhaust escaping just above the bell-shaped nozzle, which is bolted to the bottom of the booster casing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/ula-is-examining-debris-recovered-from-vulcan-rockets-shattered-booster-nozzle/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The service, branded as Anonymous Sudan, directed powerful and sustained DDoSes against Big Tech companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, Riot Games, PayPal, Steam, Hulu, Netflix, Reddit, GitHub, and Cloudflare. Other targets included CNN.com, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, the US departments of Justice, Defense and State, the FBI, and government websites for the state of Alabama. Other attacks targeted sites or servers located in Europe.</p>
<p>Two brothers, Ahmed Salah Yousif Omer, 22, and Alaa Salah Yusuuf Omer, 27, were both charged with one count of conspiracy to damage protected computers. Ahmed Salah was also charged with three counts of damaging protected computers. Among the allegations is that one of the brothers attempted to “knowingly and recklessly cause death.” If convicted on all charges, Ahmed Salah would face a maximum of life in federal prison, and Alaa Salah would face a maximum of five years in federal prison.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/us-prosecutors-take-down-operation-accused-of-35000-ddoses-over-14-months/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For several months in 1898, a pair of male lions turned the Tsavo region of Kenya into their own human hunting grounds, killing many construction workers who were building the Kenya-Uganda railway. A team of scientists has now identified exactly what kinds of prey the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsavo_Man-Eaters">Tsavo Man-Eaters</a>" fed upon, based on DNA analysis of hairs collected from the lions' teeth, according to a <a href="https://cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01240-5">recent paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. They found evidence of various species the lions had consumed, including humans.</p>
<p>The British began construction of a railway bridge over the Tsavo River in March 1898, with Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Patterson leading the project. But mere days after Patterson arrived on site, workers started disappearing or being killed. The culprits: two maneless male lions, so emboldened that they often dragged workers from their tents at night to eat them. At their peak, they were killing workers almost daily—including an attack on the district officer, who narrowly escaped with claw lacerations on his back. (His assistant, however, was killed.)</p>
<p>Patterson finally managed to shoot and kill one of the lions on December 9 and the second 20 days later. The lion pelts decorated Patterson's home as rugs for 25 years before being sold to Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History in 1924. The skins were restored and used to reconstruct the lions, which are now on permanent display at the museum, along with their skulls.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/scientists-found-human-hairs-in-teeth-of-19th-century-lions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Following an investigation, Elon Musk's X has won its fight to avoid gatekeeper status under the European Union's strict competition law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the European Commission (EC) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_24_5324">announced</a> that "X does indeed not qualify as a gatekeeper in relation to its online social networking service, given that the investigation revealed that X is not an important gateway for business users to reach end users."</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Another nationwide meat recall is underway over <em>Listeria </em>contamination—and it's far more formidable than the last.</p>
<p>As of October 15, meat supplier BrucePac, of Durant, Oklahoma, is recalling <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/brucepac-recalls-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due-possible-listeria">11.8 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products</a> after routine federal safety testing found<em> Listeria monocytogenes</em>, a potentially deadly bacterium, in samples of the company's poultry. The finding triggered an immediate recall, which was first issued on October 9. But, officials are still working to understand the extent of the contamination—and struggling to identify the hundreds of potentially contaminated products.</p>
<p>"Because we sell to other companies who resell, repackage, or use our products as ingredients in other foods, we do not have a list of retail products that contain our recalled items," <a href="https://www.brucepac.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Recall-FAQs-Website-101524.pdf">BrucePac said in a statement</a> updated October 15.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/theres-another-massive-meat-recall-over-listeria-and-its-a-doozy/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"They told us our son cheated on a paper, which is not what happened," Jennifer Harris <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/hingham-high-school-ai-lawsuit/62602947">told WCVB</a>. "They basically punished him for a rule that doesn't exist."</p>
<p>Jennifer and her husband, Dale, filed the lawsuit in Plymouth County Superior Court, and the case was then moved to US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Defendants include the superintendent, principal, a teacher, the history department head, and the Hingham School Committee.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/student-was-punished-for-using-ai-then-his-parents-sued-teacher-and-administrators/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It will soon be easy to "click to cancel" subscriptions after the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/10/federal-trade-commission-announces-final-click-cancel-rule-making-it-easier-consumers-end-recurring">adopted</a> a final rule on Wednesday that makes it challenging for businesses to opt out of easy cancellation methods.</p>
<p>“Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” FTC chair Lina Khan said in a press release. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.”</p>
<p>The heart of the new rule requires businesses to provide simple ways to cancel subscriptions. Under the rule, any subscription that can be signed up for online must be able to be canceled online. And cancellation paths for in-person sign-ups must be just as easy, offered either by phone or online.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/ftc-click-to-cancel-rule-seeks-to-end-free-trial-traps-sneaky-auto-enrollments/">Read full article</a></p>
