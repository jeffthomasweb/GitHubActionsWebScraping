                            <![CDATA[<p>The payload fairing at the top of Gilmour Space's first Eris rocket was supposed to deploy a few minutes after lifting off from northeastern Australia. Instead, the nose cone fell off the rocket hours before it was supposed to leave the launch pad Thursday.</p>
<p>Gilmour, the Australian startup that developed the Eris rocket, announced the setback in a post to the company's social media accounts Thursday.</p>
<p>"During final launch preparations last night, an electrical fault triggered the system that opens the rocket’s nose cone (the payload fairing)," Gilmour <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7328897706481909761/">posted on LinkedIn</a>. "This happened before any fuel was loaded into the vehicle. Most importantly, no one was injured, and early checks show no damage to the rocket or the launch pad."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/the-top-fell-off-australias-first-orbital-class-rocket-delaying-its-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The FBI is warning people to be vigilant of an ongoing malicious messaging campaign that uses AI-generated voice audio to impersonate government officials in an attempt to trick recipients into clicking on links that can infect their computers.</p>
<p>“Since April 2025, malicious actors have impersonated senior US officials to target individuals, many of whom are current or former senior US federal or state government officials and their contacts,” <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250515">Thursday’s advisory</a> from the bureau’s Internet Crime Complaint Center said. “If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic.”</p>
<h2>Think you can’t be fooled? Think again.</h2>
<p>The campaign's creators are sending AI-generated voice messages—better known as deepfakes—along with text messages “in an effort to establish rapport before gaining access to personal accounts,” FBI officials said. Deepfakes use AI to mimic the voice and speaking characteristics of a specific individual. The differences between the authentic and simulated speakers are often indistinguishable without trained analysis. Deepfake videos work similarly.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/fbi-warns-of-ongoing-scam-that-uses-deepfake-audio-to-impersonate-government-officials/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Masked men jumped out of a white-panel van in Paris this week, attempting to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/europe/paris-kidnap-crypto-attack-intl?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc">snatch a 34-year-old woman off the street</a>. The woman's husband fought back and suffered a fractured skull, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_VVNCmfxso">France24</a>. The woman continued resisting long enough for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/parisian-hailed-hero-helping-thwart-crypto-kidnapping-2025-05-14/">bike shop owner named Nabil</a> to rush out swinging a fire extinguisher, which he hurled after the departing van as the attackers finally fled. The entire altercation was captured on video.</p>
<p>The woman was identified as the daughter of a "crypto boss," and her attempted kidnapping is part of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/">disquieting surge in European crypto-related abductions</a>—two of which have already involved fingers being chopped off. The last major abduction happened in Paris only two weeks ago, and it ended with French police storming a house in the Paris suburbs and rescuing a crypto mogul's now-four-fingered father.</p>
<p>The attacks have spooked the industry, which has called, somewhat ironically, for enhanced protections from the government. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/woman-escapes-botched-kidnapping-paris-gangs-target-crypto-wealth-2025-05-14/">notes </a>that the issue has been escalated all the way to the top of the French government, where Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced plans this week to "meet with French crypto entrepreneurs to make them aware of the risks and to take measures to protect them."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/fractured-skulls-and-ski-masks-more-crypto-kidnap-madness-on-the-streets-of-paris/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has continued to design, manufacture, and sell new Surface hardware since longtime team leader Panos Panay <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/panos-panay-leader-of-the-surface-and-windows-teams-is-leaving-microsoft/">left the company for Amazon in late 2023</a>, including both Intel- and Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro tablets and Surface Laptops. New <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsofts-12-inch-surface-pro-is-cheaper-but-unfixes-a-decade-old-design-problem/">smaller versions</a> of both of these mainstays were introduced<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/lighter-cheaper-surface-laptop-saves-a-little-money-but-gives-up-a-lot/"> just a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>But the weirder, more unique parts of the Surface lineup have been mostly neglected since Panay's departure. Late last year, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/microsoft-discontinues-lackadaisically-updated-surface-studio-all-in-one-desktop/">discontinued the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop</a>, which was never updated consistently and started at a whopping $4,300. But it provided one of the few alternatives to the basic "monitor with a computer inside it" all-in-one design template. Now, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/667664/surface-laptop-studio-2-end-of-life-notepad">reports</a> that Microsoft stopped manufacturing the Surface Laptop Studio 2 earlier this month and that the PC will disappear after current retail stock is sold.</p>
<p>Microsoft reportedly plans to officially announce the end-of-life status of the Laptop Studio 2 in June. The company will support the Laptop Studio with driver and firmware updates as necessary through at least October of 2029, in accordance with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-driver-firmware-lifecycle-support">its six-year support lifecycle</a> for Surface hardware.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/report-microsofts-experimental-laptop-studio-is-vanishing-without-a-replacement/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla has raised the ire of some of its customers, who are accusing the carmaker of misleading them. Until recently, it would not allow customers who leased its EVs to purchase them at the end of the lease. Instead, the leases stated that it "plan[s] to use those vehicles in the Tesla ride-hailing network."</p>
<p>Tesla instituted that policy for Model 3 leases <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2019/04/12/teslas-hypothetical-robotaxi-service-with-off-lease-cars-is-brilliant/">starting in 2019</a> and later expanded it to the Model Y until changing the policy <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/27/tesla-now-offers-lease-buyouts-after-saying-it-would-keep-cars-as-robotaxis/">last November</a>. But Tesla is not currently sitting on a fleet of several hundred thousand ex-lease autonomous Models 3 and Y, and as of today there exists no actual Tesla ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>Instead, it has been spiffing up the ex-lease cars with software updates and then selling them to new customers, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/musk-took-leased-cars-back-so-tesla-could-use-them-robotaxis-instead-tesla-sold-2025-05-15/">according to Reuters</a>.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Back in February, Elon Musk skewered the Treasury Department for lacking "basic controls" to stop payments to terrorist organizations, boasting at the Oval Office that "any company" has those controls.</p>
<p>Fast-forward three months, and now Musk's social media platform X is suspected of taking payments from sanctioned terrorists and providing premium features that make it easier to raise funds and spread propaganda—including through X's chatbot, Grok. Groups seemingly benefiting from X include Houthi rebels, Hezbollah, and Hamas, as well as groups from Syria, Kuwait, and Iran. Some accounts have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers, paying to boost their reach while X apparently looks the other way.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/u.s.-sanctioned-terrorists-enjoy-premium-boost-on-x">report</a> released Thursday, the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) flagged popular accounts likely linked to US-sanctioned terrorists. Some of the accounts bear "ID verified" badges, suggesting that X may be going against its own policies that ban sanctioned terrorists from benefiting from its platform.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/report-terrorist-groups-seem-to-be-paying-x-to-raise-funds-collect-tips/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>China has been installing renewable energy at a spectacular rate and now has more renewable capacity than the next 13 countries combined, and four times that of its closest competitor, the US. Yet, so far at least, that hasn't been enough to offset the rise of fossil fuel use in that country. But <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-clean-energy-just-put-chinas-co2-emissions-into-reverse-for-first-time/">a new analysis</a> by the NGO Carbon Brief suggests things may be changing, as China's emissions have now dropped over the past year, showing a 1 percent decline compared to the previous March. The decline is largely being led by the power sector, where growth in renewables has surged above rising demand.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that China's emissions have gone down over the course of a year, but in all previous cases the cause was primarily economic—driven by things like the COVID pandemic or the 2008 housing crisis. The latest shift, however, was driven largely by the country's energy sector, which saw a 2 percent decline in emissions over the past year.</p>

Months of emails and explanations to Google's Play Store representatives have yielded no changes, Nextcloud <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-android-file-upload-issue-google/">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>That blog post—and media coverage of it—seem to have moved the needle. In an update to the post, Nextcloud wrote that as of May 15, Google has offered to restore full file access permissions. "We are preparing a test release first (expected tonight) and a final update with all functionality restored. If no issues occur, the update will hopefully be out early next week," the Nextcloud team wrote.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has hit out at Apple’s plans to produce more iPhones in India as a way of avoiding US tariffs on Chinese-made goods, as he continues to push the tech group to manufacture its best-selling device in America.</p>
<p>Speaking in Qatar on the latest leg of his Middle East tour, the US president said he had “a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday” after the Apple chief executive confirmed last week that Indian factories would supply the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the coming months.</p>
<p>The Financial Times previously reported that Apple planned to source from India all of the more than 60 million iPhones sold annually in the US by the end of next year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/trump-has-a-little-problem-with-apples-plan-to-ship-iphones-from-india/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You've probably heard of the infamous "marshmallow test," in which young children are asked to wait to eat a yummy marshmallow placed in front of them while left alone in a room for 10 to 15 minutes. If they successfully do so, they get a second marshmallow; if not, they don't. The test has become a useful paradigm for scientists interested in studying the various factors that might influence one's ability to delay gratification, thereby promoting social cooperation. According to <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.250392">a paper</a> published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, one factor is trust: If children are paired in a marshmallow test and one promises not to eat their treat for the specified time, the other is much more likely to also refrain from eating it.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/r-i-p-walter-mischel-father-of-the-infamous-marshmallow-test/">previously reported</a>, psychologist Walter Mischel's <a href="https://bingschool.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/115-dev_psych_1990.pdf">landmark behavioral study</a> involved 600 kids between the ages of four and six, all culled from Stanford University's Bing Nursery School. He would give each child a marshmallow and give them the option of eating it immediately if they chose. But if they could wait 15 minutes, they would get a second marshmallow as a reward. Then Mischel would leave the room, and a hidden video camera would tape what happened next.</p>
<p>Some kids just ate the marshmallow right away. Others found a handy distraction: covering their eyes, kicking the desk, or poking at the marshmallow with their fingers. Some smelled it, licked it, or took tiny nibbles around the edges. Roughly one-third of the kids held out long enough to earn a second marshmallow. Several years later, Mischel noticed a strong correlation between the success of some of those kids later in life (better grades, higher self-confidence) and their ability to delay gratification in nursery school. Mischel's follow-up study confirmed the correlation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/a-peers-promise-can-help-kids-pass-the-marshmallow-test/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For phone nerds who've been around the block a few times, the original Motorola Razr is undeniably iconic. The era of foldables has allowed Motorola to resurrect the Razr in an appropriately flexible form, and after a few generations of refinement, the 2025 Razrs are spectacular pieces of hardware. They look great, they're fun to use, and they just about disappear in your pocket.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/motorola-reveals-three-new-super-colorful-razr-foldables/">new Razrs</a> also have enormous foldable OLEDs, along with external displays that are just large enough to be useful. Moto has upped its design game, offering various Pantone shades with interesting materials and textures to make the phones more distinctive, but Motorola's take on mobile AI could use some work, as could its long-term support policy. Still, these might be the coolest phones you can get right now.</p>
<h2>An elegant tactile experience</h2>
<p>Many phone buyers couldn't care less about how a phone's body looks or feels—they'll just slap it in a case and never look at it again. Foldables tend not to fit as well in cases, so the physical design of the Razrs is important. The good news is that Motorola has refined the foldable formula with an updated hinge and some very interesting material choices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/motorola-razr-and-razr-ultra-2025-review-cool-as-hell-but-too-much-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

CarPlay is Apple's way of casting a phone's video and audio to a car's infotainment system, but with CarPlay Ultra it gets a big upgrade. Now, in addition to displaying compatible iPhone apps on the car's center infotainment screen, CarPlay Ultra will also take over the main instrument panel in front of the driver, replacing the OEM-designed dials like the speedometer and tachometer with a number of different Apple designs instead.</p>
<p>"iPhone users love CarPlay and it has changed the way people interact with their vehicles. With CarPlay Ultra, together with automakers we are reimagining the in-car experience and making it even more unified and consistent," said Bob Borchers, vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple.</p>

<p>However, to misquote William Gibson, CarPlay Ultra is unevenly distributed. In fact, if you want it today, you're going to have to head over to the nearest Aston Martin dealership. Because to begin with, it's only rolling out in North America with Aston Martin, inside the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/aston-martins-new-suv-is-actually-extremely-good-the-2021-dbx-review/">DBX</a> SUV, as well as the DB12, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-aston-martin-vantage-great-but-frustrating/">Vantage</a>, and Vanquish sports cars. It's standard on all new orders, the automaker says, and will be available as a dealer-performed update for existing Aston Martins with the company's in-house 10.25-inch infotainment system in the coming weeks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/apples-new-carplay-ultra-is-ready-but-only-in-aston-martins-for-now/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Threat actors, likely supported by the Russian government, hacked multiple high-value mail servers around the world by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, a class of bug that was among the most commonly exploited in decades past.</p>
<p>XSS is short for cross-site scripting. Vulnerabilities result from programming errors found in webserver software that, when exploited, allow attackers to execute malicious code in the browsers of people visiting an affected website. XSS first got attention in 2005, with the creation of the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/13/weekend_twitter_worm_attacks/">Samy Worm</a>, which knocked MySpace out of commission when it added more than one million MySpace friends to a user named Samy. XSS exploits abounded for the next decade and have gradually fizzled more recently, although this class of attacks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/thousands-of-wordpress-sites-have-been-hacked-through-tagdiv-plugin-vulnerability/">continues now</a>.</p>
<h2>Just add JavaScript</h2>
<p>On Thursday, security firm ESET <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/operation-roundpress/">reported</a> that Sednit, a Kremlin-backed hacking group also tracked as APT28, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, and Sofacy—gained access to high-value email accounts by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities in mail server software from four different makers. Those packages are: Roundcube, MDaemon, Horde, and Zimbra.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/spies-hack-high-value-mail-servers-using-an-exploit-from-yesteryear/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A US-based propulsion company, Venus Aerospace, said Wednesday it had completed a short flight test of its rotating detonation rocket engine at Spaceport America in New Mexico.</p>
<p>The company's chief executive and co-founder, Sassie Duggleby, characterized the flight as "historic." It is believed to be the first US-based flight test of an idea that has been discussed academically for decades, a rotating detonation rocket engine. The concept has previously been tested in a handful of other countries, but never with a high-thrust engine.</p>
<p>"By proving this engine works beyond the lab, Venus brings the world closer to a future where hypersonic travel—traversing the globe in under two hours—becomes possible," Duggleby told Ars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/venus-aerospace-flies-its-rotating-detonation-rocket-engine-for-the-first-time/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Users on X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/grok/">love to tag the verified @grok account in replies</a> to get the large language model's take on any number of topics. On Wednesday, though, that account started largely ignoring those requests en masse in favor of redirecting the conversation toward the topic of alleged "white genocide" in South Africa and the related song <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubul%27_ibhunu">"Kill the Boer."</a></p>
<p>Searching the Grok account's replies <a href="https://x.com/search?q=boer%20from%3Agrok&amp;src=typed_query">for mentions of "genocide"</a> or <a href="https://x.com/search?q=boer%20from%3A%40grok&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">"Boer"</a> currently returns dozens if not hundreds of posts where the LLM responds to completely unrelated queries with quixotic discussions about alleged killings of white farmers in South Africa (though many have been deleted in the time just before this post went live; links in this story have been replaced with archived versions where appropriate). The sheer range of these non sequiturs is somewhat breathtaking; everything from <a href="https://archive.is/vwqkF">questions about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s disinformation</a> to <a href="https://archive.is/iT7pF">discussions of MLB pitcher Max Scherzer's salary</a> to <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1922649282748039303">a search for new group-specific put-downs</a> see Grok quickly turning the subject back toward the suddenly all-important topic of South Africa.</p>
<p>It's like Grok has become the world's most tiresome party guest, harping on its own pet talking points to the exclusion of any other discussion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/xais-grok-suddenly-cant-stop-bringing-up-white-genocide-in-south-africa/">Read full article</a></p>

The update brings what OpenAI describes as improved coding and web development capabilities to paid ChatGPT subscribers, with wider enterprise rollout planned in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Adding GPT-4.1 and 4.1 mini to ChatGPT adds to an already complex model selection that includes GPT-4o, various specialized GPT-4o versions, o1-pro, o3-mini, and o3-mini-high models. There are technically nine AI models available for ChatGPT Pro subscribers. Wharton professor Ethan Mollick recently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3lp3ue3qizs2a">publicly lampooned</a> the awkward situation on social media.</p>

<p>Deciding which AI model to use can be daunting for AI novices. Reddit users and <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/less-is-more-chatgpt-has-too-many-options-but-poor-performance/1213483">OpenAI forum members</a> alike commonly voice confusion about the available options. "I do not understand the reason behind having multiple models available for use," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1j2dh5m/why_are_multiple_models_available/">wrote</a> one Reddit user in March. "Why would anyone use anything but the best one?" Another Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1jio5sk/a_bit_lost_with_so_many_models_and_limits/">said</a> they were "a bit lost" with the many ChatGPT models available after switching back from using Anthropic Claude.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/some-chatgpt-users-now-face-9-ai-models-to-choose-from-after-gpt-4-1-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Since 2017, a particularly dangerous strain of <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 has emerged across the country to spark outbreaks, severe disease, and deaths. It spreads in various ways: via leafy greens and contaminated beef, like its relatives, but also recreational waters. Hundreds of people across 46 states have been infected, and health officials have documented at least nine separate outbreaks. One in 2018, linked to lettuce, caused over 200 infections across 37 states, killing five people and causing a severe kidney condition in 26.</p>
<p>Now, a sweeping genetic analysis by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests a tiny mutation in one of the bacteria's molecular weapons may be behind the strain's rise. The finding, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/13/24-0686_article">published recently in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases</a>, provides insights into this clinically significant plague and its rise to prominence. It also highlights the role of the bacteria's sophisticated military tactics.</p>
<p>The mutated weapon is part of a complex system that <em>E. coli</em> and other harmful bacteria sometimes use called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_III_secretion_system">a Type 3 Secretion System</a> (T3SS). This involves molecular machinery that basically functions like a syringe, complete with a long needle that is poked into the cells of its victims. The T3SS then directly injects a fleet of hostile proteins. Those proteins—called effectors—attack specific targets that collectively disable the host's defense responses and make the host more hospitable for its bacterial conqueror.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/a-dangerous-e-coli-strain-has-emerged-a-small-mutation-may-explain-its-rise/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google's DeepMind research division claims its newest AI agent marks a significant step toward using the technology to tackle big problems in math and science. The system, known as AlphaEvolve, is based on the company's Gemini large language models (LLMs), with the addition of an "evolutionary" approach that evaluates and improves algorithms across a range of use cases.</p>
<p>AlphaEvolve is essentially an AI coding agent, but it goes deeper than a standard Gemini chatbot. When you talk to Gemini, there is always a risk of hallucination, where the AI makes up details due to the non-deterministic nature of the underlying technology. AlphaEvolve uses an interesting approach to increase its accuracy when handling complex algorithmic problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/">According to DeepMind</a>, this AI uses an automatic evaluation system. When a researcher interacts with AlphaEvolve, they input a problem along with possible solutions and avenues to explore. The model generates multiple possible solutions, using the efficient Gemini Flash and the more detail-oriented Gemini Pro, and then each solution is analyzed by the evaluator. An evolutionary framework allows AlphaEvolve to focus on the best solution and improve upon it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/google-deepmind-creates-super-advanced-ai-that-can-invent-new-algorithms/">Read full article</a></p>
