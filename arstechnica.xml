                            <![CDATA[
<p>Boy, was 1992 a different time for computer games. Epic MegaGames’ <em>Jill of the Jungle</em> illustrates that as well as any other title from the era. Designed and programmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the game was meant to prove that console-style games of the original Nintendo era could work just as well on PCs. (Later, the onus of proof would often be in the reverse direction.)</p>
<p>Also, it had a female protagonist, which Sweeney saw as a notable differentiator at the time. That’s pretty wild to think about in an era of <em>Tomb Raider</em>‘s Lara Croft, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>‘s Aloy, <em>Life is Strange</em>‘s Max Caulfield, <em>Returnal</em>‘s Selene Vassos, <em>Control</em>‘s Jesse Faden, <em>The Last of Us</em>‘ Ellie Williams, and a seemingly endless list of others—to say nothing of the fact that many players of all genders who played the games <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> seem to agree that the female protagonist options in those are more compelling than their male alternatives.</p>
<p>As wacky as it is to remember that the idea of a female character was seen as exceptional at any point (and with the acknowledgement that this game was nonetheless not the first to do that), it’s still neat to see how forward-thinking Sweeney was in many respects—and not just in terms of cultural norms in gaming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/revisiting-jill-of-the-jungle-the-last-game-tim-sweeney-designed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Around the world, some 40 million people are living with HIV. And though progress in treatment means the infection isn’t the death sentence it once was, researchers have never been able to bring about a cure. Instead, HIV-positive people must take a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>But in 2025, researchers reported a breakthrough that suggests that a “functional” cure for HIV—a way to keep HIV under control long-term without constant treatment—may indeed be possible. In two independent trials using infusions of engineered antibodies, some participants remained healthy without taking antiretrovirals, long after the interventions ended.</p>
<p>In one of the trials—the<a href="https://www.natap.org/2025/CROI/croi_33.htm"> FRESH trial</a>, led by virologist Thumbi Ndung’u of the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa—four of 20 participants maintained undetectable levels of HIV for a median of 1.5 years without taking antiretrovirals. In the other, the <a href="https://www.natap.org/2025/CROI/croi_34.htm">RIO trial</a> set in the United Kingdom and Denmark and led by Sarah Fidler, a clinical doctor and HIV research expert at Imperial College London, six of 34 HIV-positive participants have maintained viral control for at least two years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/achieving-lasting-remission-for-hiv/">Read full article</a></p>

The trio of astronauts arrived at the orbiting laboratory without incident.</p>
<p>However, on the ground, there was a serious problem during the launch with the ground systems that support processing of the vehicle before liftoff at Site 31, located at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://t.me/roscosmos_gk/18802">a terse statement</a> issued Thursday night on the social media site Telegram, the Russian space corporation that operates Soyuz appeared to downplay the incident: “The launch pad was inspected, as is done every time a rocket is launched. Damage to several launch pad components was identified. Damage can occur after launch, so such inspections are mandatory worldwide. The launch pad’s condition is currently being assessed.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/russian-launch-pad-incident-raises-concerns-about-future-of-space-station/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier in 2025 we celebrated Prime Day—the yearly veneration of the greatest Transformer of all, Optimus Prime (in fact, Optimus Prime is so revered that we often celebrate Prime Day twice!). But in the fall, as the evenings lengthen and the air turns chill, we pause to remember a much more somber occasion: Black Friday, the day Optimus Prime was cruelly cut down by the treacherous hand of his arch-nemesis Megatron while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVzf6_wUtlg">bravely defending Autobot City from attack</a>. Though Optimus Prime did not survive the brutal fight, the Autobot leader’s indomitable spirit nonetheless carried the day and by his decisive actions the Decepticons were routed, fleeing from the city like the cowardly robots they truly are and giving over victory to the forces of light.</p>
<p>Although Optimus Prime’s death was tragic and unexpected, things are often darkest just before dawn—and so, even though today is called “Black Friday” to remind us of the day’s solemnity, we choose to honor him the way we honor other important historical figures who also laid their lives upon the altar of freedom: we take the day off to go shopping!</p>
<p>Below you’ll find a curated list of the best Black Friday deals that we’ve been able to find. Stand strong in the shadow cast by that long-gone noble Autobot, for by his sacrifice the day was won. Now, as Optimus would say, transform, my friends—<em>transform and buy things</em>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2025/11/here-are-the-best-black-friday-deals-we-can-find/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When the US Fish and Wildlife Service reintroduced 14 gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park in 1995, the animals were, in some ways, stepping into a new world.</p>
<p>After humans hunted wolves to near-extinction across the Western US in the early 20th century, the carnivore’s absence likely altered ecosystems and food webs across the Rocky Mountains. Once wolves were reintroduced to the landscape, scientists hoped to learn if, and how quickly, these changes could be reversed.</p>
<p>Despite studies claiming to show early evidence of a tantalizing relationship between wolves and regenerating riparian ecosystems since the canines returned to Yellowstone, scientists are still debating how large carnivores impact vegetation and other animals, according to a new <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/ecolsys/56/1/annurev-ecolsys-102722-021139.pdf?expires=1762810414&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=39FA618B0AFFE69D080F20268394148B">paper</a> published this month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/reintroduced-carnivores-impacts-on-ecosystems-are-still-coming-into-focus/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/tiny-vinyl-is-a-new-pocketable-record-format-for-the-spotify-age/">looked at Tiny vinyl</a>, a new miniature vinyl single format developed through a collaboration between a toy industry veteran and the world’s largest vinyl record manufacturer. The 4-inch singles are pressed in a process nearly identical to standard 12-inch LPs or 7-inch singles, except everything is smaller. They have a standard-size spindle hole and play at 33⅓ RPM, and they hold up to four minutes of music per side.</p>
<p>Several smaller bands, like The Band Loula and Rainbow Kitten Surprise, and some industry veterans like Blake Shelton and Melissa Etheridge, have already experimented with the format. But Tiny Vinyl partnered with US retail giant Target for its big coming-out party this fall, with <a href="https://www.target.com/c/tiny-vinyl-music-movies-books/-/N-7f0kq">44 exclusive titles</a> launching throughout the end of this year.</p>
<p>Tiny Vinyl supplied a few promotional copies of releases from former America’s Got Talent finalist Grace VanderWaal, The Band Loula, country pop stars Florida Georgia Line, and jazz legends the Vince Guaraldi Trio so I could get a first-hand look at how the records actually play. I tested these titles as well as several others I picked up at retail, playing them on an Audio Technica LP-120 direct drive manual turntable connected to a Yamaha S-301 integrated amplifier and playing through a pair of vintage Klipsch kg4 speakers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/we-put-the-new-pocket-sized-vinyl-format-to-the-test-with-mixed-results/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Peruse a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_1985">list of films</a> released in 1985 and you’ll notice a surprisingly high number of movies that have become classics in the ensuing 40 years. Sure, there were blockbusters like <em>Back to the Future, The Goonies, Pale Rider, The Breakfast Club</em> and <em>Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome</em>, but there were also critical arthouse favorites like <em>Kiss of the Spider Woman</em> and Akira Kurosawa’s masterpiece, <em>Ran</em>. Since we’re going into a long Thanksgiving weekend, I’ve made a list, in alphabetical order, of some of the quirkier gems from 1985 that have stood the test of time. (Some of the films first premiered at film festivals or in smaller international markets in 1984, but they were released in the US in 1985.)</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below but no major reveals.)</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2509643">a report in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, the worm likely hatched from a hard lump in her right temple, which the woman recalled first spotting a month beforehand. She also noticed that the nodule had vanished just a day before the worm apparently made a squiggly run for her eye.</p>
<p>When she went to an ophthalmologist the next day, doctors immediately noted the “mobile lesion” on her eyelid, which was in the suspicious shape of a bunched-up worm just under her skin with a little redness and swelling.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/doctors-pull-4-inch-worm-out-of-womans-eyelid-after-monthlong-incubation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Around this time last year, officials at United Launch Alliance projected 2025 would be their busiest year ever. Tory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, told reporters the company would launch as many as 20 missions this year, with roughly an even split between the legacy Atlas V launcher and its replacement<span class="s1">—</span>the Vulcan rocket.</p>
<p>Now, it’s likely that ULA will close out 2025 with six flights<span class="s1">—five with the Atlas V and just one with the Vulcan rocket the company is so eager accelerate into service. Six flights would make</span> 2025 the busiest launch year for ULA since 2022, but it falls well short of the company’s forecast.</p>
<p>Last week, ULA announced its next launch is scheduled for December 15. An Atlas V will loft another batch of broadband satellites for the Amazon Leo network, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/we-finally-know-a-little-more-about-amazons-super-secret-satellites/">formerly known as Project Kuiper</a>, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Worries about the US grid’s ability to handle the surge in demand due to data center growth have made headlines repeatedly over the course of 2025. And, early in the year, demand for electricity had surged by nearly 5 percent compared to the year prior, suggesting the grid might truly be facing a data center apocalypse. And that rise in demand had a very unfortunate effect: Coal use rose for the first time since its recent collapse began.</p>
<p>But since the first-quarter data was released, demand has steadily eroded. As of <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=table_es1b">yesterday’s data release</a> by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which covers the first nine months of 2025, total electricity demand has risen by 2.3 percent. That slowdown means that most of the increased demand could have been met by the astonishing growth of solar power.</p>
<h2>Better than feared</h2>
<p>If you look over <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/archive/may2025.pdf">data on the first quarter of 2025</a>, the numbers are pretty grim, with total demand rising by 4.8 percent compared to the same period in the year prior. While solar power continued its remarkable surge, growing by an astonishing 44 percent, it was only able to cover a third of the demand growth. As a result of that and a drop in natural gas usage, coal use grew by 23 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/solars-growth-in-us-almost-enough-to-offset-rising-energy-use/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Under ardent anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has named Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham as its new principal deputy director—a choice that was immediately called “dangerous” and “irresponsible,” yet not as bad as it could have been, by experts.</p>
<p>Physician Jeremy Faust revealed the appointment in his newsletter <a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-the-apparent-new-2-at-cdc-is">Inside Medicine</a> yesterday, which was subsequently confirmed by journalists. Faust noted that a CDC source told him, “I heard way worse names floated,” and although Abraham’s views are “probably pretty terrible,” he at least has had relevant experience running a public health system, unlike other current leaders of the agency.</p>
<p>But Abraham hasn’t exactly been running a health system the way most public health experts would recommend. Under Abraham’s leadership, the Louisiana health department <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths">waited months</a> to inform residents about a deadly whooping cough (pertussis) outbreak. He also has a clear record of anti-vaccine views. Earlier this year, he told <a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2025/09/10/louisiana-surgeon-general-spars-with-sentor-bill-cassidy-over-covid-vaccine-advice/86074738007/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZKwokzj8qRgS5GWbb1Ft95gN-QI1M0EA21tw2R7NX4GzFwx-WDLrt27FZoK1Wn5yJMmJ-Y9MQIeOJKpieLcBPQxAKkLtV9shot1DdfZX_lA1p8gk&amp;_hsmi=391707009&amp;utm_content=391707009&amp;utm_source=hs_email">a Louisiana news outlet</a> he doesn’t recommend COVID-19 vaccines because “I prefer natural immunity.” In February, he ordered the health department to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/louisiana-officially-ends-mass-vaccinations-as-rfk-jr-comes-to-power/">stop promoting mass vaccinations</a>, including flu shots, and barred staff from running seasonal vaccine campaigns.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/rfk-jr-s-new-cdc-deputy-director-prefers-natural-immunity-over-vaccines/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Facing five lawsuits alleging wrongful deaths, OpenAI lobbed its first defense Tuesday, denying in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Raine-v-OpenAI-Answer-11-25-25.pdf">court filing</a> that ChatGPT caused a teen’s suicide and instead arguing the teen violated terms that prohibit discussing suicide or self-harm with the chatbot.</p>
<p>The earliest look at OpenAI’s strategy to overcome the string of lawsuits came in a case where parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine accused OpenAI of relaxing safety guardrails that allowed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">ChatGPT to become the teen’s “suicide coach.”</a> OpenAI deliberately designed the version their son used, ChatGPT 4o, to encourage and validate his suicidal ideation in its quest to build the world’s most engaging chatbot, parents argued.</p>
<p>But in a <a href="https://openai.com/index/mental-health-litigation-approach/">blog</a>, OpenAI claimed that parents selectively chose disturbing chat logs while supposedly ignoring “the full picture” revealed by the teen’s chat history. Digging through the logs, OpenAI claimed the teen told ChatGPT that he’d begun experiencing suicidal ideation at age 11, long before he used the chatbot.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/openai-says-dead-teen-violated-tos-when-he-used-chatgpt-to-plan-suicide/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The Russian space corporation, Roscosmos, has released images of final processing of the Soyuz 5 rocket at the Progress Rocket and Space Center in Samara, Russia, earlier this month before the booster was shipped to the launch site in Kazakhstan. It arrived there on November 12.</p>
<p>Although the Soyuz 5 is a new vehicle, it does not represent a major leap forward in technology. Rather it is, in many ways, a conventional reaction to commercial boosters developed in the West as well as the country’s prolonged war against Ukraine. Whether this strategy will be successful remains to be seen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/after-a-decade-russias-native-built-soyuz-5-rocket-finally-reaches-the-launch-site/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>I still like the Vision Pro, but I can tell it’s hanging on by a thread. Content is light, developer support is tepid, and while Apple has taken action to improve both, it’s not enough, and I’m concerned it might be too late.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When four people were arrested and charged with a conspiracy to illegally export Nvidia chips to China, there was an interesting side note. One of the arrestees, Alabama resident Brian Raymond, was the chief technology officer of an AI company called Corvex.</p>
<p>Or was he? Corvex certainly seemed to think that Raymond was its CTO in the days before his indictment. Corvex named Raymond as its CTO in a press release and filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which detailed plans for a merger with Movano Health.</p>
<p>But once Raymond was arrested, Corvex told media outlets that it had never completed the process of hiring him as an employee. While someone could technically be a CTO as a contractor and not a regular employee, a company spokesperson subsequently claimed to Ars that Raymond had never been the CTO.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/tech-firms-new-cto-gets-indicted-company-then-claims-he-was-never-cto/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Many dog breeds are noted for their personalities and behavioral traits, from the distinctive vocalizations of huskies to the herding of border collies. People have worked to identify the genes associated with many of these behaviors, taking advantage of the fact that dogs can interbreed. But that creates its own experimental challenges, as it can be difficult to separate some behaviors from physical traits distinctive to the breed—small dog breeds may seem more aggressive simply because they feel threatened more often.</p>
<p>To get around that, a team of researchers recently did the largest gene/behavior association study within a single dog breed. Taking advantage of a population of over 1,000 golden retrievers, they found a number of genes associated with behaviors within that breed. A high percentage of these genes turned out to correspond to regions of the human genome that have been associated with behavioral differences as well. But, in many cases, these associations have been with very different behaviors.</p>
<h2>Gone to the dogs</h2>
<p>The work, done by a team based largely at Cambridge University, utilized the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study, which involved over 3,000 owners of these dogs filling out annual surveys that included information on their dogs’ behavior. Over 1,000 of those owners also had blood samples obtained from their dogs and shipped in; the researchers used these samples to scan the dogs’ genomes for variants. Those were then compared to ratings of the dogs’ behavior on a range of issues, like fear or aggression directed toward strangers or other dogs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/many-genes-associated-with-dog-behavior-influence-human-personalities-too/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss medications continues to soar—and their uptake is helping to push down obesity rates on a national scale—but a safe, evidence-based way off the drugs isn’t yet in clear view.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2841273">analysis published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine</a> found that most participants in a clinical trial who were assigned to stop taking tirzepatide (Zepbound from Eli Lilly) not only regained significant amounts of the weight they had lost on the drug, but they also saw their cardiovascular and metabolic improvements slip away. Their blood pressure went back up, as did their cholesterol, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (used to assess glucose control levels), and fasting insulin.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2841278">an accompanying editorial</a>, two medical experts at the University of Pittsburgh, Elizabeth Oczypok and Timothy Anderson, suggest that this new class of drugs should be rebranded from “weight loss” drugs to “weight management” drugs, which people may need to take indefinitely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/glp-1-drugs-improve-heart-health-but-only-if-you-keep-taking-them/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Plex is starting to enforce its new rules, which prevent users from remotely accessing a personal media server without a subscription fee.</p>
<p>Previously, people outside of a server owner’s network could access the owner’s media library through Plex for free. Under the new rules <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/plex-ups-its-price-for-first-time-in-a-decade-changes-remote-streaming-access/">announced in March</a>, a server owner needs to have a Plex Pass subscription, which starts at $7 per month, to grant users remote access to their server. Alternatively, someone can remotely access another person’s Plex server by buying their own Plex Pass or a <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/remote-watch-pass-overview/">Remote Watch Pass</a>, which is a subscription with fewer features than a Plex Pass and that Plex started selling in April for a $2/month starting price.</p>
<p>Plex’s new rules took effect on April 29. According to a recent <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/changes-coming-to-remote-streaming-on-roku/933671">Plex forums</a> post by a Plex employee that <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/plex-is-now-enforcing-remote-play-restrictions-on-tvs/">How-To Geek</a> spotted today, the changes are rolling out this week, with a subscription being required for people using Plex’s Roku OS app for remote access.
