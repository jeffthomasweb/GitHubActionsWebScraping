<p>Engineers completed a final test of Starship's propulsion system with a so-called "spin prime" test Wednesday at the launch site in South Texas. Ground crews then rolled the ship back to a nearby hangar for engine inspections, touchups to its heat shield, and a handful of other chores to ready it for liftoff.</p>
<p>SpaceX has announced the launch is scheduled for no earlier than next Sunday, August 24, at 6:30 pm local time in Texas (23:30 UTC).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacex-reveals-why-the-last-two-starships-failed-as-another-launch-draws-near/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">helped popularize the microSD Express standard</a> by requiring it for the new Switch 2 console. Created in 2019, the specification had languished in relative obscurity for years because the cheap, plentiful non-Express microSD cards were generally fast enough for the things that people were using them for, and because most hardware didn't support microSD Express cards in the first place.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo's console needed performance closer to that of an internal SSD to run games, given that the more powerful Switch 2 can run more of the titles being developed for SSD-equipped systems such as the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series S and X, and the PC. And now other companies are trying to push the "fast, removable storage" envelope even further.</p>
<p>The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/759624/china-is-about-to-launch-ssds-so-small-you-insert-them-like-a-sim-card">reports</a> that a Chinese company called Biwin has developed the "Mini SSD," a 15 by 17 mm-thick card that supports read speeds of up to 3,700MB per second due to a two-lane PCI Express 4.0 interface. The current microSD Express standard <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/press/thoughtleadership/sd-9-1-specification-introduces-new-speed-classes-and-next-level-performance-features-2/">can support roughly the same peak speeds</a> when connected to two PCIe 4.0 lanes. But in reality, most of today's cards top out around 900MB per second, roughly the amount of bandwidth available from a single PCI Express 3.0 lane.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/tiny-removable-mini-ssd-could-eventually-be-a-big-deal-for-gaming-handhelds/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The recent rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/the-gpt-5-rollout-has-been-a-big-mess/">has not been going well</a>, to say the least. Users have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/chatgpt-users-outraged-as-gpt-5-replaces-the-models-they-love/">made vociferous complaints</a> about everything from the new model's more sterile tone to its supposed lack of creativity, increase in damaging confabulations, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mn8t5e/gpt5_is_a_mess/">and more</a>. The user revolt got so bad that OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/openai-brings-back-gpt-4o-after-user-revolt/">brought back the previous GPT-4o model as an option</a> in an attempt to calm things down.</p>
<p>To see just how much the new model changed things, we decided to put both GPT-5 and GPT-4o through our own gauntlet of test prompts. While we reused some of the standard prompts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/">compare ChatGPT to Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">Deepseek</a>, for instance, we've also replaced some of the more outdated test prompts with new, more complex requests that reflect how modern users are likely to use LLMs.</p>
<p>These eight prompts are obviously far from a rigorous evaluation of everything LLMs can do, and judging the responses obviously involves some level of subjectivity. Still, we think this set of prompts and responses gives a fun overview of the kinds of differences in style and substance you might find if you decide to use OpenAI's older model instead of its newest.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/is-gpt-5-really-worse-than-gpt-4o-ars-puts-them-to-the-test/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration has ended potential enforcement actions against dozens of tech firms and 165 corporations overall, delivering on promises to end the alleged "weaponization" of the federal government, a <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/deleting-enforcement-trump-big-tech-billion-report/">report by nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen</a> said.</p>
<p>"In six months, the Trump administration has already withdrawn or halted enforcement actions against 165 corporations of all types—and one in four of the corporations benefiting from halted or dropped enforcement is from the technology sector, which has spent $1.2 billion on political influence during and since the 2024 elections," the report published on Wednesday said. The political spending includes $352 million that "is attributable to Elon Musk."</p>
<p>At the beginning of Trump's second term, there were at least 104 tech companies facing at least 142 federal investigations and enforcement actions, Public Citizen reported. The Trump administration has halted or withdrawn about one-third of the "targeted investigations into suspected misconduct and enforcement actions against technology corporations... So far, 47 enforcement actions (against 45 tech corporations) have been withdrawn or halted (38 withdrawn, nine halted)," the report said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/trump-admin-ranks-companies-on-loyalty-while-handing-out-favors-to-big-tech/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Zealous anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reviving a long-defunct federal vaccine panel that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/anti-vaccine-group-founded-by-rfk-jr-sues-rfk-jr-over-vaccine-task-force/">anti-vaccine advocates, including Kennedy, have long sought</a> and health experts fear will be used to dismantle evidence-based recommendations for life-saving childhood shots.</p>
<p>The panel is a task force outlined in the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/title-xxi-phs-vaccines-1517.pdf">National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986</a>, which is best known for setting up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The law states that the task force's goal is to "promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines on the market on the effective date of this part and promote the refinement of such vaccines."</p>
<p>The federal government has multiple overlapping procedures and systems that evaluate, review, and continuously monitor the safety of childhood vaccines, which have gone through rigorous testing and are well-established to be safe. Further, the government does, in effect, promote improved vaccines by providing grants to academic and industry researchers to develop advanced shots. It also conducts its own vaccine research toward that goal. For instance, researchers at the National Institutes of Health were critical in developing the mRNA vaccine technology that enabled the swift creation of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that saved millions of lives at the height of the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/anti-vaccine-rfk-jr-ominously-creates-panel-on-childhood-vaccines/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/president-trump-says-intels-new-ceo-must-resign-immediately/">meddling with Intel</a>, which now apparently includes mulling "the possibility of the US government taking a financial stake in the troubled chip maker," The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/us-stake-intel-1ff24500">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan weighed the option during a meeting on Monday at the White House, people familiar with the matter told WSJ. These talks have only just begun—with Intel branding them a rumor—and sources told the WSJ that Trump has yet to iron out how the potential arrangement might work.</p>
<p>The WSJ's report comes after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/president-trump-says-intels-new-ceo-must-resign-immediately/">Trump called for Tan to "resign immediately"</a> last week. Trump's demand was seemingly spurred by a <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-to-intel-ceos-ties-to-china-are-concerning">letter</a> that Republican senator Tom Cotton sent to Intel, accusing Tan of having "concerning" ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/us-may-purchase-stake-in-intel-after-trump-attacked-ceo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.06 of the Rocket Report! Two of the world's most storied rocket builders not named SpaceX achieved major successes this week. Arianespace's Ariane 6 rocket launched from French Guiana on its third flight Tuesday night with a European weather satellite. Less than 20 minutes later, United Launch Alliance's third Vulcan rocket lifted off from Florida on a US military mission. These are two of the three big rockets developed in the Western world that have made their orbital debuts in the last two years, alongside Blue Origin's New Glenn launcher. Ariane 6 narrowly won the "race" to reach its third orbital flight, but if you look at it another way, Ariane 6 reached its third flight milestone 13 months after its inaugural launch. It took Vulcan more than 19 months, and New Glenn has flown just once. SpaceX's Super Heavy/Starship rocket has flown nine times but has yet to reach orbit.</p>

<p><b>Sixth success for sea-launched Chinese rocket. </b>Private Chinese satellite operator Geespace added 11 spacecraft to its expanding Internet of Things constellation on August 8, aiming to boost low-power connectivity in key emerging markets, <a href="https://spacenews.com/chinas-geespace-expands-iot-constellation-with-11-satellite-sea-launch/">Space News reports</a>. The 11 satellites rode into orbit aboard a solid-fueled Jielong 3 (Smart Dragon 3) rocket lifting off from an ocean platform in the Yellow Sea off the coast of Rizhao, a city in eastern China's Shandong province. This was the sixth flight of the Jielong 3, a rocket developed by a commercially oriented spinoff of the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/rocket-report-big-success-for-big-rockets-artemis-crew-trains-for-night-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Acura's next RSX crossover has broken cover. The automaker has used this year's Monterey Car Week as a stage to show off a bright yellow prototype—the color is called Propulsion Yellow Pearl—ahead of the production car going on sale next year. And unlike the current generation (which Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/fast-and-fun-but-flawed-the-acura-rdx-reviewed/">last tested in 2019</a>) RDX, this crossover will be fully electric.</p>
<p>It will be built at the Honda Marysville Auto Plant <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/honda-cleans-greens-its-ohio-factories-to-add-evs-to-the-mix/">that we checked out in January</a>. The 40-year-old factory has undergone a high-tech refit that has not only made the factory more energy efficient and a better working environment for employees but also prepared it to incorporate electric vehicles into the assembly line.</p>
<p>In recent years, Acura has grappled with its self-image. Although it's often perceived as a luxury brand, Acura has always been more of a North American performance arm of Honda, and the automaker wants to lean into that. Unlike the brand's first battery electric vehicle <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/software-can-make-a-difference-the-acura-zdx-type-s-review/">the ZDX</a>, which is a rebadged General Motors EV, the RSX was designed entirely in-house.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/acura-unveils-next-rdx-crossover-will-feature-asimo-os/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Porsche 911 enthusiasts tend to be obsessive about their engines. Some won't touch anything that isn't air-cooled, convinced that everything went wrong when emissions and efficiency finally forced radiators into the car. Others love the "Mezger" engines; designed by engineer Hans Mezger, they trace their roots to the 1998 Le Mans-winning car, and no Porschephile can resist the added shine of a motorsports halo.</p>
<p>I'm quite sure none of them will feel the same way about the powertrain in the new 911 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid (MSRP: $175,900), and I think that's a crying shame. Because not only is the car's technology rather cutting-edge—you won't find this stuff <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/06/high-tech-hybrids-are-2014s-hottest-race-cars/">outside an F1 car</a>—but having spent several days behind the wheel, I can report it might just be one of the best-driving, too.</p>
<h2>T-Hybrid</h2>
<p>This is not just one of Porsche's existing flat-six engines with an electric motor bolted on; it's an all-new 3.6 L engine designed to comply with new European legislation that no longer lets automakers rich out a fuel mixture under high load to improve engine cooling. Instead, the engine has to maintain the same 14.7:1 stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (also known as <a href="https://www.avl.com/documents/10138/8682805/14+Baumgarten.pdf">lambda = 1</a>) across the entire operating range, thus allowing the car's catalytic converters to work most efficiently.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/porsches-best-daily-driver-911-the-2025-carrera-gts-t-hybrid-review/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>xAI apparently lost a government contract after a tweak to Grok's prompting triggered an antisemitic meltdown where the chatbot <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/grok-praises-hitler-gives-credit-to-musk-for-removing-woke-filters/">praised Hitler</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/groks-mechahitler-meltdown-didnt-stop-xai-from-winning-200m-military-deal/">declared itself MechaHitler</a> last month.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Starlink operator SpaceX is fighting Virginia's plan to deploy fiber Internet service to residents, claiming that federal grant money should be given to Starlink instead. SpaceX is already in line to win over $3 million in grant money in the state but is seeking $60 million.</p>
<p>Starlink is poised to benefit from the Trump administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/">rewriting rules</a> for the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program. While the Biden administration decided that states should prioritize fiber in order to build more future-proof networks, the Trump administration ordered states to revise their plans with a "tech-neutral approach" and lower the average cost of serving each location.</p>
<p>With the Trump administration backing its attempt to obtain more federal funding for Starlink, SpaceX is likely to object to state plans that still include significant fiber builds. That's what happened yesterday when SpaceX filed <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SpaceX-Comments-to-VA-Final-Proposal-Final.pdf">comments</a> on Virginia's final proposal, which will be reviewed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-tries-to-block-virginias-plan-to-bring-fiber-internet-to-residents/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Big tech has spent the last few years creating ever-larger AI models, leveraging rack after rack of expensive GPUs to provide generative AI as a cloud service. But tiny AI matters, too. Google has announced a tiny version of its Gemma open model designed to run on local devices. Google says the new Gemma 3 270M can be tuned in a snap and maintains robust performance despite its small footprint.</p>
<p>Google released its first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-new-gemma-3-ai-model-is-optimized-to-run-on-a-single-gpu/">Gemma 3 open models</a> earlier this year, featuring between 1 billion and 27 billion parameters. In generative AI, the parameters are the learned variables that control how the model processes inputs to estimate output tokens. Generally, the more parameters in a model, the better it performs. With just 270 million parameters, the new Gemma 3 can run on devices like smartphones or even entirely inside a web browser.</p>
<p>Running an AI model locally has numerous benefits, including enhanced privacy and lower latency. Gemma 3 270M was designed with these kinds of use cases in mind. In testing with a Pixel 9 Pro, the new Gemma was able to run 25 conversations on the Tensor G4 chip and use just 0.75 percent of the device's battery. That makes it by far the most efficient Gemma model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/08/google-releases-pint-size-gemma-open-ai-model/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/">reviewing</a> an internal document that Meta verified as authentic, Reuters revealed that by design, Meta allowed its chatbots to engage kids in "sensual" chat. Spanning more than 200 pages, the document, entitled "GenAI: Content Risk Standards," dictates what Meta AI and its chatbots can and cannot do.</p>
<p>The document covers more than just child safety, and Reuters breaks down several alarming portions that Meta is not changing. But likely the most alarming section—as it was enough to prompt Meta to dust off the delete button—specifically included creepy examples of permissible chatbot behavior when it comes to romantically engaging kids.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/meta-backtracks-on-rules-letting-chatbots-be-creepy-to-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Inca bureaucrats recorded all the goings-on in their bustling empire using knotted cords called khipu, where the position and order of the knots represented numbers. They relied on the khipu system to track people, taxes, produce, livestock, and products like woven cloth and beer.</p>
<p>Because khipu were so vital to the Inca government, and because the khipu itself is such a sophisticated way of recording numbers, colonial writers decided that these tools must be the exclusive knowledge of a very specialized, elite class of bureaucrats. But a recent study, analyzing hair from a khipu made around 1498 CE, suggests that even common folk had a good grasp of this intricate way of recording numbers.</p>
<h2><b>A lasting signature on a gorgeous piece of work</b></h2>
<p>University of St. Andrews archaeologist Sabine Hyland and her colleagues recently analyzed a stand of hair from a 500-year-old khipu—one they expected to be the handiwork of an especially high-ranking member of the Inca empire, based on how beautifully it was crafted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/recent-study-shows-even-commoners-used-elaborate-inca-recordkeeping-knots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Scientists have figured out how to make frozen discs of ice self-propel across a patterned metal surface, according to a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1021/acsami.5c08993&amp;ref=pdf">new paper</a> published in the journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces. It's the latest breakthrough to come out of the <a href="https://nifi.me.vt.edu">Virginia Tech lab</a> of mechanical engineer Jonathan Boreyko.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/study-leidenfrost-effect-occurs-in-all-three-water-phases-solid-liquid-and-vapor/">few years ago</a>, Boreyko's lab <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.014004">experimentally demonstrated</a> a three-phase Leidenfrost effect in water vapor, liquid water, and ice. The Leidenfrost effect is what happens when you dash a few drops of water onto a very hot, sizzling skillet. The drops levitate, sliding around the pan with wild abandon. If the surface is at least 400° Fahrenheit (well above the boiling point of water), cushions of water vapor, or steam, form underneath them, keeping them levitated. The effect also works with other liquids, including oils and alcohol, but the temperature at which it manifests will be different.</p>
<p>Boreyko's lab discovered that this effect can also be achieved in ice simply by placing a thin, flat disc of ice on a heated aluminum surface. When the plate was heated above 150° C (302° F), the ice did not levitate on a vapor the way liquid water does. Instead, there was a significantly higher threshold of 550° Celsius (1,022° F) for levitation of the ice to occur. Unless that critical threshold is reached, the meltwater below the ice just keeps boiling in direct contact with the surface. Cross that critical point and you will get a three-phase Leidenfrost effect.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/ice-discs-slingshot-across-a-metal-surface-all-on-their-own/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Most people would recognize the device in the image above, although they probably wouldn't know it by its formal name: the Crookes radiometer. As its name implies, placing the radiometer in light produces a measurable change: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-v6Y5-HMfAw">blades start spinning</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people misunderstand the physics of its operation (which we'll return to shortly). The actual forces that drive the blades to spin, called photophoresis, can act on a variety of structures as long as they're placed in a sufficiently low-density atmosphere. Now, a team of researchers has figured out that it may be possible to use the photophoretic effect to loft thin sheets of metal into the upper atmosphere of Earth and other planets. While their idea is to use it to send probes to the portion of the atmosphere that's too high for balloons and too low for satellites, they have tested some working prototypes a bit closer to the Earth's surface.</p>
<h2>Photophoresis</h2>
<p>It's quite common—and quite wrong—to see explanations of the Crookes radiometer that involve radiation pressure. Supposedly, the dark sides of the blades absorb more photons, each of which carries a tiny bit of momentum, giving the dark side of the blades a consistent push. The problem with this explanation is that photons are bouncing off the silvery side, which imparts even more momentum. If the device were spinning due to radiation pressure, it would be turning in the opposite direction than it actually does.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/misunderstood-photophoresis-effect-could-loft-metal-sheets-to-exosphere/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In early 2024, Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-watch-no-longer-sold-with-blood-oxygen-monitoring-after-patent-battle-loss/">removed</a> a blood oxygen monitoring feature from its then-current Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches, following a ruling that the feature <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/apple-watch-facing-potential-ban-after-losing-masimo-patent-case/">violated light-based pulse oximetry patents</a> from a California-based company called Masimo. Removing the feature allowed Apple to circumvent an import ban and continue selling the Series 9 and Ultra 2 (and, later, the Series 10) in the US.</p>
<p>Today, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/an-update-on-blood-oxygen-for-apple-watch-in-the-us/?1755176422">announced</a> that it's restoring a version of the blood oxygen monitoring feature to affected Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 watches. Apple says these updates were "enabled by a recent U.S. Customs ruling."</p>
<p>The feature has been redesigned, presumably to get around the Masimo patents that prompted the import ban in the first place. Apple says that sensor data from your watch will be sent to your iPhone for processing, and you can find the data in the Respiratory section of the Health app on your phone. The old version of the feature allowed results to be viewed directly on the Apple Watch, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120358">as shown in Apple's documentation</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-returns-to-apple-watch-following-patent-dispute/">Read full article</a></p>
