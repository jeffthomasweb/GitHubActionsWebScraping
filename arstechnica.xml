                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can’t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that.</p>
<p>J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.</p>
<h2>Open sesame</h2>
<p>The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumin Technology’s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[80 percent of game devs are working on a PC project, up from 66 percent last year.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Four out of five game developers are currently working on a project for the PC, a sizable increase from 66 percent of developers a year ago. That's according to <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Informa's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a>, which partnered with Omdia to ask over 3,000 game industry professionals about their work in advance of March's Game Developers Conference.</p>
<p>The 80 percent of developers working on PC projects in this year's survey is by far the highest mark for any platform dating back to at least 2018, when 60 percent of surveyed developers were working on a PC game. In the years since, the ratio of game developers working on the PC has hovered between 56 and 66 percent before this year's unexpected jump. The number of game developers saying they were <em>interested</em> in the PC as a platform also increased substantially, from 62 percent last year to 74 percent this year.</p>

      While the PC has long been the most popular platform in this survey, the sudden jump in the last year was rather large.

<p>The PC has long been the most popular platform for developers to work on in the annual State of the Game Industry survey, easily outpacing consoles and mobile platforms that generally see active work from anywhere between 12 to 36 percent of developer respondents, depending on the year. In its report, Informa notes this surge as a "passion for PC development explod[ing]" among developers, and mentions that while "PC has consistently been the platform of choice... this year saw its dominance increase even more."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/way-more-game-makers-are-working-on-pc-titles-than-ever-survey-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI released a research preview of "<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/">Operator</a>," a web automation tool that uses a new AI model called <a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/">Computer-Using Agent</a> (CUA) to control computers through a visual interface. The system performs tasks by viewing and interacting with on-screen elements like buttons and text fields similar to how a human would.</p>
<p>Operator is available today for subscribers of the $200 per month ChatGPT Pro plan at <a href="https://operator.chatgpt.com/">operator.chatgpt.com</a>. The company plans to expand to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users later. OpenAI intends to integrate these capabilities directly into ChatGPT and later release CUA through its API for developers.</p>
<p>Operator watches on-screen content while you use your computer and executes tasks through simulated keyboard and mouse inputs. The Computer-Using Agent processes screenshots to understand the computer's state and then makes decisions about clicking, typing, and scrolling based on its observations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[US agencies wasting billions on empty offices an “embarrassment,” RTO memo says.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">All federal agencies received a <a href="https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/OPM%20Return%20to%20Office%20Guidance%20Memorandum%201-22-25.pdf">memo</a> Wednesday requiring the termination of remote work options, with return-to-office plans due by end of day Friday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, Charles Ezell, told the heads and acting heads of all departments and agencies that the change is due to Donald Trump's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/">Return to In-Person Work</a> presidential memorandum, which carved out space for some exemptions and ordered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Heads of all departments and agencies in the executive branch of Government shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis, provided that the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Empty offices a “national embarrassment”</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the memo, "most federal offices presently are virtually abandoned," with "the vast majority of federal office workers" having "not returned to in-person work" after transitioning to remote work during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only has this "devastated" the local economy in Washington, D.C., the memo said, but having so many federal offices sitting empty also serves as a "national embarrassment."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/all-federal-agencies-ordered-to-terminate-remote-work-ideally-within-30-days/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok owner ByteDance is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/tiktok-deal-could-stop-short-of-full-us-sale-shareholder-says">reportedly</a> still searching for non-sale options to stay in the US after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/supreme-court-rules-tiktok-can-be-banned/">Supreme Court upheld a national security law</a> requiring that TikTok's US operations either be shut down or sold to a non-foreign adversary.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last weekend, TikTok briefly went dark in the US, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/after-chaotic-weekend-tiktok-remains-in-limbo/">only to come back online hours later</a> after Donald Trump reassured ByteDance that the US law would not be enforced. Then, shortly after Trump took office, he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-day-one-orders-saving-tiktok-creating-doge-and-ending-censorship/">signed an executive order</a> delaying enforcement for 75 days while he consulted with advisers to "pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump's executive order did not suggest that he intended to attempt to override the national security law's ban-or-sale requirements. But that hasn't stopped ByteDance, board member Bill Ford told World Economic Forum (WEF) attendees, from searching for a potential non-sale option that "could involve a change of control locally to ensure it complies with US legislation," Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/tiktok-deal-could-stop-short-of-full-us-sale-shareholder-says">reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-can-save-tiktok-without-forcing-a-sale-bytedance-board-member-claims/">Read full article</a></p>

Both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/">2016's <em>Doom</em></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/">2020's <em>Doom Eternal</em></a> paid homage to both the look and feel of the original <em>Doom</em> titles without being slavishly devoted to older gameplay conventions that can feel dated decades later.</p>
<p>Yet by the end of <em>Doom Eternal</em>, you could feel the modernized gameplay system threatening to burst at the seams a bit. Managing your limited ammo, health, and armor resources in <em>Eternal</em> meant expertly juggling a bewildering array of chainsaws, flamethrowers, grenades, and melee-based staggers into powerful, pre-animated "glory kills." That was all on top of the frequent weapon-switching needed to take advantage of the weaknesses of the varied enemies surrounding you and the double-jump-and-dash movement system that required expert use of all three dimensions.</p>
<p>Something had to give. So for <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, the team at id Software has committed to a more streamlined, back-to-basics system that limits complexity while maintaining the same overall difficulty level. That means a "fewer strings on the guitar" approach to controls that narrows almost every action down to just three context-sensitive buttons, as the developers discussed in a hands-off virtual preview session attended by Ars Technica.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has revived three complaints against broadcast stations accused of bias against President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Outgoing Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel last week directed the FCC to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/departing-fcc-chair-rejects-complaints-about-tv-news-coverage-of-trump/">dismiss the complaints</a> against CBS, ABC, and NBC stations, along with a fourth complaint about Fox, in what she called a stand for the First Amendment. Rosenworcel said the "threat to the First Amendment has taken on new forms, as the incoming President has called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke licenses for broadcast television stations because he disagrees with their content and coverage."</p>
<p>But in three orders issued yesterday, the FCC Enforcement Bureau reversed the CBS, ABC, and NBC decisions. "We find that the previous order was issued prematurely based on an insufficient investigatory record for the station-specific conduct at issue," each new order said. "We therefore conclude that this complaint requires further consideration."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-fcc-chair-gets-to-work-on-punishing-news-stations-accused-of-bias/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Although fans of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> might still be hankering for the long-delayed next book in the series, bestselling sci-fi/fantasy author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin">George R.R. Martin</a> has instead added a different item to his long list of publications: a peer-reviewed physics paper just published in the American Journal of Physics that he co-authored. The paper derives a formula to describe the dynamics of a fictional virus that is the centerpiece of the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cards">Wild Cards</a></em> series of books, a shared universe edited by Martin and Melinda M. Snodgrass, with some 44 authors contributing.</p>
<p><em>Wild Cards</em> grew out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superworld"><em>Superworld</em></a> RPG, specifically a long-running campaign game-mastered by Martin in the 1980s, with several of the original sci-fi writers who contributed to the series participating. (A then-unknown Neil Gaiman once pitched Martin a <em>Wild Cards</em> story involving a main character who lived in a world of dreams. Martin rejected the pitch, and Gaiman's idea became <em>The Sandman</em>.) Initially, Martin planned to write a novel centered on his character Turtle, but he then decided it would be better as a shared universe anthology. Martin thought that superhero comics had far too many sources of the many different superpowers and wanted his universe to have one single source. Snodgrass suggested a virus.</p>
<p>The series is basically an alternate history of the US in the aftermath of World War II. An airborne alien virus, designed to rewrite DNA, had been released over New York City in 1946 and spread globally, infecting tens of thousands worldwide. It's called the Wild Card virus because it affects every individual differently. It kills 90 percent of those it infects and mutates the rest. Nine percent of the latter end up with unpleasant conditions—these people are called Jokers—while 1 percent develop superpowers and are known as Aces. Some Aces have "powers" that are so trivial and useless that they are known as "deuces."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/george-r-r-martin-has-co-authored-a-physics-paper/">Read full article</a></p>

The announcement came during a White House meeting with President Donald Trump, who called it the "largest AI infrastructure project in history."</p>
<p>However, the origins of the Stargate project <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-openai-planning-100-billion-data-center-project-information-reports-2024-03-29/">extend back to 2024</a>, prior to Trump beginning his second term in office, and skeptics have begun to take aim at the numbers announced.</p>
<p>OpenAI says the goal of Stargate is to kickstart building more data centers to expand computing capacity for current and future AI projects, including OpenAI's goal of "AGI," which the company <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">defines</a> as a highly autonomous AI system that "outperforms humans at most economically valuable work."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/trump-announces-500b-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-with-agi-aims/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Now 11 seasons in, Formula E has come a long way from its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/03/racing-goes-electric-at-the-track-with-formula-e-the-first-e-racing-series/">sometimes chaotic early days and those mid-race pitstops</a> to change cars. Car swaps went away a long time ago, but when the series gets back to racing next month in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the mid-race pit stop will be back. Except this time, the cars will be quickly recharged by powerful 600 kW fast chargers.</p>
<p>The new race feature, which Formula E is calling "pit boost," is a 30-second pitstop, during which time the car receives a 600 kW fast charge—more than twice as much power as a Tesla Supercharger—that adds 10 percent (3.85 kWh) to the battery's state of charge. It's mandatory for every car in the race, but a team is only allowed to charge one of its two cars at a time and only within a specified window of time during the race.</p>
<p>Some people are probably going to be unimpressed with the length of the stops—while they're shorter than you might see at a prototype stop at Le Mans or Daytona, you also won't see mechanics running around changing tires. We're also talking an order of magnitude longer than a current Formula 1 pitstop, which will no doubt be used as ammunition by Formula E's detractors, just as the lap-time comparisons are.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/600-kw-fast-charging-pitstops-are-coming-to-formula-e/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Cadillac Lyriq was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/">the first of a new breed</a> of General Motors' electric vehicles. Built around a common battery platform (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/general-motors-is-ditching-ultium-branding-for-its-ev-batteries/">which used to be called Ultium</a>), the midsize SUV has been on sale for about three years now, and for model year 2026, there's a new version available, the first Cadillac EV to wear the V-series badge.</p>
<p>"V-Series captures the spirit of Cadillac, embodying our relentless pursuit of engineering excellence through our racing and production vehicles," said John Roth, vice president of Global Cadillac. "LYRIQ-V takes this commitment a step further in the EV era, pushing our performance pedigree of V-Series to new heights with a powerful, personalized and high-tech driving experience that fits perfectly into our customers' lives," Roth said.</p>
<p>As with other Cadillac V-series cars, you can expect a much higher power output than the base models. In this case, that's a hefty 615 hp (459 kW) and 650 lb-ft (880 Nm)—not quite double the output of the single-motor Lyriq we drove back in 2023. The Lyriq-V uses a pair of motors to achieve that output, powered by the same 102 kWh battery pack as in the normal Lyriq.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/cadillac-gives-the-lyriq-a-race-car-inspired-glow-up/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Parents, students, teachers, and administrators throughout North America are smarting from what could be the biggest data breach of 2025: an intrusion into the network of a cloud-based service storing detailed data of millions of pupils and school personnel.</p>
<p>The hack, which came to light earlier this month, hit PowerSchool, a Folsom, California, firm that provides cloud-based software to some 16,000 K–12 schools worldwide. The schools serve 60 million students and employ an unknown number of teachers. Besides providing software for administration, grades, and other functions, PowerSchool stores personal data for students and teachers, with much of that data including Social Security numbers, medical information, and home addresses.</p>
<p>On January 7, PowerSchool <a href="https://www.powerschool.com/security/sis-incident/">revealed</a> that it had experienced a network intrusion two weeks earlier that resulted in the “unauthorized exportation of personal information” customers stored in PowerSchool’s Student Information System (SIS) through PowerSource, a customer support portal. Information stolen included individuals’ names, contact information, dates of birth, medical alert information, Social Security Numbers, and unspecified “other related information.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/students-parents-and-teachers-still-smarting-from-breach-exposing-their-info/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Late last month, researchers revealed a finding that’s likely to shock some people and confirm the low expectations of others: Renewable energy facilities throughout Central Europe use unencrypted radio signals to receive commands to feed or ditch power into or from the grid that serves some 450 million people throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Fabian Bräunlein and Luca Melette stumbled on their discovery largely by accident while working on what they thought would be a much different sort of hacking project. After observing a radio receiver on the streetlight poles throughout Berlin, they got to wondering: Would it be possible for someone with a central transmitter to control them en masse, and if so, could they create a city-wide light installation along the lines of <a href="http://blinkenlights.net/">Project Blinkenlights</a>?</p>

<p>The man, said to be in his 40s, told doctors that he had adopted a "carnivore diet" eight months prior.

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Apple must face a potential class action alleging that Apple had a policy of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/apple-deliberately-pays-women-less-than-men-lawsuit-says/">paying men higher salaries than women for similar work</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, California Superior Court Judge Ethan P. Schulman filed an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jong-v-Apple-Order-Denying-Motion-to-Strike-1-21-24.pdf">order</a> that largely denies Apple's motions to strike the class allegations and suspend several class claims. This allows what one lawyer representing women suing, Joseph Sellers, said was "a very important case that impacts thousands of current and former female Apple employees."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most significantly, Apple tried and failed to argue that pay disparities for individual female workers suing were "justified" and that their circumstances were not common to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/apple-deliberately-pays-women-less-than-men-lawsuit-says/">12,000 female employees who could be owed backpay</a> if the class action is certified and Apple loses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-must-face-suit-over-alleged-policy-of-underpaying-female-workers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Reddit is staying out of the current revolt against social media website X and, to a lesser degree, Meta, on its platform.</p>
<p>Since Tuesday, hundreds of subreddits have discussed and/or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nffc/comments/1i6k2oz/rnffc_is_banning_direct_links_to_xtwitter/">implemented bans</a> against the site formerly called Twitter, as reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/hundreds-of-subreddits-are-considering-banning-all-links-to-x/">404 Media</a>. Dozens of subreddits have already agreed to disallow the sharing of any links to X, with moderators (volunteer Reddit users) agreeing to enforce the bans.</p>
<p>The trend seemed to start among subreddits focused on sports-related topics, like the subreddits for the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1i6ne3o/twitter_and_rnfl/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://mashable.com/article/sports-subreddits-push-to-ban-x-links-after-elon-musk-salute">NFL</a>, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/">Vancouver Canucks</a> NHL team, and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1i6gym0/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://mashable.com/article/sports-subreddits-push-to-ban-x-links-after-elon-musk-salute">Liverpool Football Club</a>, as reported by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sports-subreddits-push-to-ban-x-links-after-elon-musk-salute">Mashable</a>. However, as of today, subreddits of various topics are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1i6hprq/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/">discussing X bans</a>. Reddit users in support of X bans like the one instituted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/londonontario/comments/1i6xi7j/banning_of_twitterx_links/">r/londonontario</a> have pointed to various reasoning, including not being able to see tweet links without having an X account, Elon Musk <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/elon-musk-salute-nazi-trump-inauguration-backlash-rcna188540">appearing to make a Nazi salute</a> at the presidential inauguration on Monday (as cited by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i6ybpf/xtwitter_are_blocked_in_rchristianity/?ref=404media.co">r/Christianity’s</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1i6txcn/fuck_this_guy_x_links_are_now_banned_from/">r/newjersey's</a> bans, for example), and general dislike for Musk and/or how he runs X.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/reddit-wont-interfere-with-users-revolting-against-x-with-subreddit-bans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that AI models may surpass human capabilities "in almost everything" within two to three years, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-01-21-2025/card/anthropic-ceo-says-ai-could-surpass-human-intelligence-by-2027-9tka9tjLKLalkXX8IgKA">Wall Street Journal interview</a> at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Speaking at Journal House in Davos, Amodei <a href="https://x.com/JoannaStern/status/1881750060251451884">said</a>, "I don't know exactly when it'll come, I don't know if it'll be 2027. I think it's plausible it could be longer than that. I don't think it will be a whole bunch longer than that when AI systems are better than humans at almost everything. Better than almost all humans at almost everything. And then eventually better than all humans at everything, even robotics."</p>
<p>Amodei co-founded Anthropic in 2021 with his sister, Daniela Amodei, and five other former OpenAI employees. Not long after, Anthropic emerged as a strong technological competitor to OpenAI's AI products (such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT). Most recently, its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> model has remained highly regarded among some AI users and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-king-is-dead-claude-3-surpasses-gpt-4-on-chatbot-arena-for-the-first-time/">highly ranked</a> among AI benchmarks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/">Read full article</a></p>
