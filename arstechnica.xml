<p>The venerable Hubble Space Telescope is running out of gyroscopes, and when none are left, the instrument will cease to conduct meaningful science.</p>
<p>To preserve the telescope, which has been operating in space for nearly three and a half decades, NASA announced Tuesday that it will reduce the Hubble's operations such that it will function on just a single gyroscope. This will limit some scientific operations, and it will take longer to point the telescope to new objects and lock onto them.</p>
<p>But in a conference call with space reporters, Hubble officials stressed that the beloved scientific instrument is not going anywhere anytime soon.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029000#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029000&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, a group of former OpenAI and Google DeepMind employees <a href="https://righttowarn.ai/">published</a> an open letter calling for AI companies to commit to principles allowing employees to raise concerns about AI risks without fear of retaliation. The letter, titled "A Right to Warn about Advanced Artificial Intelligence," has so far been signed by 13 individuals, including some who chose to remain anonymous due to concerns about potential repercussions.</p>

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">The signatories argue that while AI has the potential to deliver benefits to humanity, it also poses serious risks that include "further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/">human extinction</a>."</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">They also assert that AI companies possess substantial non-public information about their systems' capabilities, limitations, and risk levels, but currently have only weak obligations to share this information with governments and none with civil society.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028761#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028761&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A ransomware attack that crippled a London-based medical testing and diagnostics provider has led several major hospitals in the city to declare a critical incident emergency and cancel non-emergency surgeries and pathology appointments, it was widely reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>The attack was detected Monday against Synnovis, a supplier of blood tests, swabs, bowel tests, and other hospital services in six London boroughs. The company <a href="https://www.synnovis.co.uk/news-and-press/synnovis-cyberattack">said</a> it has "affected all Synnovis IT systems, resulting in interruptions to many of our pathology services." The company gave no estimate of when its systems would be restored and provided no details about the attack or who was behind it.</p>
<h2>Major impact</h2>
<p>The outage has led hospitals, including Guy's and St Thomas' and King's College Hospital Trusts, to cancel operations and procedures involving blood transfusions. The cancellations include transplant surgeries, which require blood transfusions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029003#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029003&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years, the arguments against renewable power focused on its high costs. But as the price of wind and solar plunged, the arguments shifted. Suddenly, concerns about the waste left behind when solar panels hit end-of-life became so common that researchers at the US's National Renewable Energy Lab felt compelled to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02230-0">publish a commentary</a> in Nature Physics debunking them.</p>
<p>Part of the misinformation is pure nonsense. The primary ingredients of most panels are silicon, aluminum, and silver, none of which is a major environmental threat. Solar panels also have a useful lifespan of decades, and the vast majority of those in existence are less than 10 years old, so waste hasn't even become much of a problem yet. And, even once these panels age out, recycling techniques are available.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only realistic concern is that existing recycling technologies rely on nitric acid and can produce some toxic waste. But a group of researchers from Wuhan University have figured out an alternative means of recycling that avoids the production of toxic waste, and is more energy-efficient as a bonus.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028993#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028993&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Max's monthly ad-free streaming subscription costs $1 more than it did yesterday. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) today raised the prices for ad-free Max subscription plans, effective immediately for new subscribers.</p>
<p>In addition to the cheaper ad-free plan now costing $17 per month, the Ultimate ad-free monthly plan, which supports four instead of two concurrent streams and 4K instead of 1080p resolution, is up a dollar to $21 per month.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google has changed its repair policy in response to criticism from repair advocate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n4y9mrep9Y">Louis Rossmann</a>. Rossmann dug through the Google Store's "<a href="https://store.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/device-repair/">Service &amp; Repair Program Terms &amp; Conditions</a>" for its first-party mail-in repair service and found the same style of onerous bans on third-party parts that Samsung was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/ifixit-dumps-samsung-partnership-says-company-doesnt-care-about-repair/">recently caught</a> using. Section D, article 4 of the terms include the rather incredible line "Unauthorized Parts: You will not send in a Device containing non-Google-authorized parts – if You do, Your Device will not be returned to you." That's right, according to the terms, Google would <em>keep</em> a device sent in for repair, and you wouldn't get it back.</p>
<p>We asked Google for a comment on Rossmann's video, and a spokesperson says the terms will be updated:</p>
<blockquote><p>If a customer sends their Pixel to Google for repair, we would not keep it regardless of whether it has non-OEM parts or not. In certain situations, we won't be able to complete a repair if there are safety concerns. In that case, we will either send it back to the customer or work with them to determine next steps. Customers are also free to seek the repair options that work best for them. We are updating our Terms and Conditions to clarify this.</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds a lot more reasonable.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028821#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028821&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Zoom CEO Eric Yuan has a vision for the future of work: sending your AI-powered digital twin to attend meetings on your behalf. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24168733/zoom-ceo-ai-clones-digital-twins-videoconferencing-decoder-interview">an interview</a> with The Verge's Nilay Patel published Monday, Yuan shared his plans for Zoom to become an "AI-first company," using AI to automate tasks and reduce the need for human involvement in day-to-day work.</p>
<p>"Let’s say the team is waiting for the CEO to make a decision or maybe some meaningful conversation, my digital twin really can represent me and also can be part of the decision making process," Yuan said in the interview. "We’re not there yet, but that’s a reason why there’s limitations in today’s LLMs."</p>

<p>LLMs are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/">large language models</a>—text-predicting AI models that power AI assistants like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/bing-chat-is-now-microsoft-copilot-in-potentially-confusing-rebranding-move/">Microsoft Copilot</a>. They can output very convincing human-like text based on probabilities, but they are far from being able to replicate human reasoning. Still, Yuan suggests that instead of relying on a generic LLM to impersonate you, in the future, people will train custom LLMs to simulate each person.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028754#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028754&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Members of the Legendary Computer Bugs Tribunal, honored guests, if I may have your attention? I would, humbly, submit a new contender for your esteemed judgment. You may or may not find it novel, you may even deign to call it a "bug," but I assure you, you will find it entertaining.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.nethack.org/"><em>NetHack</em></a>. It is one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/ascii-art-permadeath-the-history-of-roguelike-games/">the all-time roguelike</a> games, and I mean that in the more strict sense of that term. The content is procedurally generated, deaths are permanent, and the only thing you keep from game to game is your skill and knowledge. I do understand that the only thing two roguelike fans can agree on is how wrong the third roguelike fan is in their definition of roguelike, but, please, let us move on.</p>
<h2><em>NetHack</em> is great for machine learning…</h2>
<p>Being a difficult game full of consequential choices and random challenges, as well as a "single-agent" game that can be generated and played at lightning speed on modern computers, <em>NetHack</em> is great for those working in machine learning—or <a href="https://underactuated.mit.edu/imitation.html">imitation learning</a>, actually, as detailed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09423">Jens Tuyls' paper</a> on how compute scaling affects single-agent game learning. Using Tuyls' model of expert <em>NetHack</em> behavior, Bartłomiej Cupiał and Maciej Wołczyk trained a neural network to play and improve itself using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028789#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028789&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We got our first look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Romulus"><em>Alien: Romulus</em></a>, the ninth installment in the sci-fi franchise, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/03/teaser-for-alien-romulus-hints-that-franchise-is-returning-to-its-horror-roots/">in March</a> with a brief teaser. That footage showed promise that horror director Fede Alvarez (<em>Don't Breathe</em>,<em> Evil Dead</em>) could fulfill his intention to bring this standalone film back to the franchise's stripped-down space horror roots. Now we have the full trailer, and we're pretty confident he's kept that promise. It looks as gory, intense, and delightfully terrifying as the seminal first two films in the franchise.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/03/teaser-for-alien-romulus-hints-that-franchise-is-returning-to-its-horror-roots/">previously reported</a>, <em>Alien: Romulus</em> is set between the events of <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> (and is not related to FX/Hulu's <em>Alien</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(American_TV_series)">prequel series</a> slated to premiere next year). That is, after Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of the <em>Nostromo</em>, destroyed the killer xenomorph and launched herself into space in the ship's lifeboat—along with the ginger cat, Jonesy—and before she woke up after 57 years in hypersleep and battled more xenomorphs while protecting the young orphan, Newt (Carrie Henn). Per the short-and-sweet official premise: "While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028822#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028822&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>E-Trade is apparently struggling to balance the risks and rewards of allowing Keith Gill to continue trading volatile meme stocks on its platform, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The meme-stock influencer known as "Roaring Kitty" and "DeepF—Value" is considered legendary for instantly skyrocketing the price of stocks, notably GameStop, most recently with a single tweet.</p>
<p>E-Trade is concerned, according to The Journal's insider sources, that on the one hand, Gill's social media posts are potentially illegally manipulating the market—and possibly putting others' investments at risk. But on the other, the platform worries that restricting Gill's trading could incite a boycott fueled by his "meme army" closing their accounts "in solidarity." That could also sharply impact trading on the platform, sources said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028866#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028866&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Over the years, Subaru has generated a cult following in the US, making its name with all-wheel drive powertrains and a go-anywhere attitude. Cars like the rally-bred WRXes and STIs did a lot of work here, but lately, Subaru has seemed to go in the opposite direction, phasing out fun drives like the STI lineup in favor of volume-movers like the Ascent and bloated versions of existing models such as the Subaru Wilderness editions.</p>
<p>Its first electric vehicle is perhaps even less in character. The $44,995 Solterra is the result of an ongoing partnership with Toyota and was developed together with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/the-2023-toyota-bz4x-review-not-as-bad-as-the-horror-stories-have-it/">the bZ4X</a>. Unlike the Toyota, there's no single-motor option for the Solterra. It's all-wheel-drive only, with a pair of identical 107 hp (80 kW) permanent magnet electric motors, one for each axle. That means you can do some, but not all, of the off-road things you'd expect to do with a Subaru.</p>
<h2>Looks are deceiving</h2>
<p>At first glance, the Solterra looks like the edgy, tech-leaning offspring of a Crosstrek and an Impreza wagon. The 8.3 inches of ground clearance is slightly less than the Outback or Forester, while the Solterra comes in at 184.6 inches (4,689 mm) in length, placing it squarely in the middle of the brand's stable. It's a rather compact SUV, even more so when you try to get comfortable in the cockpit. My short frame was cramped, and anyone taller than me won't feel welcome on long drives.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028799#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028799&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As expected, broadband industry lobby groups have sued the Federal Communications Commission in an attempt to nullify <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-restores-net-neutrality-rules-that-ban-blocking-and-throttling-in-3-2-vote/">net neutrality rules</a> that prohibit blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization.</p>
<p>Lobby groups representing cable, telecom, and mobile Internet service providers sued the FCC in several US appeals courts last week. Industry groups also filed a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1053179708951/1">petition</a> with the FCC on Friday asking for a stay of the rules, claiming the regulations shouldn't take effect while litigation is pending because the industry is likely to prevail in court.</p>
<p>The FCC is highly likely to reject the petition for a stay, but the groups can then ask appeals court judges to impose an injunction that would prevent enforcement. The industry lost a similar case during the Obama era, but is hoping to win this time because of the Supreme Court's evolving approach on whether federal agencies can decide "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/is-net-neutrality-doomed-at-supreme-court-fcc-and-isps-prepare-for-epic-battle/">major questions</a>" without explicit instructions from Congress.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028836#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028836&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Last month, we looked into some of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">the most incorrect, dangerous, and downright weird answers generated by Google's new AI Overviews feature</a>. Since then, Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/">offered a partial apology/explanation</a> for generating those kinds of results and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-overviews-rollback.html">reportedly rolled back the feature's rollout</a> for at least some types of queries.</p>
<p>But the more I've thought about that rollout, the more I've begun to question the wisdom of Google's AI-powered search results in the first place. Even when the system doesn't give obviously wrong results, condensing search results into a neat, compact, AI-generated summary seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of how people use Google in the first place.</p>
<h2>Reliability and relevance</h2>
<p>When people type a question into the Google search bar, they only sometimes want the kind of basic reference information that can be found on a Wikipedia page or corporate website (or even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/european-copyright-google-tax-on-snippets/">a Google information snippet</a>). Often, they're looking for subjective information where there is no one "right" answer: "What are the best Mexican restaurants in Santa Fe?" or "What should I do with my kids on a rainy day?" or "How can I prevent cheese from sliding off my pizza?"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028826#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028826&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Microsoft’s Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs come with quite a few new AI and machine learning-driven features, but the tentpole is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-new-recall-feature-will-record-everything-you-do-on-your-pc/">Recall</a>. Described by Microsoft as a comprehensive record of everything you do on your PC, the feature is pitched as a way to help users remember where they’ve been and to provide Windows extra contextual information that can help it better understand requests from and meet the needs of individual users.</p>
<p>This, as many users in infosec communities on social media <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@chetwisniewski@securitycafe.ca/112475715570662237">immediately pointed out</a>, sounds like a potential security nightmare. That’s doubly true because Microsoft says that by default, Recall’s screenshots take no pains to redact sensitive information, from usernames and passwords to health care information to NSFW site visits. By default, on a PC with 256GB of storage, Recall can store a couple dozen gigabytes of data across three months of PC usage, a huge amount of personal data.</p>

<p>The line between “potential security nightmare” and “actual security nightmare” is at least partly about the implementation, and Microsoft <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy-and-control-over-your-recall-experience-d404f672-7647-41e5-886c-a3c59680af15">has been saying things that are at least superficially reassuring</a>. Copilot+ PCs are required to have a fast neural processing unit (NPU) so that processing can be performed locally rather than sending data to the cloud; local snapshots are protected at rest by Windows’ disk encryption technologies, which are generally on by default if you’ve signed into a Microsoft account; neither Microsoft nor other users on the PC are supposed to be able to access any particular user’s Recall snapshots; and users can choose to exclude apps or (in most browsers) individual websites to exclude from Recall’s snapshots.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028683#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028683&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Elon Musk is yet again being accused of diverting Tesla resources to his other companies. This time, it's high-end H100 GPU clusters from Nvidia. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-ordered-nvidia-ship-thousands-ai-chips-reserved-tesla-x-xai-rcna155371">CNBC's Lora Kolodny reports</a> that while Tesla ordered these pricey computers, emails from Nvidia staff show that Musk instead redirected 12,000 GPUs to be delivered to his social media company X.</p>
<p>It's almost unheard of for a profitable automaker to pivot its business into another sector, but that appears to be the plan at Tesla as Musk continues to say that the electric car company is instead destined to be an AI and robotics firm instead.</p>
<h2>Does Tesla make cars or AI?</h2>
<p>That explains why <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-profits-drop-55-as-elon-musk-dodges-cheap-car-questions/">Musk told investors in April</a> that Tesla had spent $1 billion on GPUs in the first three months of this year, almost as much as it spent on R&amp;D, despite being desperate for new models to add to what is now an old and very limited product lineup that is suffering rapidly declining sales in <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/tesla-model-3-model-y-drag-evs-down-us-registration-data">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-china-made-ev-sales-fall-66-yy-may-2024-06-04/">China</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028780#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028780&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Surgeons in New York have removed a pig kidney less than two months after <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/combined-heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-surgery/">transplanting it into Lisa Pisano, a 54-year-old woman</a> with kidney failure who also needed a mechanical heart pump. The team behind the transplant says there were problems with the heart pump, not the pig kidney, and that the patient is in stable condition.</p>
<p>Pisano was facing heart and kidney failure and required routine dialysis. She wasn’t eligible to receive a <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/organ-transplants/">traditional heart and kidney transplant</a> from a human donor because of several chronic medical conditions that reduced the likelihood of a good outcome.</p>

<p>Given its recent manufacturing troubles, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/amds-ryzen-ai-300-series-laptop-cpus-are-its-first-for-new-copilot-pcs/">resurgent AMD</a>, an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/">incursion from Qualcomm</a>, and Apple’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/review-apples-efficient-m3-macbook-airs-are-just-about-as-good-as-laptops-get/">shift from customer to competitor</a>, it’s been a rough few years for Intel’s processors. Computer buyers have more viable options than they have in many years, and in many ways the company’s Meteor Lake architecture was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/intels-meteor-lake-cpus-bring-a-much-faster-gpu-radically-new-chip-design/">more interesting as a technical achievement</a> than it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/intel-intros-first-meteor-lake-chips-with-faster-gpus-and-worse-single-core-speed/">as an upgrade</a> for previous-generation Raptor Lake processors.</p>
<p>But even given all of that, Intel still provides the vast majority of PC CPUs—nearly four-fifths of all computer CPUs sold are Intel’s, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7173194948257808385/">recent analyst estimates from Canalys</a>. The company still casts a long shadow, and what it does still helps set the pace for the rest of the industry.</p>

<p>Enter its next-generation CPU architecture, codenamed Lunar Lake. We’ve known about Lunar Lake for a while—Intel reminded everyone it was coming when Qualcomm upstaged it during Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC reveal—but this month at Computex the company is going into more detail ahead of availability sometime in Q3 of 2024.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028454#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028454&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cloud storage provider Snowflake said that accounts belonging to multiple customers have been hacked after threat actors obtained credentials through info-stealing malware or by purchasing them on online crime forums.</p>
<p>Ticketmaster parent Live Nation—which <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1335258/000133525824000081/lyv-20240520.htm?=7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343">disclosed Friday</a> that hackers gained access to data it stored through an unnamed third-party provider—<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/live-nation-confirms-ticketmaster-was-hacked-says-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/">told TechCrunch</a> the provider was Snowflake. The live-event ticket broker said it identified the hack on May 20, and a week later, a “criminal threat actor offered what it alleged to be Company user data for sale via the dark web.”</p>
<p>Ticketmaster is one of six Snowflake customers to be hit in the hacking campaign, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/112538305342479437">said</a> independent security researcher Kevin Beaumont, citing conversations with people inside the affected companies. Australia’s Signal Directorate <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/112538305342479437">said Saturday</a> it knew of “successful compromises of several companies utilizing Snowflake environments.” Researchers with security firm Hudson Rock said in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240531140540/https://hudsonrock.com/blog/snowflake-massive-breach-access-through-infostealer-infection">now-deleted post</a> that Santander, Spain’s biggest bank, was also hacked in the campaign.

<p>Kids and teens with a high body mass index (BMI) were 29 times more likely to have a high fat mass index compared with youths who had lower BMIs, making the controversial metric a "very good screening tool," according to <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-065960/197382/Screening-Accuracy-of-BMI-for-Adiposity-Among-8-to">a study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics</a>.</p>
<p>The study adds to the long-standing debate about the use of BMI, which has always been an imperfect proxy for assessing a person's body fat, aka adiposity. Last year, the American Medical Association adopted a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/06/american-medical-assoc-blasts-bmi-for-historical-harm-racist-exclusion/">strongly worded policy</a> calling out the calculation's "significant limitations" and "historical harms," including "racist exclusion," because its use is largely based on white populations. But other experts have pushed back, arguing that the maligned metric is still a quick low-cost tool for assessing the health and risks of patients.</p>
<p>BMI, calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared, has long been used as a shorthand way of assessing a person's adiposity. In children, high BMIs are associated with cardiovascular disease risks later in life. But, the metric can also be misleading. Because it is based solely on weight and height, it does not distinguish between fat and lean mass. As such, athletes with relatively large amounts of lean muscle mass can easily have BMIs that put them in the overweight or obesity categories, while those with little lean mass but high fat mass can still have BMIs in a normal range. BMI also does not tell clinicians anything about body fat distribution, which can be important for health risks. And research has found that the relationship between BMI and adiposity can differ by race and ethnicity. For instance, at the same BMI, Black children tend to have less adiposity than white children.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028705#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028705&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It doesn't seem like PlayStation VR2 is having quite the same success as its predecessor, which was a runaway hit at a moment when public curiosity and investment in VR were at an all-time high. Nonetheless, it's one of the most advanced VR headsets available—tied to a tiny library on the PS5.</p>
<p>That's about to change, as Sony has confirmed its plans to launch a PC adapter for the headset on August 7. It will cost $60, and it will, at a minimum, let PSVR2 owners play a large library of SteamVR titles, provided their PCs meet the minimum specifications.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">Sony's blog post</a> about the adapter says players will need a Steam account, so it's unclear how or whether you can use the headset to dive into PC VR experiences through various channels besides Steam.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028680#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028680&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
