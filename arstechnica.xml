                            <![CDATA[<p>Mission patches are a decades-old tradition in spaceflight. They can range from the figurative to the abstract, prompting valuable insights or feeding confusion. Some are just plain weird.</p>
<p>Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/after-60-years-of-spaceflight-patches-here-are-some-of-our-favorites/">published a story</a> a few months ago on spaceflight patches from NASA, SpaceX, Russia, and the NRO, the US government's spy satellite agency, which is responsible for some of the most head-scratching mission logos.</p>
<p>Until recently, China's entries in the realm of spaceflight patches often lacked the originality found in patches from the West. For example, a <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/001665.html">series of patches</a> for China's human spaceflight missions used a <a href="http://spacefacts.de/mission/english/shenzhou_13.htm">formulaic design</a> with a <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/001749.html">circular shape</a> and a mix of <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/001780.html">red and blue</a>. The patch for China's most recent Shenzhou crew to the country's Tiangong space station last month finally broke the mold with a <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/001939.html">triangular shape</a> after China's human spaceflight agency put the patch up for a public vote.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/do-these-buddhist-gods-hint-at-the-purpose-of-chinas-super-secret-satellites/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>My Ars colleagues were kicking back at the Orbital HQ water cooler the other day, and—as gracefully aging gamers are wont to do—they began to reminisce about classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment">Sierra On-Line adventure games</a>. I was a huge fan of these games in my youth, so I settled in for some hot buttered nostalgia.</p>
<p>Would we remember the limited-palette joys of early King's Quest, Space Quest, or Quest for Glory titles? Would we branch out beyond games with "Quest" in their titles, seeking rarer fare like<em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Pharkas:_Frontier_Pharmacist">Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist</a></em>? What about the gothic stylings of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colonel%27s_Bequest">The Colonel's Bequest</a></em> or the voodoo-curious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Knight:_Sins_of_the_Fathers"><em>Gabriel Knight</em></a>?</p>
<p>Nope. The talk was of acorns. [Bleeping] acorns, in fact.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/sierra-made-the-games-of-my-childhood-are-they-still-fun-to-play/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, the US health department announced a plan to <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fda-to-remove-ingestible-fluoride-drug-products-for-children.html">ban prescription fluoride supplements for children</a>. These ingested fluoride products are dispensed at safe doses by doctors and dentists to prevent tooth decay in children who are unable to get adequate fluoride doses from community water systems—something that may become more common as more states and cities remove or ban fluoride from their water.</p>
<p>Both the American Dental Association (ADA) and <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/FAQ-Fluoride-and-Children.aspx">the American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommend fluoridating community water and <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Fluoride-Supplements.aspx">advise prescribing fluoride supplements for children</a> who do not get adequate fluoride dosages through their water.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under anti-vaccine advocate and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr states without clear evidence that fluoride supplements harm children's microbiome and pose other health risks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/rfk-jr-wants-to-ban-fluoride-supplements-based-on-nonsense/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Spotify rushed to remove hundreds of obviously fake podcasts found to be marketing prescription drugs in violation of Spotify's policies and, likely, federal law.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Business Insider (BI) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-takes-down-podcasts-peddling-drugs-opioids-2025-5">reported</a> that Spotify removed 200 podcasts advertising the sale of opioids and other drugs, but that wasn't the end of the scandal. Today, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/tech/spotify-removing-drug-sales-podcasts">revealed</a> that it easily uncovered dozens more fake podcasts peddling drugs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the podcasts may have raised a red flag for a human moderator—with titles like "My Adderall Store" or "Xtrapharma.com" and episodes titled "Order Codeine Online Safe Pharmacy Louisiana" or "Order Xanax 2 mg Online Big Deal On Christmas Season," CNN reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/spotify-plays-whack-a-mole-with-fake-podcasts-selling-drugs-scamming-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For a short period of time on Friday, Darth Vader could drop F-bombs in the video game <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a voice AI implementation gone wrong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/">reports GameSpot</a>. Epic Games rapidly deployed a hotfix after players encountered the Sith Lord responding to their comments with profanity and strong language.</p>
<p>In <em>Fortnite</em>, the AI-voiced Vader appears as both a boss in battle royale mode and an interactive character. The official Star Wars website <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">encourages players</a> to "ask him all your pressing questions about the Force, the Galactic Empire… or you know, a good strat for the last Storm circle," adding that "the Sith Lord has opinions."</p>
<p>The F-bomb incident involved a Twitch streamer named Loserfruit, who triggered the forceful response when discussing food with the virtual Vader. The Dark Lord of the Sith responded by repeating her words "freaking" and "fucking" before adding, "Such vulgarity does not become you, Padme." The exchange <a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805">spread virally</a> across social media platforms on Friday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/the-empire-strikes-back-with-f-bombs-ai-darth-vader-goes-rogue-with-profanity-slurs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The rapid expansion of generative AI has changed the way Google and other tech giants design products, but most of the AI features you've used are running on remote servers with a ton of processing power. Your phone <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-says-the-pixel-8-will-get-its-new-ai-model-but-ram-usage-is-a-concern/">has a lot less power</a>, but Google appears poised to give developers some important new mobile AI tools. At I/O next week, Google will likely announce a new set of APIs to let developers leverage the capabilities of Gemini Nano for on-device AI.</p>
<p>Google has quietly published documentation on big new AI features for developers. According to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-nano-ml-kit-genai-api-3558292/">Android Authority</a>, an update to the ML Kit SDK will add API support for on-device generative AI features via Gemini Nano. It's built on AI Core, similar to the experimental Edge AI SDK, but it plugs into an existing model with a set of predefined features that should be easy for developers to implement.</p>
<p>Google says ML Kit’s GenAI APIs will enable apps to do summarization, proofreading, rewriting, and image description without sending data to the cloud. However, Gemini Nano doesn't have as much power as the cloud-based version, so expect some limitations. For example, Google notes that summaries can only have a maximum of three bullet points, and image descriptions will only be available in English. The quality of outputs could also vary based on the version of Gemini Nano on a phone. The standard version (Gemini Nano XS) is about 100MB in size, but Gemini Nano XXS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/">as seen on the Pixel 9a</a> is a quarter of the size. It's text-only and has a much smaller context window.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-to-give-app-devs-access-to-gemini-nano-for-on-device-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>News broke yesterday that researchers in Philadelphia <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2025/may/worlds-first-patient-treated-with-personalized-crispr-therapy">appear to have successfully treated a 6-month-old baby boy</a>, called KJ, with a personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy. The treatment corrects an ultra-rare mutation in KJ that breaks a liver enzyme. That enzyme is required to convert ammonia, a byproduct of metabolism, to urea, a waste product released in urine. Without treatment, ammonia would build up to dangerous levels in KJ—and he would have a 50 percent chance of dying in infancy.</p>
<p>While the gene-editing treatment isn't a complete cure, and long-term success is still uncertain, KJ's condition has improved and stabilized. And the treatment's positive results appear to be a first for personalizing gene editing.</p>
<p>Now, who doesn't love a good story about a seemingly miraculous medical treatment saving a cute, chubby-cheeked baby? But, this story delivers more than an adorable bundle of joy; the big triumph is the striking timeline of the treatment's development—and the fact that it provides a template for how to treat other babies with ultra-rare mutations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/the-remarkable-timeline-of-a-custom-gene-editing-therapy-to-save-a-newborn/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We've been expecting it for a while, and now it's here: OpenAI has introduced an agentic coding tool called Codex in research preview. The tool is meant to allow experienced developers to delegate rote and relatively simple programming tasks to an AI agent that will generate production-ready code and show its work along the way.</p>
<p>Codex is a unique interface (not to be confused with the Codex CLI tool introduced by OpenAI last month) that can be reached from the side bar in the ChatGPT web app. Users enter a prompt and then click either "code" to have it begin producing code, or "ask" to have it answer questions and advise.</p>
<p>Whenever it's given a task, that task is performed in a distinct container that is preloaded with the user's codebase and is meant to accurately reflect their development environment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-introduces-codex-its-first-full-fledged-ai-agent-for-coding/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As we often like to remind people, beware buying any car in its first model year. It takes a little while for any OEM to find its feet with a new model, and now there's half-baked software that can need frequent updating to worry about in addition to any mechanical woes. I bring this up because various bugs meant that an electric car we were supposed to review had to be repeatedly postponed, as it was away being fixed, and as a result our week with the 2025 Volvo V60 Cross Country turned into two. And what a pleasant two weeks they were.</p>
<p>The Volvo station wagon is not in its first production year. Any criticism of its onboard electronics would focus more on the fact that they are now increasingly vintage, but that also means the bugs have mostly been squashed by now. Sadly, Volvo killed off the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/10/the-volvo-v60-wagon-is-a-perfect-antidote-to-the-bloated-crossover/">regular V60 station wagon</a> earlier this year, but you can still buy the Cross Country version, which starts at $51,495, including the delivery charge.</p>
<p>As the name probably implies, the V60 Cross Country has some adaptations for unpaved roads: it rides a little higher and on softer suspension, and there's protective cladding here and there that gives this wagon a bit of a bold stance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/more-bounce-to-the-ounce-the-2025-volvo-v60-cross-country-review/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>How did reptilian things that looked something like crocodiles get to the Caribbean islands from South America millions of years ago? They probably walked.</p>
<p>The existence of any prehistoric apex predators in the islands of the Caribbean used to be doubted. While their absence would have probably made it even more of a paradise for prey animals, fossils unearthed in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic have revealed that these islands were crawling with monster crocodyliform species called sebecids, ancient relatives of crocodiles.</p>
<p>While sebecids first emerged during the Cretaceous, this is the first evidence of them lurking outside South America during the Cenozoic epoch, which began 66 million years ago. An international team of researchers has found that these creatures would stalk and hunt in the Caribbean islands millions of years after similar predators went extinct on the South American mainland. Lower sea levels back then could have exposed enough land to walk across.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/carnivorous-crocodile-like-monsters-used-to-terrorize-the-caribbean/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Meta thinks there's no reason to carry on with its defense after the Federal Trade Commission closed its monopoly case, and the company has moved to end the trial early by claiming that the FTC utterly failed to prove its case.</p>
<p>"The FTC has no proof that Meta has monopoly power," Meta's <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FTC-v-Meta-Motion-for-Judgment-5-15-25.pdf">motion for judgment</a> filed Thursday said, "and therefore the court should rule in favor of Meta."</p>
<p>According to Meta, the FTC failed to show evidence that "the overall quality of Meta’s apps has declined" or that the company shows too many ads to users. Meta says that's "fatal" to the FTC's case that the company wielded monopoly power to pursue more ad revenue while degrading user experience over time (an Internet trend known as "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/as-internet-enshittification-marches-on-here-are-some-of-the-worst-offenders/">enshittification"</a>). And on top of allegedly showing no evidence of "ad load, privacy, integrity, and features" degradation on Meta apps, Meta argued there's no precedent for an antitrust claim rooted in this alleged harm.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/meta-says-no-proof-of-monopoly-power-wants-ftc-case-dismissed-mid-trial/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Volkswagen provided flights from Los Angeles to Bozeman, Montana, and accommodation so Ars could drive the new Tiguan. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>In the modern era, cars keep getting bigger and bigger between generations. Or at least, they're certainly not getting smaller. That's especially true in America, where bigger is always better and the vehicles in the current crop of "compact" crossovers are now nearly as large as full-size SUVs from a decade ago. <span style="color: #bfbfbf;">Don’t ask about curb weights, either, as more powerful drivetrains, including widespread adoption of hybrid-electric components, add significant mass, as highlighted by </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-bmw-m5-touring-review-way-more-power-way-too-much-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new BMW M5 "sport sedan."</a><span style="color: #bfbfbf;"> </span></p>
<p>Within that fray, however, the new Volkswagen Tiguan stands apart. VW purposefully refined the third-gen Tiguan to cater better to American consumer needs, which meant dropping the third row to create more interior volume for the front and rear seats. The wheelbase still measures the same length at 109.9 inches (2,791 mm), but shorter overhangs mean the overall length actually shrinks by nearly two inches. Yet more efficient packaging on the inside also results in a marginal passenger volume increase of about two percent.</p>
<p>To help keep pricing attractive at below $30,000 to start, VW also decided to skip out on a hybrid variant, but the new EA888evo5 2.0 L turbocharged-four nonetheless delivers more power and improved fuel economy. And all of the above actually contributes to the Tiguan losing weight while evolving from the second to third generation, shaving about 160 lbs (72.5 kg), depending on trim.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-vw-tiguan-caters-to-us-tastes-at-an-affordable-price/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Nintendo took the wraps off the Switch 2 in early April, it announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/some-original-switch-games-will-run-better-on-switch-2-some-wont-run-at-all/">around a dozen first-party Switch games</a> would be getting free updates that would add some Switch 2-specific benefits to older games running on the new console. We could safely assume that these updates wouldn't be as extensive as the $10 and $20 paid upgrade packs for games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, but Nintendo's page didn't initially provide any game-specific details.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">updated its support page</a> with more game-by-game details about what players of these older games can expect on the new hardware. The baseline improvement for most games is "improved image quality" and optimizations for the Switch 2's built-in display, but others include support for GameShare multiplayer, support for the new Joy-Cons' mouse controls, support for HDR TVs, and other tweaks.</p>
<p>The most significant of the announced updates are frame rate improvements for <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, the main-series <em>Pokémon</em> games released in late 2022. Most latter-day Switch games suffered from frame rate dips here and there, as newer games outstripped the capabilities of a low-power tablet processor that had already been a couple of years old when the Switch launched in 2017. But the <em>Pokémon</em> performance problems were so pervasive and widely commented-upon that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/nintendo-is-working-on-improvements-to-latest-pokemon-games-after-buggy-launch/">Nintendo released a rare apology</a> promising to improve the game post-release. Subsequent patches helped somewhat but could never deliver a consistently smooth frame rate; perhaps new hardware will finally deliver what software patches couldn't.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/pokemon-scarlet-violet-frame-rate-fixes-are-among-the-switch-2s-free-game-updates/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, the world was a bit perplexed by the Grok LLM's sudden insistence on turning practically every response <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/xais-grok-suddenly-cant-stop-bringing-up-white-genocide-in-south-africa/">toward the topic of alleged "white genocide" in South Africa</a>. xAI now says that odd behavior was the result of "an unauthorized modification" to the Grok system prompt—the core set of directions for how the LLM should behave.</p>
<p>That prompt modification "directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic" and "violated xAI's internal policies and core values," xAI <a href="https://x.com/xai/status/1923183620606619649">wrote on social media</a>. The code review process in place for such changes was "circumvented in this incident," it continued, without providing further details on how such circumvention could occur.</p>
<p>To prevent similar problems from happening in the future, xAI says it has now implemented "additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can't modify the prompt without review" as well as putting in place "a 24/7 monitoring team" to respond to any widespread issues with Grok's responses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/groks-white-genocide-obsession-came-from-unauthorized-prompt-edit-xai-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When my colleague Kyle Orland submitted <a href="https://kertisjones.itch.io/tetrisweeper"><em>Tetrisweeper</em></a> for a list of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/">Ars' favorite 2024 games not from 2024</a>, I told him, essentially: "Good for you, not for me." I'm a pedestrian <em>Tetris</em> player, at best, so the idea of managing a whole different game mechanic, while trying to clear lines and prevent stack-ups, sounded like taking a standardized test while baking a three-layer cake.</p>
<p>And yet, here I am, sneaking rounds of <em>Drop Duchy</em> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/drop-duchy-f46b7e">Epic</a>, for Windows/Linux via Proton) into lunch breaks, weekend mornings, and other bits of downtime. <em>Drop Duchy</em> is similarly not just a <em>Tetris</em>-esque block-dropper. It also has you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligning terrain types for resources</li>
<li>Placing both your troops and the enemy's</li>
<li>Choosing which cards to upgrade, sell, and bring into battle</li>
<li>Picking between terrain types to leave behind</li>
<li>Upgrading a tech tree with achievements</li>
<li>Picking the sequence of battles for maximum effectiveness</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Drop Duchy</em> is a quirky game, one that hasn't entirely fused together its various influences without some seams showing. But I keep returning to it, even as it beats me to a pulp on Normal mode, based on decisions I made five rounds ago. It feels like a medium-deep board game, played at triple speed, with someone across the table timing you on how fast you arrange your tiles.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/drop-duchy-is-a-deck-building-tetris-like-carcassonne-esque-puzzler/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.44 of the Rocket Report! We had some interesting news on Thursday afternoon from Down Under. As Gilmour Space was preparing for the second launch attempt of its Eris vehicle, as part of the pre-launch preparations, something triggered the payload fairing to deploy. We would love to see some video of that. Please.</p>

<p><strong>Rotating detonation rocket engine takes flight</strong>. On Wednesday, US-based propulsion company Venus Aerospace completed a short flight test of its rotating detonation rocket engine at Spaceport America in New Mexico, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/venus-aerospace-flies-its-rotating-detonation-rocket-engine-for-the-first-time/">Ars reports</a>. It is believed to be the first US-based flight test of an idea that has been discussed academically for decades. The concept has previously been tested in a handful of other countries, but never with a high-thrust engine.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-how-is-your-payload-fairing-poland-launches-test-rocket/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The payload fairing at the top of Gilmour Space's first Eris rocket was supposed to deploy a few minutes after lifting off from northeastern Australia. Instead, the nose cone fell off the rocket hours before it was supposed to leave the launch pad Thursday.</p>
<p>Gilmour, the Australian startup that developed the Eris rocket, announced the setback in a post to the company's social media accounts Thursday.</p>
<p>"During final launch preparations last night, an electrical fault triggered the system that opens the rocket’s nose cone (the payload fairing)," Gilmour <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7328897706481909761/">posted on LinkedIn</a>. "This happened before any fuel was loaded into the vehicle. Most importantly, no one was injured, and early checks show no damage to the rocket or the launch pad."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/the-top-fell-off-australias-first-orbital-class-rocket-delaying-its-launch/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The FBI is warning people to be vigilant of an ongoing malicious messaging campaign that uses AI-generated voice audio to impersonate government officials in an attempt to trick recipients into clicking on links that can infect their computers.</p>
<p>“Since April 2025, malicious actors have impersonated senior US officials to target individuals, many of whom are current or former senior US federal or state government officials and their contacts,” <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250515">Thursday’s advisory</a> from the bureau’s Internet Crime Complaint Center said. “If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic.”</p>
<h2>Think you can’t be fooled? Think again.</h2>
<p>The campaign's creators are sending AI-generated voice messages—better known as deepfakes—along with text messages “in an effort to establish rapport before gaining access to personal accounts,” FBI officials said. Deepfakes use AI to mimic the voice and speaking characteristics of a specific individual. The differences between the authentic and simulated speakers are often indistinguishable without trained analysis. Deepfake videos work similarly.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/fbi-warns-of-ongoing-scam-that-uses-deepfake-audio-to-impersonate-government-officials/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Masked men jumped out of a white-panel van in Paris this week, attempting to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/europe/paris-kidnap-crypto-attack-intl?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc">snatch a 34-year-old woman off the street</a>. The woman's husband fought back and suffered a fractured skull, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_VVNCmfxso">France24</a>. The woman continued resisting long enough for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/parisian-hailed-hero-helping-thwart-crypto-kidnapping-2025-05-14/">bike shop owner named Nabil</a> to rush out swinging a fire extinguisher, which he hurled after the departing van as the attackers finally fled. The entire altercation was captured on video.</p>
<p>The woman was identified as the daughter of a "crypto boss," and her attempted kidnapping is part of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/">disquieting surge in European crypto-related abductions</a>—two of which have already involved fingers being chopped off. The last major abduction happened in Paris only two weeks ago, and it ended with French police storming a house in the Paris suburbs and rescuing a crypto mogul's now-four-fingered father.</p>
<p>The attacks have spooked the industry, which has called, somewhat ironically, for enhanced protections from the government. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/woman-escapes-botched-kidnapping-paris-gangs-target-crypto-wealth-2025-05-14/">notes </a>that the issue has been escalated all the way to the top of the French government, where Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced plans this week to "meet with French crypto entrepreneurs to make them aware of the risks and to take measures to protect them."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/fractured-skulls-and-ski-masks-more-crypto-kidnap-madness-on-the-streets-of-paris/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has continued to design, manufacture, and sell new Surface hardware since longtime team leader Panos Panay <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/panos-panay-leader-of-the-surface-and-windows-teams-is-leaving-microsoft/">left the company for Amazon in late 2023</a>, including both Intel- and Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro tablets and Surface Laptops. New <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsofts-12-inch-surface-pro-is-cheaper-but-unfixes-a-decade-old-design-problem/">smaller versions</a> of both of these mainstays were introduced<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/lighter-cheaper-surface-laptop-saves-a-little-money-but-gives-up-a-lot/"> just a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>But the weirder, more unique parts of the Surface lineup have been mostly neglected since Panay's departure. Late last year, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/microsoft-discontinues-lackadaisically-updated-surface-studio-all-in-one-desktop/">discontinued the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop</a>, which was never updated consistently and started at a whopping $4,300. But it provided one of the few alternatives to the basic "monitor with a computer inside it" all-in-one design template. Now, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/667664/surface-laptop-studio-2-end-of-life-notepad">reports</a> that Microsoft stopped manufacturing the Surface Laptop Studio 2 earlier this month and that the PC will disappear after current retail stock is sold.</p>
