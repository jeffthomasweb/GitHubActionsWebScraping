                            <![CDATA[<p>In a small randomized controlled trial, people lost twice as much weight when their diet was limited to minimally processed food compared to when they switched to a diet that included ultraprocessed versions of foods but was otherwise nutritionally matched.</p>
<p>The trial, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0">published in Nature Medicine</a> by researchers at University College London, adds to a growing body of evidence that food processing, in addition to simple nutrition content, influences our weight and health. Ultraprocessed foods have already been vilified for their link to obesity—largely through weaker observational studies—but researchers have struggled to shore up the connection with high-quality studies and understand their impact on health.</p>
<p>The ultraprocessed foods researchers provided in the new trial were relatively healthy ones—as ultraprocessed foods go. They included things like multigrain breakfast cereal, packaged granola bars, flavored yogurt cups, fruit snacks, commercially premade chicken sandwiches, instant noodles, and ready-made lasagna. But, in the minimally processed trial diet, participants received meals from a caterer rather than ones from a grocery store aisle. The diet included overnight oats with fresh fruit, plain yogurt with toasted oats and fruit, handmade fruit and nut bars, freshly made chicken salad, and from-scratch stir fry and spaghetti Bolognese.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/in-trial-people-lost-twice-as-much-weight-by-ditching-ultraprocessed-food/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple released a new developer beta build of macOS 26 Tahoe today, and it came with another big update for a familiar icon. The old Macintosh HD hard drive icon, for years represented by a facsimile of an old spinning hard drive, has been replaced with something clearly intended to resemble a solid-state drive (the SSD in your Mac <em>actually</em> looks like a handful of chips soldered to a circuit board, but we'll forgive the creative license).</p>
<p>The Macintosh HD icon became less visible a few years back, when new macOS installs stopped showing your internal disk on the desktop by default. It has also been many years since Apple shifted to SSDs as the primary boot media for new Macs. It's not clear why the icon is being replaced now, instead of years ago—maybe the icon had started <a href="https://www.securedatarecovery.com/blog/hard-drive-clicking">clicking</a>, and Apple just wanted to replace it before it suffered from catastrophic icon failure—but regardless, the switch is logical (this is a computer storage pun).</p>
<h2>An iconic life</h2>
<p>The original hard drive icon dates back to 2000, when Apple introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2000/01/macos-x-gui/">the new look and feel of Mac OS X</a> to the public through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/09/macos-x-beta/">the third of four public developer betas</a> (scroll down far enough in our original coverage, and you can spot the hard drive icon in some of the screenshots).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/rip-to-the-macintosh-hd-hard-drive-icon-2000-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration is telling states they will be shut out of a $42 billion broadband deployment fund if they set the rates that Internet service providers receiving subsidies are allowed to charge people with low incomes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/BEAD_FAQs_v13.pdf">latest version</a> of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) FAQ on the grant program, released today, is a challenge to states considering laws that would force Internet providers to offer cheap plans to people who meet income eligibility guidelines. One state already has such a law: New York requires ISPs with over 20,000 customers in the state to offer $15 broadband plans with download speeds of at least 25Mbps, or $20-per-month service with 200Mbps speeds.</p>
<p>Other states have been considering similar laws, and were initially emboldened by New York winning a yearslong court battle against ISPs that tried to invalidate the state law. But states may now be dissuaded by the Trump administration's stance against price mandates being applied to the grant program.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/trump-admin-warns-states-dont-try-to-lower-broadband-prices/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>His company used "intimidation tactics" to sidestep regulatory scrutiny, it was a "toxic" workplace, and its safety culture was "critically flawed." The <em>Titan</em> itself was "undocumented, unregistered, non-certificated, [and] unclassed." As for Rush, he managed to "completely ignore vital inspections, data analyses, and preventative maintenance procedures." The result was a "catastrophic event" that occurred when 4,930 pounds per square inch of water pressure cracked the sub open and crushed its five occupants during a dive to the <em>Titanic</em> wreckage site.</p>
<p>Had Rush somehow survived, the report says, he would have been referred for prosecution.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/titan-sub-implosion-caused-by-absolutely-bonkers-toxic-workplace-environment/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/epa-plans-to-ignore-science-stop-regulating-greenhouse-gases/">made lots of headlines</a> by rejecting the document that establishes its ability to regulate the greenhouse gases that are warming our climate. While the legal assault on regulations grabbed most of the attention, it was paired with two other actions that targeted other aspects of climate change: the science underlying our current understanding of the dramatic warming the Earth is experiencing, and the renewable energy that represents our best chance of limiting this warming.</p>
<p>Collectively, these actions illuminate the administration's strategy for dealing with a problem that it would prefer to believe doesn't exist, despite our extensive documentation of its reality. They also show how the administration is tailoring its approach to different audiences, including the audience of one who is demanding inaction.</p>
<h2>When in doubt, make something up</h2>
<p>The simplest thing to understand is an action by the Department of the Interior, which handles permitting for energy projects on federal land—including wind and solar, both onshore and off. That has placed the Interior in an awkward position. Wind and solar are now generally the cheapest ways to generate electricity and are currently in the process of a spectacular boom, with solar now accounting for over 80 percent of the newly installed capacity in the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/analysis-the-trump-administrations-assault-on-climate-action/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At a time when subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) streaming services keep getting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/streaming-prices-climb-in-2025-after-already-surpassing-inflation-rates/">more expensive</a> and their ads <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/maxs-longer-commercial-breaks-bring-ad-load-to-6-minutes-per-hour/">more extensive</a>, Roku’s new streaming service, Howdy, is worth a closer look.</p>
<p><a href="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/browse/howdy">Howdy</a> launched today in the US for $3 per month. It is currently only accessible via a web browser or the Howdy app on Roku OS. Roku said in its announcement today that Howdy will roll out to “mobile and additional platforms in the near future."</p>
<p>Howdy has, per Roku, “nearly 10,000 hours” of content from Warner Bros. Discovery, Lionsgate, and Filmrise. That’s a much smaller number of content distribution partners than what you’ll find on Roku’s flagship streaming service, The Roku Channel, which has shows and movies from companies like AMC Networks, MGM, NBCUniversal, and Paramount. (Roku also makes the Roku OS operating systems for smart TVs and streaming devices and Roku-brand TVs, and runs the Frndly TV streaming service.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/roku-gets-frugal-with-the-content-and-price-of-its-new-streaming-service/">Read full article</a></p>

Information included names, organization names, addresses, Cisco assigned user IDs, email addresses, phone numbers, and account-related metadata such as creation date.</p>

<p>Cisco said that the breach didn’t expose customers’ confidential or proprietary information, password data, or other sensitive information.

                            <![CDATA[<p>A federal jury found on Friday that Meta violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act, the state's wiretap law, by collecting data from a period-tracker app without user consent.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs in a class-action case proved by a preponderance of evidence that Meta intentionally eavesdropped on and/or recorded conversations using an electronic device, said a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.372884/gov.uscourts.cand.372884.756.0_2.pdf">verdict form</a> released yesterday in US District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs also proved that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy and that Meta did not have consent from all parties to eavesdrop on and/or record the conversations, the jury found.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in 2021 against Flo Health, maker of an app for tracking periods, ovulation, and pregnancy. Facebook owner Meta, Google, and app analytics company Flurry were added as defendants later. The plaintiffs settled with <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.372884/gov.uscourts.cand.372884.740.0_1.pdf">Flo Health</a>, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.372884/gov.uscourts.cand.372884.696.0.pdf">Google</a>, and <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.372884/gov.uscourts.cand.372884.589.0.pdf">Flurry</a> before the trial, leaving Meta as the only remaining defendant.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/jury-finds-meta-broke-wiretap-law-by-collecting-data-from-period-tracker-app/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is preparing to raise what could be its final defense to stop The New York Times from digging through a spectacularly broad range of ChatGPT logs to hunt for any copyright-infringing outputs that could become the most damning evidence in the hotly watched case.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NYT-v-OpenAI-Letter-Confidential-Settlement-7-31-25.pdf">joint letter</a> Thursday, both sides requested to hold a confidential settlement conference on August 7. Ars confirmed with the NYT's legal team that the conference is not about settling the case but instead was scheduled to settle one of the most disputed aspects of the case: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/nyt-to-start-searching-deleted-chatgpt-logs-after-beating-openai-in-court/">news plaintiffs searching through millions of ChatGPT logs</a>.</p>
<p>That means it's possible that this week, ChatGPT users will have a much clearer understanding of whether their private chats might be accessed in the lawsuit. In the meantime, OpenAI has <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NYT-v-OpenAI-Letter-from-OpenAI-8-4-25.pdf">broken down</a> the "highly complex" process required to make deleted chats searchable in order to block the NYT's request for broader access.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/openai-offers-20-million-user-chats-in-chatgpt-lawsuit-nyt-wants-120-million/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>OpenAI is releasing new generative AI models today, and no, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/openais-most-capable-ai-model-gpt-5-may-be-coming-in-august/">GPT-5</a> is not one of them. Depending on how you feel about generative AI, these new models may be even more interesting, though. The company is rolling out gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, its first <a href="https://openai.com/open-models">open-weight models</a> since the release of GPT-2 in 2019. You can download and run these models on your own hardware, with support for simulated reasoning, tool use, and deep customization.</p>
<p>When you access the company's proprietary models in the cloud, they're running on powerful server infrastructure that cannot be replicated easily, even in enterprise. The new OpenAI models come in two variants (120b and 20b) to run on less powerful hardware configurations. Both are transformers with a configurable chain of thought (CoT), supporting low, medium, and high settings. The lower settings are faster and use fewer compute resources, but the outputs are better with the highest setting. You can set the CoT level with a single line in the system prompt.</p>
<p>The smaller gpt-oss-20b has a total of 21 billion parameters, utilizing mixture-of-experts (MoE) to reduce that to 3.6 billion parameters per token. As for gpt-oss-120b, its 117 billion parameters come down to 5.1 billion per token with MoE. The company says the smaller model can run on a consumer-level machine with 16GB or more of memory. To run gpt-oss-120b, you need 80GB of memory, which is more than you're likely to find in the average consumer machine. It should fit on a single AI accelerator GPU like the Nvidia H100, though. Both models have a context window of 128,000 tokens.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-releases-its-first-open-source-models-since-2019/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Intel has a lot riding on "18A," its next-generation manufacturing process for silicon chips that the company claims will help it catch up to the lead that competitors like TSMC have built up over the last few years. With 18A, Intel would return to manufacturing its own processor designs in its own factories, including the upcoming Series 3 Core Ultra chips for laptops (codenamed Panther Lake), after manufacturing parts of all other Core Ultra chips with TSMC. Intel is also offering 18A manufacturing capacity to external chipmakers, a major milestone in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-steps-down-after-terrible-no-good-very-bad-year/">former CEO</a> Pat Gelsinger's plan to make Intel a competitive, cutting-edge (and primarily US-based) chip manufacturer for the rest of the industry.</p>
<p>But a Reuters report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/intel-struggles-with-key-manufacturing-process-next-pc-chip-sources-say-2025-08-05/">claims</a> that Intel is struggling to make usable chips on 18A, according to "people who were briefed on the company's test data since late last year." As of this summer, these sources say that just 10 percent of the chips being manufactured on 18A are "up to [Intel's] specifications."</p>
<p>Intel disputed the numbers cited in the report. "Yields are better than that," Intel CFO David Zinsner told Reuters, though neither Zinsner nor Intel provided an alternate figure.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/report-intel-struggles-to-ramp-up-production-on-new-18a-manufacturing-process/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Lift up either side of the new Morgan Plus Four’s engine decklid and no carburetors or velocity stacks materialize on the engine of this otherwise eminently classic-looking car. The latest generation of Plus Four returns to the American market this year for the first time since 2005. But to make it happen, Morgan spent five years homologating the little roadster with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, technically as a replica.</p>
<p>That's why, underneath the left-hand hood, a hilarious list of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards exemptions lays out every way the Plus Four skips out on the usual fare, such as side impact protection, ejection mitigation, a hood latch system, and tire pressure monitoring. Apparently, that’s what it takes to produce a truly lightweight sports car in the modern era.</p>
<p>More importantly, this latest generation of the Plus Four, which debuted in 2020 in other regions, stays shockingly light by now using a bonded aluminum chassis to help with handling and rigidity while harnessing the power output of a modern BMW drivetrain. But Morgan still builds the body on an ash wood frame, proving that the old ways that allowed a tiny British coachbuilder to remain on the market as a low-volume manufacturer at a reasonable price may never truly die.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/2025-morgan-plus-four-classy-fun-but-no-manual-for-the-us-makes-no-sense/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Chances are you haven't been watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_(2021_TV_series)"><em>Invasion</em></a>, an Apple TV+ sci-fi drama overshadowed to some extent by two of the streamer's other sci-fi shows, <em>Silo</em> and <em>Foundation</em>. Yes, <em>Invasion</em> has received mixed reviews for its ponderous pacing (especially in the first season). Even its fans may admit to having something of a love/hate relationship with the show. But the cinematography is gorgeous, and the writers are clearly trying to explore some ambitious themes, with variable success. Apple TV+ just released a trailer for the upcoming third season that suggests this series with so much promise might finally be hitting its stride.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers for first two seasons below.)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)"><em>Invasion</em></a> was created by David Weil (<em>Hunters</em>) and Simon Kinberg (best known for writing and/or producing several <em>X-Men</em> films, as well as <em>The Martian</em>, which was nominated for several Oscars). The first season focused on the initial stages of the titular alien invasion, portraying the events through the eyes of ordinary people around the world—the series is in English, Japanese, and Pashto—as they come to terms with the existential threat Earth is facing. In fact, the aliens take a back seat to the human interactions, which irritated some viewers eager to see actual aliens in a show about an extraterrestrial invasion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/08/invasion-s3-trailer-hints-the-series-is-finally-finding-its-stride/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Electric vehicle maker Rivian filed a lawsuit against the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles this week in an effort to force the state to lift its ban on direct-to-consumer vehicle sales. Rivian is one of a number of new EV startups since Tesla that has abandoned the dealership model for selling cars, but as things currently stand, that remains illegal in many states.</p>
<p>The prohibitions on direct car sales date back to the early days of the automobile and fears that the big American car companies would become too vertically integrated. But there were other benefits to the car companies—supplying cars to franchised dealers allowed them to concentrate their capital on things like production lines and factories rather than a nationwide distribution system.</p>
<p>That's pretty much how things stayed until the early 2010s—despite <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/economic-effects-state-bans-direct-manufacturer-sales-car-buyers">a Justice Department report in 2009</a> that found the laws were harmful to consumers, when a new automotive startup called Tesla decided it wanted to go another way.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/rivian-sues-ohio-over-direct-car-sales-ban/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>While no one has figured out how to make money from generative artificial intelligence, that hasn't stopped Google DeepMind from pushing the boundaries of what's possible with a big pile of inference. The capabilities (and costs) of these models have been on an impressive upward trajectory, a trend exemplified by the reveal of Genie 3. A mere seven months after showing off <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">the Genie 2 "foundational world model,"</a> which was itself a significant improvement over its predecessor, Google now has Genie 3.</p>
<p>With Genie 3, all it takes is a prompt or image to create an interactive world. Since the environment is continuously generated, it can be changed on the fly. You can add or change objects, alter weather conditions, or insert new characters—DeepMind calls these "promptable events." The ability to create alterable 3D environments could make games more dynamic for players and offer developers new ways to prove out concepts and level designs. However, many in the gaming industry have expressed doubt that such tools would help.</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1107194484?color=ff9933"></div><div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300">
    <div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"></div>
    <div class="caption-content">
      Genie 3: building better worlds.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>It's tempting to think of Genie 3 simply as a way to create games, but DeepMind sees this as a research tool, too. Games play a significant role in the development of artificial intelligence because they provide challenging, interactive environments with measurable progress. That's why DeepMind previously turned to games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/deepmind-alphago-go-ke-jie-china/"><em>Go</em></a> and <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/starcraft-2-google-deepmind-ai/">StarCraft</a></em> to expand the bounds of AI.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/deepmind-reveals-genie-3-world-model-that-creates-real-time-interactive-simulations/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This delayed allergic reaction is called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2014.12.1947">alpha-gal syndrome</a>.
