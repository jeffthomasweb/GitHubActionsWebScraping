              <![CDATA[<p>It looked like the final scene of a movie, the denouement of a long adventure in which the good guys finally prevail. Azure skies and brilliant blue seas provided a perfect backdrop on Tuesday evening as a spacecraft carrying four people neared the planet's surface.</p>
<p>"Just breathtaking views of a calm, glass-like ocean off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida," commented Sandra Jones, a NASA spokesperson, during the webcast co-hosted by the space agency and SpaceX, whose Dragon vehicle returned the four astronauts from orbit.</p>
<p>A drone near the landing site captured incredible images of Crew Dragon <em>Freedom</em> as it slowly descended beneath four parachutes. Most of NASA's astronauts today, outside of the small community of spaceflight devotees, are relatively anonymous. But not two of the passengers inside <em>Freedom</em>, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. After nine months of travails, 286 days to be precise, they were finally coming home.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/can-nasa-remain-nonpartisan-when-basic-spaceflight-truths-are-shredded/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's been nearly two years now since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/phil-harrisons-successor-announced-at-sony-shuhei-yoshida/">game industry veteran</a> Phil Harrison <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/after-the-death-of-stadia-vp-phil-harrison-has-left-google/">left Google</a> following the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">implosion of the company's Stadia cloud gaming service</a>. But the passage of time hasn't stopped one company from taking advantage of this week's Game Developers Conference to poke fun at the erstwhile gaming executive for his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meet-the-stadia-developers-blindsided-by-googles-latest-product-shutdown/">alleged mistreatment of developers</a>.</p>
<p>VGC <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/has-a-harrison-fired-you-lately-savage-planet-devs-taunt-former-stadia-boss-phil-harrison-with-gdc-billboard/">spotted a conspicuous billboard</a> in San Francisco's Union Square Monday featuring the overinflated, completely bald head of <em>Gunther</em> Harrison, the fictional Alta Interglobal CEO who was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-will-serve-up-its-dish-in-may-2025/">recently revealed</a> as the blatantly satirical antagonist in the upcoming game <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. A large message atop the billboard asks passersby—including the tens of thousands in town for GDC—"Has a Harrison fired <em>you</em> lately? You might be eligible for emotional support."</p>

<p>While Gunther Harrison probably hasn't fired any GDC attendees, the famously bald Phil Harrison was responsible for the firing of plenty of developers when he <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/report-stadia-undershot-to-the-tune-of-hundreds-of-thousands-of-users/">shut down Google's short-lived Stadia Games &amp; Entertainment (SG&amp;E) publishing imprint</a> in early 2021. That shutdown <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/">surprised a lot of newly jobless game developers</a>, perhaps none moreso than those at Montreal-based Typhoon Games, which Google had <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/google-buys-triple-a-game-dev-typhoon-studio-to-beef-up-stadia/">acquired in late 2019</a> to make what Google's Jade Raymond said at the time would be "platform-defining exclusive content" for Stadia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/developers-gdc-billboard-pokes-at-despised-former-google-stadia-exec/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Asus, Dell, HP, and others to produce powerful desktop machines that run AI models locally.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>During Tuesday's Nvidia GTX keynote, CEO Jensen Huang unveiled two "personal AI supercomputers" called DGX Spark and DGX Station, both powered by the Grace Blackwell platform. In a way, they are a new type of AI PC architecture specifically built for running neural networks, and five major PC manufacturers will build the supercomputers.</p>
<p>These desktop systems, first previewed as "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/nvidias-first-desktop-pc-can-run-local-ai-models-for-3000/">Project DIGITS</a>" in January, aim to bring AI capabilities to developers, researchers, and data scientists who need to prototype, fine-tune, and run large AI models locally. DGX systems can serve as standalone desktop AI labs or "bridge systems" that allow AI developers to move their models from desktops to DGX Cloud or any AI cloud infrastructure with few code changes.</p>
<p>Huang explained the rationale behind these new products in a <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-dgx-spark-and-dgx-station-personal-ai-computers">news release</a>, saying, "AI has transformed every layer of the computing stack. It stands to reason a new class of computers would emerge—designed for AI-native developers and to run AI-native applications."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-dgx-desktop-personal-ai-supercomputers/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday at Nvidia's GTC 2025 conference in San Jose, California, CEO Jensen Huang <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/keynote/">revealed</a> several new AI-accelerating GPUs the company plans to release over the coming months and years. He also revealed more specifications about previously announced chips.</p>
<p>The centerpiece announcement was Vera Rubin, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/nvidia-jumps-ahead-of-itself-and-reveals-next-gen-rubin-ai-chips-in-keynote-tease/">first teased</a> at Computex 2024 and now scheduled for release in the second half of 2026. This GPU, named after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin">famous astronomer</a>, will feature tens of terabytes of memory and comes with a custom Nvidia-designed CPU called Vera.</p>
<p>According to Nvidia, Vera Rubin will deliver significant performance improvements over its predecessor, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">Grace Blackwell</a>, particularly for AI training and inference.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-rubin-ultra-and-feynman-ai-chips-for-2027-and-2028/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Sheriff John Montgomery of Baxter County, Arkansas, isn't going to take it anymore—if by "it" you mean "having to offer lower phone call rates to incarcerated inmates." Noting that such phone calls are "not required to be provided by law," Montgomery is <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/arkansas-jail-cutting-inmate-phone-service-entirely-march-30/">ending all inmate phone calls</a> on March 30, 2025.</p>
<p>The cause of Montgomery's wrath, and of his March 30 date, is the Federal Communications Commission, which set an April 1, 2025, deadline for smaller jails to lower the obscene rates of inmate phone calls. (Larger jails had to comply in January.) According to the FCC, 15-minute phone calls to inmates could run as much as $12.10 in these smaller jails. The Commission now demands that such calls cost no more than $1.35. (You can read the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/ipcs">new rate schedule</a> here.)</p>
<p>The rates are high in part because extra security is required for inmate communications services, but the system had also become a way for local agencies to make money by charging vendors a "site commission payment." In this model, vendors might be selected based less on what was good for security and for inmate families and more on how much cash the vendor could funnel to the jail. FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/fcc-closes-final-loopholes-that-keep-prison-phone-prices-exorbitantly-high/">referred to these payments</a> as "kickbacks."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/rather-than-lower-rates-arkansas-jail-simply-cancels-all-inmate-phone-calls/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On the heels of its release of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-gemini-ai-can-now-see-your-search-history/">new Gemini models</a> last week, Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-collaboration-features/">announced</a> a pair of new features for its flagship AI product. Starting today, Gemini has a new Canvas feature that lets you draft, edit, and refine documents or code. Gemini is also getting Audio Overviews, a neat capability that first appeared in the company's NotebookLM product, but it's getting even more useful as part of Gemini.</p>
<p>Canvas is similar (confusingly) to the OpenAI product of the same name. Canvas is available in the Gemini prompt bar on the web and mobile app. Simply upload a document and tell Gemini what you need to do with it. In Google's example, the user asks for a speech based on a PDF containing class notes. And just like that, Gemini spits out a document.</p>
<p>Canvas lets you refine the AI-generated documents right inside Gemini. The writing tools available across the Google ecosystem, with options like suggested edits and different tones, are available inside the Gemini-based editor. If you want to do more edits or collaborate with others, you can export the document to Google Docs with a single click.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/gemini-gets-new-coding-and-writing-tools-plus-ai-generated-podcasts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Commissioner Geoffrey Starks will resign from the Federal Communications Commission this spring, he <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-410208A1.pdf">announced</a> today. Starks' exit will give Chairman Brendan Carr a Republican majority, as the FCC has had two Democrats and two Republicans since the January <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/departing-fcc-chair-rejects-complaints-about-tv-news-coverage-of-trump/">resignation</a> of former Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel.</p>
<p>"Today I sent a letter to the President and Leader Schumer indicating that I intend to resign my seat as a Commissioner this spring," said Starks, a Democrat who has been an FCC commissioner for over six years. "Serving the American people as a Commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission has been the honor of my life... Over the next few weeks, I look forward to working with the chairman and my fellow Commissioners, and all FCC staff, to further the mission of the agency."</p>
<p>Even with a 2-2 deadlock, Carr has gotten to work on some of his priorities, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-fcc-chair-gets-to-work-on-punishing-news-stations-accused-of-bias/">investigating news stations</a> accused of bias against President Donald Trump and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/fcc-chair-nixes-plan-to-boost-broadband-competition-in-apartment-buildings/">dropping a Biden-era proposal</a> to increase regulation of broadband providers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fcc-democrat-to-resign-cementing-republican-majority-for-chairman-carr/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Fans of <em>Portal 2</em> have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/05/portal-2-a-good-game-but-not-a-great-one/">waiting nearly 14 years now</a> for another official entry in the beloved action-puzzle series. In the meantime, those fans have had to settle for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/10/portal-2-peer-review-fun-but-missing-the-magic/">DLC</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/how-portal-randomized-breathes-new-life-into-a-pc-gaming-classic/">fan mods</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/">odd</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/684410/Bridge_Constructor_Portal/">Aperture-Science-themed</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/868020/Aperture_Hand_Lab/">spinoffs</a> that capture the look and feel of the <em>Portal</em> universe in a number of decidedly non-<em>Portal</em> games.</p>
<p>Now, it seems we can add a full-fledged physical pinball table to that list of spinoffs with the <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/portal/">announcement</a> of a full-size, fully licensed <em>Portal</em>-themed pinball table built on <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/p3-pinball-platform/">Multimorphic's P3 pinball platform</a>. Pinball News' write-up <a href="https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2025/03/17/portal-revealed/">has more details</a> than the <a href="https://www.wric.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/794464361/multimorphic-unveils-portal-a-new-pinball-game-for-the-p3-pinball-platform/">press release</a>, noting that the table was developed in conjunction with the team at Valve "to ensure all the features are accurately represented and they had access to all the assets from the <em>Portal</em> and <em>Portal 2</em> games."</p>
<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yphZsv4S4lA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>That means new stylized Aperture Science art on the side of the table and new "Test Chamber" animations on the large display that runs underneath the playfield. It also means Ellen McLain reprising her iconic roles as GLaDOS to record new spoken reactions to in-game events, alongside a new Wheatley-esque personality core named Reggie, voiced by Marc Silk [Update: This post originally misstated the status of Reggie and his voice actor. Ars regrets the error]. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yphZsv4S4lA">Watching the promotional trailer</a> and hearing a fully animated toy sculpt of Reggie intone "I'm making a note here: huge success!" in his trademark British accent is sure to make even the most jaded <em>Portal</em> fan grin at least a little bit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/were-getting-a-full-size-portal-pinball-table-before-portal-3/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google today <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/google-agreement-acquire-wiz/">announced</a> a $32 billion deal to buy Wiz, an Israeli cloud security company that would become part of Google's cloud division if the merger is completed.</p>
<p>The all-cash deal requires regulatory approval at a time when the Department of Justice is trying to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/doj-google-must-sell-chrome-android-could-be-next/">break up Google</a> by forcing it to sell the Chrome browser after a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">judge ruled</a> that Google illegally maintained a monopoly. Google is also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/doj-wraps-up-ad-tech-trial-google-is-three-times-a-monopolist/">awaiting a verdict</a> in a separate ad-tech monopoly case brought by the US government.</p>
<p>Google's announcement this morning said that "Wiz's products will continue to work and be available across all major clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud platforms."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/google-inks-32-billion-deal-to-buy-security-firm-wiz-even-as-doj-seeks-breakup/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Experiments with robotic spiders and prey suggest spiders can detect differences in natural web frequencies.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's well understood that spiders have poor eyesight and thus sense the vibrations in their webs whenever prey (like a fly) gets caught; the web serves as an extension of their sensory system. But spiders also exhibit less-understood behaviors to locate struggling prey. Most notably, they take on a crouching position, sometimes moving up and down to shake the web or plucking at the web by pulling in with one leg. The crouching seems to be triggered when prey is stationary and stops when the prey starts moving.</p>
<p>But it can be difficult to study the underlying mechanisms of this behavior because there are so many variables at play when observing live spiders. To simplify matters, researchers at Johns Hopkins University's Terradynamics Laboratory are building crouching spider robots and testing them on synthetic webs. The results provide evidence for the hypothesis that spiders crouch to sense differences in web frequencies to locate prey that isn't moving—something analogous to echolocation. The researchers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m0D-gF9rU4">presented</a> their initial findings today at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit in Anaheim, California.</p>
<p>"Our lab investigates biological problems using robot physical models," team member Eugene Lin told Ars. "Animal experiments are really hard to reproduce because it's hard to get the animal to do what you want to do." Experiments with robot physical models, by contrast, "are completely repeatable. And while you're building them, you get a better idea of the actual [biological] system and how certain behaviors happen." The lab has also built robots inspired by cockroaches and fish.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/spiderbot-experiments-hint-at-echolocation-to-locate-prey/">Read full article</a></p>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W">Casio F-91W</a>, the most-sold watch in the world, keeps the time on a readable display and offers a single daily alarm slot (unless you <a href="https://www.sensorwatch.net/">board-swap it</a>). The <a href="https://timex.com/collections/shop-all-weekender-watches">Timex Weekender</a> may last as long as mechanical watches exist.</p>

The Core 2 Duo, "almost exactly a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/pebble-2-reviewed-proof-that-a-heart-rate-monitor-doesnt-make-a-fitness-tracker/">Pebble 2</a>" with modernized chips, 30 days battery life, and a black-and-white e-paper screen, is $150 at preorder and is scheduled to ship in July. The Core Time 2, Migicovsky's "dream watch," is bigger, color, and metal and goes for $225 right now. Its release is slated for December.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/new-pebbleos-watches-with-more-battery-and-familiar-looks-are-up-for-preorder/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Before he was abruptly fired last month, Derek Copeland worked as a trainer at the US Department of Agriculture’s National Dog Detection Training Center, preparing beagles and Labrador retrievers to sniff out plants and animals <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-invasive-plants-are-fueling-californias-wildfire-crisis/">that are invasive</a> or vectors for zoonotic diseases, like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/another-global-pandemic-is-spreading-among-pigs/">swine fever</a>. Copeland estimates the NDDTC lost about a fifth of its trainers and a number of other support staff when 6,000 employees were <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/usda-layoffs-throw-climate-and-crop-projects-into-chaos/">let go at the USDA</a> in February as part of a government-wide purge orchestrated by the Trump administration and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-operatives-access-social-security-administration/">Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</a>.</p>
<p>Before he received his termination notice, he says, Copeland had just spent several months training the only dog stationed in Florida capable of detecting the Giant African land snail, an invasive mollusk that poses a significant threat to Florida agriculture. “We have dogs for spotted and lantern flies, Asian longhorn beetles,” he says, referring to two other non-native species. “I don’t think the American people realize how much crap that people bring into the United States.”</p>
<p>Dog trainers are just one example of the kind of highly specialized USDA staff that have been removed from their stations in recent weeks. Teams devoted to inspecting plant and food imports have been hit especially hard by the recent cuts, including the Plant Protection and Quarantine program, which has lost hundreds of staffers alone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/doge-cuts-to-usda-may-open-door-to-invasive-species-higher-food-prices/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Time and again, studies and surveys identify the time it takes to charge an electric vehicle as one of the most <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/heres-how-to-survive-your-relatives-ignorant-anti-ev-rant-this-thanksgiving/">significant hurdles</a> affecting EV adoption. For generations, drivers have gotten used to being able to refuel their cars in five minutes using energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons, and plenty of them balk at the idea of having to drive a car where recharging a battery takes half an hour or more. Now it seems that may not be an excuse for much longer—in China, at least.</p>
<p>New tech has been developed by BYD, the Chinese automaker that recently eclipsed Tesla as the leading EV maker by volume. Called the "super e-platform," the new batteries are able to charge at 10C, and the new DC chargers peak at 1,000 kW. BYD says this will add 249 miles (400 km) of range in just five minutes. By contrast, most current Tesla Superchargers peak at 250 kW, with Electrify America's chargers maxing out at 350 kW, and even the powerful new chargers used by Formula E <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/600-kw-fast-charging-pitstops-are-coming-to-formula-e/">can only reach 600 kW</a>.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to make EV charging as fast as refueling a gasoline car," said BYD chairperson Wang Chuanfu.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/new-ev-battery-boasts-5-min-charge-time-adding-250-miles-of-range/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>About 252 million years ago, volcanic eruptions triggered the <a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/what-caused-earths-biggest-mass-extinction">End-Permian Mass Extinction</a>, also known as the Great Dying. About 96 percent of marine species were wiped out—but were things just as grim on land?</p>
<p>Scientists have debated whether this event caused nearly as much terrestrial destruction. Now, researchers from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology (NIGPAS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggest that terrestrial ecosystems did not suffer nearly as much as the oceans.</p>
<p>Led by paleontologist Feng Liu, the NIGPAS team found evidence for refugiums, oases where life thrived despite the devastation. Not only did these refugiums give life a chance to survive the mass extinction event, which lasted 200,000 years, but they are now thought to have been crucial to rebuilding ecosystems in much less time than was previously assumed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/even-the-worst-mass-extinction-had-its-oases/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Optical illusions tell a lot about how people see things. For example, look at the picture below.</p>

<p>The two orange circles are identical, but the one on the right looks bigger. Why? We use context to figure out what we are seeing. Something surrounded by smaller things is often quite big.

              <![CDATA[<p>There's a new Google AI model in town, and it can generate or edit images as easily as it can create text—as part of its chatbot conversation. The results aren't perfect, but it's quite possible everyone in the near future will be able to manipulate images this way.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, Google <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/experiment-with-gemini-20-flash-native-image-generation/">expanded access</a> to Gemini 2.0 Flash's native image-generation capabilities, making the experimental feature available to anyone using <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat">Google AI Studio</a>. Previously limited to testers since December, the multimodal technology integrates both native text and image processing capabilities into one AI model.</p>
<p>The new model, titled "Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) Experimental," flew somewhat under the radar last week, but it has been garnering more attention over the past few days due to its ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/16/people-are-using-googles-new-ai-model-to-remove-watermarks-from-images/">remove watermarks</a> from images, albeit with artifacts and a reduction in image quality.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/farewell-photoshop-googles-new-ai-lets-you-edit-images-by-asking/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost science station accomplished a lot on the Moon in the last two weeks. Among other things, its instruments drilled into the Moon's surface, tested an extraterrestrial vacuum cleaner, and showed that future missions could use GPS navigation signals to navigate on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>These are all important achievements, gathering data that could shed light on the Moon's formation and evolution, demonstrating new ways of collecting samples on other planets, and revealing the remarkable reach of the US military's GPS satellite network.</p>
<p>But the pièce de résistance for Firefly's first Moon mission might be the daily dose of imagery that streamed down from the Blue Ghost spacecraft. A suite of cameras recorded the cloud of dust created as the lander's engine plume blew away the uppermost layer of lunar soil as it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/fireflys-ghostly-landing-proves-a-scrappy-company-can-shoot-for-the-moon/">touched down March 2</a> in Mare Crisium, or the Sea of Crises. This location is in a flat basin situated on the upper right quadrant of the side of the Moon always facing the Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/heres-the-secret-to-how-firefly-was-able-to-nail-its-very-first-lunar-landing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Federal support for mRNA vaccine research appears in jeopardy after <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-grants-mrna-vaccines-trump-administration-hhs-rfk/">KFF Health News</a> reported Sunday that officials at the National Institutes of Health have directed scientists to remove all references to the lifesaving technology from their grant applications. All such research is now under direct scrutiny from health secretary and long-time anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>A senior official at the NIH's National Cancer Institute confirmed to KFF that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli "sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s office and the White House."</p>
<p>Further, two independent scientists told the outlet that they were informed by NIH officials that any mention of mRNA vaccines needed to be removed from their grant applications. One, a biomedical researcher in Philadelphia, said that the NIH had "flagged our pending grant as having an mRNA vaccine component." The other, a researcher in New York who works on vaccines but not mRNA vaccines, was told that background mentions of mRNA vaccine efficacy in their previous grant applications needed to be removed from future applications.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/federal-funding-for-mrna-vaccine-research-in-jeopardy-under-rfk-jr/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Plastics are great, except when it comes to making or disposing of them. Production generally requires the use of chemicals derived from fossil fuels, and so helps to continue our reliance on them. And the final products are generally not biodegradable, so they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/01/plastic-is-everywhere-including-our-food-and-bottled-water/">tend to stick around</a> despite breaking down into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/airborne-microplastics-aid-in-cloud-formation/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">ever smaller fragments</a>.</p>
<p>Biology might ultimately provide a solution, however. Researchers have identified bacteria that evolved the ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/does-newly-discovered-bacteria-recycle-plastic/">digest some plastics</a>. And improvements in our ability to design proteins have allowed us to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/">make new enzymes</a> that can chew up plastics.</p>
<p>This week brings some progress on the other side of the equation, with a team of Korean researchers describing how they've engineered a bacterial strain that can make a useful polymer starting with nothing but glucose as fuel. The system they developed is based on an enzyme that the bacteria use when they're facing unusual nutritional conditions, and it can be tweaked to make a wide range of polymers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/researchers-engineer-bacteria-to-produce-plastics/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Owners of smart TVs and streaming sticks running Roku OS are already subject to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/roku-ad-push-continues-with-plans-to-put-video-ads-in-os-home-screen/">video advertisements on the home screen.</a> Now, Roku is testing what it might look like if it took things a step further and forced people to watch a video ad play before getting to the Roku OS home screen.</p>
<p>Reports of Roku customers seeing video ads automatically play before they could view the OS’ home screen started appearing online this week. A Reddit user, for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1jcuibl/question_about_ads/">posted</a> yesterday: “I just turned on my Roku and got an ... ad for a movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.” Multiple apparent users reported seeing an ad for the movie <em>Moana 2</em>. The ads have a close option, but some users appear to have not seen it.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, a Roku spokesperson shared a company statement that confirms that the autoplaying ads are expected behavior but not a permanent part of Roku OS currently. Instead, Roku claimed, it was just trying the ad capability out.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/roku-says-unpopular-autoplay-ads-are-just-a-test/">Read full article</a></p>
