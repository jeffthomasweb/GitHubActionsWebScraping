                        <![CDATA[Proposed datacenter would demand 5x Wyoming's current power use at full deployment.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Mayor Patrick Collins of Cheyenne, Wyoming, announced plans for an AI data center that would consume more electricity than all homes in the state combined, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-center-electricity-wyoming-cheyenne-44da7974e2d942acd8bf003ebe2e855a">Associated Press</a>. The facility, a joint venture between energy infrastructure company Tallgrass and AI data center developer Crusoe, would start at 1.8 gigawatts and scale up to 10 gigawatts of power use.</p>
<p>The project's energy demands are difficult to overstate for Wyoming, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population">least populous</a> US state. The initial 1.8-gigawatt phase, consuming 15.8 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually, is more than five times the electricity used by every household in the state combined. That figure <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=WY">represents</a> 91 percent of the 17.3 TWh currently <a href="https://findenergy.com/wy/">consumed</a> by all of Wyoming's residential, commercial, and industrial sectors combined. At its full 10-gigawatt capacity, the proposed data center would consume 87.6 TWh of electricity annually—double the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_Wyoming">43.2 TWh</a> the entire state currently generates.</p>
<p>Because drawing this much power from the public grid is untenable, the project will rely on its own dedicated gas generation and renewable energy sources, according to Collins and company officials. However, this massive local demand for electricity—even if self-generated—represents a fundamental shift for a state that currently <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=WY">sends</a> nearly 60 percent of its generated power to other states.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/ai-in-wyoming-may-soon-use-more-electricity-than-states-human-residents/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On October 20, 2023, health officials in the County of San Diego, California, put out <a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/health-officials-investigating-outbreak-linked-to-raw-milk/">a press release</a> warning of a <em>Salmonella</em> outbreak linked to raw (unpasteurized) milk. Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.</p>
<p>At the time of the press release, officials in San Diego County had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.</p>
<p>On October 25, the county put out <a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-updates-raw-milk-salmonella-case-count-and-product-recall/">a second press release</a>, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—<a href="https://www.marlerblog.com/files/2024/07/fdbFrRFL3n.pdf">raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC</a>—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own <a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/salmonella-infections-orange-county-linked-raw-milk-raw-farm-llc">press release</a>, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/07/its-shocking-massive-raw-milk-outbreak-from-2023-finally-reported/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The White House said yesterday that the European Union agreed to scrap a controversial proposal to make online platforms pay for telecom companies' broadband network upgrades and expansions. But European officials have not confirmed the White House claim, and a European Commission spokesperson said the issue must go through the legislative process.</p>
<p>A White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-the-united-states-and-european-union-reach-massive-trade-deal/">fact sheet</a> on President Trump's trade deal with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen contains a brief reference to Europe agreeing not to impose network usage fees.</p>
<p>"The United States and the European Union intend to address unjustified digital trade barriers," the White House said. "In that respect, the European Union confirms that it will not adopt or maintain network usage fees. Furthermore, the United States and the European Union will maintain zero customs duties on electronic transmissions."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/trump-claims-europe-wont-make-big-tech-pay-isps-eu-says-it-still-might/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Both comics and memes rely on the same interplay of visual and verbal elements for their humor.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It's undeniable that the rise of the Internet had a profound impact on cartooning as a profession, giving cartoonists both new tools and a new publishing and/or distribution medium. Online culture also spawned the emergence of viral memes in the late 1990s. Michelle Ann Abate, an English professor at The Ohio State University, argues in <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/30/article/960641">a paper</a> published in INKS: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society, that memes—specifically, image macros—represent a new type of digital comic, right down to the cognitive and creative ways in which they operate.</p>
<p>"One of my areas of specialty has been graphic novels and comics," Abate told Ars. "I've published multiple books on various aspects of comics history and various titles: everything from Charles Schulz's <em>Peanuts</em> to <em>The Far Side</em>, to <em>Little Lulu</em> to <em>Ziggy</em> to <em>The Family Circus</em>. So I've been working on comics as part of the genres and texts and time periods that I look at for many years now."</p>
<p>Her most recent book is 2024's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Singular-Sensations-Cultural-History-One-Panel/dp/1978840683"><em>Singular Sensations: A Cultural History of One-Panel Comics in the United States</em></a>, which Abate was researching when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020. "I was reading a lot of single panel comics and sharing them with friends during the pandemic, and memes were something we were always sharing, too," Abate said. "It occurred to me one day that there isn't a whole lot of difference between the single panel comics I'm sharing and the memes. In terms of how they function, how they operate, the connection of the verbal and the visual, there's more continuity than there is difference."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/the-case-for-memes-as-a-new-form-of-comics/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's next-generation software updates are just a couple of months away, but Apple isn't done with last year's releases just yet. Apple has released iOS 18.6, iPadOS 18.6, macOS Sequoia 15.6, watchOS 11.6, tvOS 18.6, and visionOS 2.6 to the public today, fixing an issue with sharing movies from the Photos app but mostly patching a long list of security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/124147">iOS</a>, iPadOS, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/124149">macOS</a>, the list of resolved CVEs covers everything from the Metal graphics API to WebKit to networking to filesystem permissions issues. All told, each of these updates patches over two dozen vulnerabilities, and the other OS updates cover many of the same flaws. According to Apple's release notes, at least, none of these vulnerabilities are being actively exploited in the wild—you should patch as soon as you can, but there appear to be no known zero-day vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>For iOS and iPadOS users in the EU, the updates also include a mechanism for installing alternate app stores and for installing apps directly from websites, in accordance with the EU's Digital Markets Act.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/apple-releases-ios-18-6-macos-15-6-and-other-updates-as-current-gen-winds-down/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>The rise of large language models like ChatGPT has led to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html">widespread concern that "everyone is cheating their way through college,"</a> as a recent New York magazine article memorably put it. Now, OpenAI is <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/">rolling out a new "Study Mode"</a> that it claims is less about providing answers or doing the work for students and more about helping them "build [a] deep understanding" of complex topics.</p>
<p>Study Mode isn't a new ChatGPT model but a series of "custom system instructions" written for the LLM "in collaboration with teachers, scientists, and pedagogy experts to reflect a core set of behaviors that support deeper learning," OpenAI said. Instead of the usual summary of a subject that stock ChatGPT might give—which one OpenAI employee likened to "a mini textbook chapter"—Study Mode slowly rolls out new information in a "scaffolded" structure. The mode is designed to ask "guiding questions" in the Socratic style and to pause for periodic "knowledge checks" and personalized feedback to make sure the user understands before moving on.</p>
<p>It's unknown how many students will use this guided learning tool instead of just asking ChatGPT to generate answers from the start.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/chatgpts-new-study-mode-is-designed-to-help-you-learn-not-just-give-answers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Whistle pet trackers are headed to the Internet of Things (IoT) graveyard. After releasing its first product in 2013, the Seattle-based Whistle has just been acquired by a competitor that has decided to brick all of Whistle's smart GPS and activity monitors.</p>
<p>Tractive, an Austrian company that has also been selling Internet-connected GPS trackers for pets since 2013, on Monday announced its acquisition of Whistle from Mars Petcare, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/714775/tractive-whistle-pet-tracker-acquisition">The Verge</a>. Mars Petcare is the pet food subsidiary of Mars Inc (which also makes candies like M&amp;M’s), and it acquired Whistle in 2016 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-01/mars-said-to-spend-117m-to-acquire-whistle-s-fitbit-for-dogs">for $117 million</a>.</p>
<p>Tractive bought Whistle to expand its business in the US. Until September 30, Whistle owners can get Tractive devices to replace the Whistle trackers that Tractive is bricking. People currently paying for a Whistle subscription will see their subscriptions transferred to their new Tractive device. People with a Whistle device but no subscription must “pay for a Tractive subscription” in order to get a replacement device, <a href="https://tractive.com/en/fp/whistle?ranMID=45904&amp;ranEAID=2116208&amp;utm_source=rakuten&amp;utm_term=2116208&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-cQv4pvy1XzBROb5OA6IjWA">Tractive’s website</a> says.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Ars took a look at Volvo’s latest electric vehicle. The EX90 proved to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-volvo-ex90-a-low-key-luxury-electric-suv/">a rather thoughtful Swedish take on the luxury SUV</a>, albeit one that remains a rare sight on the road. But the EX90 is not the only recipe one can cook with the underlying ingredients. The ingredients in this case are from a platform called SPA2, and to extend the metaphor a bit, the kitchen is the Volvo factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina, which in addition to making a variety of midsize and larger Volvo cars for the US and European markets also produces the Polestar 3.</p>
<p>What’s fascinating is how different the end products are. Intentionally, Polestar and Volvo wisely seek different customers rather than cannibalize each other's sales. As a new brand, Polestar comes with many fewer preconceptions other than the usual arguments that will rage in the comment section over just how much is Swedish versus Chinese, and perhaps the occasional student of history who remembers the touring car racing team that then developed some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/the-2017-s60-polestar-a-volvo-with-a-nurburgring-lap-record/">bright blue special edition Volvo road cars</a> that for a while held a production car lap record around the Nürburgring Nordschliefe.</p>
<p>That historical link is important. Polestar might now mentally slot into the space that Saab used to occupy in the last century as a refuge for customers with eclectic tastes thanks to its clean exterior designs and techwear-inspired interiors. Once past the necessity of basic transportation, aesthetics are as good a reason as most when it comes to picking a particular car. Just thinking of a Polestar as a brand that exemplifies modern Scandinavian design would be to sell it short, though. The driving dynamics are just too good.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/2025-polestar-3-drives-sporty-looks-sharp-can-be-a-little-annoying/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft devotes most of its time and energy these days to promoting new AI- and Copilot-related features for Windows 11, but the company's Windows Insider builds are still full of small tweaks and changes aimed at improving longstanding Windows features for people who just want to use their PC the way they always have.</p>
<p>New updates that began rolling out to testers in the Windows Insider program yesterday include a couple of small but meaningful changes for Windows power users. First, Microsoft is changing the way the Taskbar works on secondary monitors, allowing users to click it to see the calendar and Notification Center on all monitors, not just the primary display.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also making a change to how the various tabs in the Task Manager measure CPU usage to make it more consistent (and less nonsensical).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/revamped-task-manager-second-monitor-notifications-coming-soon-to-windows-11/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>“We will drill, baby, drill,” President Donald Trump declared at his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/">inauguration</a> on January 20. Echoing the slogan that exemplified his energy policies during the campaign, he made his message clear: more oil and gas, lower prices, greater exports.</p>
<p>Six months into Trump’s second term, his administration has little to show on that score. Output is ticking up, but <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/petro_prod.php">slower</a> than it did under the Biden administration. Pump prices for gasoline have <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&amp;f=w">bobbed</a> around where they were in inauguration week. And exports of crude oil in the four months through April <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCREXUS2&amp;f=M">trailed</a> those in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The White House is discovering, perhaps the hard way, that energy markets aren’t easily managed from the Oval Office—even as it moves to <a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/tracker-type/regulatory-tracker/">roll back regulations</a> on the <a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/tracker/epa-voc-and-methane-standards-for-oil-and-gas-facilities-2/">oil and gas sector</a>, offers up more public lands <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/climate/trump-new-mexico-nevada-mining-drilling.html">for drilling</a> at <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/what-the-megalaws-royalty-rate-cuts-mean-for-oil-and-gas-producers/">reduced royalty rates</a>, and axes Biden-era incentives for <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/megalaw-complicates-trumps-plans-to-quickly-ax-renewable-credits/">wind and solar.</a></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/trump-promised-a-drilling-boom-but-us-energy-industry-hasnt-been-interested/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Marvel Studios officially kicked off Phase Six of its cinematic universe with the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantastic_Four:_First_Steps"><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em></a>, and the film is already garnering solid reviews and a <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/fantastic-four/">strong start</a> at the box office. The cast is terrific across the board, and the production design is, well, pretty darn fantastic, evoking Disney's Tomorrowland (the park, not the film) with its 1960s retro-alt-future aesthetic. Just let your brain relax and don't try to make too much of the nonsensical plot.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>
<p>Director Matt Shakman (<em>WandaVision</em>) took a page from James Gunn's <em>Superman</em> playbook and skipped the usual origin story for our heroes. How the Fantastic Four acquired their unique abilities is recapped via brief flashbacks, along with some of their early exploits, thanks to the Four being featured celebrities on a popular talk show hosted by Ted Gilbert (Mark Gatiss). Reed Richard/Mister Fantastic (Pedro Pascal) and Sue Storm/Invisible Woman (Vanessa Kirby) are even expecting their first child, to the delight of Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Joseph Quinn) and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/review-fantastic-four-first-steps-is-the-best-film-version-so-far/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Launched in 2016, Futurehome’s Smarthub is marketed as a central hub for controlling Internet-connected devices in smart homes. For years, the Norwegian company sold its products, which also include smart thermostats, smart lighting, and smart fire and carbon monoxide alarms, for a one-time fee that included access to its companion app and cloud platform for control and automation. As of June 26, though, those core features require a 1,188 NOK (about $116.56) annual subscription fee, turning the smart home devices into dumb ones if users don't pay up.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The next front in Donald Trump's trade war will be chip tariffs—which could come by next month—but national security experts are warning that the president may have already made a huge misstep that threatens to disrupt both US trade and national security.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ari.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Letter-to-Secretary-Lutnick-on-H20-restrictions.pdf">letter</a> Monday to Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, 20 policymakers and professionals with a background in national security policy urged Trump to reverse course and block exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China.</p>
<p>In April, the Trump administration decided against imposing additional export curbs on H20 chips after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang paid $1 million for a seat at a Mar-a-Lago dinner, NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5356480/nvidia-china-ai-h20-chips-trump">reported</a>. Apparently, Nvidia's promise to invest $500 billion in AI data centers helped persuade Trump to change course, as did the terms of a temporary truce with China, in which the US promised to halt H20 chip controls in exchange for China restoring imports of rare earth minerals into the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/trump-caving-on-nvidia-h20-export-curbs-may-disrupt-his-bigger-trade-war/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Popular open source 3D modeling tool Blender's social media channels and subreddit have regularly seen people asking for a tablet version for years now. And according to <a href="https://code.blender.org/2025/07/beyond-mouse-keyboard/">a blog post</a> by Dalai Felinto from the Blender team, the developers of the application have now committed to build just that.</p>
<p>"The idea is to bring the full power of Blender to these devices," the blog post explains. "This requires adapting to platform-specific paradigms, but also to offer more task-oriented user interfaces with reduced information density. This will be achieved by extending existing input methods and improving workspaces and application templates, running on top of a regular Blender build."</p>
<p>The long-term goal is to build out not just a standalone tablet interface, but to offer the same advantages something like an iPad Pro offers to PC-connected graphics tablet peripherals, too—and it goes both ways. Ultimately, a standalone tablet + a keyboard and trackpad should offer the same experience as on desktop, and a desktop PC with a graphics tablet should be the same as a standalone tablet in terms of experience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/popular-3d-application-blender-will-get-a-tablet-version/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Friday, OpenAI's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/chatgpts-new-ai-agent-can-browse-the-web-and-create-powerpoint-slideshows/">ChatGPT Agent</a>, which can perform multistep tasks for users, proved it can pass through one of the Internet's most common security checkpoints by clicking Cloudflare's anti-bot verification—the same checkbox that's supposed to keep automated programs like itself at bay.</p>
<p>ChatGPT Agent is a feature that allows OpenAI's AI assistant to control its own web browser, operating within a sandboxed environment with its own virtual operating system and browser that can access the real Internet. Users can watch the AI's actions through a window in the ChatGPT interface, maintaining oversight while the agent completes tasks. The system requires user permission before taking actions with real-world consequences, such as making purchases. Recently, Reddit users discovered the agent could do something particularly ironic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/openais-chatgpt-agent-casually-clicks-through-i-am-not-a-robot-verification-test/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/skydance-deal-allows-trumps-fcc-to-censor-speech-and-silence-dissent-on-cbs/">approval</a> of CBS owner Paramount's $8 billion merger with Skydance came with a condition to install an ombudsman, which FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has described as a "bias monitor." It appears that the bias monitor will make sure the news company's reporting meets standards demanded by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"One of the things they're going to have to do is put an ombudsman in place for two years, so basically a bias monitor that will report directly to the president [of Paramount]," Carr <a href="https://www.newsmaxtv.com/Shows/Greg-Kelly-Reports/vid/f0e96a10-6902-11f0-9ecf-dbf20182fcd7">told Newsmax on Thursday</a>, right after the FCC announced its approval of the merger.</p>
<p>The Carr FCC claims there is precedent for such a bias monitor. But the precedent cited in last week's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-25-43A1.pdf">merger approval</a> points to a very different case involving NBC and GE, one in which an ombudsman was used to protect NBC's editorial independence from interference by its new owner.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/how-the-trump-fcc-justified-requiring-a-bias-monitor-at-cbs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>According to <em>US News and World Report</em>, the state of Oklahoma <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education/prek-12?sort=rank-desc">ranks 48th in the United States</a> for its pre-K to 12th grade education system. But the current hot-button issue consuming the Oklahoma State Board of Education isn't about improving this position; it's about whether someone was streaming video of nude women gathered around a "chiropractic table" to a TV visible during a Board of Education meeting last week.</p>
<p>Indeed, so serious has the issue become that it has already progressed from a media complaint to a <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2025/07/25/probe-needed-after-reports-of-nude-women-on-state-superintendents-office-tv-oklahoma-speaker-says/">state probe</a> to an <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/6887a662c40af63ee1a56c4c/omes-asks-oklahoma-county-sheriff-to-review-incident-in-ryan-walters-office">Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office</a> investigation in just a few days.</p>
<p>State House Speaker Kyle Hilbert (R) is <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2025/07/25/probe-needed-after-reports-of-nude-women-on-state-superintendents-office-tv-oklahoma-speaker-says/">already suggesting</a> that Superintendent Ryan Walters, the state's hard-right head of education—the man who wants to <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/education/newsroom/2025/july/supt--walters-asks-the-oklahoma-supreme-court-to-move-forward-wi.html">put Bibles in every classroom</a>—"unlock and turn over all relevant devices and fully cooperate with an investigation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/oklahomas-new-scandal-nude-women-streamed-to-tv-during-state-board-meeting/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Russia’s biggest airline cancelled dozens of flights on Monday following a failure of the state-owned company’s IT systems and, according to a Russian lawmaker and pro-Ukrainian hackers, was the result of a cyberattack, it was widely reported.</p>
<p>The airline, Aeroflot, said it cancelled about 40 flights following a “technical failure.” An online departure board for Sheremetyevo airport showed dozens of others were delayed. The cancellations and delays hobbled traffic throughout Russia and left travelers stranded at airports. The affected routes were mostly within Russia but also included routes to Belarusian capital Minsk and Yerevan, the capital of Armenia.</p>
<h2>“The damage is strategic”</h2>
<p>Russian prosecutors confirmed to Reuters that the disruption was caused by a hack and have opened a criminal investigation into it. Russian lawmakers also hinted a cyberattack was the cause of the outage, with one of them, Anton Gorelkin, saying Russia was under digital attack, possibly at the hands of hacktivists with help from unfriendly states.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/pro-ukrainian-hackers-take-credit-for-attack-that-snarls-russian-flight-travel/">Read full article</a></p>
