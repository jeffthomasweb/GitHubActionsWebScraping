              <![CDATA[<p>There is, of course, no quantitative way to rank amazing things that happen in space. We cannot measure their absolute magnitude nor assign them a numerical value, and trying to do so is something of a fool’s errand. Are we fools? Maybe. But we're fools who like to have a little fun.</p>
<p>Understandably, then, this list is completely subjective. How else could one rank events that span the cosmos, from gravitational wave detection to the launch of humans into suborbital space? What follows is a list of the most incredible, surprising, impressive, and demanding achievements and developments in space and spaceflight during the first 25 years of the 2000s—as selected by the editors of Ars Technica.</p>
<p>You will probably disagree with some choices and their ranking, and that’s totally fine. That’s what the comments section is for. But the point here is simply to bring some of these incredible moments back onto the front burner so we can all bask in their glory once again. Each of these achievements deserves our celebration and appreciation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/ranking-the-25-coolest-things-in-space-so-far-during-the-21st-century/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Startup Embodied is closing down, and its product, an $800 robot for kids ages 5 to 10, will soon be bricked.</p>
<p>Embodied blamed its closure on a failed “critical funding round." On its <a href="https://moxierobot.com/pages/closing-faqs">website</a>, it explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We had secured a lead investor who was prepared to close the round. However, at the last minute, they withdrew, leaving us with no viable options to continue operations. Despite our best efforts to secure alternative funding, we were unable to find a replacement in time to sustain operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company didn’t provide further details about the pulled funding. Embodied’s previous backers have included Intel Capital, Toyota AI Ventures, Amazon Alexa Fund, Sony Innovation Fund, and Vulcan Capital, but we don't know who the lead investor mentioned above is.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/startup-will-brick-800-emotional-support-robot-for-kids-without-refunds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Since the dawn of the generative AI era a few years ago, the march of technology—toward what tech companies hope will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/ai-superintelligence-looms-in-sam-altmans-new-essay-on-the-intelligence-age/">replace human intellectual labor</a>—has continuously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/ceos-say-generative-ai-will-result-in-job-cuts-in-2024/">sparked angst</a> about the future role humans will play in the job market. Will we all be replaced by machines?</p>
<p>A Y-Combinator-backed company called <a href="https://www.artisan.co/">Artisan</a>, which sells customer service and sales workflow software, recently launched a provocative billboard campaign in San Francisco playing on that angst, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-firms-stop-hiring-humans-billboard-campaign-sparks-outrage-2000536368">reports Gizmodo</a>. It features the slogan "Stop Hiring Humans." The company markets its software products as "AI Employees" or "Artisans."</p>
<p>The company's billboards feature messages that might inspire nightmares among workers, like "Artisans won't complain about work-life balance" and "The era of AI employees is here." And they're on display to the same human workforce the ads suggest replacing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/ai-company-trolls-san-francisco-with-billboards-saying-stop-hiring-humans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Micron Technology will receive more than $6.1 billion after the US Department of Commerce finalized one of the largest CHIPS Act awards ever to "the only US-based manufacturer of memory chips," Vice President Kamala Harris said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/10/statement-from-vice-president-kamala-harris-on-chips-and-science-act-investments-in-micron-technology/">press statement</a>.</p>
<p>Micron will use the funding to construct "several state-of-the-art memory chips facilities" in New York and Idaho, Harris said. The chipmaker has committed to a "$125 billion investment over the next few decades" and promised to create "at least 20,000 jobs," Harris confirmed.</p>
<p>Additionally, Micron "agreed to preliminary terms for an additional investment of $275 million to expand" its facility in Manassas, Virginia, Harris confirmed. Those facilities will mostly be used to manufacture chips for automotive and defense industries, Harris noted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/microns-6b-chips-funding-should-have-more-strings-attached-critics-say/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A location-tracking company that sells its services to police departments is apparently using addresses and coordinates of doctors' and lawyers' offices and other types of locations to help cops compile lists of places visited by suspects, according to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/location-data-firm-offers-to-help-cops-track-targets-via-doctor-visits/">404 Media report</a> published today.</p>
<p>Fog Data Science, which <a href="https://fogdatascience.com/">says</a> it "harness[es] the power of data to safeguard national security and provide law enforcement with actionable intelligence," has a "Project Intake Form" that asks police for locations where potential suspects and their mobile devices might be found. The form, obtained by 404 Media, instructs police officers to list locations of friends' and families' houses, associates' homes and offices, and the offices of a person's doctor or lawyer.</p>
<p>Fog Data has a trove of location data derived from smartphones' geolocation signals, which would already include doctors' offices and many other types of locations even before police ask for information on a specific person. Details provided by police on the intake form seem likely to help Fog Data conduct more effective searches of its database to find out when suspects visited particular places. The form also asks police to identify the person of interest's name and/or known aliases and their "link to criminal activity."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/location-data-firm-helps-police-find-out-when-suspects-visited-their-doctor/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Amazon started selling new cars today. The online retailer and Internet giant has had its sights on shifting metal for some time now, and if you live in one of 48 cities in the US, and you're looking for a new Hyundai, it's ready for your business.</p>
<p>Hyundai has been working with Amazon for several years on its digital experience, adding Alexa to its cars and showcasing its products at <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. But now, with Amazon Autos, customers can go ahead and buy the car, not just learn about it so they can go to a dealer well-informed.</p>
<p>In fact, the dealerships remain part of the process even with Amazon Autos—hence the fact that the service is not rolling out nationwide.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/amazon-gets-into-the-car-sales-game-starting-with-hyundai/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Are humans just squishy machines? Can an artificially intelligent robot create a true moral compass for itself? Is there a best time to play <em>The Talos Principle</em> again?</p>
<p>The answer to at least one of these questions is now somewhat answered. <em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened,</em> due in "Early 2025," will bundle the original critically acclaimed 2014 game, its <em>Road to Gehenna </em>DLC, and a new chapter, "In the Beginning," into an effectively definitive edition. Developer commentary and a level editor will also be packed in. But most of all, the whole game has been rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, bringing "vastly improved visuals" and quality-of-life boosts to the game, according to publisher Devolver Digital.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the oldest maxims in hacking is that once an attacker has physical access to a device, it’s game over for its security. The basis is sound. It doesn’t matter how locked down a phone, computer, or other machine is; if someone intent on hacking it gains the ability to physically manipulate it, the chances of success are all but guaranteed.</p>
<p>In the age of cloud computing, this widely accepted principle is no longer universally true. Some of the world’s most sensitive information—health records, financial account information, sealed legal documents, and the like—now often resides on servers that receive day-to-day maintenance from unknown administrators working in cloud centers thousands of miles from the companies responsible for safeguarding it.</p>
<h2>Bad (RAM) to the bone</h2>
<p>In response, chipmakers have begun baking protections into their silicon to provide assurances that even if a server has been physically tampered with or infected with malware, sensitive data funneled through virtual machines can’t be accessed without an encryption key that’s known only to the VM administrator. Under this scenario, admins inside the cloud provider, law enforcement agencies with a court warrant, and hackers who manage to compromise the server are out of luck.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/new-badram-attack-neuters-security-assurances-in-amd-epyc-processors/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A handful of dairy farms sprawl across the valley floor, ringed by the spikey, copper-colored San Jacinto mountains. This is the very edge of California’s dairy country—and so far, the cows here are safe.</p>
<p>But everyone worries that the potentially lethal bird flu is on the way. “I hope not,” says Clemente Jimenez, as he fixes a hose at Pastime Lakes, a 1,500-head dairy farm. “It’s a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>Further north and west, in the San Joaquin Valley—the heart of the state’s dairy industry—the H5N1 virus, commonly known as bird flu, has rippled through the massive herds that provide most of the country’s milk. Farmworkers have piled carcasses into black and white heaps. This week the state reported 19 new confirmed cases in cows and more than 240,000 in chickens. Another 50,000 cases were confirmed at a chicken breeding facility in Oklahoma.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/12/avian-flu-cases-are-on-the-upswing-at-big-dairy-farms/">Read full article</a></p>

      Michelle Yeoh stars in <em>Star Trek: Section 31</em>.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>We've got a shiny new trailer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_31_(Star_Trek)"><em>Star Trek: Section 31</em></a>, the long-awaited spinoff film that brings back Michelle Yeoh's magnificent Phillipa Georgiou from <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>. The film will give us the backstory for Georgiou's evil Mirror Universe counterpart, where she was a despotic emperor who murdered millions of her own people.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/star-treks-comic-con-panel-debuts-teaser-for-lower-decks-final-season/">previously reported</a>, Yeoh's stylishly acerbic Georgiou was eventually written out of <em>Discovery</em>, but fans took hope from rumors of a spinoff series featuring the character. That turned into a spinoff film, and we'll take it. Miku Martineau plays a young Phillipa Georgiou in the film. Meanwhile, Yeoh's older Georgiou is tasked with protecting the United Federation of Planets as part of a black ops group called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_31_(Star_Trek)">Section 31</a>, while dealing with all the blood she's spilled in her past.</p>
<p>Any hardcore Star Trek fan will tell you that Section 31 was first introduced as an urban legend of sorts in <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>. Apparently Ira Steven Behr—who came up with the idea of a secret rogue organization within Starfleet doing shady things to protect the Federation—took inspiration from Commander Sisko's comment in one episode about how "It's easy to be a saint in paradise." The name is taken from Starfleet Charter Article 14, Section 31, which allows Starfleet to take extraordinary measures in the face of extreme threats—including sabotage, assassination, and even biological warfare.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/michelle-yeoh-is-ready-to-get-messy-in-star-trek-section-31-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Lucid Air sedan's base Pure trim can manage 420 miles (676 km) of EPA-estimated range from just an 84 kWh battery pack. At 5 miles/kWh (12.4 kWh/100 km), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-lucid-air-pure-review-lower-weight-better-steering-amazing-efficiency/">the Pure</a> is the single most efficient EV in the world, with pricing that undercuts the Tesla Model S. Yet the general public is largely unaware of Lucid as an automaker in the first place. The new Gravity, which just entered serial production last week, aims to bring more recognition to the company as a whole while achieving a similarly impressive level of efficiency in an SUV form factor.</p>
<p>The day after the new model began production at Lucid's factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, I spent a morning testing a pre-production Gravity in the hills of Malibu. I had previously climbed around a static concept car about a year beforehand in a small photo studio, but under the wide-open Southern California skies, the shape actually looked smaller in person than expected.</p>
<h2>Low drag, low friction</h2>
<p>The long and low roofline helps to reinforce that perception while maintaining Lucid's commitment to aerodynamics. Lucid's head of design, Derek Jenkins, told me that with a few more improvements to the underbody's design to help wrap airflow around suspension components like tie rod ends and ball joints, the Gravity will dip below its current 0.24 coefficient of drag. That's important because despite my visual perception, the Gravity is not a small vehicle by any means. In fact, it measures 198 inches (5,029 mm) long and 87 inches wide (2,210 mm), including the mirrors, and it's 65 inches (1,651 mm) tall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2024/12/the-2025-lucid-gravity-impresses-us-with-slick-handling-magic-ride/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>After a troubling October lawsuit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/chatbots-posed-as-therapist-and-adult-lover-in-teen-suicide-case-lawsuit-says/">accused Character.AI (C.AI) of recklessly releasing dangerous chatbots that allegedly caused a 14-year-old boy's suicide</a>, more families have come forward to sue chatbot-maker Character Technologies and the startup's major funder, Google.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, another <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/A.F.-on-behalf-of-J.F.-et-al-v.-CHARACTER-TECHNOLOGIES-INC.-et-al-Complaint-12-10-24.pdf">lawsuit</a> was filed in a US district court in Texas, this time by families struggling to help their kids recover from traumatizing experiences where C.AI chatbots allegedly groomed kids and encouraged repeated self-harm and other real-world violence.</p>
<p>In the case of one 17-year-old boy with high-functioning autism, J.F., the chatbots seemed so bent on isolating him from his family after his screentime was reduced that the bots suggested that "murdering his parents was a reasonable response to their imposing time limits on his online activity," the lawsuit said. Because the teen had already become violent, his family still lives in fear of his erratic outbursts, even a full year after being cut off from the app.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/chatbots-urged-teen-to-self-harm-suggested-murdering-parents-lawsuit-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There's something liberating about traveling without your computer. Your load is lighter, your battery needs are fewer, and you don't have to risk damaging or losing one of your most important and expensive devices. Besides, most of us are already carrying around a pretty powerful and conveniently compact computer 24/7: our smartphones.</p>
<p>My problem, though, is that I prefer doing most things on a laptop rather than on a phone. Whether working, writing a detailed email, or shopping around for something online, I can complete my task quicker and more accurately if sitting at a table, typing on a physical keyboard, and navigating with a mouse.</p>
<p>So, in the interest of having my cake and eating it, I've gathered a collection of gadgets that help me get the most out of my iPhone when traveling. With these accessories, I can use my iPhone as if it were a desktop PC, peripherals and all. See you later, laptop.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/best-iphone-travel-accessories/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Although there's been a whole lot of pessimism recently, electric vehicle sales continue to grow, even if it is less quickly than many hoped. That's true in the commercial vehicle space as well—according to Cox Automotive, 87 percent of vehicle fleet operators expect to add EVs in the next five years, and more than half thought they were likely to buy EVs this year. And where and when to plug those EVs in to charge is a potential headache for fleet operators.</p>
<p>The good news is that charging infrastructure really is growing. It doesn't always feel that way—the $7.5 billion allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act for charging infrastructure has to be disbursed via state departments of transportation, so the process there has been anything but rapid. But according to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, the total number of public charging plugs <a href="https://driveelectric.gov/stations-growth?level_2=true&amp;dc_fast=true&amp;available=true&amp;temporarily_unavailable=true&amp;start_month=2021-01&amp;end_month=2024-11">has doubled since 2020</a>, to more than 144,000 level 2 plugs and closing in on 49,000 DC fast charger plugs.</p>
<p>There are ways to throw off a planned timeline when building out a station with multiple chargers. Obviously you need the funds to pay for it all—if these are to come from grants like the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, that had to wait for the states to each develop their own funding plans, then open for submissions, and so on, before even approving a project, for example.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/ev-charging-infrastructure-isnt-just-for-road-trippers/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Thousands of victims have <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Amy-et.-al.-v.-Apple-Case-24-cv-08832-Doc-1-Complaint-12-07-2024.pdf">sued</a> Apple over its alleged failure to detect and report illegal child pornography, also known as child sex abuse materials (CSAM).</p>
<p>The proposed class action comes after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/apple-details-reasons-to-abandon-csam-scanning-tool-more-controversy-ensues/">Apple scrapped a controversial CSAM-scanning tool</a> last fall that was supposed to significantly reduce CSAM spreading in its products. Apple defended its decision to kill the tool after <a href="applewebdata://EEFC054C-D7F9-4299-8D30-1A00EE287442/s">dozens of digital rights groups raised concerns</a> that the government could seek to use the functionality to illegally surveil Apple users for other reasons. Apple also was concerned that bad actors could use the functionality to exploit its users and sought to protect innocent users from false content flags.</p>
<p>Child sex abuse survivors suing have accused Apple of using the cybersecurity defense to ignore the tech giant's mandatory CSAM reporting duties. If they win over a jury, Apple could face more than $1.2 billion in penalties. And perhaps most notably for privacy advocates, Apple could also be forced to "identify, remove, and report CSAM on iCloud and implement policies, practices, and procedures to prevent continued dissemination of CSAM or child sex trafficking on Apple devices and services." That could mean a court order to implement the controversial tool or an alternative that meets industry standards for mass-detecting CSAM.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/thousands-of-child-sex-abuse-victims-sue-apple-for-lax-csam-reporting/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Archaeologists excavating a paleolithic cave site in Galilee, Israel, have found evidence that a deep-cave compound at the site may have been used for ritualistic gatherings, according to a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). That evidence includes the presence of a symbolically carved boulder in a prominent placement, and well as the remains of what may have been torches used to light the interior. And the acoustics would have been conducive to communal gatherings.</p>
<p>Dating back to the Early Upper Paleolithic period, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manot_Cave">Manot Cave</a> was found accidentally when a bulldozer broke open its roof during construction in 2008. Archaeologists soon swooped in and recovered such artifacts as stone tools, bits of charcoal, remains of various animals, and a nearly complete human skull.</p>
<p>The latter proved to be especially significant, as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14134">subsequent analysis</a> showed that the skull (dubbed Manot 1) had both Neanderthal and modern features and was estimated to be about 54,700 years old. That lent support to the hypothesis that modern humans co-existed and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3464203/">possibly interbred</a> with Neanderthals during a crucial transition period in the region, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3845641/">further bolstered</a> by genome sequencing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/paleolithic-deep-cave-compound-likely-used-for-rituals/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Reddit announced it would test an AI-powered search feature called "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/answers/">Reddit Answers</a>" that uses an AI model to create summaries from existing Reddit posts to respond to user questions, reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/reddit-tests-ai-powered-feature-answer-user-queries-2024-12-09/">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The feature generates responses by searching through Reddit's vast collection of community discussions and comments. When users ask questions, Reddit Answers provides summaries of relevant conversations and includes links to related communities and posts.</p>
<p>The move potentially puts Reddit in competition with traditional search engines like Google and newer AI search tools like those from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openai-launches-chatgpt-with-search-taking-google-head-on/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/ai-search-engine-accused-of-plagiarism-announces-publisher-revenue-sharing-plan/">Perplexity</a>.

NCTA—The Internet &amp; Television Association urged the Federal Communications Commission to avoid regulating the monthly data limits and overage charges that cable firms such as Comcast and Cox impose on many Internet plans.</p>
<p>Advocacy groups "suggest that usage-based pricing disproportionately harms low-income users, reasoning that these users are least able to afford overage fees if they exceed data thresholds," the NCTA said in <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/120202872553/1">comments</a> filed last week with the FCC. "However, in reality, usage-based pricing benefits low-income or price-sensitive consumers by providing additional options for less expensive plans."</p>
<p>The NCTA contends that "there is no basis for the assertion that regulation is warranted because low-income consumers are uniquely harmed by usage-based pricing. To the contrary, in many cases usage-based pricing provides more options for consumers, including lower-priced ones, which helps consumers stay connected."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/cable-isps-compare-data-caps-to-food-menus-dont-make-us-offer-unlimited-soup/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/">released</a> Sora Turbo, a new version of its text-to-video generation model, making it available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers through a <a href="https://sora.com/">dedicated website</a>. The model generates videos up to 20 seconds long at resolutions reaching 1080 p from a text or image prompt.</p>
<p>Open AI announced that Sora would be available today for ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers in the US and many parts of the world but is not yet available in Europe. As of early Monday afternoon, though, even existing Plus subscribers trying to use the tool are being presented with a message that "sign ups are temporarily unavailable" thanks to "heavy traffic."</p>
<p>Out of an abundance of caution, OpenAI is limiting Sora's ability to generate videos of people for the time being. At launch, uploads involving human subjects face restrictions while OpenAI refines its deepfake prevention systems. The platform also blocks content involving CSAM and sexual deepfakes. OpenAI says it maintains an active monitoring system and conducted testing to identify potential misuse scenarios before release.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/ten-months-after-first-tease-openai-launches-sora-video-generation-publicly/">Read full article</a></p>
