<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For many artists, it's a precarious time to post art online. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/a-crazy-update-midjourney-v6-upgrade-heaps-on-ai-generated-detail/">AI image generators keep getting better</a> at cheaply replicating a wider range of unique styles, and basically every popular platform is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/26/technology/terms-service-ai-training.html">rushing to update user terms</a> to seize permissions to scrape as much data as possible for AI training.</p>
<p>Defenses against AI training exist—like Glaze, a tool that adds a small amount of imperceptible-to-humans noise to images to stop image generators from copying artists' styles. But they don't provide a permanent solution at a time when tech companies appear determined to chase profits by building ever-more-sophisticated AI models that increasingly threaten to dilute artists' brands and replace them in the market.</p>
<p>In one high-profile example just last month, the estate of Ansel Adams condemned Adobe for selling AI images stealing the famous photographer's style, Smithsonian <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ansel-adams-estate-condemns-adobe-for-selling-ai-generated-images-mimicking-the-photographers-style-180984473/">reported</a>. Adobe quickly responded and removed the AI copycats. But it's not just famous artists who risk being ripped off, and lesser-known artists may struggle to prove AI models are referencing their works. In this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/rapid-growth-of-ai-systems-prompts-us-copyright-office-to-seek-public-input/">largely lawless world</a>, every image uploaded risks contributing to an artist's downfall, potentially watering down demand for their own work each time they promote new pieces online.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034684#p3">Read 56 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034684&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Supermassive black holes are ravenous. Clumps of dust and gas are prone to being disrupted by the turbulence and radiation when they are pulled too close. So why are some of them orbiting on the edge of the Milky Way’s own supermassive monster, Sgr A*? Maybe these mystery blobs are hiding something.</p>
<p>After analyzing observations of the dusty objects, an international team of researchers, led by astrophysicist Florian Peißker of the University of Cologne, have identified these clumps as potentially harboring young stellar objects (YSOs) shrouded by a haze of gas and dust. Even stranger is that these infant stars are younger than an unusually young and bright cluster of stars that are already known to orbit Sgr A*, known as the S-stars.</p>
<p>Finding both of these groups orbiting so close is unusual because stars that orbit supermassive black holes are expected to be dim and much more ancient. Peißker and his colleagues “discard the en vogue idea to classify [these] objects as coreless clouds in the high energetic radiation field of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*,” as they said in a <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/06/aa49729-24/aa49729-24.html">study</a> recently published in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035208#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035208&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you were to envision the kind of accident that would cause a person’s bowels to explode out of their body, you might imagine some sort of gruesome stabbing or grisly car accident. You’d probably never imagine that something as commonplace and harmless as a sneeze would cause this kind of ghastly injury—but that’s <a href="https://pubs.sciepub.com/ajmcr/12/6/1/index.html">exactly what happened</a> to a Florida man earlier this month.</p>
<p>The man had recently had abdominal surgery and was suffering from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551712/">wound dehiscence</a>—where his surgical scar wasn’t healing properly. While eating breakfast, the man first sneezed, then began coughing. He noticed pain and a wet sensation on his lower abdomen—only to discover several loops of his bowel had burst through his unhealed wound.</p>
<p>The man was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery where his bowels were returned to his abdomen.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035167#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035167&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More than 384,000 websites are linking to a site that was caught last week performing a supply-chain attack that redirected visitors to malicious sites, researchers said.</p>
<p>For years, the JavaScript code, hosted at polyfill[.]com, was a legitimate open source project that allowed older browsers to handle advanced functions that weren’t natively supported. By linking to cdn.polyfill[.]io, websites could ensure that devices using legacy browsers could render content in newer formats. The free service was popular among websites because all they had to do was embed the link in their sites. The code hosted on the polyfill site did the rest.</p>
<h2>The power of supply-chain attacks</h2>
<p>In February, China-based company Funnull acquired the domain and the GitHub account that hosted the JavaScript code. On June 25, researchers from security firm Sansec <a href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">reported</a> that code hosted on the polyfill domain had been changed to redirect users to adult- and gambling-themed websites. The code was deliberately designed to mask the redirections by performing them only at certain times of the day and only against visitors who met specific criteria.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035216#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035216&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For well over a century, we had the opportunity to study Neanderthals—their bones, the items they left behind, their distribution across Eurasia. So, when we finally obtained the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2006/11/6005/">sequence of their genome</a> and discovered that we share a genetic legacy with them, it was easy to place the discoveries into context. In contrast, we had no idea <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan">Denisovans</a> existed when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/12/another-case-of-early-human-interbreeding-confirmed-in-siberia/">sequencing DNA from a small finger bone</a> revealed that yet another relative of modern humans had roamed Asia in the recent past.</p>
<p>Since then, we've learned little more. The frequency of their DNA in modern human populations suggest that they were likely concentrated in East Asia. But we've only discovered fragments of bone and a few teeth since then, so we can't even make very informed guesses as to what they might have looked like. On Wednesday, an international group of researchers described finds from a cave on the Tibetan Plateau that had been occupied by Denisovans, which tell us a bit more about these relatives: what they ate. And that appears to be anything they could get their hands on.</p>
<h2>The Baishiya Karst Cave</h2>
<p>The finds come from a site called the Baishiya Karst Cave, which is perched on a cliff on the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau. It's located at a high altitude (over 3,000 meters or nearly 11,000 feet) but borders a high open plain, as you can see in the picture below.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035203#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035203&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Outside a 100-year-old house on the edge of the Peak District in northern England, a <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/heat-pumps/">heat pump’s</a> fan blades are swiftly spinning. They’re drawing outdoor air over coils of refrigerant, harvesting warmth from that air. All air-source heat pumps do this—and they can glean heat <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/myth-heat-pumps-cold-weather-freezing-subzero/">even on cold days</a>. But this heat pump is special. It is one of the most efficient installations of its kind in the country.</p>
<p>“I’m number two on there,” fizzes owner Rob Ritchie, a retired chemistry teacher, referring to the system’s position <a class="external-link" href="https://heatpumpmonitor.org/#mode=topofthescops" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://heatpumpmonitor.org/#mode=topofthescops" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://heatpumpmonitor.org/#mode=topofthescops"}'>on HeatPumpMonitor.org</a>, a kind of online leaderboard for heat pumps around the UK and beyond. “I should say it isn’t important—but it is. It’s nice being there.” </p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>
<p>At the time of writing, real-time data suggests that for every kilowatt-hour of electricity Ritchie’s heat pump consumes, it delivers 5.5 kilowatt-hours of heat—a coefficient of performance, or COP, of 5.5. Achieving a COP of 5 or above is “absolutely incredible,” says Emma-Louise Bennett, active transition support lead at <a class="external-link" href="https://www.viessmann.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.viessmann.co.uk/" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.viessmann.co.uk/"}'>Viessmann</a>, the company that made Ritchie’s heat pump.

<p>A California-based credit union with over 450,000 members said it suffered a ransomware attack that is disrupting account services and could take weeks to recover from.</p>
<p>"The next few days—and coming weeks—may present challenges for our members, as we continue to navigate around the limited functionality we are experiencing due to this incident," Patelco Credit Union CEO Erin Mendez told members in a <a href="https://www.patelco.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-1-CEO-Update.pdf">July 1 message</a> that said the security problem was caused by a ransomware attack. Online banking and several other services are unavailable, while several other services and types of transactions have limited functionality.</p>

<p>About two years after the country’s digital minister publicly <a href="https://x.com/konotaromp/status/1564767072554745856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1564767072554745856%7Ctwgr%5E067bb0ed1dd744b2bf2d78b4b36796cb16d7338c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Finformation-technology%2F2022%2F08%2Fjapan-declares-war-on-floppy-disks-for-government-use%2F">declared</a> a “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/japan-declares-war-on-floppy-disks-for-government-use/">war on floppy discs</a>,” Japan reportedly stopped using floppy disks in governmental systems as of June 28.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-declares-victory-effort-end-government-use-floppy-disks-2024-07-03/">Reuters</a> report on Wednesday, Japan's government "eliminated the use of floppy disks in all its systems." The report notes that by mid-June, Japan's Digital Agency (a body set up during the COVID-19 pandemic and aimed at updating government technology) had "scrapped all 1,034 regulations governing their use, except for one environmental stricture related to vehicle recycling.” That suggests that there's up to one government use that could still turn to floppy disks, though more details weren't available.</p>
<p>Digital Minister Taro Kono, the politician behind the modernization of the Japanese government's tech, has made his distaste for floppy disks and other old office tech, like fax machines, quite public. Kono, who's <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/election/20240627-194994/">reportedly</a> considering a second presidential run, told Reuters in a statement today:</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035152#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035152&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After more than five decades of limbo, the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/brominated-vegetable-oil-bvo">revoked the authorization of brominated vegetable oil (BVO</a>) in food, banning an additive long known to have toxic effects that is already banned in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and California.</p>
<p>BVO—simply vegetable oil that is modified with bromine—has been used in foods since the 1920s. It has often been used as a stabilizer for fruit flavorings, particularly in citrusy beverages, including sodas, to keep the citrus flavoring from separating and floating to the top. The FDA authorized the use of BVO just after gaining the authority to regulate food additives in 1958. By the early 1960s, the FDA had put BVO on its first inventory of food additives it deemed generally safe—designated "generally recognized as safe" or GRAS. But safety concerns quickly surfaced, and by the late 1960s, the FDA had already limited its use to a flavoring stabilizer and capped the amount that could be used to 15 parts per million.</p>
<p>That 15-ppm limit was authorized on an "interim basis," pending more safety studies. In 1970, the FDA revoked the GRAS designation for BVO, but continued to allow the 15-ppm limit—on an interim basis—given that safety studies "did not indicate an immediate health threat from the limited use."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035154#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035154&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A small research satellite designed to study the violent processes behind the creation and destruction of chemical elements will launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2027, NASA announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) mission features a gamma-ray telescope that will scan the sky to study gamma-rays emitted by the explosions of massive stars and the end of their lives. These supernova explosions generate reactions that fuse new atomic nuclei, a process called nucleosynthesis, of heavier elements.</p>
<p>Using data from COSI, scientists will map where these elements are forming in the Milky Way galaxy. COSI's observations will also yield new insights into the annihilation of positrons, the antimatter equivalent of electrons, which appear to be originating from the center of the galaxy. Another goal for COSI will be to rapidly report the location of short gamma-ray bursts, unimaginably violent explosions that flash and then fade in just a couple of seconds. These bursts are likely caused by merging neutron stars.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035108#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035108&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OnlyFans' paywalls make it hard for police to detect child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) on the platform, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/millions-paywalls-impede-scrutiny-onlyfans-2024-07-02/">reported</a>—especially new CSAM that can be harder to uncover online.</p>
<p>Because each OnlyFans creator posts their content behind their own paywall, five specialists in online child sexual abuse told Reuters that it's hard to independently verify just how much CSAM is posted. Cops would seemingly need to subscribe to each account to monitor the entire platform, one expert who aids in police CSAM investigations, Trey Amick, suggested to Reuters.</p>
<p>OnlyFans claims that the amount of CSAM on its platform is extremely low. Out of 3.2 million accounts sharing "hundreds of millions of posts," OnlyFans only removed 347 posts as suspected CSAM in 2023. Each post was voluntarily reported to the CyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which OnlyFans told Reuters has "full access" to monitor content on the platform.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035127#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035127&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore.—The timing of Robert Wickens' life-altering crash at Pocono Raceway in 2018 could hardly have been more cruel. After landing a full-time seat in IndyCar, he was named rookie of the year at the Indy 500 in June, finally showing the world his talent in a single-seat race car. F1's loss was IndyCar's gain, and the prospect of championships seemed certain. But <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/23411/here-are-the-injuries-indycar-star-robert-wickens-suffered-during-vicious-pocono-crash">a bad wreck</a> derailed all of that, leaving Wickens paralyzed from the waist down. This past weekend, he made his return to the cockpit of a single-seater, testing a Formula E car with hand controls at Portland International Raceway.</p>
<p>It wasn't his first time in a racing car since 2018—for the last few years he's been running in IMSA's Michelin Pilot Challenge series, taking the 2023 TCR championship in a Hyundai Elantra N. But Formula E's GenBeta car weighs almost 900 lbs less than Wickens' Hyundai and boasts far more power and that immediate electric torque. More power than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/porsche-unveils-smaller-lighter-faster-formula-e-race-car-the-99x/">the Gen3 Formula E cars</a> that lined up to race the following day, too—the 530 hp (395 kW) GenBeta machine is Formula E's test bed and is able to deploy energy from its front electric motor (in addition to the rear motor) instead of just regenerating energy under braking.</p>
<p>I spoke with Wickens a few hours before his test and asked what he was expecting in terms of performance. "It's an entirely different beast to an IndyCar," he said. "So I know here in Portland that they actually had the exact same straight line speed as IndyCar [170 mph/275 km/h], obviously achieving in very different ways. The aerodynamic differences between the two and the whole philosophy of the series are entirely different. You'll never really compare them, apples to apples, I don't think, but, I'm really excited to give the Gen beta car a go," Wickens said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035123#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035123&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Because most things about Earth change so slowly, it's difficult to imagine them being any different in the past. But Earth's rotation has been slowing due to tidal interactions with the Moon, meaning that days were considerably shorter in the past. It's easy to think that a 22-hour day wouldn't be all that different, but that turns out not to be entirely true.</p>
<p>For example, some modeling has indicated that certain day lengths will be in resonance with other effects caused by the planet's rotation, which can potentially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/the-gravitational-interactions-that-have-helped-us-dodge-60-hour-days/">offset the drag</a> caused by the tides. Now, a new paper looks at how these resonances could affect the climate. The results suggest that it would shift rain to occurring in the morning and evening while leaving midday skies largely cloud-free. The resulting Earth would be considerably warmer.</p>
<h2>On the Lamb</h2>
<p>We're all pretty familiar with the fact that the daytime Sun warms up the air. And those of us who remember high school chemistry will recall that a gas that is warmed will expand. So, it shouldn't be a surprise to hear that the Earth's atmosphere expands due to warming on its day side and contracts back again as it cools (these lag the daytime peak in sunlight). These differences provide something a bit like a handle that the gravitational pulls of the Sun and Moon can grab onto, exerting additional forces on the atmosphere. This complicated network of forces churns our atmosphere, helping shape the planet's weather.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035071#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035071&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ah, cats. We love our furry feline overlords despite the occasional hairball and their propensity to scratch the furniture to sharpen their claws. The latter is perfectly natural kitty behavior, but overly aggressive scratching is usually perceived as a behavioral problem. Veterinarians frown on taking extreme measures like declawing or even euthanizing such "problematic" cats. But there are alternative science-backed strategies for reducing or redirecting the scratching behavior, according to the authors of a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2024.1403068/full">new paper</a> published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science.</p>
<p>This latest study builds on the group's prior research investigating the effects of synthetic feline facial pheromones on undesirable scratching in cats, according to co-author Yasemin Salgirli Demirbas, a veterinary researcher at Ankara University in Turkey. "From the beginning, our research team agreed that it was essential to explore broader factors that might exacerbate this issue, such as those influencing stress and, consequently, scratching behavior in cats," she told Ars. "What’s new in this study is our focus on the individual, environmental, and social dynamics affecting the level of scratching behavior. This perspective aims to enhance our understanding of how human and animal welfare are interconnected in different scenarios."</p>
<p>The study investigated the behavior of 1,211 cats, with data collected via an online questionnaire completed by the cats' caregivers. The first section collected information about the caregivers, while the second asked about the cats' daily routines, social interactions, environments, behaviors, and temperaments. The third and final section gathered information about the frequency and intensity of undesirable scratching behavior in the cats based on a helpful "scratching index."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034541#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034541&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On the day before Christmas last year, a Falcon 9 rocket launched from California and put two spy satellites into low-Earth orbit for the armed forces of Germany, which are collectively called the Bundeswehr.</p>
<p>Initially, the mission appeared successful. The German satellite manufacturer, OHB, <a href="https://www.ohb.de/en/news/sarah-satellites-successfully-launched">declared that</a> the two satellites were "safely in orbit." The addition of the two SARah satellites completed a next-generation constellation of three reconnaissance satellites, the company said.</p>
<p>However, six months later, the two satellites have yet to become operational. <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-schwierigkeiten-bei-sarah-spionagesatelliten-a-1f6a0e7a-38f2-4a63-af65-78eb43c1d736">According to</a> the German publication Der Spiegel, the antennas on the satellites cannot be unfolded. Engineers with OHB have tried to resolve the issue by resetting the flight software, performing maneuvers to vibrate or shake the antennas loose, and more to no avail.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035061#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035061&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In December, New York became the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/ny-passes-right-to-repair-will-require-tech-oems-to-share-tools-diagnostic-info/">first state</a> to enact a "Right to Repair" law for electronics. Since then, other states, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/oregon-governor-signs-nations-first-right-to-repair-bill-that-bans-part-pairing/">Oregon</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/minnesota-enacts-right-to-repair-law-that-covers-more-devices-than-any-other-state/">Minnesota</a>, have passed similar laws. However, a recent analysis of some recently released gadgets shows that self-repair still has a long way to go before it becomes ubiquitous.</p>
<p>On Monday, the US Public Interest Research Group (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/all-the-ways-streaming-services-are-aggravating-their-subscribers-this-week/">PIRG</a>) released its Leaders and Laggards <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/leaders-and-laggards-in-new-york/">report</a> that examined user repairability of 21 devices subject to New York's electronics Right to Repair law. The nonprofit graded devices "based on the quality and accessibility of repair manuals, spare parts, and other critical repair materials.”</p>
<p>Nathan Proctor, one of the report's authors and senior director for the Campaign for the Right to Repair for the US PIRG Education Fund, told Ars Technica via email that PIRG focused on new models since the law only applies to new products, adding that PIRG "tried to include a range of covered devices from well-known brands."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034998#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034998&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) continues to reveal how photos of real children casually posted online years ago are being used to train AI models powering image generators—even when platforms prohibit scraping and families use strict privacy settings.</p>
<p>Last month, HRW researcher Hye Jung Han <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/ai-trained-on-photos-from-kids-entire-childhood-without-their-consent/">found 170 photos of Brazilian kids that were linked in LAION-5B</a>, a popular AI dataset built from Common Crawl snapshots of the public web. Now, she has released a second <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/02/australia-childrens-personal-photos-misused-power-ai-tools">report</a>, flagging 190 photos of children from all of Australia’s states and territories, including indigenous children who may be particularly vulnerable to harms.</p>
<p>These photos are linked in the dataset "without the knowledge or consent of the children or their families." They span the entirety of childhood, making it possible for AI image generators to generate realistic deepfakes of real Australian children, Han's report said. Perhaps even more concerning, the URLs in the dataset sometimes reveal identifying information about children, including their names and locations where photos were shot, making it easy to track down children whose images might not otherwise be discoverable online.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035015#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035015&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US government will pay Moderna $176 million to develop an mRNA vaccine against a pandemic influenza—an award given as the highly pathogenic bird flu virus H5N1 continues to spread widely among US dairy cattle.</p>
<p>The funding flows through BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, as part of a new Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) Consortium. The program is intended to set up partnerships with industry to help the country better prepare for pandemic threats and develop medical countermeasures, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/07/02/hhs-provides-176-million-develop-pandemic-influenza-mrna-based-vaccine.html">the Department of Health and Human Services said in a press announcement Tuesday</a>.</p>

The company said it expects to release the results of that trial this year and that those results will direct the design of a Phase 3 trial, anticipated to begin in 2025.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035014#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035014&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Researchers have warned of a critical vulnerability affecting the OpenSSH networking utility that can be exploited to give attackers complete control of Linux and Unix servers with no authentication required.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-6387, allows unauthenticated remote code execution with root system rights on Linux systems that are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glibc">glibc</a>, an open source implementation of the C standard library. The vulnerability is the result of a code regression introduced in 2020 that reintroduced CVE-2006-5051, a vulnerability that was fixed in 2006. With thousands, if not millions, of vulnerable servers populating the Internet, this latest vulnerability could pose a significant risk.</p>
<h2>Complete system takeover</h2>
<p>“This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent access,” <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/07/01/regresshion-remote-unauthenticated-code-execution-vulnerability-in-openssh-server">wrote</a> Bharat Jogi, the senior director of threat research at Qualys, the security firm that discovered it. “It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other vulnerable systems within the organization.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035011#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035011&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Supreme Court today agreed to hear a challenge to the Texas law that requires age verification on porn sites. A <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/070224zor_2co3.pdf">list of orders</a> released this morning shows that the court granted a petition for certiorari filed by the Free Speech Coalition, an adult-industry lobby group.</p>
<p>In March, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/texas-can-require-age-verification-on-porn-sites-5th-circuit-judges-rule/">ruled</a> that Texas could continue enforcing the law while litigation continues. In a 2-1 decision, 5th Circuit judges wrote that "the age-verification requirement is rationally related to the government's legitimate interest in preventing minors' access to pornography. Therefore, the age-verification requirement does not violate the First Amendment."</p>
<p>The dissenting judge faulted the 5th Circuit majority for reviewing the law under the "rational-basis" standard instead of the more stringent strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court "has unswervingly applied strict scrutiny to content-based regulations that limit adults' access to protected speech," Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote at the time.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034992#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034992&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
