                            <![CDATA[<p>Negotiations over the US federal budget for fiscal year 2026 are in the beginning stages, but when it comes to space, the fault lines are already solidifying in the Senate.</p>
<p>The Trump White House released its budget request last Friday, and this included <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/fy-2026-budget-request/">detailed information</a> about its plans for NASA. On Thursday, just days later, the US Senate shot back with its own budget priorities for the space agency.</p>
<p>The US budget process is complicated and somewhat broken in recent years, as Congress has failed to pass a budget on time. So, we are probably at least several months away from seeing a final fiscal year 2026 budget from Congress. But we got our first glimpse of the Senate's thinking when the chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released his "legislative directives" for NASA on Thursday</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/senate-response-to-white-house-budget-for-nasa-keep-sls-nix-science/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Discord members are biting their nails. As reports swirl that the social media company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/discords-cto-is-just-as-worried-about-enshittification-as-you-are-173049834.html">is planning an initial public offering</a> this year and increasingly leans on advertising revenue, there's fear that Discord will become engulfed in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/as-internet-enshittification-marches-on-here-are-some-of-the-worst-offenders/">enshittification</a> that has already scarred so many online communities. Co-founder and CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy claims he's worried about that, too.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/discords-cto-is-just-as-worried-about-enshittification-as-you-are-173049834.html">Engadget </a>published today, Vishnevskiy claimed that Discord employees regularly discuss concerns about Discord going astray and angering users.</p>
<p>"I understand the anxiety and concern," Vishnevskiy said. "I think the things that people are afraid of are what separate a great, long-term focused company from just any other company."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/discord-cto-says-hes-constantly-bringing-up-enshittification-during-meetings/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A remarkable schoolyard brawl erupted online Thursday between President Donald Trump and his former "First Buddy" Elon Musk during which the pair traded insults and barbs. The war of words reached a crescendo during the afternoon when Trump threatened Musk's federal contracts.</p>

I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114632206992330264">Trump wrote</a> on his social media network, Truth Social, at 2:37 pm ET.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It seems like hardly a day goes by anymore without a new version of Google's Gemini AI landing, and sure enough, Google is rolling out a major update to its most powerful 2.5 Pro model. This release is aimed at fixing some problems that cropped up in an earlier Gemini Pro update, and the word is, this version will become a stable release that comes to the Gemini app for everyone to use.</p>
<p>The previous Gemini 2.5 Pro release, known as the I/O Edition, or simply 05-06, was focused on coding upgrades. <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-pro-latest-preview/">Google claims</a> the new version is even better at generating code, with a new high score of 82.2 percent in the Aider Polyglot test. That beats the best from OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek by a comfortable margin.</p>
<p>While the general-purpose Gemini 2.5 Flash has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/gemini-2-5-is-leaving-preview-just-in-time-for-googles-new-250-ai-subscription/">left preview</a>, the Pro version is lagging behind. In fact, the last several updates have attracted some valid criticism of 2.5 Pro's performance outside of coding tasks since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">big 03-25 update</a>. Google's Logan Kilpatrick <a href="https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1930657743251349854">says</a> the team has taken that feedback to heart and that the new model "closes [the] gap on 03-25 regressions." For example, users will supposedly see more creativity with better formatting of responses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-releases-updated-gemini-2-5-pro-says-its-the-most-intelligent-model-yet/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, the GPU itself is less interesting than the storm Nvidia stirred up by trying to earn it better reviews. If you don’t follow the twists and turns of graphics card launch metanarratives, allow me to recap the company's behavior for you.</p>
<p>Though the RTX 5060 launched on May 19, Nvidia and its partners were uncharacteristically slow to ship graphics cards to reviewers. For outlets that received pre-launch hardware, Nvidia didn’t provide the pre-launch drivers that it usually sends out so that reviewers could run their own tests on the cards, informing reviewers on a call that drivers would be available to them and the public on the 19th.</p>
<p>Except! Nvidia <em>did</em> offer advance drivers to a handful of publications on the condition that they run a few benchmarks that had been pre-selected by Nvidia and that they only report numbers from tests performed with the 50-series new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) setting enabled.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-and-5060-review-putting-the-mid-in-mid-range/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, ahead of the launch of the Switch 2 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">its GameChat communication features</a>, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/privacy-policy/whats-changed/">updated</a> its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a> to note that the company "may also monitor and record your video and audio interactions with other users." Now that the Switch 2 has officially launched, we have a clearer understanding of how the console handles audio and video recorded during GameChat sessions, as well as when that footage may be sent to Nintendo or shared with partners, including law enforcement.</p>
<p>Before using GameChat on Switch 2 for the first time, you must consent to a set of GameChat Terms displayed on the system itself. These terms warn that chat content is "recorded and stored temporarily" both on your system and the system of those you chat with. But those stored recordings are only shared with Nintendo if a user reports a violation of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/community-guidelines/?srsltid=AfmBOoq-mAHbzdcIN7q8kBPONxq-dm5WM2_fFDG_ec16SRZc0dWkz-Xr">Nintendo's Community Guidelines</a>, the company writes.</p>
<p>That reporting feature lets a user "review a recording of the last three minutes of the latest three GameChat sessions" to highlight a particular section for review, suggesting that chat sessions are not being captured and stored in full. The terms also lay out that "these recordings are available only if the report is submitted within 24 hours," suggesting that recordings are deleted from local storage after a full day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-warns-switch-2-gamechat-users-your-chat-is-recorded/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Calling Anthropic two-faced for depicting itself as a "white knight of the AI industry" while allegedly lying about AI scraping, Reddit painted Anthropic as the worst among major AI players. While Anthropic rivals like OpenAI and Google paid Reddit to license data—and, crucially, agreed to "Reddit’s licensing terms that protect Reddit and its users’ interests and privacy" and require AI companies to respect Redditors' deletions—Anthropic wouldn't participate in licensing talks, Reddit alleged.</p>
<p>"Unlike its competitors, Anthropic has refused to agree to respect Reddit users’ basic privacy rights, including removing deleted posts from its systems," Reddit's complaint said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/reddit-sues-anthropic-over-ai-scraping-that-retained-users-deleted-posts/">Read full article</a></p>

On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it.</p>
<p>The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently <a href="https://www.sanmarcostx.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_06032025-4464">proposed</a>, down the road.</p>

      <em>Alien: Earth</em> is set two years before the events of 1979's <em>Alien</em>.

<p>It's been a long wait for diehard fans of Ridley Scott's <em>Alien</em> franchise, but we finally have a fittingly sinister official trailer for the spinoff prequel series, <em>Alien: Earth,</em> coming this summer to FX/Hulu.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/alien-earth-teaser-gives-us-xenomorphs-pov/">previously reported</a>, the official premise is short and sweet: "When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat."</p>
<p>The series is set in 2120, two years before the events of the first film, <em>Alien</em> (1979), in a world where corporate interests are competing to be the first to unlock the key to human longevity—maybe even immortality. Showrunner Noah Hawley <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/noah-hawley-alien-series-prometheus-backstory-not-useful-1235871454/">has said</a> that the style and mythology will be closer to that film than <em>Prometheus</em> (2012) or <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, both of which were also prequels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/fx-hulu-releases-sinister-alien-earth-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/">we covered</a> in May, the moratorium would prevent states from regulating AI for a decade.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Under the Trump administration, the Food and Drug Administration is eagerly embracing artificial intelligence tools that staff members are reportedly calling rushed, buggy, overhyped, and inaccurate.</p>
<p>On Monday, the FDA publicly announced the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-launches-agency-wide-ai-tool-optimize-performance-american-people">agency-wide rollout of a large language model (LLM) called Elsa</a>, which is intended to help FDA employees—"from scientific reviewers to investigators." The FDA said the generative AI is already being used to "accelerate clinical protocol reviews, shorten the time needed for scientific evaluations, and identify high-priority inspection targets."</p>
<p>"It can summarize adverse events to support safety profile assessments, perform faster label comparisons, and generate code to help develop databases for nonclinical applications," the announcement promised.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/fda-rushed-out-agency-wide-ai-tool-its-not-going-well/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, classic computer collector Joe Strosnider <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/museumjoe.bsky.social/post/3lqq3v43hh52b">announced</a> the availability of a new 3D-printer filament that replicates the iconic "<a href="https://vintagemacmuseum.com/when-the-mac-plus-changed-from-beige-to-platinum/">Platinum</a>" color scheme used in classic Macintosh computers from the late 1980s through the 1990s. The PLA filament (PLA is short for polylactic acid) allows hobbyists to 3D-print nostalgic novelties, replacement parts, and accessories that match the original color of vintage Apple computers.</p>
<p>Hobbyists commonly feed this type of filament into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/what-i-learned-from-my-first-few-months-with-a-bambu-lab-a1-3d-printer-part-1/">commercial desktop 3D printers</a>, which heat the plastic and extrude it in a computer-controlled way to fabricate new plastic parts.</p>
<p>The Platinum color, which Apple used in its desktop and portable computer lines starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS">Apple IIgs</a> in 1986, has become synonymous with a distinctive era of classic Macintosh aesthetic. Over time, original Macintosh plastics have become <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/189/what-happened-to-my-snes-case-discoloration-in-classic-machines">brittle and discolored</a> with age, so matching the "original" color can be a somewhat challenging and subjective experience.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/06/new-filament-lets-you-3d-print-parts-in-authentic-1980s-apple-computer-color/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, DC—The general outline of the Trump administration's proposed 2026 budget was released a few weeks back, and it included massive cuts for most agencies, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/trumps-2026-budget-proposal-crippling-cuts-for-science-across-the-board/">every one that funds scientific research</a>. Late last week, those agencies began releasing details of what the cuts would mean for the actual projects and people they support. And the results are as bad as the initial budget had suggested: one-of-a-kind scientific experiment facilities and hardware retired, massive cuts in supported scientists, and entire areas of research halted.</p>
<p>And this comes in an environment where previously funded grants are being terminated, funding is being held up for ideological screening, and universities have been subjected to arbitrary funding freezes. Collectively, things are heading for damage to US science that will take decades to recover from. It's a radical break from the trajectory science had been on.</p>
<p>That's the environment that the US's National Academies of Science found itself in yesterday while hosting the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/44894_06-2025_the-state-of-the-science-address-2025">State of the Science</a> event in Washington, DC. It was an obvious opportunity for the nation's leading scientific organization to warn the nation of the consequences of the path that the current administration has been traveling. Instead, the event largely ignored the present to worry about a future that may never exist.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/us-science-is-being-wrecked-and-its-leadership-is-fighting-the-last-war/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"I got a call Friday, of last week, that the president has decided to go in a different direction," Isaacman said. "It was a real bummer."</p>
<p>It was a real bummer for most of the space community, myself included. To be clear, I am biased. I have gotten to know Isaacman over the last five years rather well, talking with him about his passion for spaceflight, what is working, and what is not. What I have discovered in Isaacman is a person who cares deeply about the future of US spaceflight and wants to make a meaningful contribution to its advancement. To see him done wrong like this, well, it's a very sordid affair.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/jared-isaacman-speaks-out-and-its-clear-that-nasa-lost-a-visionary-leader/">Read full article</a></p>

Starks' departure could have given Carr a 2-1 Republican majority, but it turns out Republican Commissioner Nathan Simington will leave at the same time as Starks.</p>
<p>"I will be concluding my tenure at the Federal Communications Commission at the end of this week," Simington <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-411800A1.pdf">announced</a> today. "It has been the greatest honor of my professional life to serve the American people as a Commissioner. I am deeply honored to have been entrusted with this responsibility by President Donald J. Trump during his first term."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/two-fcc-commissioners-resign-trumps-chair-still-lacks-republican-majority/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">OpenAI is now fighting a court <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Preservation-Order-5-13-25.pdf">order</a> to preserve all ChatGPT user logs—including deleted chats and sensitive chats logged through its API business offering—after news organizations suing over copyright claims accused the AI company of destroying evidence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"Before OpenAI had an opportunity to respond to those unfounded accusations, the court ordered OpenAI to 'preserve and segregate all output log data that would otherwise be deleted on a going forward basis until further order of the Court (in essence, the output log data that OpenAI has been destroying)," OpenAI explained in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NYT-v-OpenAI-Preservation-Order-5-13-25.pdf">court filing</a> demanding oral arguments in a bid to block the controversial order.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the filing, OpenAI alleged that the court rushed the order based only on a hunch raised by The New York Times and other news plaintiffs. And now, without "any just cause," OpenAI argued, the order "continues to prevent OpenAI from respecting its users’ privacy decisions." That risk extended to users of ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro, as well as users of OpenAI’s application programming interface (API), OpenAI said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-says-court-forcing-it-to-save-all-chatgpt-logs-is-a-privacy-nightmare/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p class="p1">It was shortly after moving into Chicago's Jefferson Park neighborhood that I saw the sign for the first time: American Science &amp; Surplus. My curiosity piqued, I pulled into the strip mall and walked into a store filled with an unimaginable variety of lab equipment, military surplus, tools, electronics, toys, and so much more.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, nearly 90 years after its launch selling "reject lenses" as American Lens &amp; Photo, <a href="https://sciplus.com">American Science &amp; Surplus</a> is facing an existential threat. The COVID-19 pandemic and increased costs hit the business hard, so the store has launched a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/keep-american-science-surplus-alive">GoFundMe campaign looking to raise $200,000</a> from customers and fans alike. What's happening in suburban Chicago is a microcosm of the challenges facing local retail, with big-box retailers and online behemoths overwhelming beloved local institutions. It's a story that has played out countless times in the last two-plus decades, and owner Pat Meyer is hoping this tale has a different ending.</p>

<p class="p1">Launching a fundraiser was a tough choice for Meyer. "I don't like asking people for money," he said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/american-science-surplus-is-fighting-for-its-life-heres-why-you-should-care/">Read full article</a></p>

Today, though, with the June 5 launch of the Switch 2 having already arrived in regions like Japan and Australia, the ever-efficient UPS driver delivered final retail hardware straight from Nintendo of America to the Ars Orbiting HQ.</p>

<p>The 14-hour lead time between our receipt of the hardware and the midnight launch of the Switch 2 on the US East Coast isn't close to enough time to put together a comprehensive review. For now, though, we thought we'd take you through a pictorial journey of our unboxing and initial setup process, ahead of much more coverage to come.</p>
<p>And while you peruse the images, we recommend listening to the absolute bop that is the Switch 2 setup music, which we've embedded below:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/its-here-unboxing-and-setting-up-our-switch-2-review-unit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) teamed up with DOGE to fire 10,000 employees while relying on "hopelessly error-ridden" personnel records, a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.281208/gov.uscourts.dcd.281208.1.0_3.pdf">class-action complaint</a> filed yesterday alleged. The lawsuit said the HHS terminated thousands of workers on April 1, shortly after sharing the flawed personnel records with the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>"These agencies knew that the records were hopelessly error-ridden, and that the records should have been used, if at all, with great caution," said the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the District of Columbia. "Instead of taking steps to verify the contents of the records and correct the systemic inaccuracies, the agencies promptly used them to fire 10,000 employees."</p>
<p>The case was filed by a law firm founded by former Justice Department attorneys on behalf of seven named plaintiffs and all others who were laid off as part of the April 1 Reduction in Force (RIF). It alleges that the government violated the Privacy Act, which <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552a">requires</a> agencies to verify the accuracy of information used as the basis for adverse actions against employees.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/lawsuit-doge-hhs-used-hopelessly-error-ridden-data-to-fire-10000-workers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Over the years, scholars of the Dead Sea Scrolls have analyzed the ancient parchments with various methods: for example, X-rays, multispectral imaging, "virtual unfolding," and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeography">paleography</a>, i.e., studying elements in their writing styles. The scrolls are believed to date back to between the third century BCE and the first century CE, but those dates rely largely on paleography, since only a handful of the scrolls have calendar dates written on them.</p>
<p>However, the traditional paleographic method is inherently subjective and based on a given scholar's experience. A team of scientists has combined radiocarbon dating from 24 scroll samples and machine-learning-based handwriting analysis to create their own AI program—dubbed Enoch. The objective was to achieve more accurate date estimates, according to a <a href="https://plos.io/44KpPfy">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE. Among the findings: Many of the scrolls are older than previously thought.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/scientists-discover-that-four-blank-dead-sea-scrolls-actually-have-text/">reported earlier</a>, these ancient Hebrew texts—roughly <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2019-09/miot-htm083019.php">900 full and partial scrolls</a> in all, stored in clay jars—were first discovered scattered in various caves near what was once the settlement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qumran_Caves">Qumran</a>, just north of the Dead Sea, by Bedouin shepherds in 1946–1947. (Apparently, a shepherd threw a rock while searching for a lost member of his flock and accidentally shattered one of the clay jars, leading to the discovery.) Qumran was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qumran">destroyed by the Romans</a>, circa 73 CE, and historians believe the scrolls were hidden in the caves by a sect called the Essenes to protect them from being destroyed. The natural limestone and conditions within the caves helped preserve the scrolls for millennia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/are-dead-sea-scrolls-older-than-we-thought/">Read full article</a></p>
