<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A little more than a day after launching into space, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft flew up to the International Space Station and docked with the orbiting laboratory on Thursday</p>
<p>The journey through space was not always easy. In the immediate hours after launch on Wednesday, the spacecraft was beset by two helium leaks in its propulsion system. Then, on Thursday, several of Starliner's spacecraft thrusters went offline for a time. Far more often than originally planned, spacecraft commander Butch Wilmore had to take manual control of Starliner while engineers on the ground worked on these and other issues.</p>
<p>However, at 1:34 pm ET on Thursday, Wilmore and the mission's other crew member, Suni Williams, successfully docked with the space station. A couple of hours later, they floated through the hatch, making a triumphant entry onto the station—and making history.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029550#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029550&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpaceX demonstrated Thursday that its towering Super Heavy booster and Starship rocket might one day soon be recovered and reused in the manner Elon Musk has envisioned for the future of space exploration.</p>
<p>For the first time, both elements of the nearly 400-foot-tall (121-meter) rocket not only launched successfully from SpaceX's Starbase facility near Brownsville, Texas, but also came back to Earth for controlled splashdowns at sea. This demonstration is a forerunner to future Starship test flights that will bring the booster, and eventually the upper stage, back to land for reuse again and again.</p>
<p>The two-stage rocket took off from Starbase at 7:50 am CDT (12:50 UTC) and headed east over the Gulf of Mexico with more than 15 million pounds of thrust, roughly twice the power of NASA's Saturn V rocket from the Apollo lunar program of the 1960s and 1970s.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029471#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029471&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission wants to verify that Internet service providers are strengthening their networks against attacks that take advantage of vulnerabilities in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).</p>
<p>The FCC today <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-internet-routing-security-reporting-requirements">unanimously approved</a> a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would require ISPs to prepare confidential reports "detail[ing] their progress and plans for implementing BGP security measures that utilize the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), a critical component of BGP security."</p>
<p>"Today, we begin a rulemaking to help make our Internet routing more secure," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said. "We propose that all providers of broadband Internet access service prepare and update confidential BGP security risk management plans. These plans would describe and attest to their efforts to follow existing best practices with respect to Route Origin Authorizations and Route Origin Validation using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure. In addition, we propose quarterly reporting for the largest providers to ensure we are making progress addressing this well-known vulnerability."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029635#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029635&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Light painting is a technique used in both art and science that involves taking long-exposure photographs while moving some kind of light source—a small flashlight, perhaps, or candles or glowsticks—to essentially trace an image with light. A UK collaboration of scientists and artists has combined light painting with low-cost air pollution sensors to visualize concentrations of particulate matter (PM) in select locations in India, Ethiopia, and Wales. The objective is to creatively highlight the health risks posed by air pollution, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01409-4">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature Communications.</p>
<p>“Air pollution is the leading global environmental risk factor," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1047036?">said co-author Francis Pope</a>, an environmental scientist at the University of Birmingham in the UK who spearheaded the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021EGUGA..23.2255P/abstract">Air of the Anthropocene</a> project with artist Robin Price. "[The project] creates spaces and places for discussions about air pollution, using art as a proxy to communicate and create dialogues about the issues associated with air pollution. By painting with light to create impactful images, we provide people with an easy-to-understand way of comparing air pollution in different contexts—making something that was largely invisible visible."</p>
<p>Light painting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_painting">has been around</a> since 1889, when <a title="Étienne-Jules Marey" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey">Étienne-Jules Marey</a> and <a title="Georges Demenÿ" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Demen%C3%BF">Georges Demeny</a>, who were investigating the use of photography as a scientific tool to study biological motion, created the first known light painting called <em>Pathological Walk From in Front</em>. In 1914, Frank and Lillian Mollier Gilbreth tracked the motion of manufacturing and clerical workers using light painting techniques, and <a href="https://cocktailpartyphysics.com/tripping-the-light-fantastic/">in 1935,</a> Man Ray "signed" his <em>Space Writing</em> series with a penlight—a private joke that wasn't discovered until 74 years later by photographer/historian <a href="http://www.ellencareyphotography.com/pictus-writ-man-ray/">Ellen Carey</a> in 2009.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029387#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029387&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The European Center for Digital Rights, known as Noyb, has filed complaints in 11 European countries to halt Meta's plan to start training vague new AI technologies on European Union-based Facebook and Instagram users' personal posts and pictures.</p>
<p>Meta's AI training data will also be collected from third parties and from using Meta's generative AI features and interacting with pages, the company has said. Additionally, Meta plans to collect information about people who aren't on Facebook or Instagram but are featured in users' posts or photos. The only exception from AI training is made for private messages sent between "friends and family," which will not be processed, Meta's <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/h/bringing-generative-ai-experiences-to-people-in-europe/">blog</a> said, but private messages sent to businesses and Meta are fair game. And any data collected for AI training could be shared with third parties.</p>
<p>"Unlike the already problematic situation of companies using certain (public) data to train a specific AI system (e.g. a chatbot), Meta's new privacy policy basically says that the company wants to take all public and non-public user data that it has collected since 2007 and use it for any undefined type of current and future 'artificial intelligence technology,'" Noyb alleged in a press release.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029628#p3">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029628&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A few weeks ago, we called some attention to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/">legal difficulty of passing on your digital Steam game library</a> after you die. While Valve hasn't responded to a request for comment on the matter, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/06/gog-looks-to-out-steam-steam-with-optional-drm-free-galaxy-platform/">PC gaming platform GOG</a> tells Ars that it is ready and willing to help users transfer their accounts in the event of their death.</p>
<p>As long as they bring a court order, that is.</p>
<p>"In general, your GOG account and GOG content is not transferable," GOG spokesperson Zuzanna Rybacka tells Ars. "However, if you can obtain a copy of a court order that specifically entitles someone to your GOG personal account, the digital content attached to it, taking into account the EULAs of specific games within it, and that specifically refers to your GOG username or at least email address used to create such an account, we’d do our best to make it happen."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029619#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029619&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The last time a human set the world record for solving a Rubik's Cube, it was Max Park, at 3.13 seconds for a standard 3×3×3 cube, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rubiks-cube-world-record-gets-215000596.html">set in June 2023</a>. It is going to be very difficult for any human to pull off a John Henry-like usurping of the new machine record, which is more than 10 times faster, at 0.305 seconds. That's within the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4043155/#RSIF20130227C2">accepted time frame for human eye blinking</a>, which averages out to one-third of a second.</p>
<p>TOKUFASTbot, built by Mitsubishi Electric, can actually pull off a solve in as little as 0.204 seconds on video, but not when Guinness World Records judges were measuring. The previous mechanical record was 0.38 seconds.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/59qgzzSD1tk?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Mitsubishi Electric's TOKUFASTbot, solving a Rubik's-like puzzle on May 7, two weeks before judges showed up to verify its world-record speed. </p></div>
<p>There are a few footnotes and caveats to what would otherwise be an incremental gain and nifty slow-motion video. The first thing is that the world record reported is for "fastest robot to solve a rotating puzzle cube." That intriguingly sidesteps the much better-known "Rubik's Cube" identifier.

<p>The FBI is urging victims of one of the most prolific ransomware groups to come forward after agents recovered thousands of decryption keys that may allow the recovery of data that has remained inaccessible for months or years.</p>
<p>The revelation, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/fbi-cyber-assistant-director-bryan-vorndran-s-remarks-at-the-2024-boston-conference-on-cyber-security">made Wednesday</a> by a top FBI official, comes three months after an international roster of law enforcement agencies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/02/after-years-of-losing-its-finally-feds-turn-to-troll-ransomware-group/">seized servers</a> and other infrastructure used by LockBit, a ransomware syndicate that authorities say has extorted more than $1 billion from 7,000 victims around the world. Authorities said at the time that they took control of 1,000 decryption keys, 4,000 accounts, and 34 servers and froze 200 cryptocurrency accounts associated with the operation.</p>
<p>At a speech before a cybersecurity conference in Boston, FBI Cyber Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/fbi-cyber-assistant-director-bryan-vorndran-s-remarks-at-the-2024-boston-conference-on-cyber-security">said Wednesday</a> that agents have also recovered an asset that will be of intense interest to thousands of LockBit victims—the decryption keys that could allow them to unlock data that’s been held for ransom by LockBit associates.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029593#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029593&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>June 2023 did not seem like an exceptional month at the time. It was the warmest June in the instrumental temperature record, but monthly records haven't exactly been unusual in a period where the top 10 warmest years on record have all occurred within the last 15 years. And monthly records have often occurred in years that are otherwise unexceptional; at the time, the warmest July on record had occurred in 2019, a year that doesn't stand out much from the rest of the past decade.</p>
<p>But July 2023 set another monthly record, easily eclipsing 2019's high temperatures. Then August set yet another monthly record. And so has every single month since, a string of records that propelled 2023 to the warmest year since we started keeping track.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the European Union's Copernicus Earth-monitoring service <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/hottest-may-record-spurs-call-climate-action?utm_source=socialmedia&amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;utm_id=news-call-climate-action-0624">announced</a> that we've now gone a full year where every single month has been the warmest version of that month since we've had enough instruments in place to track global temperatures.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029541#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029541&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission reportedly plan investigations into whether Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI are snuffing out competition in artificial intelligence technology.</p>
<p>The agencies struck a deal on how to divide up the investigations, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/technology/nvidia-microsoft-openai-antitrust-doj-ftc.html">reported</a> yesterday. Under this deal, the Justice Department will take the lead role in investigating Nvidia's behavior while the FTC will take the lead in investigating Microsoft and OpenAI.</p>
<p>The agencies' agreement "allows them to proceed with antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia play in the artificial intelligence industry, in the strongest sign of how regulatory scrutiny into the powerful technology has escalated," the NYT wrote.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029532#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029532&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Humane AI Pin has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-a-700-voice-command-box-definitely-wont-replace-your-phone/">launched,</a> crashed, and burned, with founders already <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/humane-ai-pin-founders-run-for-the-exits-one-month-after-launch/">looking to sell</a> the company just one month after launch. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/humane-ai-pin.html">New York Times</a> has an article detailing exactly how the company got to the point of launching a dead-on-arrival product and provided a few updates on the sales of the product and the company.</p>
<p>Humane, if you haven't heard, is a company founded by two former Apple employees, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, in 2018. The company raised $230 million from some big-name investors like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and, before launch, was valued at $1 billion. The product, the AI Pin, is sort of trying to be a Star Trek communicator. You magnetically clip it onto your shirt and can tap it for voice commands. It has "no apps" (the founders bragged about this feature) and is mostly just a voice assistant box with a touch panel, battery, camera, and speaker/microphone. There's no traditional screen, but a laser projector can shoot a smartwatch-like UI onto your hand that you control with gestures.</p>
<p>The going rate for one of these things is $700, plus a $24 a month subscription, a hard sell in the face of a $400 Apple Watch. It also doesn't really work and was universally panned in reviews, with conclusions ranging from The Verge's "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review">not even close</a>" to Marques Brownlee's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA">the worst product I've ever reviewed</a>." Apparently, the voice commands are very slow, the battery life is an awful two to four hours, it's heavy and drags down your shirt, and the projector doesn't work well in many lighting conditions. It's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172377/humane-ai-pin-battery-case-issue-warning">also reportedly a fire hazard</a>, with Humane emailing customers this week and telling them to "immediately stop using and charging" the battery case because some units with defective batteries "may pose a fire safety risk."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029442#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029442&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC, kicks off in Cupertino, California, next week. As always, it will start with a livestream keynote on Monday morning at 10 am Pacific, 1 pm Eastern. We'll be in attendance reporting on the event, so let's take a moment to take stock of what we expect to see next week.</p>
<p>But first, let's note something we <em>don't</em> think we'll see: Due to some peculiarities about Apple's upgrade cycles, as well as a push toward the M4, we're not actually expecting any major hardware announcements at WWDC this year.</p>
<p>That's OK, though, because it looks like it's going to be a big one for software news. iOS has seen relatively modest updates in the past couple of years, but that's about to change.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029509#p3">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029509&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Earlier today, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile laid out the direction for Formula 1's next set of technical regulations, which will go into effect in 2026. It will be the second big shakeup of F1's technical regs since 2022 and involves sweeping changes to the hybrid powertrain and a fundamental rethink of how some of the aerodynamics work.</p>
<p>"With this set of regulations, the FIA has sought to develop a new generation of cars that are fully in touch with the DNA of Formula 1—cars that are light, supremely fast and agile but which also remains at the cutting edge of technology, and to achieve this we worked towards what we called a 'nimble car' concept. At the center of that vision is a redesigned power unit that features a more even split between the power derived from the internal combustion element and electrical power," said Nikolas Tombazis, the FIA's single-seater technical director.</p>
<h2>Didn’t we just get new rules?</h2>
<p>It feels like F1 only just got through its last big rule change with the (re)introduction of ground-effect cars at the start of 2022. Since the early 1980s, F1 cars have generated aerodynamic grip, or downforce, via front and rear wings. But drivers found it increasingly difficult to follow each other closely through corners as the dirty air from the car in front starved the following car's front wing of air, robbing it of cornering grip in the process.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029513#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029513&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            The new PS5 packaging, as seen on the PlayStation Direct online store, is missing the "8K" label in the corner.                          [credit:
                              <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240220195209/https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>
                            ]
                      </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>

<p>When we first received our PlayStation 5 review unit from Sony in 2020, we reacted with some bemusement to the "8K" logo on the box and its implied promise of full 7630×4320 resolution output. We then promptly forgot all about it since native 8K content <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294400/8k-tv-shipments-worldwide/">and 8K compatible TVs</a> have remained a relative curiosity thus far in the PS5's lifespan.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, Digital Foundry's John Linneman discovered that Sony has quietly removed that longstanding 8K label from the PS5 box. The ultra-high-resolution promise no longer appears on <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">the packaging shown on Sony's official PlayStation Direct store</a>, a change that appears to have happened between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240121065345/https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">late January</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240220195209/https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">mid-February</a>, according to Internet Archive captures of the store page (the old "8K" box can still be seen at <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/playstation-5/consoles/products/sony-playstation-5-console/11108140.html">other online retailers</a>, though).</p>
<h2>A promise deferred</h2>
<p>This packaging change has been a long time coming since the PS5 hasn't technically been living up to its 8K promise for years now. While Sony's Mark Cerny mentioned the then-upcoming hardware's 8K support <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">in a 2019 interview</a>, the system eventually launched with a pretty big "coming soon" caveat for that feature. "PS5 is compatible with 8K displays at launch, and after a future system software update will be able to output resolutions up to 8K when content is available, with supported software," the company <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/">said in an FAQ</a> surrounding the console's 2020 launch.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029499#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029499&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has taken a rare step and publicly committed to a software support timeline for one of its products, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-iphone-security-updates-five-year-minimum/">as pointed out by MacRumors</a>. A public regulatory filing for the iPhone 15 Pro (<a href="https://regulatoryinfo.apple.com/cwt/api/ext/file?fileId=securityTelecommunication%2FiPhone%2015%20Pro%20Max%20%28Model%20A3106%29_V0.pdf">PDF</a>) confirms that Apple will support the device with new software updates for at least five years from its "first supply date" of September 22, 2023, which would guarantee support until at least 2028.</p>
<p>Apple published the filing to comply with new Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (PSTI) regulations from the UK that went into effect in late April. As <a href="https://www.centerforcybersecuritypolicy.org/insights-and-research/the-uk-psti-act-comes-into-effect">this plain-language explainer</a> from the Center for Cybersecurity Policy and Law summarizes, the PSTI regulations (among other things) don't mandate a specific support window for manufacturers of Internet-connected devices, but they do require companies to publish a concrete support window and contact information for someone at the company who can be contacted with bug reports.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-software-support-commitment-3449135/">publications like Android Authority</a> have pointed out, five years is less than some Android phone makers like Google and Samsung have publicly committed to; both companies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/the-google-pixel-8-is-official-with-7-years-of-updates/">have said</a> they'll support their latest devices <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-four-year-update-list-android/">for seven years</a>. But in reality, Apple usually hits or exceeds this seven-year timeline for updates—and does so for iPhones released nearly a decade ago and not just its newest products.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029397#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029397&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, DuckDuckGo unveiled a new "<a href="https://www.spreadprivacy.com/ai-chat/">AI Chat</a>" service that allows users to converse with four mid-range large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Mistral in an interface similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today">ChatGPT</a> while attempting to preserve privacy and anonymity. While the AI models involved can output inaccurate information readily, the site allows users to test different mid-range LLMs without having to install anything or sign up for an account.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo's AI Chat currently features access to OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/chatgpt-and-whisper-apis-debut-allowing-devs-to-integrate-them-into-apps/">GPT-3.5 Turbo</a>, Anthropic's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">Claude 3 Haiku</a>, and two open source models, Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/meta-releases-chatgpt-like-ai-site-and-open-weights-llama-3-model/">Llama 3</a> and Mistral's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/new-french-ai-model-makes-waves-by-matching-gpt-3-5-on-benchmarks/">Mixtral 8x7B</a>. The service is currently free to use within daily limits. Users can access AI Chat through the DuckDuckGo search engine, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=DuckDuckGo&amp;ia=chat">direct links to the site</a>, or by using "!ai" or "!chat" shortcuts in the search field. AI Chat can also be disabled in the site's settings for users with accounts.</p>
<p>According to DuckDuckGo, chats on the service are anonymized, with metadata and IP address removed to prevent tracing back to individuals. The company states that chats are not used for AI model training, citing its privacy policy and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/aichat/privacy-terms?ref=spreadprivacy.com">terms of use</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029426#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029426&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Rivian provided flights from Los Angeles to Seattle and accommodation so Ars could drive the new R1S and R1T. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>In rainy Seattle this week, Rivian unveiled what it's calling the "Second Generation" of its R1 line with a suite of mostly under-the-hood software and hardware updates that increase range, power, and efficiency while simultaneously lowering the cost of production for the company. While it's common for automotive manufacturers to do some light refreshes after about four model years, Rivian has almost completely retooled the underpinnings of its popular R1S SUV and R1T pickup just two years <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/rivians-67-500-314-mile-electric-adventure-truck-put-to-the-test/">after the vehicles made their debut</a>.</p>
<p>"Overdelivering on the product is one of our core values," Wassym Bensaid, the chief software officer at Rivian, told a select group of journalists at the event on Monday night, "and customer feedback has been one of the key inspirations for us."</p>
<p>For these updates, Rivian changed more than half the hardware components in the R1 platform, retooled its drive units to offer new tri- and quad-motor options (with more horsepower), updated the suspension tuning, deleted 1.6 miles (2.6 km) of wiring, reduced the number of ECUs, increased the number of cameras and sensors around the vehicle, changed the battery packs, and added some visual options that better aligned with customizations that owners were making to their vehicles, among other things. Rivian is also leaning harder into AI and ML tools with the aim of bringing limited hands-free driver-assistance systems to their owners toward the end of the year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029400#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029400&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>We’ve been living through the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-generative-ai-revolution-has-begun-how-did-we-get-here/">generative AI boom</a> for nearly a year and a half now, following the late 2022 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But despite transformative effects on companies’ share prices, generative AI tools powered by large language models (LLMs) still have major drawbacks that have kept them from being as useful as many would like them to be. Retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, aims to fix some of those drawbacks.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most prominent drawback of LLMs is their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">tendency toward confabulation</a> (also called “hallucination”), which is a statistical gap-filling phenomenon AI language models produce when they are tasked with reproducing knowledge that wasn’t present in the training data. They generate plausible-sounding text that can veer toward accuracy when the training data is solid but otherwise may just be completely made up.</p>
<p>Relying on confabulating AI models gets people and companies in trouble, as we’ve covered in the past. In 2023, we saw <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/michael-cohens-lawyer-cited-three-fake-cases-in-possible-ai-fueled-screwup/">two instances</a> of lawyers citing legal cases, confabulated by AI, that didn’t exist. We’ve covered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/will-chatgpts-hallucinations-be-allowed-to-ruin-your-life/">claims against OpenAI</a> in which ChatGPT confabulated and accused innocent people of doing terrible things. In February, we wrote about Air Canada’s customer service chatbot <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/">inventing a refund policy</a>, and in March, a New York City chatbot was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/nycs-government-chatbot-is-lying-about-city-laws-and-regulations/">caught confabulating</a> city regulations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028618#p3">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028618&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>After years of delays, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft finally rocketed into orbit from Florida on Wednesday, sending two veteran NASA astronauts on a long-delayed shakedown cruise to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The Starliner capsule lifted off at 10:52 am EDT (14:52 UTC) on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Fifteen minutes later, after shedding two strap-on boosters and a core stage powered by a Russian RD-180 engine, the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage released Starliner right on target to begin a nearly 26-hour pursuit of the space station. Docking at the space station is set for 12:15 pm EDT (16:15 UTC) Thursday, where NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will spend at least a week before coming back to Earth.</p>
<p>In remarks shortly after Wednesday's launch, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wilmore and Williams, both former US Navy pilots, will "test this thing from izzard to gizzard" to ensure Boeing's Starliner is ready for operational six-month crew rotation missions to the ISS.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029190#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029190&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has bluntly stated the truth: "<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html">Vaccines do not cause autism</a>," the agency affirms on its website. Yet, nearly a quarter of Americans still don't believe it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/false-belief-in-mmr-vaccine-autism-link-endures-as-measles-threat-persists/">an April 2024 survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center</a> (APPC) of the University of Pennsylvania, 24 percent of US adults denied or disputed that the CDC ever said that. Specifically, the survey asked them to assess the accuracy of the statement that the CDC has said there is no evidence linking vaccines to autism. Six percent called the statement "very inaccurate," and 18 percent said it was "somewhat inaccurate." An additional 3 percent responded that they were "not sure." Of the remaining 73 percent, only 41 percent considered it "very accurate," and 32 percent said it was "somewhat accurate."</p>
<p>The results are largely unchanged from responses in 2018 when survey respondents were asked the same question. In that year, 26 percent of adults reported that the statement was "very inaccurate" or "somewhat inaccurate."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029345#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029345&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
