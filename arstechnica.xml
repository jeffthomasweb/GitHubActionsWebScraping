<p>Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was indicted in France today and ordered to post bail of 5 million euros. The multi-billionaire was forbidden from leaving the country and must report to police twice a week while the case continues.</p>
<p>Charges were detailed in a statement issued today by Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau, which was <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-28-CP-TELEGRAM-mise-en-examen.pdf">provided to Ars</a>. They are nearly identical to the possible charges <a href="https://www.tribunal-de-paris.justice.fr/sites/default/files/2024-08/2024-08-26%20-%20CP%20TELEGRAM%20.pdf">released by Beccuau on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>The first charge listed is complicity in "web-mastering an online platform in order to enable an illegal transaction in organized group." Today's press release said this charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a 500,000-euro fine.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046072#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046072&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malicious hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in a widely used security camera to spread Mirai, a family of malware that wrangles infected Internet of Things devices into large networks for use in attacks that take down websites and other Internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>The attacks target the AVM1203, a surveillance device from Taiwan-based manufacturer AVTECH, network security provider Akamai <a href="https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/2024-corona-mirai-botnet-infects-zero-day-sirt">said Wednesday</a>. Unknown attackers have been exploiting a 5-year-old vulnerability since March. The zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-7029, is easy to exploit and allows attackers to execute malicious code. The AVM1203 is no longer sold or supported, so no update is available to fix the critical zero-day.</p>
<h2>That time a ragtag army shook the Internet</h2>
<p>Akamai said that the attackers are exploiting the vulnerability so they can install a variant of Mirai, which arrived in September 2016 when a botnet of infected devices <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/why-the-silencing-of-krebsonsecurity-opens-a-troubling-chapter-for-the-net/">took down</a> cybersecurity news site Krebs on Security. Mirai contained functionality that allowed a ragtag army of compromised webcams, routers, and other types of IoT devices to wage distributed denial-of-service attacks of record-setting sizes. In the weeks that followed, the Mirai botnet delivered similar attacks on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/botnet-of-145k-cameras-reportedly-deliver-internets-biggest-ddos-ever/">Internet service providers</a> and other targets. One such attack, against dynamic domain name provider Dyn <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/double-dip-internet-of-things-botnet-attack-felt-across-the-internet/">paralyzed</a> vast swaths of the Internet.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046043#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046043&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Five more people have died in a nationwide outbreak of <em>Listeria </em>infections linked to contaminated Boar's Head brand meats, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24.html#cdc_outbreak_main_guide-what-you-should-do">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>To date, 57 people across 18 states have been sickened, all of whom required hospitalization. A total of eight have died. The latest tally makes this the largest listeriosis outbreak in the US since 2011, when cantaloupe processed in an unsanitary facility led to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1215837">147 <em>Listeria</em> infections</a> in 28 states, causing 33 deaths, the CDC notes.</p>
<p>The new cases and deaths come after a massive recall of more than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/">7 million pounds of Boar's Head meat products</a>, which encompassed 71 of the company's products. That recall was <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/boars-head-provisions-co--expands-recall-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due">announced on July 30</a>, which itself was an expansion of a July 26 recall of an additional 207,528 pounds of Boar's Head products. By August 8, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/another-death-in-nationwide-outbreak-that-spurred-massive-meat-recall/">the CDC last provided an update</a> on the outbreak, the number of cases had hit 43, with 43 hospitalizations and three deaths.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046040#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046040&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google's Gemini AI model is once again able to generate images of humans after that function was "paused" in February following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/googles-hidden-ai-diversity-prompts-lead-to-outcry-over-historically-inaccurate-images/">outcry over historically inaccurate racial depictions</a> in many results.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-update-august-2024/">a blog post</a>, Google said that its Imagen 3 model—which was first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/google-strikes-back-at-openai-with-project-astra-ai-agent-prototype/">announced</a> in May—will "start to roll out the generation of images of people" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users in the "coming days." But a version of that Imagen model—complete with human image-generation capabilities—was recently made available to the public <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/imagen-3/">via the Gemini Labs test environment</a> without a paid subscription (though a Google account is needed to log in).</p>
<p>That new model comes with some safeguards to try to avoid the creation of controversial images, of course. Google writes in its announcement that it doesn't support "the generation of photorealistic, identifiable individuals, depictions of minors or excessively gory, violent or sexual scenes." In <a href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/posts/faq">an FAQ</a>, Google clarifies that the prohibition on "identifiable individuals" includes "certain queries that could lead to outputs of prominent people." In Ars' testing, that meant a query like "President Biden playing basketball" would be refused, while a more generic request for "a US president playing basketball" would generate multiple options.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045999#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045999&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Midjourney, a company best known for its robust AI image-generation tool, has publicly announced that it's "getting into hardware" and has invited job-seekers to apply to join its new hardware division.</p>

<p>Midjourney founder David Holz previously worked at a hardware company; he was CTO of Leap Motion. A few months ago, he hired Ahmad Abbas,  whom he worked with at Leap Motion. Abbas also worked at Apple for five years as a hardware manager working on the Vision Pro headset.

<p>An appeals court has revived a lawsuit against TikTok by reversing a lower court's ruling that Section 230 immunity shielded the short video app from liability <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/section-230-shields-tiktok-in-childs-blackout-challenge-death-lawsuit/">after a child died taking part in a dangerous "Blackout Challenge</a>."</p>

<p>Because TikTok promoted the challenge in children's feeds, Tawainna Anderson counted among mourning parents who attempted to sue TikTok in 2022. Ultimately, she was told that TikTok was not responsible for recommending the video that caused the death of her daughter Nylah.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045993#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045993&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Too often, new tech product or service launches seem like solutions in search of a problem, but not this one: ESPN is launching software that lets you figure out just where you can watch the specific game you want to see amid an overcomplicated web of streaming services, cable channels, and arcane licensing agreements. Every sports fan is all too familiar with today's convoluted streaming schedules.</p>
<p>Launching today on ESPN.com and the various ESPN mobile and streaming device apps, the new guide offers various views, including one that lists all the sporting events in a single day and a search function, among other things.

<p>Imagine receiving a traffic ticket in the mail because you were speeding down a Russian road in Kursk with a Ukrainian attack drone on your tail. That's the reality facing some Russians living near the front lines after Ukraine's surprise seizure of Russian territory in Kursk Oblast. And they're complaining about it on Telegram.</p>
<p>Rob Lee, a well-known analyst of the Ukraine/Russia war, <a href="https://x.com/RALee85/status/1828248321678290949">comments on X</a> that "traffic cameras are still operating in Kursk, and people are receiving speeding fines when trying to outrun FPVs [first-person-view attack drones]. Some have resorted to covering their license plates but the traffic police force them to remove them."</p>

<p>Pretty much every day for the last couple of weeks, workers wielding welding guns and torches have climbed onto SpaceX's Starship launch pad in South Texas to make last-minute upgrades ahead of the next test flight of the world's largest rocket.</p>
<p>Livestreams of the launch site provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LabPadre/featured">LabPadre</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUu1lih2RifWkKtDOJdsBA">NASASpaceflight.com</a> have shown sparks raining down two mechanical arms extending from the side of the Starship launch tower at SpaceX's Starbase launch site on the Gulf Coast east of Brownsville, Texas. We are publishing several views here of the welding activity with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS2PHJmvJzo">permission of LabPadre</a>, which runs a YouTube page with multiple live views of Starbase.</p>
<p>If SpaceX has its way on the next flight of Starship, these arms will close together to capture the first-stage booster, called Super Heavy, as it descends back to Earth and slows to a hover over the launch pad.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044794#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044794&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has donated the Mono Project, an open-source framework that brought its .NET platform to non-Windows systems, to the Wine community. WineHQ will be <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine-mono/mono">the steward of the Mono Project upstream code</a>, while Microsoft will encourage Mono-based apps to migrate to its open source .NET framework.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Microsoft notes on the Mono Project homepage</a>, the last major release of Mono was in July 2019. Mono was "a trailblazer for the .NET platform across many operating systems" and was the first implementation of .NET on Android, iOS, Linux, and other operating systems.</p>
<h2>Ximian, Novell, SUSE, Xamarin, Microsoft—now Wine</h2>
<p>Mono began as a project of Miguel de Icaza, co-creator of the GNOME desktop. De Icaza led Ximian (originally Helix Code), aiming to bring Microsoft's then-new .NET platform to Unix-like platforms. Ximian was acquired by Novell in 2003.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045805#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045805&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, researchers from Google and Tel Aviv University unveiled <a href="https://gamengen.github.io/">GameNGen</a>, a new AI model that can interactively simulate the classic 1993 first-person shooter game <em>Doom</em> in real time using AI image generation techniques borrowed from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a>. It's a neural network system that can function as a limited game engine, potentially opening new possibilities for real-time video game synthesis in the future.</p>
<p>For example, instead of drawing graphical video frames using traditional techniques, future games could potentially use an AI engine to "imagine" or hallucinate graphics in real time as a prediction task.</p>

<p>An Australian man who pretended to be a famous teenage YouTuber has been sentenced to 17 years for orchestrating what police are calling "one of the worst sextortion cases in history."</p>
<p>Twenty-nine-year-old Muhammad Zain Ul Abideen Rasheed blackmailed hundreds of victims across 20 countries, ultimately pleading guilty to 119 charges involving 286 people. Most victims were children, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a <a href="https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/wa-man-jailed-sextortion-286-victims">press release</a> confirming that Rasheed targeted at least 180 kids under 16.</p>
<p>AFP coordinated with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and INTERPOL to catch Rasheed before more victims could be harmed. Their investigation started in 2019 when cops in Leon County, Florida, were tipped off to a sextortion scammer "masquerading as a YouTuber," an ICE <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/hsi-australian-federal-police-identify-245-victims-child-exploitation-predator-posing">press release</a> said. He was first charged in 2020 and was then hit with more charges in 2021.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045876#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045876&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple will cut 100 jobs, all in its digital services teams. Laid off employees will have 60 days to find another job in the company before it cuts ties with them altogether, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>
<p>Compared to some other big tech companies, layoffs are relatively uncommon at Apple. This is the fourth wave this year, but cuts so far (including this one) have been laser-focused and small in scope—a contrast with companies like Intel, Cisco, or Microsoft, which have recently made more drastic cuts of anywhere from 7 to 15 percent of their workforces.</p>
<p>The current set of cuts chiefly affects the Books team. Digital services like this have been a big part of Apple's financial success in recent quarters; in just the past year, services revenue is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/apple-reports-record-revenues-despite-stagnant-iphone-sales/">up 14 percent</a>. However, Books has no subscription offering, and Apple was subject to a US Department of Justice <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/apple-calls-e-book-price-fixing-case-bizarre-says-doj-is-being-unfair/">price-fixing lawsuit</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045830#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045830&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Autonomous driving capabilities are a central component of Tesla's stratospheric share price, with CEO Elon Musk repeatedly telling investors that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/teslas-full-self-driving-sees-pedestrian-chooses-not-to-slow-down/">they're the difference between</a> "being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero." But real-world performance on the road lags far behind Musk's claims, with the latest data point coming from another Musk venture, the Boring Company, and its tunnels under Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The Boring Company might be Elon Musk's strangest side hustle. Whether it was sparked by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/elon-musk-hates-sitting-in-traffic-so-now-hes-going-to-build-tunnels/">desire to avoid traffic</a> commuting to SpaceX or part of an insidious plan to undermine rail projects, the results for the sewer-sized tunnels have been about what you'd expect: Proposed tunnels <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/elon-musks-boring-company-is-digging-a-10-mile-tunnel-in-maryland/">between Washington DC and Baltimore</a>, underneath <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/elon-musk-talks-proof-of-concept-tunnel-parallel-to-the-405-in-los-angeles/">I-405 in Los Angeles</a>, and from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/chicago-selects-elon-musks-boring-company-to-build-express-line-from-ohare/">Chicago to its major airport</a> remain literal pipe dreams.</p>
<p>So far, there's just a 2.2-mile loop with three stations serving the Las Vegas Convention Center, albeit with the potential to expand the subterranean system to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/musks-boring-company-gets-ok-to-dig-68-miles-of-tunnels-under-las-vegas/">68 miles (110 km) in total</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045900#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045900&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Telegram CEO Pavel Durov is heading to court for a possible indictment after being released from police custody, authorities in France said on Wednesday. "An investigating judge has ended Pavel Durov's police custody and will have him brought to court for a first appearance and a possible indictment," according to a statement from the Paris prosecutor's office that was quoted in an <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/08/28/business/telegram-ceo-freed-french-custody/">Associated Press article</a>.</p>
<p>Durov was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/08/shocker-french-make-surprise-arrest-of-telegram-founder-at-paris-airport/">arrested in Paris on Saturday</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-awaits-charges-in-france-as-firm-denies-law-breaking/">questioned by police</a> for several days. The French investigative judge will "decide whether to place him under formal investigation following his arrest as part of a probe into organized crime on the messaging app," Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-judges-decide-next-step-durov-probe-2024-08-28/">wrote today</a>.</p>
<p>"Being placed under formal investigation in France does not imply guilt or necessarily lead to trial, but indicates that judges consider there is enough to the case to proceed with the probe. Investigations can last years before being sent to trial or shelved," Reuters wrote. The judge's decision on a formal investigation is expected today, the article said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045841#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045841&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The low-volume British carmaker Ariel got its start with a reimagining of the iconic Lotus Seven, gaining something of a reputation for building the car that filled Jeremy Clarkson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaWoo82zNUA">epiglottis full of bees</a> on <em>Top Gear</em>, back when that was the most-torrented TV show on the Internet. Then it expanded its lineup with the Nomad, which added off-road ground ability to the mix, creating a car that starred on <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/12/the-grand-tour-season-2-the-one-where-hammond-nearly-dies-again/">The Grand Tour</a></em> as well as in the last few iterations of <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/forza-horizon-4-is-the-best-open-world-driving-game-you-can-buy/">Forza Horizon</a></em>. Today, Ariel unveiled its idea for an all-electric take on that go-anywhere car with the E-Nomad.</p>
<p>Ariel says the E-Nomad can match the more than respectable acceleration of its gas-powered car, which means 0–60 mph (98 km/h) in 3.4 seconds despite wearing nobbly all-terrain tires. But rapidly accelerating electric vehicles aren't anything special. What does stand out is the E-Nomad's relative lack of mass—it tips the scales at just 1,975 lbs (896 kg), less than half as much as most of the EVs on sale today.</p>
<p>The E-Nomad's 41 kWh battery pack lives behind the cabin, replacing the internal combustion engine and fuel tank you'd find on the regular car. Ariel sourced it from Rockfort Engineering and says the pouch cells offer "best-in-class energy density." In total, the battery pack weighs less than 660 lbs (300 kg) and can send up to 281 hp (210 kW) to the drive unit at the rear. The drive has a peak torque output of 361 lb-ft (490 Nm) and is optimized for mass, weighing 202 lbs (92 kg).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045832#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045832&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As far back as 2016, work on AI-based chatbots revealed that they have a disturbing tendency to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/microsoft-terminates-its-tay-ai-chatbot-after-she-turns-into-a-nazi/">reflect some of the worst biases</a> of the society that trained them. But as large language models have become ever larger and subjected to more sophisticated training, a lot of that problematic behavior has been ironed out. For example, I asked the current iteration of ChatGPT for five words it associated with African Americans, and it responded with things like "resilience" and "creativity."</p>
<p>But a lot of research has turned up examples where implicit biases can persist in people long after outward behavior has changed. So some researchers decided to test whether the same might be true of LLMs. And was it ever.</p>
<p>By interacting with a series of LLMs using examples of the African American English sociolect, they found that the AI's had an extremely negative view of its speakers—something that wasn't true of speakers of another American English variant. And that bias bled over into decisions the LLMs were asked to make about those who use African American English.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045652#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045652&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02112021/global-methane-pledge-cop26/"> 2021 pledge</a> by more than 100 nations to cut methane emissions from anthropogenic sources 30 percent by 2030 might not slow global warming as much as projected, as new research shows that feedbacks in the climate system are boosting methane emissions from natural sources, especially tropical wetlands.</p>
<p>A new trouble spot is in the Arctic, where scientists recently found unexpectedly large methane emissions in winter. And globally, the increase in water vapor caused by global warming is slowing the rate at which methane breaks down in the atmosphere. If those feedbacks intensify, scientists said, it could outpace efforts to cut methane from fossil fuel and other human sources.</p>
<p>Methane traps about 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, and <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/methane/?intent=121#:~:text=(Learn%20more%20about%20the%20Global,(which%20began%20in%201750).">scientists estimate</a> it’s responsible for 20 to 30 percent of climate warming since the start of the industrial age, when atmospheric methane was at a concentration of about 0.7 parts per million. It has <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends_ch4/">zig-zagged upward</a> since then, spiking with the first fossil gas boom in the 1980s, then leveling off slightly before a huge surge started in the early 2000s. The amount of methane in the atmosphere reached about 1.9 ppm in 2023, nearly three times the pre-industrial level.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045807#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045807&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Seven months after its first lunar lander fell short of reaching the Moon, Astrobotic announced Tuesday that the spacecraft was stricken by a valve failure that caused a propellant tank to burst in orbit. The company's next landing attempt, using a much larger spacecraft, will include fixes to prevent a similar failure.</p>
<p>Astrobotic's first Peregrine lander, which the company called Peregrine Mission One, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/americas-first-lunar-lander-in-a-half-century-wont-reach-the-moon/">launched on January 8 aboard United Launch Alliance's first Vulcan rocket</a>. But soon after separating from the rocket in space, the lander ran into trouble as it stepped through an activation sequence to begin priming its propulsion system.</p>
<p>A review board determined "the most likely cause of the malfunction was a failure of a single helium pressure control valve called a PCV—pressure control valve 2, within the propulsion system," said John Horack, a space industry veteran and professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at Ohio State University.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045535#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045535&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Early on Wednesday morning, at 3:48 am ET local time, a Falcon 9 rocket booster making its 23rd launch took off from Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p>
<p>The mission successfully delivered 21 Starlink satellites, including 13 of the larger vehicles with direct-to-cell capabilities, before attempting a landing on the <em>A Shortfall of Gravitas</em>. However, the experienced booster had a shortfall of stability and tipped over shortly following touchdown.</p>
<p>Prior to Wednesday's landing failure, SpaceX had landed 267 boosters in a row. The company's last failure occurred in February 2021. The cause of the failure was not immediately clear, and SpaceX said "teams are assessing the booster's flight data and status." <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=sl-8-6">Based on video of the landing</a>, it is possible there was an engine burn timing issue.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045775#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045775&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
