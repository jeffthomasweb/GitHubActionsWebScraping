      Narrator Ryan Reynolds celebrates nature's outcasts in the new NatGeo docuseries <em>Underdogs</em>.

          </div>

<p>Most of us have seen a nature documentary or two (or three) at some point in our lives, so it's a familiar format: sweeping majestic footage of impressively regal animals accompanied by reverently high-toned narration (preferably with a tony British accent). <em>Underdogs</em>, a new docuseries from National Geographic, takes a decidedly different and unconventional approach. Narrated by with hilarious irreverence by Ryan Reynolds, the five-part series highlights nature's less cool and majestic creatures: the outcasts and benchwarmers, more noteworthy for their "unconventional hygiene choices" and "unsavory courtship rituals." It's like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/review-james-gunns-the-suicide-squad-is-like-the-boys-on-steroids/"><em>The Suicide Squad</em></a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/review-thunderbolts-is-a-refreshing-return-to-peak-marvel-form/"><em>Thunderbolts*</em></a>, except these creatures actually exist.</p>
<p>Per the official premise, "<em>Underdogs</em> features a range of never-before-filmed scenes, including the first time a film crew has ever entered a special cave in New Zealand—a huge cavern that glows brighter than a bachelor pad under a black light thanks to the glowing butts of millions of mucus-coated grubs. All over the world, overlooked superstars like this are out there 24/7, giving it maximum effort and keeping the natural world in working order for all those showboating polar bears, sharks and gorillas." It's rated PG-13 thanks to the odd bit of scatalogical humor and shots of Nature Sexy Time</p>
<p>Each of the five episodes is built around a specific genre. "Superheroes" highlights the surprising superpowers of the honey badger, pistol shrimp, and the invisible glass frog, among others, augmented with comic book graphics; "Sexy Beasts" focuses on bizarre mating habits and follows the format of a romantic advice column; "Terrible Parents" highlights nature's worst practices, following the outline of a parenting guide; "Total Grossout" is exactly what it sounds like; and "The Unusual Suspects" is a heist tale, documenting the supposed efforts of a macaque to put together the ultimate team of masters of deception and disguise (an inside man, a decoy, a fall guy, etc.).  Green Day even wrote and recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6GHGvLFBKg">a special theme song</a> for the opening credits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/delightfully-irreverent-underdogs-isnt-your-parents-nature-docuseries/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Aviation Administration may soon levy fees on companies seeking launch and reentry licenses, a new tack in the push to give the agency the resources it needs to keep up with the rapidly growing commercial space industry.</p>
<p>The text of a budget <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/AD3D04CF-52B4-411F-854B-44C55ABBADDA">reconciliation bill</a> released by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last week calls for the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, known as AST, to begin charging licensing fees to space companies next year. The fees would phase in over eight years, after which the FAA would adjust them to keep pace with inflation. The money would go into a trust fund to help pay for the operating costs of the FAA's commercial space office.</p>
<p>The bill released by Cruz's office last week covers federal agencies under the oversight of the Senate Commerce Committee, which he chairs. These agencies include the FAA and NASA. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/senate-response-to-white-house-budget-for-nasa-keep-sls-nix-science/">Ars recently covered</a> Cruz's proposals for NASA to keep the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Gateway lunar space station alive, while the Trump administration aims to cancel Gateway and end the SLS and Orion programs after two crew missions to the Moon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/companies-may-soon-pay-a-fee-for-their-rockets-to-share-the-skies-with-airplanes/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The American Midwest is home to some of the richest, most productive farmland in the world, enabling its transformation into a vast corn- and soy-producing machine—a conversion spurred largely by decades-long policies that support the production of biofuels.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.wri.org/research/rethinking-biofuels-us-midwest">new report</a> takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/biofuels-policy-has-been-a-failure-for-the-climate-new-report-claims/">Read full article</a></p>

People who enjoy watching baby animals probed, snipped, and mutilated in horrible ways often have difficulty finding local collaborators, but online communities like "million tears"—now thankfully shuttered—can help them forge connections.</p>
<p>Once they do meet other like-minded souls, communication takes place through chat apps like Telegram and Signal, often using encryption.</p>
<p>Money is pooled through various phone apps, then sent to videographers in countries where wages are low and monkeys are plentiful. (The cases I have seen usually involve Indonesia; read <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/thanks-internet-its-now-shockingly-easy-to-become-an-international-monkey-torturer/">my feature from last year</a> to learn more about how these groups work.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/despite-arrests-online-monkey-torture-rings-keep-on-torturing/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Arid coastal regions that are also prone to fog are prime locations for fog-harvesting devices as a water source, especially during prolonged droughts. But the standard technology is prone to clogging. Scientists at Virginia Tech have created an improved version of their earlier "fog harp" alternative design to address that issue, according to a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/ta/d5ta02686e">new paper</a> published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.</p>
<p>Fog harvesting (or dew catching) is an ancient practice dating as far back as the Incas, who placed buckets under trees to collect condensation. It's also practiced by certain insects, notably Namib desert beetles, which survive on the water that condenses onto their wings. The wings have alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions to enhance the condensation. Today's fog harvesters are usually mesh nets mounted onto frames with a trough or basin underneath. Like the beetle's wings, the mesh filaments are chemically coated to be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic.</p>
<p>The efficiency of these water harvesters depends on decreasing the size of the filaments and the mesh holes. "If the holes were too big, the microscopic droplets would pass through it, and it wouldn't harvest much water," co-author James Kaindu, a student in researcher Jonathan Boreyko's lab at Virginia Tech, told Ars. The trade-off is that smaller filaments and holes are more prone to clogging. "If it was too small, the droplets would coalesce and create a water film on it," said Kaindu. "It would impede the flow and act as a barrier that would dramatically affect its capture efficiency."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/these-va-tech-scientists-are-building-a-better-fog-harp/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NotebookLM is undoubtedly one of Google's best implementations of generative AI technology, giving you the ability to explore documents and notes with a Gemini AI model. Last year, Google added the ability to generate so-called "audio overviews" of your source material in NotebookLM. Now, Google has brought those <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/">fake AI podcasts</a> to search results as a test. Instead of clicking links or reading the AI Overview, you can have two nonexistent people <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/audio-overviews-search-labs/">tell you what the results say</a>.</p>
<p>This feature is not currently rolling out widely—it's available in search labs, which means you have to <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/30">manually enable it</a>. Anyone can opt in to the new Audio Overview search experience, though. If you join the test, you'll quickly see the embedded player in Google search results. However, it's not at the top with the usual block of AI-generated text. Instead, you'll see it after the first few search results, below the "People also ask" knowledge graph section.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission is reportedly pitching a merger condition that would forbid advertising agencies from boycotting platforms based on political content, in a move that could benefit Elon Musk's X social network and President Trump's own Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>As the FTC reviews a proposed merger between Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group, two large ad agencies, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/business/ftc-omnicom-interpublic-merger.html">reported</a> yesterday that a "proposed consent decree would prevent the merged company from boycotting platforms because of their political content by refusing to place their clients' advertisements on them, according to two people briefed on the matter."</p>
<p>This is one of several moves the FTC has reportedly made to discourage ad boycotts that have riled conservatives. The FTC currently has only Republican commissioners because President Trump <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-fires-both-ftc-democrats-in-challenge-to-supreme-court-precedent/">fired both Democrats</a>, who allege in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/ftc-democrats-sue-trump-say-firings-break-law-and-supreme-court-precedent/">lawsuit</a> that the firings were illegal. Trump also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/trump-declares-sweeping-power-over-independent-agencies-such-as-fcc-and-sec/">declared sweeping executive power</a> over the FTC and other agencies that were created to operate independently from the White House.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trumps-ftc-targets-advertising-boycotts-in-potential-boost-for-elon-musks-x/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Beyond that, the space agency is not offering much information about the unfolding situation in orbit. However, multiple sources have confirmed to Ars that the leak is a serious concern for the space agency as it deals with hardware that is approaching three decades in orbit.</p>
<p>To understand the current situation, it is important to review past leaks on the station, which has an aluminum structure. The station has had a slow <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/on-the-space-station-band-aid-fixes-for-systemic-problems/">but increasing leak since 2019</a>. The air leaks are located in the transfer tunnel of the space station's Russian Zvezda service module, one of the oldest elements of the complex, the first elements of which were launched in 1998. The transfer tunnel, known by the Russian acronym PrK, connects the Zvezda module with a docking port where Soyuz crew and Progress resupply spacecraft attach to the station.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/theres-another-leak-on-the-iss-but-nasa-is-not-saying-much-about-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">StreamTV Insider provided flights from New York City to Denver and two nights of accommodation so Ars could attend its StreamTV Show. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>DENVER—Ads shown while you're streaming shows or movies are disruptive enough. But there's something uniquely eerie about what you see when a connected TV (CTV) platform fails to sell ad inventory. You may get a black screen accompanied by ethereal music or a confusing thumping beat, alongside a graphic that says something like, "We'll be right back."</p>
<p>Not only are streamers being forced to endure <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/amazon-prime-video-subscribers-sit-through-up-to-6-minutes-of-ads-per-hour/">more ad time than ever,</a> but that time doesn't even always benefit streaming platforms or advertisers. For the past six months, AdGood has been working to turn that blank, wasted ad space into messaging for good by helping nonprofits buy ad space for cheap.</p>
<p>During the StreamTV Show in Denver this week, Ars spoke with Kris Johns, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.adgood.org/about">AdGood</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that sells unused, CTV ad space to other nonprofits. AdGood sells unfilled, sometimes donated, ad space at discounted rates, which <a href="https://www.adgood.org/">it says</a> can be as low as about $5 to $6 CPMs (cost per mille, or the amount an advertiser pays for every 1,000 impressions an ad earns). Johns said that CTV CPMs can vary depending on the scenario, with costs ranging from $12 to $15 and higher. Some CTV ad firms <a href="https://keynesdigital.com/ctv-advertising-rates/">peg</a> the average CTV CPM at <a href="https://keynesdigital.com/ctv-advertising-rates/">$35 to $65</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/inside-the-firm-turning-eerie-blank-streaming-ads-into-useful-nonprofit-messages/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apps used to be the measure of a mobile platform's worth, with Apple and Google dueling over who could list the most items in their respective stores. Today, the numbers don't matter as much—there are enough apps, and Google's attempt to replace parts of the web with apps is going away. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/android-instant-apps-will-blur-the-lines-between-apps-and-mobile-sites/">Instant Apps</a>, a feature that debuted in 2017, will reportedly be scrapped in December 2025. In its place, you'll just have to use the Internet.</p>
<p>Developer Leon Omelan spotted this news buried in the latest Canary release of Android Studio (confirmed by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-killing-android-instant-apps-3567211/">Android Authority</a>). The development client includes a warning that Instant Apps is headed for the Google graveyard. Here's the full notice, which is the only official confirmation from Google at this time.</p>

<p>Instant Apps wasn't a bad idea—it was just too late. Early in the mobile era, browsers and websites were sluggish on phones, making apps a much better option. Installing them for every site that offered them could be a pain, though. Google's Instant Apps tried to smooth over the experience by delivering an app live without installation. When developers implemented the feature, clicking a link to their websites could instead open the Android app in a similar amount of time as loading a webpage. Google later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/the-play-store-gets-a-try-now-button-for-games-no-install-required/">expanded the feature</a> to games.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/another-one-for-the-graveyard-google-to-kill-instant-apps-in-december/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Wondering what to get the dad who has everything? We have some ideas!]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Greetings Arsians! It's time—at least in some parts of the world—to celebrate dads. Father's Day is nearly here, and as there's a custom of gift-giving, many of us will have to choose something. Below, various Ars editors have identified a few things they've bought recently that they think could be great gifts for dads—with the caveat that there's an indefinably large spectrum of variations of what dads like. Still, we did our best to include a few things that are pretty general, and a few that are weirdly specific. In any case, want to show some appreciation for your dad? Here are some options you can throw some money at.</p>
<h2>Under $100</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4jMr4ic">86Lux Book Light</a></strong> - $15</p>
<p>Unless your father has light dimmers or has jumped onboard the small-lights-not-big-ones interior design trend, chances are there are two environments available to him for reading: one giant, bright ceiling light that is great for reading but not so great for setting an immersive and relaxing mood or, well, darkness. Enter the clip book light, a good way to light up the page at a brightness suitable for not-so-new eyes without harshing the reading vibes. The 86Lux Book Light is one of many offerings, but we like its simple design. It has multiple temperature and brightness levels, and it's adjustable, so it can reliably clip onto most books.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/shopping/2025/06/ars-technicas-gift-guide-for-fathers-day-give-dad-some-cool-things/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Trained on the data of the dead, these tools, sometimes called grief bots or AI ghosts, may be text-, audio-, or even video-based.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.48 of the Rocket Report! The shock of last week's public spat between President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has worn off, and Musk expressed regret for some of his comments going after Trump on social media. Musk also backtracked from his threat to begin decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, currently the only way for the US government to send people to the International Space Station. Nevertheless, there are many people who think Musk's attachment to Trump could end up putting the US space program at risk, and I'm not convinced that danger has passed.</p>

<p><b>Quebec invests in small launch company. </b>The government of Quebec will invest CA$10 million ($7.3 million) into a Montreal-area company that is developing a system to launch small satellites into space, <a href="https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/national/quebec-to-invest-10m-in-company-developing-canadian-made-satellite-launch-technology/article_d986b3a5-d502-5da3-b985-775f101b12f4.html">The Canadian Press reports</a>. Quebec Premier François Legault announced the investment into Reaction Dynamics at the company's facility in Longueuil, a Montreal suburb.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Breast cancer. Colon cancer. An enlarged thyroid gland. A family history of tumors and cancers as well. It wasn't until the woman developed an annoying case of dry mouth that doctors put it all together. By then, she was in her 60s.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2835072">a new case study in JAMA Dermatology</a>, the woman presented to a dermatology clinic in Spain after three months of oral unpleasantness. They noted the cancers in her medical history. When she opened wide, doctors immediately saw the problem: Her tongue was covered in little wart-like bumps that resembled a slippery, flesh-colored cobblestone path.

<p>Such a cobblestone tongue is a telltale sign of a rare genetic condition called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525984/">Cowden syndrome</a>. It's caused by inherited mutations that break a protein, called PTEN, leading to tumors and cancers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/after-a-series-of-tumors-womans-odd-looking-tongue-explains-everything/">Read full article</a></p>

In those few seconds, the trajectory of his life over the next three and a half years changed dramatically.</p>
<p>The president, the callers said, wanted to go in a different direction for NASA's administrator. At the time, Isaacman was within days of a final vote on the floor of the US Senate and assured of bipartisan support. He had run the gauntlet of six months of vetting, interviews, and a committee hearing. He expected to be sworn in within a week. And then, it was all gone.</p>
<p>"I was very disappointed, especially because it was so close to confirmation and I think we had a good plan to implement," Isaacman told Ars on Wednesday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/what-might-have-been-at-jared-isaacmans-nasa/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple this week provided a glimpse into a feature that solves one of the biggest drawbacks of passkeys, the industry-wide standard for website and app authentication that isn't susceptible to credential phishing and other attacks targeting passwords.</p>
<p>The import/export feature, which Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/279/?time=1152">demonstrated</a> at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference, will be available in the next major releases of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. It aims to solve one of the biggest shortcomings of passkeys as they have existed to date. Passkeys created on one operating system or credential manager are largely bound to those environments. A passkey created on a Mac, for instance, can sync easily enough with other Apple devices connected to the same iCloud account. Transferring them to a Windows device or even a dedicated credential manager installed on the same Apple device has been impossible.</p>
<h2>Growing pains</h2>
<p>That limitation has led to criticisms that passkeys are a power play by large companies to lock users into specific product ecosystems. Users have also rightly worried that the lack of transferability increases the risk of getting locked out of important accounts if a device storing passkeys is lost, stolen, or destroyed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/apple-previews-new-import-export-feature-to-make-passkeys-more-interoperable/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, electronics engineer Lorentio Brodesco <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/psx/comments/1l47s0o/for_the_first_time_ever_a_ps1_motherboard_not/">announced</a> the completion of a mock-up for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brodesco/nsone-playstation-1-custom-motherboard">nsOne</a>, reportedly the first custom PlayStation 1 motherboard created outside of Sony in the console's 30-year history. The fully functional board accepts original PlayStation 1 chips and fits directly into the original console case, marking a milestone in reverse-engineering for the classic console released in 1994.</p>
<p>Brodesco's motherboard isn't an emulator or FPGA-based re-creation—it's a genuine circuit board designed to work with authentic PlayStation 1 components, including the CPU, GPU, SPU, RAM, oscillators, and voltage regulators. The board represents over a year of <a href="https://x.com/LBrodesco44460/status/1769683646150008938">reverse-engineering work</a> that began in March 2024 when Brodesco discovered incomplete documentation while repairing a PlayStation 1.</p>
<p>"This isn't an emulator. It's not an FPGA. It's not a modern replica," Brodesco wrote in a Reddit post about the project. "It's a real motherboard, compatible with the original PS1 chips."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/engineer-creates-first-custom-motherboard-for-1990s-playstation-console/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When major events occur, most people rush to Google to find information. Increasingly, the first thing they see is an AI Overview, a feature that already has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">reputation for making glaring mistakes</a>. In the wake of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/12/world/india-plane-crash-ahmedabad">tragic plane crash in India</a>, Google's AI search results are spreading misinformation claiming the incident involved an Airbus plane—it was actually a Boeing 787.</p>
<p>Travelers are more attuned to the airliner models these days after a spate of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/initial-findings-put-boeings-software-at-center-of-ethiopian-737-crash/">crashes involving Boeing's 737 lineup</a> several years ago. Searches for airline disasters are sure to skyrocket in the coming days, with reports that more than 200 passengers and crew lost their lives in the Air India Flight 171 crash. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/">The way generative AI operates</a> means some people searching for details may get the wrong impression from Google's results page.</p>
<p>Not all searches get AI answers, but Google has been steadily <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/">expanding this feature</a> since it debuted last year. One searcher on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1l9lymm/google_is_showing_it_was_an_airbus_aircraft_that/">spotted a troubling confabulation</a> when searching for crashes involving Airbus planes. AI Overviews, apparently overwhelmed with results reporting on the Air India crash, stated confidently (and incorrectly) that it was an Airbus A330 that fell out of the sky shortly after takeoff. We've run a few similar searches—some of the AI results say Boeing, some say Airbus, and some include a strange mashup of both Airbus and Boeing. It's a mess.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-ai-mistakenly-says-fatal-air-india-crash-involved-airbus-instead-of-boeing/">Read full article</a></p>
