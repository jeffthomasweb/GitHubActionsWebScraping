                            <![CDATA[<p>The heavy version of Europe's Ariane 6 rocket launched for the first time Thursday, hauling 32 spacecraft to low-Earth orbit for Amazon's satellite broadband constellation.</p>
<p>The Ariane 6 rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center on the northeastern coast of South America at 11:45 am EST (16:45 UTC), quickly soaring into a clear sky at the tropical spaceport on the power of a hydrogen-fueled main engine and four strap-on solid rocket boosters.</p>
<p>This Ariane 6 configuration, called Ariane 64, is the first to use the rocket's full complement of four boosters. Collectively, the rocket generated more than 3.4 million pounds of thrust (15,400 kilonewtons) of thrust as it steered northeast over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the rocket's upper stage released all 32 of Amazon's satellites into an on-target orbit at an altitude of 289 miles (465 kilometers).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/when-amazon-badly-needed-a-ride-europes-ariane-6-rocket-delivered/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[OpenAI's new GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark is 15 times faster at coding than its predecessor.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/">released</a> its first production AI model to run on non-Nvidia hardware, deploying the new GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark coding model on chips from Cerebras. The model delivers code at more than 1,000 tokens (chunks of data) per second, which is reported to be roughly 15 times faster than its predecessor. To compare, Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 in its new premium-priced fast mode <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/fast-mode">reaches</a> about 2.5 times its standard speed of <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/claude-opus-4-6-adaptive">68.2 tokens per second</a>, although it is a larger and more capable model than Spark.</p>
<p>"Cerebras has been a great engineering partner, and we're excited about adding fast inference as a new platform capability," Sachin Katti, head of compute at OpenAI, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Codex-Spark is a research preview available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month) through the Codex app, command-line interface, and VS Code extension. OpenAI is rolling out API access to select design partners. The model ships with a 128,000-token context window and handles text only at launch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openai-sidesteps-nvidia-with-unusually-fast-coding-model-on-plate-sized-chips/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration's top vaccine regulator at the Food and Drug Administration, single-handedly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-refuses-to-review-modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine/">decided to refuse to review Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine</a>, overruling agency scientists, according to reports from Stat News and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/02/11/moderna-flu-vaccine-application-rejected-by-prasad-overruling-fda-staff/">Stat</a> was first to report, based on unnamed FDA sources, that a team of career scientists at the agency was ready to review the vaccine and that David Kaslow, a top career official who reviews vaccines, even wrote a memo objecting to Prasad’s rejection. The memo reportedly included a detailed explanation of why the review should proceed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/why-the-fda-blocked-modernas-new-flu-shot-84fdaab6">The Wall Street Journal confirmed</a> the report with its own sources, who added that FDA scientists attended an hourlong meeting with Prasad in early January, in which they laid out their objections to Prasad's plans to block the vaccine review. They reportedly told Prasad—a political appointee known for causing turmoil and espousing anti-vaccine rhetoric—that it was the wrong approach.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/trump-official-overruled-fda-scientists-to-reject-modernas-flu-shot/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HgMbkitzhEM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Nicolas Cage has carved out a quirky niche for himself in recent years with such films as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/color-out-of-space-review-nic-cage-lovecraft-match-made-in-rlyeh/"><em>Color Out of Space</em></a> (2019), <em>Pig</em> (2021), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/ars-technicas-favorite-films-in-2022/"><em>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</em></a> (2022), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/film-technica-our-favorite-movies-of-2023/"><em>Dream Scenario</em></a> (2023), and <em>Longlegs</em> (2024), among others. Now he's starring in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Noir"><em>Spider-Noir</em></a>, a new live-action series based on the Marvel Comics character. Cage plays an aging private investigator and disillusioned superhero in 1930s New York. Prime Video released the first teaser in two forms: one in black and white—very Raymond Chandler-esque—and another in color, which the showrunners are calling "True Hue."</p>
<p>Marvel Comics created its "noir" line in 2009, reinterpreting familiar Marvel characters in an alternate universe, usually set during the Great Depression in the US. A version of the Spider-Noir character, voiced by Cage, briefly appeared in the animated masterpieces, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review-more-spider-people-means-a-better-film/"><em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em></a> (2018) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/film-technica-our-favorite-movies-of-2023/"><em>Across the Spider-Verse</em></a> (2023). (He is set to reprise that role in the upcoming <em>Beyond the Spider-Verse</em>.)</p>
<p>Co-showrunner (with Steve Lightfoot) Oren Uziel is a film noir fan, so that Marvel series naturally appealed to him. The live-action series is still set in 1930s New York, but the spidery superhero is not Peter Parker. (Uziel thought the Parker character was too associated with a boyish high school type, which didn't really fit the noir vibe.) So Cage is playing Ben Reilly, a hard-boiled PI with a secret superhero identity, The Spider. Cage has described his portrayal as "70 percent Humphrey Bogart [specifically <em>The Big Sleep</em>] and 30 percent Bugs Bunny," which seems pretty on point for Cage's distinctively flamboyant style.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/spider-noir-teaser-comes-in-colorized-true-hue-and-black-and-white/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Moments after liftoff from Florida's Space Coast early Thursday morning, a shower of sparks emerged in the exhaust plume of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket. Seconds later, the rocket twisted on its axis before recovering and continuing the climb into orbit with a batch of US military satellites.</p>
<p>The sight may have appeared familiar to seasoned rocket watchers. Sixteen months ago, a Vulcan rocket lost one of its booster nozzles shortly after launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The rocket recovered from the malfunction and still reached the mission's planned orbit.</p>
<p>Details of Thursday's booster problem remain unclear. An investigation into the matter is underway, according to ULA, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But the circumstances resemble those of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/ulas-second-vulcan-rocket-lost-part-of-its-booster-and-kept-going/">booster malfunction in October 2024</a>. Closeup video from Thursday's launch shows a fiery plume near the throat of one of the rocket's four solid-fueled boosters, the area where the motor's propellant casing connects to its bell-shaped exhaust nozzle. The throat drives super-hot gas from the burning solid propellant through the nozzle to generate thrust.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/ulas-vulcan-launcher-still-has-a-solid-rocket-booster-problem/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a widely expected move, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us">has announced</a> that it is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-trumps-epa-hopes-to-avoid-greenhouse-gas-regulations/">revoking an analysis of greenhouse gases</a> that laid the foundation for regulating their emissions by cars, power plants, and industrial sources. The analysis, called an endangerment finding, was initially ordered by the US Supreme Court in 2007 and completed during the Obama administration; it has, in theory, served as the basis of all government regulations of carbon dioxide emissions since.</p>
<p>In practice, lawsuits and policy changes between Democratic and Republican administrations have meant it has had little impact. In fact, the first Trump administration left the endangerment finding in place, deciding it was easier to respond to it with weak regulations than it was to challenge its scientific foundations, given the strength of the evidence for human-driven climate change.</p>
<h2>Legal tactics</h2>
<p>The second Trump administration, however, was prepared to tackle the science head-on, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/mockery-of-science-climate-scientists-tear-into-new-us-climate-report/">gathering a group of contrarians</a> to write a report questioning that evidence. It did not go well, either <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/mockery-of-science-climate-scientists-tear-into-new-us-climate-report/">scientifically</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/us-forced-to-disclose-its-climate-working-groups-communications/">legally</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/as-expected-trumps-epa-guts-climate-endangerment-finding/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson has accused Apple of violating US law by suppressing conservative-leaning news outlets on Apple News.</p>
<p>Ferguson pointed to research by a pro-Trump group that accused Apple News of suppressing articles by Fox News, the New York Post, Daily Mail, Breitbart, and The Gateway Pundit. The FTC chair claims that Apple News might be violating promises made to consumers in its terms of service, but his letter doesn't cite any specific provisions from the Apple terms that might have been violated.</p>
<p>"Recently, there have been reports that Apple News has systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed news articles from more conservative publications," Ferguson wrote in the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/apple-news-warning-letter.pdf">letter</a> to Apple CEO Tim Cook yesterday. He said the "reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers, as well as the reasonable consumer expectations of the tens of millions of Americans who use Apple News."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-ftc-denies-being-speech-police-but-says-apple-news-is-too-liberal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/high-ram-prices-mean-record-setting-profits-for-samsung-and-other-memory-makers/">AI-driven memory and storage price hikes</a> have been the defining feature of the PC industry in 2026, and hobbyists have been hit the hardest—companies like Apple with lots of buying power have been able to limit the price increases for their PCs, phones, and other gadgets so far, but smaller outfits like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ram-shortage-delays-valves-steam-machine-desktop-and-steam-frame-headset/">Valve</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ongoing-ram-crisis-prompts-raspberry-pis-second-price-hike-in-two-months/">Raspberry Pi</a> haven't been so lucky.</p>
<p>Framework, the company behind repairable and upgradeable computer designs like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/review-ryzen-ai-cpu-makes-this-the-fastest-the-framework-laptop-13-has-ever-been/">Laptop 13</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/review-new-framework-laptop-16-takes-a-fresh-stab-at-the-upgradeable-laptop-gpu/">Laptop 16</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/framework-laptop-12-review-im-excited-to-see-what-the-2nd-generation-looks-like/">Laptop 12</a>, is also taking a hard hit by price increases. The company stopped selling standalone RAM sticks in November 2025 and has increased prices on one or more of its systems <a href="https://frame.work/blog/updates-on-memory-pricing-and-navigating-the-volatile-memory-market">every month since then</a>; this week's increases are hitting the Framework Desktop and the DIY Editions of its various laptops particularly hard.</p>
<p>The price increases are affecting both standalone SODIMM memory modules and the soldered-down LPDDR5X memory used in the Framework Desktop. Patel says that standalone RAM sticks are being priced "as close as we can to the weighted average cost of our purchases from suppliers." In September, buying an 8GB stick of RAM with a Framework Laptop 13 cost $40; it currently costs $130. A 96GB DDR5 kit of two 48GB sticks costs $1,340, up from $480 in September.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/frameworks-ram-prices-climbing-on-a-monthly-cadence-with-more-hikes-to-come/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset launched in February 2024, users were frustrated at the lack of a proper YouTube app—a significant disappointment given the device's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/can-a-3500-headset-replace-your-tv-we-tried-vision-pro-to-find-out/">focus on video content consumption</a>, and YouTube's strong library of immersive VR and 360 videos. That complaint continued through the release of the second-generation Vision Pro last year, including in our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/where-apples-vision-pro-stands-today-post-m5-refresh/">review</a>.</p>
<p>Now, two years later, an official YouTube app from Google has launched on the Vision Pro's app store. It's not just a port of the iPad app, either—it has panels arranged spatially in front of the user as you'd expect, and it supports 3D videos, as well as 360- and 180-degree ones.</p>
<p>YouTube's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-for-visionos/id6745572359">App Store listing</a> says users can watch "every video on YouTube" (there's a screenshot of a special interface for Shorts vertical videos, for example) and that they get "the full signed-in experience" with watch history and so on.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/it-took-two-years-but-google-released-a-youtube-app-on-vision-pro/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/distillation-experimentation-integration-ai-adversarial-use">announced</a> that "commercially motivated" actors have attempted to clone knowledge from its Gemini AI chatbot by simply prompting it. One adversarial session reportedly prompted the model more than 100,000 times across various non-English languages, collecting responses ostensibly to train a cheaper copycat.</p>
<p>Google published the findings in what amounts to a quarterly self-assessment of threats to its own products that frames the company as the victim and the hero, which is not unusual in these self-authored assessments. Google calls the illicit activity "model extraction" and considers it intellectual property theft, which is a somewhat loaded position, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784257/google-ai-bard-privacy-policy-train-web-scraping">given</a> that Google's LLM was built from materials scraped from the Internet without permission.</p>
<p>Google is also no stranger to the copycat practice. In 2023, The Information <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/03/30/google-bard-chatgpt-training-report/">reported</a> that Google's Bard team had been accused of using ChatGPT outputs from ShareGPT, a public site where users share chatbot conversations, to help train its own chatbot. Senior Google AI researcher Jacob Devlin, who created the influential BERT language model, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-ai-researcher-reportedly-left-190003999.html">warned</a> leadership that this violated OpenAI's terms of service, then resigned and joined OpenAI. Google denied the claim but reportedly stopped using the data.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/attackers-prompted-gemini-over-100000-times-while-trying-to-clone-it-google-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Very few people alive today have seen the Appalachian forests as they existed a century ago. Even as state and national parks preserved ever more of the ecosystem, fungal pathogens from Asia nearly wiped out one of the dominant species of these forests, the American chestnut, killing an estimated 3 billion trees. While new saplings continue to sprout from the stumps of the former trees, the fungus persists, killing them before they can seed a new generation.</p>
<p>But thanks in part to trees planted in areas where the two fungi don't grow well, the American chestnut isn't extinct. And efforts to revive it in its native range have continued, despite the long generation times needed to breed resistant trees. In Thursday's issue of Science, researchers describe their efforts to apply modern genomic techniques and exhaustive testing to identify the best route to restoring chestnuts to their native range.</p>
<h2>Multiple paths to restoration</h2>
<p>While the American chestnut is functionally extinct—it's no longer a participant in the ecosystems it once dominated—it's most certainly not extinct. Two Asian fungi that have killed it off in its native range; one causes chestnut blight, while a less common pathogen causes a root rot disease. Both prefer warmer, humid environments and persist there because they can grow asymptomatically on distantly related trees, such as oaks. Still, chestnuts planted outside the species' original range—primarily in drier areas of western North America—have continued to thrive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/can-modern-genetics-help-us-restore-the-appalachian-forests-of-the-1800s/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>An elephant's trunk is a marvelous thing, flexible enough to bend and stretch as it forages for food, but also stiff enough to grasp and maneuver even delicate objects like peanuts or a tortilla chip. That's because the trunk is highly sensitive when it comes to sensing touch. Scientists have determined that the whiskers lining the trunk are crucial for that sensitivity thanks to their unique structure, amounting to a kind of innate "material intelligence, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx8981">new paper</a> published in the journal Science.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/the-secret-to-a-rats-sense-of-touch-its-all-in-how-the-whiskers-bend/">previously reported</a>, there is a long history of <a href="https://cocktailpartyphysics.com/by-a-whisker/">studying whiskers</a> (<em>vibrissae</em>) in mammals. Rats, cats, tree squirrels, manatees, harbor seals, sea otters, pole cats, shrews, tammar wallabies, sea lions, and naked mole-rats all share strikingly similar basic whisker anatomies, according to various prior studies. Among other potential applications, such research could one day enable scientists to build artificial whiskers as tactile sensors in robotics, as well as learn more about human touch.</p>
<p>Whiskers are much more complex than one might think, both in structure and function. Rats, for instance, <a href="https://cocktailpartyphysics.com/by-a-whisker/">have about 30 large whiskers</a> and dozens of smaller ones, part of a complex “scanning sensorimotor system” that enables the rat to perform such diverse tasks as texture analysis, active touch for path finding, pattern recognition, and object location, just by scanning the terrain with its whiskers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/unique-structure-of-elephant-whiskers-give-them-built-in-sensing-intelligence/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Years before the Chevrolet Bolt or Tesla Model 3, the Nissan Leaf was a good-faith attempt by a major automaker to bring electric vehicles to the mass market. But even in its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/nissans-bigger-battery-bev-the-2019-leaf-plus-review/">second-generation</a>, the Leaf was hamstrung by poor battery management and was soon left behind. For its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/small-affordable-efficient-a-lot-to-like-about-the-2026-nissan-leaf/">third take on the Leaf</a>, Nissan fixed the earlier cars' key flaw by adding liquid-cooling for the battery pack. Better yet, the new Leaf is built on a dedicated EV platform that offers better interior space and range efficiency than the hatchback it replaces, despite taking up less road space.</p>
<p>Our first drive of the car took place last year in San Diego, a region <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/the-art-of-driving-fast-on-public-roads-in-the-21st-century-a-how-to/">where the roads</a> tend to flatter a car. Our first impression was positive enough to place the Leaf first among <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/the-10-best-vehicles-ars-technica-drove-in-2025/">the cars we drove in 2025</a>. Sure, if money were no object, I'd take that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/porsches-best-daily-driver-911-the-2025-carrera-gts-t-hybrid-review/">hybrid Porsche 911</a> that came in second, but you could buy five fully loaded Leafs for the same price as a bare-bones Carrera GTS. And for those of us in the real world, money usually is an object. But a longer test with the Leaf was in order to see how the electric Nissan held up in the day-to-day grind.</p>
<h2>Price and specs</h2>
<p>In time, Nissan will offer an entry-level Leaf with a 52 kWh battery pack and a bit less power. For now, though, the company is only importing cars with a 75 kWh (usable) pack and a 214 hp (160 kW), 262 lb-ft (355 Nm) electric motor, which drives the front wheels. Nissan has managed to keep the price sensible, too; the S+ trim starts at $29,990. Riding on the smallest 18-inch wheels, the S+ has the longest range at 303 miles (488 km), but this version does without some of the features many EV drivers may consider essential, like heated front seats and a heat pump.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/2026-nissan-leaf-review-the-best-budget-ev-on-sale-right-now/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's been about a month since Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—an anti-vaccine activist and lawyer who has no background in medicine, health, or science—released dietary guidance for Americans. It's going about as well as expected for a man who drinks raw milk, peddles beef tallow, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/germ-theory-skeptic-rfk-jr-goes-swimming-in-sewage-tainted-water/">swims in sewage-tainted water</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-new-york-ballot-access-lawsuit-e522e2348e54125420fffe8ca25a0d9f">keeps roadkill meat in his freezer</a>. That is to say, it's going badly—so badly that even his favorite AI chatbot is openly defecting.</p>
<p>Of course, this hasn't slowed Kennedy. On Wednesday, he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins held an event in Washington, DC, to celebrate what they called the "implementation" of the dietary guidance, which is represented in an upside-down food pyramid—or a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-s-dietary-guidelines-beef-tallow-is-in-but-no-booze-for-breakfast/">funnel</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/UlIIwSE5VWM">the event</a>, which lasted about an hour, seemed mostly focused on honoring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4F4yZhmMho">a commercial</a> produced to promote the nutrition guidance and a new website showcasing it, RealFood.gov. That commercial, which aired during last weekend's Super Bowl, featured tightly framed shots of world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who made stigmatizing remarks about how he felt "fat and nasty" earlier in life and consequently "just wanted to kill myself." He went on to decry America's "obese, fudgy" people and lambasted "processed food," before eating an apple.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/rfk-jr-food-pyramid-site-links-to-grok-which-says-you-shouldnt-trust-rfk-jr/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>US businesses and consumers paid nearly 90 percent of the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs last year, according to new Federal Reserve research that undercuts the president’s claim that foreign companies would bear the burden.</p>
<p>The study by the New York Fed found that the majority of tariff costs were passed through to Americans in the first 11 months of 2025, although exporters shouldered an increasing amount as the year progressed.</p>
<p>“Our results show that the bulk of the tariff incidence continues to fall on US firms and consumers,” the study’s authors wrote in a blog post on Thursday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/us-consumers-business-pay-90-of-tariff-costs-says-federal-reserve/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Alongside new endgame content, Blizzard says the Warlock is coming to other Diablo games soon.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>It's not every day that a classic PC game gets a new content expansion 25 years after its last major update. But that's what happened last night, as Blizzard suddenly <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243863/rain-annihilation-in-reign-of-the-warlock">released new "Reign of the Warlock" DLC</a> that adds a new class, new end-game challenges, and new inventory-management options to the classic <em>Diablo II</em>.</p>
<p>To be clear, the new DLC is technically not for the original 2000 release of <em>Diablo II</em> (which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/16-years-later-blizzard-is-still-patching-diablo-ii/">still getting patches as of 2016</a>) but for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/diablo-ii-resurrected-impressions-an-uneasy-walk-through-old-remade-dungeons/">the game's 2021 <em>Resurrected</em> remaster</a>. Still, that remastered version has gameplay and animations that are extremely faithful to the original, making yesterday's surprise update the kind of content drop that players have been waiting for since <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction">2001's "Lord of Destruction" expansion</a>.</p>
<p>The "Reign of the Warlock" DLC lets you "command forbidden power" as a new class that "wields forbidden arts, bridles hellfire and shadow, and dominates demons," according to the in-game class selection screen description. By way of backstory, Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243863/rain-annihilation-in-reign-of-the-warlock">writes</a> that most Warlocks "have the means to lead a lavish lifestyle but find the pursuit of luxury and ease stale. Instead, they leverage their elevated status in Sanctuary to hunt down lost knowledge that would enable them to continue the legacy of Horazon."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/diablo-ii-gets-its-first-new-playable-class-in-over-25-years/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We are now a few years into the AI revolution, and talk has shifted from who has the best chatbot to whose AI agent can do the most things on your behalf. Unfortunately, AI agents are still rough around the edges, so tasking them with anything important is not a great idea. OpenAI launched its Atlas agent late last year, which we found to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/10/we-let-openais-agent-mode-surf-the-web-for-us-heres-what-happened/">modestly useful</a>, and now it's Google's turn.</p>
<p>Unlike the OpenAI agent, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-begins-rolling-out-chromes-auto-browse-ai-agent-today/">Google's new Auto Browse agent</a> has extraordinary reach because it's part of Chrome, the world's most popular browser by a wide margin. Google began rolling out Auto Browse (in preview) earlier this month to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to send the agent across the web to complete tasks.</p>
<p>I've taken Chrome's agent for a spin to see whether you can trust it to handle tedious online work for you. For each test, I lay out the problem I need to solve, how I prompted the robot, and how well (or not) it handled the job.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/tested-how-chromes-auto-browse-agent-handles-common-web-tasks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida is accustomed to getting makeovers. It got another one Wednesday with the removal of the Crew Access Arm used by astronauts to board their rides to space.</p>
<p>Construction workers first carved the footprint for the launch pad from the Florida wetlands more than 60 years ago. NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.</p>
<p>SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad's tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA's orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company's human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. Astronauts started using the pathway, suspended more than 200 feet above the pad surface, beginning with the first crew flight on a Dragon spacecraft in 2020.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/heres-why-americas-most-historic-launch-pad-is-getting-yet-another-facelift/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, a fossil-fuel lobbying group called the Washington Coal Club awarded President Trump a trophy that named him the "Undisputed Champion of Clean, Beautiful Coal." Trump took advantage of the opportunity to take his latest shot at reviving the fortunes of the US's most polluting source of electricity: an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/02/strengthening-united-states-national-defense-with-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-power-generation-fleet/">executive order</a> that would make the military buy it.</p>
<p>Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump's return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term.</p>
<p>Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trump-admin-orders-another-coal-plant-to-stay-open/">forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations</a>. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/trumps-latest-plan-to-revive-coal-power-make-the-military-buy-it/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/faa-shuts-down-el-paso-airspace-for-10-days-and-wont-say-why/">closed airspace up to 18,000 feet</a> above the El Paso International Airport in Texas, saying the restrictions would be in place for 10 days. Then, less than 10 hours later, the federal agency reopened the airspace, allowing planes to land and take off at the busy airport.</p>
<p>About an hour after lifting the restrictions, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, whose responsibilities include overseeing the FAA, explained the unexpected closure by saying, "The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion." (The Trump Administration refers to the Department of Defense as the Department of War, or DOW, although its legal name remains the former.)</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees with Duffy's account.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/el-paso-airport-closed-after-military-used-new-anti-drone-laser-to-zap-party-balloon/">Read full article</a></p>
