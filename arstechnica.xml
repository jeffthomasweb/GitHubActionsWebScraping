            <![CDATA[New cursing chatbot follows Elon Musk's plan to provide an "uncensored" answer to ChatGPT.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, xAI <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893847308124471714">released</a> a new voice interaction mode for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/new-grok-3-release-tops-llm-leaderboards-despite-musk-approved-based-opinions/">Grok 3 AI model</a> that is currently available to its premium subscribers. The feature is somewhat similar to OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a> for ChatGPT. But unlike ChatGPT, Grok offers several uncensored personalities users can choose from (currently expressed through the same default female voice), including an "unhinged" mode and one that will roleplay verbal sexual scenarios.</p>
<p>On Monday, AI researcher Riley Goodside brought wider attention to the over-the-top "unhinged" mode in particular when he <a href="https://x.com/goodside/status/1893932239718691167">tweeted a video</a> (warning: NSFW audio) that showed him repeatedly interrupting the vocal chatbot, which began to simulate yelling when asked. "Grok 3 Voice Mode, following repeated, interrupting requests to yell louder, lets out an inhuman 30-second scream, insults me, and hangs up," he wrote.</p>
<p>By default, "unhinged" mode <a href="https://x.com/FoxArmer/status/1894274737423212615">curses, insults, and belittles</a> the user non-stop using vulgar language. Other modes include "Storyteller" (which does what it sounds like), "Romantic" (which stammers and speaks in a slow, uncertain, and insecure way), "Meditation" (which can guide you through a meditation-like experience), "Conspiracy" (which likes to talk about conspiracy theories, UFOs, and bigfoot), "Unlicensed Therapist" (which plays the part of a talk psychologist), "Grok Doc" (a doctor), "Sexy" (marked as "18+" and acts almost like a 1-800 phone sex operator), and "Professor" (which talks about science).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/groks-uncensored-ai-voice-mode-lets-users-talk-sex-therapy-and-conspiracies/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Gemini Code Assist lets you do 90 times more than competing tools. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Generative AI has wormed its way into myriad products and services, some of which benefit more from these tools than others. Coding with AI has proven to be a better application than most, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-i-program-with-llms/">individual developers</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-ceo-says-over-25-of-new-google-code-is-generated-by-ai/">big companies</a> leaning heavily on generative tools to create and debug programs. Now, indie developers have access to a new AI coding tool free of charge—Google has announced that <a href="https://codeassist.google/products/individual">Gemini Code Assist</a> is available to everyone.</p>
<p>Gemini Code Assist was first released late last year as an enterprise tool, and the new version has almost all the same features. While you can use the standard Gemini or another AI model like ChatGPT to work on coding questions, Gemini Code Assist was designed to fully integrate with the tools developers are already using. Thus, you can tap the power of a large language model (LLM) without jumping between windows. With Gemini Code Assist connected to your development environment, the model will remain aware of your code and ready to swoop in with suggestions. The model can also address specific challenges per your requests, and you can chat with the model about your code, provided it's a public domain language.</p>
<p>At launch, Gemini Code Assist pricing started at $45 per month per user. Now, it costs nothing for individual developers, and the limits on the free tier are generous. Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-code-assist-free/">says</a> the product offers 180,000 code completions per month, which it claims is enough that even prolific professional developers won't run out. This is in stark contrast to Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/github-copilot-moves-beyond-openai-models-to-support-claude-3-5-gemini/">GitHub Copilot</a>, which offers similar features with a limit of just 2,000 code completions and 50 Copilot chat messages per month. Google did the math to point out Gemini Code Assist offers 90 times the completions of Copilot.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/googles-free-gemini-code-assist-arrives-with-sky-high-usage-limits/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Framework announced two new systems to its lineup today: the convertible Framework 12 and a gaming-focused (but not-very-upgradeable) mini ITX Framework Desktop PC. But it's continuing to pay attention to the <a href="https://frame.work/laptop13">Framework Laptop 13, too</a>—the company's first upgrade-friendly repairable laptop is getting another motherboard update, this time with AMD's latest Ryzen AI 300-series processors. It's Framework's second AMD Ryzen-based board, following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/review-framework-laptop-finally-gets-an-amd-ryzen-config-and-its-pretty-good/">late 2023's Ryzen 7040-based refresh</a>.</p>
<p>The new boards are available for preorder today and will begin shipping in April. Buyers new to the Framework ecosystem can buy a laptop, which starts at $1,099 as a pre-built system with an OS, storage, and RAM included, or $899 for a build-it-yourself kit where you add those components yourself. Owners of Framework Laptops going all the way back to the original 11th-generation Intel version can also buy a bare board to drop into their existing systems; these start at $449.</p>
<p>Framework will ship six- and eight-core Ryzen AI 300 processors on lower-end configurations, most likely the Ryzen AI 5 340 and Ryzen AI 7 350 that AMD announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amds-2025-ryzen-laptop-lineup-a-mix-of-powerful-new-and-renamed-old/">at CES in January</a>. These chips include integrated Radeon 840M and 860M GPUs with four and eight graphics cores, respectively.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-gives-its-13-inch-laptop-another-boost-with-ryzen-ai-300-cpu-update/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The original Framework Laptop’s sales pitch was that it wanted to bring some of the modularity and repairability of the desktop PC ecosystem to a functional, thin-and-light laptop. For nearly half a decade, the company has made good on that promise with multiple motherboard upgrades and other tweaks for the original 13-inch Framework Laptop; with the Framework Laptop 16 and Laptop 12, the company has tried to bring the same ethos to gaming/workstation laptops and budget PCs for students.</p>
<p>One of Framework's announcements today was for the company's first desktop PC. Unsurprisingly dubbed the Framework Desktop, it's aimed less at the general-purpose PC crowd and more at people who want the smallest, most powerful desktop they can build and will pay extra money to get it. Pre-orders for this system start today, and Framework says it should ship in Q3 of 2025.</p>
<p>Here was my first question: What does a company trying to build a more desktop-like laptop have to bring to the desktop ecosystem, where things are already standardized, upgradeable, and repairable?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-known-for-upgradable-laptops-intros-not-particularly-upgradable-desktop/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Framework has been selling and upgrading the upgrade-and-repair-friendly Framework Laptop 13 for nearly four years now, and in early 2024 it announced a larger, more powerful <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-frameworks-laptop-16-is-unique-laudable-fascinating-and-flawed/">Framework Laptop 16</a>. At a product event today, the company showed off what it called "an early preview" of its third laptop design, the convertible, budget-focused Framework Laptop 12.</p>
<p>This addition to Framework's lineup centers on a 12.2-inch, 1920×1200 convertible touchscreen that flips around to the back with a flexible hinge, a la Lenovo's long-running Yoga design. Framework CEO Nirav Patel said it had originally designed the systems with "students in mind," and to that end it comes in five colors and uses a two-tone plastic body with an internal metal frame rather than the mostly aluminum exterior Framework has used for the 13 and 16. Framework will also sell the laptop with an optional stylus.</p>
<p>For better or worse, the Framework Laptop 12 appears to be its own separate system, with motherboards, accessories, and a refresh schedule distinct from the 13-inch laptop. While the Laptop 13 already offers first-generation Intel Core Ultra-based and (as of today) AMD Ryzen AI 300-based processors, the first Framework Laptop 12 motherboard is going to use Intel's 13th-generation Core i3 and i5 processors, originally launched back in late 2022. Despite the age of these chips, Framework claims the laptop will be "unusually powerful for its class."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/frameworks-laptop-12-is-its-first-stab-at-a-budget-convertible-touchscreen-pc/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court has once again rejected a telecom industry challenge to New York's $15 broadband law.</p>
<p>The court first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/big-loss-for-isps-as-supreme-court-wont-hear-challenge-to-15-broadband-law/">refused</a> the hear the case in December, which meant that an appeals court ruling upholding the law was not disturbed. New York <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/new-york-starts-enforcing-15-broadband-law-that-isps-tried-to-kill/">started enforcing</a> the law in January, but broadband industry groups made another attempt to get the Supreme Court's attention.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/att-complies-with-law-requiring-cheap-internet-by-ending-a-service-in-ny/">stopped offering</a> its 5G home Internet service in New York entirely instead of complying with the law, and the industry hoped AT&amp;T's exit would convince the Supreme Court to change its decision. Lobby groups filed a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-161/339618/20250117153313967_suppl.%20brief%20-%20NYSTA%20v.%20James%20-%20No.%2024-161.pdf">supplemental brief</a> on January 17 urging the court to reconsider its denial of their petition, saying that AT&amp;T's exit proves that "some providers will cease offering broadband service in New York rather than sell at a loss."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/isps-lose-yet-another-attempt-to-kill-new-yorks-15-broadband-mandate/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Qualcomm and Google have joined forces to extend software updates on Android devices. With Google's assistance, the chipmaker has committed to providing extended vendor support to any OEM building on its most powerful chips, pushing the theoretical lifespan of Android devices to eight years. There are plenty of caveats, but this move could make your next phone more useful for longer.</p>
<p>The extended support window only applies to Android devices with the latest Qualcomm chipsets. To start, the eight-year support timeline will be extended to devices running the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/qualcomm-brings-laptop-class-cpu-cores-to-phones-with-snapdragon-8-elite/">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> mobile platform, which has powered devices like the OnePlus 13 and Galaxy S25. Later this year, the same policy will be applied to the company's new Snapdragon 8 and Snapdragon 7-series chips, and you can expect the same deal for at least the next five generations of Qualcomm silicon.</p>
<p>"Through this collaboration, OEMs can more seamlessly update the software and security on their devices, ensuring a more secure and long-lasting Android experience for our users," <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/02/qualcomm-extends-support-for-updates-on-android-devices-with-snapdragon-8-elite">said</a> Google's Android Platform manager Seang Chau.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/qualcomm-and-google-team-up-to-offer-8-years-of-android-updates/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>That comforting hot cup of tea—or refreshing glass of iced tea on a hot summer day—could help reduce the amount of toxic metals in drinking water, according to a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.4c01030">new paper</a> published in the journal ACS Food &amp; Science Technology.</p>
<p>“We’re not suggesting that everyone starts using tea leaves as a water filter,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074361?">said co-author Vinayak Dravid</a>, who studies sorbent materials at Northwestern University. “Our goal was to measure tea’s ability to adsorb heavy metals. By quantifying this effect, our work highlights the unrecognized potential for tea consumption to passively contribute to reduced heavy metal exposure in populations worldwide.”</p>
<p>Some 2 billion people drink tea on a daily basis worldwide, and numerous studies have suggested various health benefits from regular tea consumption. Most nutrition studies focus on things like polyphenols, caffeine, or other chemicals released during brewing, but such research overlooks a unique aspect of tea: unlike most food and drink, tea leaves are not directly consumed, and the brewing process allows tea leaves to adsorb chemicals as well as release them—most notably heavy metal toxins like lead, arsenic, or cadmium. (Adsorption is when a substance adheres to the surface of something; absorption is when a material takes in a substance.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/brewing-tea-removes-lead-from-water/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>One of the big advantages of electric vehicles is their greater freedom when it comes to packaging. Batteries go where it makes the most sense in terms of stability and safety. Electric motors are compact and don't need much cooling compared to a combustion engine, and there's no exhaust to worry about.</p>
<p>Putting the motors close to the wheels makes sense—in the wheel itself if possible—and it seems that a startup called Donut Lab may have solved some of the problems hub-mounted motors have faced in the past.</p>
<p>You can see where the name came from—the motors look like metal donuts. That originally had me thinking they used <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/mercedes-benz-showcases-axial-flux-ev-motor-in-one-eleven-concept-car/">axial flux technology</a>, as some hybrid supercars do, but I was mistaken. These are radial flux motors, just ones that make a lot of torque considering their size and mass.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/these-compact-electric-motors-could-revolutionize-ev-design/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>My preferred methods of organizing my schedule could be considered dated, so when I got a chance to try out a gadget meant to streamline my various digital calendars, I took it.</p>
<p>While I do use digital calendars and to-do lists, my go-to method for organizing my day’s tasks, goals, and upcoming events is pen and paper. I use paper calendars in agendas for a visual layout of events, including those as far away as next month. They give me a sense of control, as I'm able to highlight, circle, draw arrows, underline, erase, and so on. I also write more to-do lists than might be considered efficient (as evidenced by “make to-do list” being a frequent line on my to-do lists).</p>
<p>But there are many benefits to using tech for staying organized, too. With digital options, I can easily check my availability on the go with my phone and get alerts to remind me of events.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/streamlining-and-oversimplifying-my-online-calendars-with-a-3-5-inch-smart-screen/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>COVID-19 vaccines cut the risk of long COVID by between 57–73 percent in kids and teens, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830556">a study published today in JAMA Network Open</a>. And there's more good news: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830557">A second study</a> published today in the journal offered <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm">more data</a> that the now-annual shots are not linked to sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death in young athletes—a claim that gained traction on social media and among anti-vaccine groups during the acute phase of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Together, the studies bolster current recommendations that children and teens should stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines, which are estimated to have prevented <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations">more than 3 million deaths and more than 18 million hospitalizations</a> in the first two years of their use.  So far, the recommendations for kids have largely gone unheeded; only <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/child-coverage-vaccination.html">14 percent</a> of children ages 5 to 17 are up to date on their 2024–2025 COVID shot. Surveys suggest that parents largely think the vaccines are unnecessary, given that most children only have mild COVID infections.</p>
<p>Still, not all infections are mild, and even mild cases can lead to long COVID, according to the authors of the first study. An estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long COVID, defined as having symptoms that continue or develop four or more weeks after the initial phase of infection. With tens of millions of kids getting infected with the pandemic virus, a large number of them are at risk of developing the condition.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/covid-shots-protect-kids-from-long-covid-and-dont-cause-sudden-death/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency industry and those responsible for securing it are still in shock following Friday’s heist, likely by North Korea, that drained $1.5 billion from Dubai-based exchange Bybit, making the theft by far the biggest ever in digital asset history.</p>
<p>Bybit officials <a href="https://announcements.bybit.com/article/incident-update---eth-cold-wallet-incident-blt292c0454d26e9140/">disclosed</a> the theft of more than 400,000 ethereum and staked ethereum coins just hours after it occurred. The notification said the digital loot had been stored in a “Multisig Cold Wallet” when, somehow, it was transferred to one of the exchange’s hot wallets. From there, the cryptocurrency was transferred out of Bybit altogether and into wallets controlled by the unknown attackers.</p>
<h2>This wallet is too hot, this one is too cold</h2>
<p>Researchers for blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, among others, <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/bybit-hack-largest-in-history">said</a> over the weekend that the techniques and flow of the subsequent laundering of the funds bear the signature of threat actors working on behalf of North Korea. The revelation comes as little surprise since the isolated nation has long maintained a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/us-sanctions-north-korean-hackers-for-wannacry-and-dozens-of-other-attacks/">thriving cryptocurrency theft racket</a>, in large part to pay for its weapons of mass destruction program.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/how-north-korea-pulled-off-a-1-5-billion-crypto-heist-the-biggest-in-history/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">announced</a> Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a new AI language model with a simulated reasoning (SR) capability called "<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/visible-extended-thinking">extended thinking</a>," allowing the system to work through problems step by step. The company also revealed Claude Code, a command line AI agent for developers currently available as a limited research preview.</p>
<p>Anthropic calls Claude 3.7 the first "hybrid reasoning model" on the market, giving users the option to choose between quick responses or extended, visible chain-of-thought processing similar to OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">o1</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">o3</a> series models, Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking</a>, and DeepSeek's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">R1</a>. When using Claude 3.7's API, developers can specify exactly how many tokens the model should use for thinking, up to its 128,000 token output limit.</p>
<p>The new model is available across all Claude subscription plans, and the extended thinking mode feature is available on all plans except the free tier. API pricing remains unchanged at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, with thinking tokens included in the output pricing since they are part of the context considered by the model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Nothing, the smartphone venture from OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, is on its third generation of Android smartphones. The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro will be officially announced on March 4, but there won't be much left to reveal. Not only has Nothing teased the phones a few times, there's also a new video highlighting the Nothing Phone 3a Pro's design. In it, Nothing's design team speaks at length about how they tried to incorporate the chunky camera module, but what they came up with is going to be divisive.</p>
<p>As we approach 20 years since the iPhone made touchscreen smartphones the default, the form factor is very fleshed out. Some of today's most popular smartphones have almost reached the point of anti-design—flat, unremarkable bodies that are intended to be covered up with a case. There's something to be said for that when most people slap a sheet of plastic on their phone and only remove it once in a blue moon. Nothing, however, designs phones with transparent panels and glowing "Glyphs" that are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/the-nothing-phone-2a-is-a-light-up-budget-phone-for-349/">intended to be seen</a>. In the case of the 3a Pro, there's also a camera module so big it's sure to stand out.</p>
<p>People generally want big screens and big batteries that don't make phones too thick or heavy. Some components have shrunk or been dropped entirely to free up space (a moment of silence for the dearly departed headphone jack). Camera modules, however, can't shrink infinitely. Smaller lenses and sensors have an impact on image quality, so expensive phones often have gargantuan camera arrays that can make phones top-heavy. For example, look at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-family-the-just-hardware-review-no-ai/">Google Pixel 9 series</a>, which features a camera bump that towers above the rest of the back.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nothing-explains-why-the-phone-3a-pro-ended-up-with-a-giant-camera/">Read full article</a></p>

      Diego Luna returns as Cassian in the forthcoming second season of <em>Andor</em>.

<p>The first season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)"><em>Andor</em></a>, the Star Wars prequel series to <em>Rogue One</em> and <em>A New Hope</em>, earned critical raves for its gritty aesthetic and multilayered narrative rife with political intrigue. While ratings were a bit sluggish, they were good enough to win the series a second season, and Disney+ just dropped the first action-packed teaser trailer.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/official-andor-trailer-shows-us-what-the-birth-of-a-revolution-looks-like/">previously reported</a>, the story begins five years before the events of <em>Rogue One</em>, with the Empire's destruction of Cassian Andor's (Diego Luna) homeworld and follows his transformation from a "revolution-averse" cynic to a major player in the nascent rebellion who is willing to sacrifice himself to save the galaxy. S1 left off with Cassian returning to Ferrix for the funeral of his adoptive mother, Maarva (Fiona Shaw), rescuing a friend from prison, and dodging an assassination attempt. A post-credits scene showed prisoners assembling the firing dish of the now-under-construction Death Star.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/the-revolution-starts-now-with-andor-s2-teaser/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Acura is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/honda-cleans-greens-its-ohio-factories-to-add-evs-to-the-mix/">gearing</a> up to build its first entirely in-house battery-electric vehicles, but it has gotten a head start with the ZDX SUV. Built in collaboration with General Motors, the ZDX is a comfortable and competent luxury EV. More than that, it's a shining example of what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebadging">badge engineering</a> looks like in the digital age.</p>
<p>Automakers have long collaborated with each other. Sometimes that means working together on a powertrain or vehicle platform for use in quite different products. Sometimes, it's a little less involved—the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/an-alfa-romeo-bar-the-badge-we-drive-the-2024-dodge-hornet-rt-plug-in/">Dodge Hornet</a> differs very little from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/the-2024-alfa-romeo-tonale-is-a-confoundingly-charming-plug-in-hybrid/">Alfa Romeo Tonale</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In the case of the Acura ZDX, the vehicle platform and the battery-electric powertrain are all thoroughly GM, what used to be called Ultium, until the American automaker <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/general-motors-is-ditching-ultium-branding-for-its-ev-batteries/">retired that branding</a>. It is, in essence, Acura's take on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-cadillac-lyriq-a-bug-free-ev-with-carplay-thats-still-a-bit-bland/">Cadillac Lyriq</a> and is similar, if not identical, in terms of power output and pricing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/software-can-make-a-difference-the-acura-zdx-type-s-review/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Later this week, Amazon is closing a small loophole that allowed purchasers of Kindle books to download those files to a computer and transfer them via USB. Originally intended to extend e-book access to owners of very old Kindles without Wi-Fi connectivity, the feature has also made it easier for people to download and store copies of the e-books they've bought, reducing the risk that Amazon might make changes to their text or remove them from the Kindle store entirely.</p>
<p>The "Download &amp; transfer via USB" option on Amazon's site is going away this Wednesday, February 26. People who want to download their libraries to their PC easily should do so within the next two days. This change <em>only</em> affects the ability to download these files directly to a computer from Amazon's website—if you've downloaded the books beforehand, you'll still be able to load them on your Kindles via USB, and you'll still be able to use third-party software as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G5WYD9SAF7PGXRNA">the Send to Kindle service</a> to get EPUB files and other books loaded onto a Kindle.</p>

      Downloading files to your PC through Amazon's site is still possible, but it's going away later this week.

<p>For typical Kindle owners who buy their books via Amazon's store and seamlessly download them to modern or modern-ish Kindle devices over Wi-Fi, you likely won't notice any change. The effects will be noticed most by those who use third-party software like <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to manage a local e-book library and people who have hopped to other e-reader platforms who want to be able to download their Kindle purchases and strip them of their DRM so they can be read elsewhere.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/psa-amazon-kills-download-transfer-via-usb-option-for-kindles-this-week/">Read full article</a></p>
