<p>Among the many highlights of last weekend's San Diego Comic-Con was the official full trailer for the second season of <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.</em> Sauron has returned and is plotting his takeover of Middle-earth. Will donning the titular rings make the wearers his adversaries—or his collaborators?</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/05/saurons-dark-rise-is-front-and-center-in-the-rings-of-power-s2-teaser/">previously reported</a>, Prime Video made a major investment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power"><em>The Rings of Power</em></a> when it acquired the rights to the source material from the Tolkien estate, even committing to multiple seasons upfront. Pretty much everyone guessed long before the S1 finale's reveal that Halbrand (Charlie Vickers), king of the Southlands, was Sauron in disguise. Fans even dubbed him "Hot Sauron." He took advantage of the fact that the elvish light of Valar was fading, putting the race of elves in danger of extinction unless they returned to Valinor to preserve their immortality. The discovery of the precious ore mithril gave the elves another option championed by Elrond (Robert Aramayo), Galadriel (Morfydd Clark), and the elven smith Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039912#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039912&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The merging of Warner Bros. and Discovery effectively put an end to one DC Extended Universe era while placing the fate of several planned projects in limbo. Chief among those was <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/03/the-batman-2-release-date-2026-1235856229/">a sequel</a> to 2022's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Batman_(film)"><em>The Batman</em></a> and an associated spinoff series, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Penguin_(TV_series)">The Penguin</a>.</em> Both projects have survived the merger, and DC Studio unveiled the first full trailer for <em>The Penguin—</em>starring Colin Farrell reprising his <em>The Batman</em> role of Oswald Cobblepot—during its panel at San Diego Comic-Con last weekend.</p>
<p>The panel also included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc83MIHaI-k">a first look</a> and <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/batman-caped-crusader-penguin-minnie-driver-sdcc-2024/">a screening</a> of the first episode of Prime Video's new animated series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14681596/"><em>Batman: Caped Crusader</em></a>, with Minnie Driver voicing a gender-swapped version of the Penguin named Oswalda Cobblepot. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdzSiO-7LyM">official trailer</a> dropped last month.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Dark mode, night mode, light-on-dark design, or whatever you want to call the version of computer content that doesn't feel blindingly bright at night, had something of a peak moment around 2019–2020. That's when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/android-11-preview-hands-on-notification-changes-dark-mode-options-and-more/">Android</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/ios-13-apple-brings-dark-mode-to-iphones-and-multitasking-overhaul-to-ipads/">iOS</a> designed a system-wide way to implement a darker theme, and signal to compatible apps to do the same. Many, many systems, apps, websites, and other digital tools soon followed.</p>
<p>Except, most notably, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Despite being one of the sites most sympathetic to late-night mind wandering, Wikipedia had no official way to switch its iconic white pages into something more sleep and eyeball-friendly. Now, after great effort from its community, a dark mode (technically a dark "Color" setting) is available to most Wikipedia visitors on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>On desktop, look for a sidebar on the right-hand side that has buttons for setting text size and width, and then "Color (beta)." If you don't see a sidebar, look for an eyeglasses-like icon in the upper-right corner near the search and account tools. On mobile, look for the three horizontal bars (aka hamburger button) in the upper-left corner of a page, choose Settings, then pick your Color. There is the standard Light you know, Dark, and Automatic, which takes its color cues from your system.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039811#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039811&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft is urging users of VMware’s ESXi hypervisor to take immediate action to ward off ongoing attacks by ransomware groups that give them full administrative control of the servers the product runs on.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-37085, allows attackers who have already gained limited system rights on a targeted server to gain full administrative control of the ESXi hypervisor. Attackers affiliated with multiple ransomware syndicates—including Storm-0506, Storm-1175, Octo Tempest, and Manatee Tempest—have been exploiting the flaw for months in numerous post-compromise attacks, meaning after the limited access has already been gained through other means.</p>

<h2>Admin rights assigned by default</h2>
<p>Full administrative control of the hypervisor gives attackers various capabilities, including encrypting the file system and taking down the servers they host. The hypervisor control can also allow attackers to access hosted virtual machines to either exfiltrate data or expand their foothold inside a network. Microsoft discovered the vulnerability under exploit in the normal course of investigating the attacks and reported it to VMware. VMware parent company Broadcom <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24505">patched</a> the vulnerability on Thursday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039863#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039863&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0jTyLSP-sTM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">"Lower decks! Lower decks!" The fifth season of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> will be the animated series' last (boo!). </p></div>
<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> is a particular favorite among Ars staffers; it's arguably the best of the recent crop of Star Trek shows, along with <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>. So we were disappointed when we learned that the animated series would be ending with its fifth season. Paramount+ debuted the first teaser for S5 during the Star Trek panel at San Diego Comic-Con over the weekend, along with a teaser for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Section_31"><em>Star Trek: Section 31</em></a>—a spinoff film from <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> featuring Michelle Yeoh's Philippa Georgiou—a clip from <em>Strange New Worlds</em> S3, and the latest news about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_television_series#Starfleet_Academy"><em>Star Trek: Starfleet Academy</em></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Lower Decks</em> teaser opens with a suitably nostalgic recap of some of the highlights of the adventures of the plucky crew of the USS <em>Cerritos,</em> inviting viewers to join them for one last adventure. Cue Boimler (Jack Quaid) and Mariner (Tawny Newsome) in voiceover objecting to that description ("Yeah, right, we're not done voyaging—we've hardly even cracked one quadrant yet"). Their S5 mission involves a "quantum fissure" that is causing "space potholes" to pop up all over the Alpha Quadrant ("boo interdimensional portals!"), and the <em>Cerritos</em> crew must close them—while navigating angry Klingons, an Orion war, and who knows what other crazy developments?</p>
<p>The final season of <em>Lower Decks</em> premieres on Paramount+ on October 24, 2024, and will run through December 19.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039676#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039676&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The death of the US government's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is starting to result in disconnection of Internet service for Americans with low incomes. On Friday, Charter Communications reported a net loss of 154,000 Internet subscribers that it said was mostly driven by customers canceling after losing the federal discount. About 100,000 of those subscribers were reportedly getting the discount, which in some cases <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/05/biden-praises-isps-for-price-cuts-even-as-they-sabotage-his-fcc-nominee/">made Internet service free</a> to the consumer.</p>
<p>The $30 monthly broadband discounts provided by the ACP <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/fcc-makes-last-plea-to-congress-as-broadband-discount-program-runs-out-of-cash/">ended in May</a> after Congress failed to allocate more funding. The Biden administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Summary-of-Funding-Request-to-Meet-Critical-Needs.pdf">requested</a> $6 billion to fund the ACP through December 2024, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/republicans-slam-broadband-discounts-for-poor-people-threaten-to-kill-program/">Republicans called</a> the program "wasteful."</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers' main complaint was that most of the ACP money went to households that already had broadband before the subsidy was created. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel warned that killing the discounts would reduce Internet access, <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402286A1.pdf">saying</a> an FCC survey found that 77 percent of participating households would change their plan or drop Internet service entirely once the discounts expired.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039833#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039833&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Although driving is a privilege, some Americans treat it more like a right. This entitlement leads them to get upset with policy proposals that try to increase road safety by prioritizing vulnerable road users over the wants of drivers. But a new study suggests that a common complaint—taking away lanes from cars makes emergency response times go up—about traffic calming isn't actually true.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/the-us-plans-to-reduce-roadway-deaths-with-smarter-road-design/">American roads aren't particularly safe</a>, and while much of the blame of late has been directed at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/higher-vehicle-hoods-significantly-increase-pedestrian-deaths-study-finds/">ever-bigger trucks and SUVs</a>, the problem is more complex than just big cars. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/how-cities-can-stem-the-tide-of-pedestrian-deaths-from-large-cars-and-suvs/">Like the built environment,</a> standard American road design, with a pair of lanes going in either direction, makes it very easy to drive much faster than the speed limit, which is often over 25 mph.</p>

<p>Sometime next year, SpaceX will begin returning its Dragon crew and cargo capsules to splashdowns in the Pacific Ocean and end recoveries of the spacecraft off the coast of Florida.</p>
<p>This will allow SpaceX to make changes to the way it brings Dragons back to Earth and eliminate the risk, however tiny, that a piece of debris from the ship's trunk section might fall on someone and cause damage, injury, or death.</p>
<p>"After five years of splashing down off the coast of Florida, we've decided to shift Dragon recovery operations back to the West Coast," said Sarah Walker, SpaceX's director of Dragon mission management.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039636#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039636&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>California's "Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act" (a.k.a. SB-1047) has led to a flurry of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/361562/california-ai-bill-scott-wiener-sb-1047">headlines</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/15/california-ai-bill-sb-1047-fierce-debate-regulation-safety/">debate</a> concerning the overall "safety" of large artificial intelligence models. But critics are concerned that the bill's overblown focus on existential threats by future AI models could severely limit research and development for more prosaic, non-threatening AI uses today.</p>

<p><a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1047">SB-1047</a>, introduced by State Senator <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/">Scott Wiener</a>, passed the California Senate <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/bipartisan-vote-senate-passes-senator-wieners-landmark-ai-safety-and-innovation-bill">in May</a> with a 32-1 vote and seems well positioned for a final vote in the State Assembly in August. The text of the bill requires companies behind sufficiently large AI models (currently set at $100 million in training costs and the rough computing power implied by those costs today) to put testing procedures and systems in place to prevent and respond to "safety incidents."</p>
<p>The bill lays out a legalistic definition of those safety incidents that in turn focuses on defining a set of "critical harms" that an AI system might enable. That includes harms leading to "mass casualties or at least $500 million of damage," such as "the creation or use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon" (hello, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a>?) or "precise instructions for conducting a cyberattack... on critical infrastructure." The bill also alludes to "other grave harms to public safety and security that are of comparable severity" to those laid out explicitly.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036533#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036533&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the summers of 2018 and 2019, ecologist <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/sustainable-land-management/our-staff/james-ryalls">James Ryalls</a> and his colleagues would go out to a field near Reading in southern England to stare at the insects buzzing around black mustard plants. Each time a bee, hoverfly, moth, butterfly, or <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2021/the-essential-fly">other insect</a> tried to get at the pollen or nectar in the small yellow flowers, they’d make a note.</p>
<p>It was part of an unusual experiment. Some patches of mustard plants were surrounded by pipes that released ozone and nitrogen oxides—polluting gases produced around power plants and conventional cars. Other plots had pipes releasing normal air.</p>
<p>The results startled the scientists. Plants smothered by pollutants were visited by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749122000616">up to 70 percent fewer insects overall, and their flowers received 90 percent fewer visits</a> compared with those in unpolluted plots. The concentrations of pollutants were well below what US regulators consider safe. “We didn’t expect it to be quite as dramatic as that,” says study coauthor <a href="https://staffprofile.unisq.edu.au/Profile/Robbie-Girling">Robbie Girling</a>, an entomologist at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia and a visiting professor at the University of Reading.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039764#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039764&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After SpaceX decided to launch orbital missions of its Starship rocket from Texas about five years ago, the company had to undergo a federal environmental review of the site to ensure it was safe to do so.</p>
<p>As a part of this multi-year process, the Federal Aviation Administration completed a Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment in June 2022. Following that review, SpaceX received approval to conduct up to five Starship launches from South Texas annually.</p>
<p>SpaceX has since launched Starship four times from its launch site in South Texas, known as Starbase, and is planning a fifth launch within the next two months. However, as it continues to test Starship and make plans for regular flights, SpaceX will need a higher flight rate. This is especially true as the company is unlikely to activate additional launch pads for Starship in Florida until at least 2026.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039734#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039734&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Initially announced for iOS 18, Apple Intelligence is expected to launch for the public this fall. Typically, Apple also releases a public beta (the developer one requires a developer account) for new OS updates, but it hasn't announced any specifics about that just yet.</p>
<p>Not all the Apple Intelligence features will be part of this beta. It will include writing tools, like the ability to rewrite, proofread, or summarize text throughout the OS in first-party and most third-party apps. It will also include new Siri improvements, such as moving seamlessly between voice and typing, the ability to follow when you stumble over your words, and maintaining context from one request to the next. (It will not, however, include ChatGPT integration; Apple says that's coming later.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039736#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039736&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe received a much-needed boost this weekend with the box office dominance of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/final-deadpool-and-wolverine-trailer-strikes-a-surprisingly-somber-note/"><em>Deadpool and Wolverin</em>e</a>, which raked in a <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/deadpool-wolverine-box-office-records-1236025175/">record-breaking</a> $438.3 million worldwide and $205 million domestically. And the Marvel panel at this weekend's San Diego Comic-Con kept up the momentum, delighting attendees with sneak peeks of what's to come—most notably the <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/robert-downey-jr-victor-von-doom-avengers-doomsday-1236024873/">return of Robert Downey Jr.</a> to the MCU. The twist: RDJ won't be donning his usual Iron Man suit. Instead, he'll be playing Doctor Doom for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> (2026), with the Russo brothers <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/avengers-russo-brothers-comic-con-1236024839/">returning to direct</a>. This will be followed by the Russo-directed <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em> (2027).</p>
<p>Comic-Con attendees were also treated to exclusive new footage from <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em>, and updates on <em>Thunderbolts</em> and <em>The Fantastic Four</em> reboot, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/">titled <em>First Steps</em></a>, as well as a surprise screening of <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em>.</p>

<p>It's no secret that Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (<em>The Kang Dynasty</em>) around Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror (and associated Variants), introduced in <em>Loki</em> and last year's <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>. But then Majors was convicted of "reckless assault and harassment" (domestic violence), and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the MCU's most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039678#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039678&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple spent a lot of time at its Worldwide Developers Conference this year talking up the new iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 features powered by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/">Apple Intelligence</a>, the brand name Apple is using for various generative AI features. But beta testers still haven't been able to use any of these features for themselves, even though Apple has released four developer beta builds and two public beta builds of all of these updates at this point.</p>
<p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-28/apple-intelligence-to-miss-initial-release-of-upcoming-ios-18-ipados-overhauls">reports</a> that Apple still plans to release a preview of these features this summer, but the Apple Intelligence features will actually be "later than anticipated." Apple Intelligence reportedly won't be ready when the initial versions of these operating systems launch in the fall—usually mid-to-late September—and Apple currently plans to launch them to the general public in an update in October, the report says.</p>

<p>Gurman says that Apple will still have a preview of the Apple Intelligence features available for beta testers this summer as promised. But they'll be available in beta versions of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 updates that will be released and tested separately from the 18.0 updates that are currently available in Apple's developer and public beta programs. (Gurman doesn't specifically mention macOS 15 Sequoia, but hopefully a 15.1 update with the Apple Intelligence features will be available for Macs, too.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039693#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039693&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dropbox is not backup. A portable hard drive is not backup. Real backup, experienced people have told me, starts with <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf">the 3-2-1 rule</a>: three copies, two types of storage (or devices), and one copy is remote.</p>
<p>And yet my data backup system remains precarious. I have tried many schemes, ranging from “pay for Google Drive space and just dump it all there” to “multi-platform rsync/crontab-based headless system I try to build out with help from StackExchange.” I try not to be the person in an informercial, insisting that there must be a better way, but when it comes to backing up music, photos, cloud-based email and files, settings, and more, I am indeed that person. There <i>has</i> to be a better way, and it can’t just be the heavy lift of setting up a Synology NAS, right?</p>
<p>Well, what if Synology itself knew that not everybody is ready to become a self-employed, single-client junior sysadmin? That’s how I think about <a href="https://bee.synology.com/en-me/BeeStation">the BeeStation</a> ($220 as of this writing). It’s just enough backup to be way better than what most people think of as backup (praying that a giant corporation never loses or closes their account), but it’s still just one device. It can also create a pretty smooth ascent to full-on NAS if this little taste of self-directed storage spurs your ambitions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038468#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038468&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An accountant who fills out spreadsheets at the beach, a dog groomer who always has time for one more client, a basketball player who shoots free throws to the point of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Every profession has its share of hard chargers and overachievers. But for some workers—perhaps more than ever in our always-on, always-connected world—the drive to send one more email, clip one more poodle, sink one more shot becomes all-consuming.</p>
<p>Workaholism is a common feature of the modern workplace. A recent review gauging its pervasiveness across occupational fields and cultures <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10643257/">found that roughly 15 percent of workers</a> qualify as workaholics. That adds up to millions of overextended employees around the world who don’t know when—or how, or why—to quit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039521#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039521&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Walnut was born on June 3, 1995, at the start of what would become an unusually hot summer, on an island called Rum (pronounced <em>room</em>), the largest of the Small Isles off the west coast of Scotland. We know this because since 1974, <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-012722-024041">researchers have diligently recorded</a> the births of red deer like her, and caught, weighed and marked every calf they could get their hands on—about 9 out of every 10.</p>
<p>Near the cottage in Kilmory on the northern side of the island where the researchers are based, there has been no hunting since the project began, which allowed the deer to relax and get used to human observers. Walnut was a regular there, grazing the invariably short-clipped grass in this popular spot. “She would always just be there in the group, with her sisters and their families,” says biologist Alison Morris, who has lived on Rum for more than 23 years and studies the deer year-round.</p>
<p>Walnut raised 14 offspring, the last one in 2013, when she was 18 years old. In her later years, Morris recalls, Walnut would spend most of her time away from the herd, usually with Vanity, another female (called a hind) of the same age who had never calved. “They were often seen affectionately grooming each other, and after Walnut died of old age in October 2016, at the age of 21—quite extraordinary for a hind—Vanity spent most of her time alone. She died two years later, at the grand age of 23.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039482#p3">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039482&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>As I mentioned in another recent review, I've been checking out electric hardtail mountain bikes lately. Their relative simplicity compared to full-suspension models tends to allow companies to hit a lower price point without sacrificing much in terms of component quality, potentially opening up mountain biking to people who might not otherwise consider it. The first e-hardtail I checked out, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/aventons-ramblas-an-e-bike-that-offers-a-hard-tail-and-a-solid-ride/">Aventon's Ramblas</a>, fits this description to a T, offering a solid trail riding experience at a price that's competitive with similar offerings from major manufacturers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.velotricbike.com/products/velotric-summit-1?variant=42388148912311">Velotric's Summit 1</a> has a slightly different take on the equation. The company has made a few compromises that allowed it to bring the price down to just under $2,000, which is significantly lower than a lot of the competition. The result is something that's a bit of a step down on some more challenging trails. But it still can do about 90 percent of what most alternatives offer, and it's probably a better all-around bicycle for people who intend to also use it for commuting or errand-running.</p>
<h2>Making the Summit</h2>
<p>Velotric is another e-bike-only company, and we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/no-gimmicks-no-problems-the-low-fuss-reasonably-priced-e-bike/">generally been impressed</a> by its products, which offer a fair bit of value for their price. The Summit 1 seems to be a reworking of its T-series of bikes (which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/velotric-t1-e-bike-review-low-key-and-sleek-yet-powerful-and-fun/">also impressed us</a>) into mountain bike form. You get a similar app experience and integration of the bike into Apple's Find My system, though the company has ditched the thumbprint reader, which is supposed to function as a security measure. Velotric has also done some nice work adapting its packaging to smooth out the assembly process, placing different parts in labeled sub-boxes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038100#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038100&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Early on Saturday morning, at 1:45 am local time, a Falcon 9 rocket soared into orbit from its launch site at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p>By some measures this was an extremely routine mission—it was, after all, SpaceX's 73rd launch of this calendar year. And like many other Falcon 9 launches this year, the "Starlink 10-9" mission carried 23 of the broadband Internet satellites into orbit. However, after a rare failure earlier this month, this particular Falcon 9 rocket was making a return-to-flight for the company and attempting to get the world's most active booster back into service.</p>
<p>And by all measures, it performed. The first stage booster, B-1069, made its 17th flight into orbit before landing on the <em>Just Read the Instructions</em> drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Then, a little more than an hour after liftoff, the rocket's second stage released its payload into a good orbit, from which the Starlink spacecraft will use its on-board thrusters to reach operational altitudes in the coming weeks.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039608#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039608&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved two injectable versions of the blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drug semaglutide (Wegovy and Ozempic). Both come in pre-filled pens with pre-set doses, clear instructions, and information about overdoses. But, given the drugs' daunting prices and supply shortages, many patients are turning to imitations—and those don't always come with the same safety guardrails.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/fda-alerts-health-care-providers-compounders-and-patients-dosing-errors-associated-compounded?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">an alert Friday</a>, the FDA warned that people are overdosing on off-brand injections of semaglutide, which are dispensed from compounding pharmacies in a variety of concentrations, labeled with various units of measurement, administered with improperly sized syringes, and prescribed with bad dosage math. The errors are leading some patients to take up to 20 times the amount of intended semaglutide, the FDA reports.</p>
<p>Though the agency doesn't offer a tally of overdose cases that have been reported, it suggests it has received multiple reports of people sickened by dosing errors, with some requiring hospitalizations. Semaglutide overdoses cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fainting, headache, migraine, dehydration, acute pancreatitis, and gallstones, the agency reports.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039643#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039643&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
