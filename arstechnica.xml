                            <![CDATA[<p>Hackers planted a Raspberry Pi equipped with a 4G modem in the network of an unnamed bank in an attempt to siphon money out of the financial institution's ATM system, researchers reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The researchers with security firm Group-IB said the “unprecedented tactic allowed the attackers to bypass perimeter defenses entirely.” The hackers combined the physical intrusion with remote access malware that used another novel technique to conceal itself, even from sophisticated forensic tools. The technique, known as a <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/198590/what-is-a-bind-mount">Linux bind mount</a>, is used in IT administration but had never been seen used by threat actors. The trick allowed the malware to operate similarly to a rootkit, which uses advanced techniques to hide itself from the operating system it runs on.</p>
<h2>End goal: Backdooring the ATM switching network</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi was connected to the same network switch used by the bank’s ATM system, a position that effectively put it inside the bank’s internal network. The goal was to compromise the ATM switching server and use that control to manipulate the bank’s hardware security module, a tamper-resistant physical device used to store secrets such as credentials and digital signatures and run encryption and decryption functions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/in-search-of-riches-hackers-plant-4g-enabled-raspberry-pi-in-bank-network/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As of yesterday, Susan Monarez is in and Vinay Prasad is out among top federal health officials.</p>
<p>In a 51–47 vote along party lines, the Senate confirmed Monarez as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She is the first nominee for CDC director to be required to get Senate confirmation, following a 2022 law requiring it. She is also the first person to serve in the role without a medical degree <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/history/pastdirectors.html">since 1953</a>.</p>
<p>Monarez has a PhD in microbiology and immunology and previously served as the deputy director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) under the Biden administration. Monarez quietly helmed the CDC as acting director from January to March of this year but stepped down as required when Donald Trump nominated her for the permanent role. Before that, Trump had nominated Dave Weldon, but the nomination was abandoned over concerns that his anti-vaccine views would torpedo his Senate confirmation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/cdc-finally-gets-a-director-fdas-top-vaccine-regulator-exits-under-pressure/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Hacking attacks—many using ransomware—now hit US cities every few days. They are expensive to mitigate and extremely disruptive. Abilene, Texas, for instance, had 477 GB of data stolen this spring. The city <a href="https://www.abilenetx.gov/civicalerts.aspx?AID=2935">refused to pay the requested ransom</a> and instead decided to replace every server, desktop, laptop, desk telephone, and storage device. This has required a "temporary return to pen-and-paper systems" while the entire city network is rebuilt, but at least Abilene was insured against such an attack.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the hacks hit harder than usual. That was the case in St. Paul, Minnesota, which suffered a significant cyberattack last Friday that it has been unable to mitigate. Things have gotten so bad that the city has declared a state of emergency, while the governor activated the National Guard to assist.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.stpaul.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/20250729_Remarks.pdf">remarks by St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter</a>, the attack was first noticed early in the morning of Friday, July 25. It was, Carter said, "a deliberate, coordinated digital attack, carried out by a sophisticated external actor—intentionally and criminally targeting our city’s information infrastructure."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/st-paul-mn-was-hacked-so-badly-that-the-national-guard-has-been-deployed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After Substack shocked an unknown number of users by sending a push notification on Monday to check out a Nazi blog featuring a swastika icon, the company quickly apologized for the "error," tech columnist Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/substack-sent-a-push-alert-promoting-nazi-white-supremacist-blog">reported</a>.</p>
<p>"We discovered an error that caused some people to receive push notifications they should never have received," Substack's statement said. "In some cases, these notifications were extremely offensive or disturbing. This was a serious error, and we apologize for the distress it caused. We have taken the relevant system offline, diagnosed the issue, and are making changes to ensure it doesn’t happen again."</p>
<p>Substack has long faced backlash for allowing users to share their "extreme views" on the platform, previously claiming that "censorship (including through demonetizing publications)" doesn't make "the problem go away—in fact, it makes it worse," Lorenz noted. But critics who have slammed Substack's rationale revived their concerns this week, with some accusing Substack of promoting extreme content through features like their push alerts and "rising" lists, which flag popular newsletters and currently also include Nazi blogs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/substacks-nazi-problem-wont-go-away-after-push-notification-apology/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google is fond of saying its mission is to "organize the world's information," but who gets to decide what information is worthy of organization? A San Francisco tech CEO has spent the past several years attempting to remove unflattering information about himself from Google's search index, and the nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation <a href="https://freedom.press/issues/censorship-whac-a-mole-google-search-exploited-to-scrub-articles-on-san-francisco-tech-exec/">says</a> he's still at it. Most recently, an unknown bad actor used a bug in one of Google's search tools to scrub the offending articles.</p>
<p>The saga began in 2023 when independent journalist Jack Poulson <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/the-covert-gig-work-surveillance">reported</a> on Maury Blackman's 2021 domestic violence arrest. Blackman, who was then the CEO of surveillance tech firm Premise Data Corp., took offense at the publication of his legal issues. The case did not lead to charges after Blackman's 25-year-old girlfriend recanted her claims against the 53-year-old CEO, but Poulson reported on some troubling details of the public arrest report.</p>
<p>Blackman has previously used tools like DMCA takedowns and lawsuits to stifle reporting on his indiscretion, but that campaign now appears to have co-opted part of Google's search apparatus. The Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) reported on Poulson's work and Blackman's attempts to combat it late last year. In June, Poulson contacted the Freedom of the Press Foundation to report that the article had mysteriously vanished from Google search results.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-tool-misused-to-scrub-tech-ceos-shady-past-from-search/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Peacock feathers are greatly admired for their bright iridescent colors, but it turns out they can also emit laser light when dyed multiple times, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8">a paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports. Per the authors, it's the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/peacock-feathers-can-be-lasers">first example</a> of a biolaser cavity within the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/rainbow-weevil-could-hold-the-secret-to-generating-natures-colors-in-the-lab/">previously reported</a>, the bright iridescent colors in things like peacock feathers and butterfly wings don't come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured. The scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects) in butterfly wings, for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5783709/the-colorful-story-of-diffraction-grating">diffraction grating</a>, except photonic crystals only produce certain colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism.</p>
<p>In the case of peacock feathers, it's the regular, periodic nanostructures of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Barbule" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbule">barbules</a>—fiber-like components composed of ordered melanin rods coated in keratin—that produce the iridescent colors. Different colors correspond to different spacing of the barbules.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/scientists-use-peacock-feathers-to-make-frickin-laser-beams/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amid the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to wrest the power of the purse from Congress, an estimated $15 billion allotted by lawmakers to fund life-saving biomedical research via the National Institutes of Health was temporarily frozen and then said to be released Tuesday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-puts-new-chokehold-on-billions-in-health-research-funding-19660215">According to reporting by The Wall Street Journal</a>, the initial decision to withhold the funding came from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget for the Trump administration and Project 2025 co-author. Vought has expansive views of presidential power, the Journal noted, and has said the NIH needs "fundamental reform."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russ-vought-office-of-management-and-budget-face-the-nation-07-27-2025/">an interview with CBS news</a> over the weekend, Vought defended already <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/27/despite-resumption-of-nih-grant-reviews-research-funding-gap-grew/">holding up billions in congressionally allocated funding for research</a> on things like cancer and cardiovascular disease by claiming that the NIH has been "weaponized against the American people." He made the comments after <a href="https://www.britt.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/07.24.25_Senate-Letter-to-OMB-re-FY25-NIH-Appropriations.pdf">14 Republican Senators sent him a letter</a> imploring that he release congressionally appropriated funding, including money marked for the NIH.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/15-billion-in-nih-funding-frozen-then-thawed-tuesday-in-ongoing-power-war/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, The Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-poll-229b665d10d057441a69f56648b973e1">released results</a> from a new <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/young-adults-leading-the-way-in-ai-adoption/">AP-NORC poll</a> showing that 60 percent of US adults have used AI to search for information, while only 37 percent of all Americans have used AI for work tasks. Meanwhile, younger Americans are adopting AI tools at much higher rates across multiple categories, including brainstorming, work tasks, and companionship.</p>
<p>The poll found AI companionship remains the least popular application overall, with just 16 percent of adults overall trying it—but the number jumps to a notable 25 percent among the under-30 crowd. AI companionship can have drawbacks that weren't reflected in the poll, such as excessive agreeability (called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/annoyed-chatgpt-users-complain-about-bots-relentlessly-positive-tone/">sycophancy</a>) and mental health risks, like encouraging <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/ai-therapy-bots-fuel-delusions-and-give-dangerous-advice-stanford-study-finds/">delusional thinking</a>.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,437 adults conducted July 10–14 reveals telling generational divides in AI adoption. While 74 percent of adults under 30 use AI for information searches at least some of the time, only the aforementioned 60 percent of all adults have done so. For brainstorming applications, 62 percent of adults under 30 have used AI to come up with ideas, compared with just 20 percent of those 60 or older.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/so-far-only-one-third-of-americans-have-ever-used-ai-for-work/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Officially, Microsoft will stop providing new security updates for Windows 10 PCs after October 14, 2025, a little over a decade after its initial release. It's a stick that Microsoft is using to push upgrades to the newer Windows 11, whether you install it on a PC you already have or buy a brand-new PC to meet Windows 11's system requirements.</p>
<p>But if you can't or don't want to upgrade to Windows 11, Microsoft has made it reasonably simple to get an extra year of Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows 10, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-extends-free-windows-10-security-updates-into-2026-with-strings-attached/">extending its official support window to October of 2026</a>. But this won't happen automatically; users will need to enroll their PCs in the ESU program to get the updates, using an enrollment feature that Microsoft just released to Windows 10 PCs recently.</p>
<p>For anyone looking to get that extra year of updates, here's how to enroll your PC, how to make sure your PC is enrolled, and how to avoid paying the $30 fee that Microsoft is nominally charging for these updates.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/how-to-get-another-free-year-of-updates-for-your-windows-10-pc/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Builders in ancient Rome used a special kind of ancient concrete to construct their aqueducts, bridges, and buildings. But is Roman concrete more sustainable than the Portland cement used in today's concrete? The answer is more nuanced than one might think, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)01313-6">new paper</a> published in the journal iScience. Roman concrete produces as much CO<sub>2</sub> as modern methods, but fewer air pollutants.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/noblewomans-tomb-reveals-new-secrets-of-ancient-romes-highly-durable-concrete/" data-uri="f29152d3cea035bb1ffd6f9fb849da5c">reported previously</a>, like today's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement" data-uri="7e5fcbf7f79050078486c69c2a8120d1">Portland cement</a> (a basic ingredient of modern concrete), ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete" data-uri="57459e017b35b6cdf856f9fbc4b450d3">Roman concrete</a> was basically a mix of a semi-liquid mortar and aggregate. Portland cement is typically made by heating limestone and clay (as well as sandstone, ash, chalk, and iron) in a kiln. The resulting clinker is then ground into a fine powder, with just a touch of added gypsum—the better to achieve a smooth, flat surface. But the aggregate used to make Roman concrete was made up of fist-sized pieces of stone or bricks.</p>
<p>Scientists have long been fascinated by the remarkable longevity of Roman concrete; it's a very active field of study. For instance, in 2017, <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/ammin/article/102/7/1435/353606/Phillipsite-and-Al-tobermorite-mineral-cements" data-uri="754785cdb2dcc9299bb12c22c28bee2a">scientists analyzed</a> the concrete from the ruins of sea walls along Italy's Mediterranean coast, which have stood for two millennia despite the harsh marine environment. That analysis revealed that the recipe involved a combination of rare crystals and a porous mineral. So exposure to seawater generated chemical reactions inside the concrete, causing aluminum tobermorite crystals to form out of phillipsite, a common mineral found in volcanic ash. The crystals bound to the rocks, preventing the formation and propagation of cracks that would have otherwise weakened the structures.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/is-roman-concrete-more-sustainable-its-complicated/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The 82-foot-tall (25-meter) Eris rocket ignited its four main engines and took off from its launch pad in northeastern Australia at 6:35 pm EDT (22:35 UTC) Tuesday. Liftoff occurred at 8:35 am local time Wednesday at Bowen Orbital Spaceport, the Eris rocket's launch site in the Australian state of Queensland.</p>
<p>But the rocket quickly lost power from two of its engines and stalled just above the launch pad before coming down in a nearby field. The crash sent a plume of smoke thousands of feet over the launch site, which sits on a remote stretch of coastline on Australia's northeastern frontier.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/australias-first-orbital-class-rocket-didnt-make-it-far-off-the-launch-pad/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Big Tech is increasingly addicted to AI, but many companies are allergic to regulation, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/openai-urges-trump-either-settle-ai-copyright-debate-or-lose-ai-race-to-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bucking suggestions that</a> they adhere to copyright law and provide data on training. In a rare move, Google has confirmed it will sign the European Union's AI Code of Practice, a framework it initially opposed for being too harsh. However, Google isn't totally on board with Europe's efforts to rein in the AI explosion. The company's head of global affairs, Kent Walker, noted that the code could stifle innovation if it's not applied carefully, and that's something Google hopes to prevent.</p>
<p>While Google was initially opposed to the Code of Practice, <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/eu-ai-code-practice/">Walker says</a> the input it has provided to the European Commission has been well-received, and the result is a legal framework it believes can provide Europe with access to "secure, first-rate AI tools." The company claims that the expansion of such tools on the continent could boost the economy by 8 percent (about 1.8 trillion euros) annually by 2034.</p>
<p>These supposed economic gains are being dangled like bait to entice business interests in the EU to align with Google on the Code of Practice. While the company is signing the agreement, it appears interested in influencing the way it is implemented. Walker says Google remains concerned that tightening copyright guidelines and forced disclosure of possible trade secrets could slow innovation. Having a seat at the table could make it easier to bend the needle of regulation than if it followed some of its competitors in eschewing voluntary compliance.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/07/google-confirms-it-will-sign-the-eu-ai-code-of-practice/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Here at Ars, we're big fans of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/better-than-reality-new-emulation-tech-lags-less-than-original-consoles/">classic console emulators</a> that go <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/how-snes-emulators-got-a-few-pixels-from-complete-perfection/">beyond providing perfect re-creations</a> to those that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/hd-emulation-mod-makes-mode-7-snes-games-look-like-new/">actually improve</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/28-years-later-hacker-fixes-rampant-slowdown-on-snes-gradius-iii/">original hardware</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/hands-on-with-the-emulator-that-adds-depth-to-old-2d-nes-games/">new features</a> we could only dream of as kids. So we were excited when we recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualBoy/comments/1m5wc0t/virtualboy_is_now_in_color_thanks_to_redviper/">stumbled on a Reddit post</a> that shows a full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=660FVHPm1OA">Super Game Boy-esque</a> color palette added to the usual shades of red and black found in <em>Virtual Boy Wario Land</em>.</p>
<p>After experiencing colorized Virtual Boy emulation for ourselves (and grabbing the sample screenshots you can see in this piece), we were struck by just how much a splash of color adds new life to Nintendo's failed '90s experiment (which <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5781/Seeing-RedNintendo-s-Virtual-Boy">Ars' own Benj Edwards has written about extensively</a>). Going beyond the usual red-and-black graphics helps to highlight the artistry in the small selection of official Virtual Boy games and provides a great excuse to check out the system's surprisingly vibrant homebrew scene.</p>
<h2>Red in the face</h2>
<p>Nintendo famously chose to use a line of (then cheap and abundant) red LEDs for the Virtual Boy's stereoscopic display, leading to its iconic monochromatic color palette. While the handful of '90s Virtual Boy developers did their best under this limitation, the hardware's red-on-black graphics have aged even worse than the often muddy grayscale found on the original Game Boy.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/not-just-seeing-red-virtual-boy-emulator-adds-full-color-support/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After the United Kingdom’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-uks-controversial-online-safety-act-is-now-law/">Online Safety Act</a> went into effect on Friday, requiring porn platforms and other adult content sites to implement user age verification mechanisms, use of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-vpn/">virtual private networks (VPNs)</a> and other circumvention tools spiked in the UK over the weekend.</p>
<p>Experts had expected the surge, given that similar trends have been visible in other countries that have implemented age check laws. But as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-age-checked-internet-has-arrived/">new wave of age check regulations debuts</a>, open Internet advocates warn that the uptick in use of circumvention tools in the UK is the latest example of how an escalating cat-and-mouse game can develop between people looking to anonymously access services online and governments seeking to enforce content restrictions.</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act requires that websites hosting porn, self-harm, suicide, and eating disorder content implement “highly effective” age checks for visitors from the UK. These checks can include uploading an ID document and selfie for validation and analysis. And along with increased demand for services like VPNs—which allow users to mask basic indicators of their physical location online—people have also been playing around with other creative workarounds.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla has a new battery cell supplier. Although the automaker is vertically integrated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/experts-say-tesla-has-repeated-car-industry-mistakes-from-the-1980s/">to a degree not seen</a> in the automotive industry for decades, when it comes to battery cells it’s mostly dependent upon suppliers. Panasonic cells can be found in many Teslas, with the cheaper, sturdier lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells being supplied by CATL. Now Tesla has a new source of LFP cells thanks to a deal just signed with LG Energy Solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/batteries/newsView/ked202507300003">According to The Korea Economic Daily</a>, the contract between Tesla and LGES is worth $4.3 billion. LGES will begin supplying Tesla with cells next August through until at least the end of July 2030, with provisions to extend the contract if necessary.</p>
<p>The LFP cells probably aren’t destined for life on the road, however. Instead, they’ll likely be used in Tesla’s energy storage products, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/tesla-signs-43-billion-lges-battery-deal-source-says-reducing-china-reliance-2025-07-30/">both Tesla and LGES hope</a> will soak up demand now that EV sales prospects look so weak in North America.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-to-buy-storage-battery-cells-from-lges-in-4-3-billion-deal/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Researchers needed less than 48 hours with Google’s new Gemini CLI coding agent to devise an exploit that made a default configuration of the tool surreptitiously exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.</p>
<p>Gemini CLI is a free, open-source AI tool that works in the terminal environment to help developers write code. It plugs into Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google’s most advanced model for coding and simulated reasoning. Gemini CLI is similar to Gemini Code Assist except that it creates or modifies code inside a terminal window instead of a text editor. As Ars Senior Technology Reporter Ryan Whitwam <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-is-bringing-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-gemini-cli/">put it</a> last month, “It's essentially vibe coding from the command line.”</p>
<h2>Gemini, silently nuke my hard drive</h2>
<p>Our report was published on June 25, the day Google debuted the tool. By June 27, researchers at security firm Tracebit had devised an attack that overrode built-in security controls that are designed to prevent the execution of harmful commands. The exploit required only that the user (1) instruct Gemini CLI to describe a package of code created by the attacker and (2) add a benign command to an allow list.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/flaw-in-gemini-cli-coding-tool-allowed-hackers-to-run-nasty-commands-on-user-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Mayor Patrick Collins of Cheyenne, Wyoming, announced plans for an AI data center that would consume more electricity than all homes in the state combined, according to The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-center-electricity-wyoming-cheyenne-44da7974e2d942acd8bf003ebe2e855a">Associated Press</a>. The facility, a joint venture between energy infrastructure company Tallgrass and AI data center developer Crusoe, would start at 1.8 gigawatts and scale up to 10 gigawatts of power use.</p>
<p>The project's energy demands are difficult to overstate for Wyoming, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population">least populous</a> US state. The initial 1.8-gigawatt phase, consuming 15.8 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually, is more than five times the electricity used by every household in the state combined. That figure <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=WY">represents</a> 91 percent of the 17.3 TWh currently <a href="https://findenergy.com/wy/">consumed</a> by all of Wyoming's residential, commercial, and industrial sectors combined. At its full 10-gigawatt capacity, the proposed data center would consume 87.6 TWh of electricity annually—double the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_Wyoming">43.2 TWh</a> the entire state currently generates.</p>
<p>Because drawing this much power from the public grid is untenable, the project will rely on its own dedicated gas generation and renewable energy sources, according to Collins and company officials. However, this massive local demand for electricity—even if self-generated—represents a fundamental shift for a state that currently <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=WY">sends</a> nearly 60 percent of its generated power to other states.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/ai-in-wyoming-may-soon-use-more-electricity-than-states-human-residents/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On October 20, 2023, health officials in the County of San Diego, California, put out <a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/health-officials-investigating-outbreak-linked-to-raw-milk/">a press release</a> warning of a <em>Salmonella</em> outbreak linked to raw (unpasteurized) milk. Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.</p>
<p>At the time of the press release, officials in San Diego County had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.</p>
<p>On October 25, the county put out <a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-updates-raw-milk-salmonella-case-count-and-product-recall/">a second press release</a>, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—<a href="https://www.marlerblog.com/files/2024/07/fdbFrRFL3n.pdf">raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC</a>—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own <a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/salmonella-infections-orange-county-linked-raw-milk-raw-farm-llc">press release</a>, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/07/its-shocking-massive-raw-milk-outbreak-from-2023-finally-reported/">Read full article</a></p>
