                            <![CDATA[<p>You can't spot a hedgehog from space, but you might be able to find where they live by looking for brambles. That's the premise behind <a href="https://toao.com/blog/can-we-really-see-brambles-from-space">ongoing research</a> at the University of Cambridge, where scientists are using satellite imagery and AI models to map potential hedgehog habitats across the UK by first identifying their favorite hiding spots: bramble patches.</p>
<p>European hedgehog populations have <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2022/february/britains-rural-hedgehogs-see-dramatic-population-decline.html">declined</a> by roughly 30 to 50 percent over the past decade, so tracking these nocturnal creatures across large areas remains difficult and expensive. Rather than searching for the hedgehogs directly, researcher Gabriel Mahler developed an AI model that identifies brambles, which are thorny shrubs that hedgehogs use for shelter and foraging, from satellite data.</p>
<p>These small mammals rely on this type of dense vegetation for daytime shelter, nesting sites, and protection from predators. Brambles also attract insects and provide berries, supporting the invertebrate populations that hedgehogs eat.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/can-ai-detect-hedgehogs-from-space-maybe-if-you-find-brambles-first/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>She told doctors that for the past month she had developed severe nausea, non-bloody vomiting, and pain she described as a burning feeling that spread from her upper abdomen, through her right side, and around to her back. Nothing she did made it better.</p>
<p>The doctors started collecting her medical history, which was lengthy. The woman had Type 2 diabetes, Stage 2 chronic kidney disease, opioid use disorder, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), among other conditions. While she was taking many medications, she noted that for the past year she had also been taking semaglutide, a GLP-1 weight-loss drug, and had lost about 40 pounds (over 19 percent of her body weight).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/woman-hospitalized-with-pain-and-vomiting-a-diet-soda-cured-her/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>LG is looking to create a new market: TVs for senior citizens. However, I can't help thinking that the answer for a TV that truly prioritizes the needs of older people is much simpler—and cheaper.</p>
<p>On Thursday, LG announced the Easy TV in South Korea, aiming it at the “senior TV market,” according to a Google translation of the <a href="https://live.lge.co.kr/2509-lg-easytv/">press release</a>. One of the features that LG has included in attempts to appeal to this demographic is a remote control with numbers. Many remotes for smart TVs, streaming sticks, and boxes don’t have numbered buttons, with much of the controller's real estate dedicated to other inputs.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Video game mega-publisher Electronic Arts is planning to take the company private in a deal that could be worth as much as $50 billion, according to reports from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/electronic-arts-nears-roughly-50-billion-deal-go-private-wsj-reports-2025-09-26/">Reuters</a>, and <a>Financial Times</a>.</p>
<p>All three outlets cite anonymous sources in reporting that the deal could be announced next week, with Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners reportedly interested in investing. The Wall Street Journal says the move "would likely be the largest leveraged buyout ever."</p>
<p>The Saudi PIF already had a roughly 9 percent stake in EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-to-transfer-its-gaming-stock-to-savvy-games-group">as of a year ago</a>, making it one of the largest shareholders in the company.

                            <![CDATA[<p>YouTube has a new Labs program, allowing listeners to "discover the next generation of YouTube." In case you were wondering, that generation is apparently all about AI. The streaming site says Labs will offer a glimpse of the AI features it's developing for YouTube Music, and it starts with AI "hosts" that will chime in while you're listening to music. Yes, really.</p>
<p>The new AI music hosts are supposed to provide a richer listening experience, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-youtube-labs/">according to YouTube</a>. As you're listening to tunes, the AI will generate audio snippets similar to, but shorter than, the fake podcasts you can create in NotebookLM. The "Beyond the Beat" host will break in every so often with relevant stories, trivia, and commentary about your musical tastes. YouTube says this feature will appear when you are listening to mixes and radio stations.</p>
<p>The experimental feature is intended to be a bit like having a radio host drop some playful banter while cueing up the next song. It sounds a bit like <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-22/spotify-debuts-a-new-ai-dj-right-in-your-pocket/">Spotify's AI DJ,</a> but the YouTube AI doesn't create playlists like Spotify's robot. This is still generative AI, which comes with the risk of hallucinations and low-quality slop, neither of which belongs in your music. That said, Google's Audio Overviews are often surprisingly good in small doses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/youtube-music-is-testing-ai-hosts-that-will-interrupt-your-tunes/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Conservative broadcaster Sinclair is putting <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> back on the air. In a <a href="https://sbgi.net/sinclair-statement-on-the-return-of-jimmy-kimmel-live/">statement</a> today, Sinclair said it will end its preemption of the show on its ABC affiliates starting tonight, even though ABC and owner Disney haven't accepted its request for an ombudsman and other changes.</p>
<p>Facing the threat of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/09/25/some-groups-that-advertise-with-nexstar-and-sinclair-are-pausing-their-ads">lost advertising dollars</a>, Sinclair said it "received thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives." Nexstar separately announced an end to its blackout of Kimmel shortly after this article published.</p>
<p>Sinclair said its decision to preempt Kimmel "was independent of any government interaction or influence." Sinclair's preempting of Kimmel last week came just as Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">said</a> TV station owners that didn't preempt the show could lose their FCC licenses.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/sinclair-gets-nothing-it-asked-for-puts-jimmy-kimmel-back-on-anyway/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While most people don't spend a lot of time thinking about the keys they tap all day, mechanical keyboard enthusiasts certainly do. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/keyboard-diying-is-moving-outside-hobbyist-circles-and-thats-a-good-thing/">interest in DIY keyboards expands</a>, there are plenty of things to obsess over, such as keycap sets, layout, knobs, and switches. But you have to get deep into the hobby before you realize there's something more important than all that: the stabilizers.</p>
<p>Even if you have the fanciest switches and a monolithic aluminum case, bad stabilizers can make a keyboard feel and sound like garbage. Luckily, there's a growing ecosystem of weirdly fancy stabilizers that can upgrade your typing experience, packing an impressive amount of innovation into a few tiny bits of plastic and metal.</p>
<h2>What is a stabilizer, and why should you care?</h2>
<p>Most keys on a keyboard are small enough that they go up and down evenly, no matter where you press. That's not the case for longer keys: Space, Enter, Shift, Backspace, and, depending on the layout, a couple more on the number pad. These keys have wire assemblies underneath called stabilizers, which help them go up and down when the switch does.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/you-should-care-more-about-the-stabilizers-in-your-mechanical-keyboard-heres-why/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An Ebola outbreak in a southwestern province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is escalating quickly, as some health responders say they have less than a tenth of the funding needed to contain the deadly disease.</p>
<p>The first case was identified in <a href="https://cosamed.org/blog/detail/detection-of-suspected-cases-of-viral-hemorrhagic-fever-in-kasai">a 34-year-old pregnant woman</a> on August 20, when she sought care at a local hospital in the Kasai province for fever, bloody vomiting, and hemorrhages. She died on August 25. Officials declared an outbreak on September 4, when the case tally was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-a42c28f0c8c1a4d8cecca5072b392593">up to 28 with 15 deaths</a>. As of this week, there have been <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/publication/who-ebola-situation-report-drc-25-02-21-september-2025">at least 57 cases and 35 deaths</a>—a 61 percent fatality rate, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>Officials in DR Congo are struggling to respond to the outbreak, which is in a province known for its poor road networks, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-who-funding-usaid-8aac166927249acf58a75abe859f56a2">according to reporting by The Associated Press</a>. Treating Ebola can require extensive resources, including protective equipment, medicines, and transportation to reach remote areas. Health facilities in the area of the outbreak are already overwhelmed and quickly running low on critical resources, including clean water and protective equipment. The only treatment center in the epicenter of the outbreak, the Bulape health zone, is at 119 percent capacity, the AP reported, citing information from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Africa (IFRC).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/ebola-outbreak-in-dr-congo-rages-with-61-death-rate-and-funding-running-dry/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"Everyone is going to be treated fairly," the president added—seemingly covering his tracks as critics warn that TikTok under US ownership could soon carry a right-wing bias, perhaps going the way of Twitter after Elon Musk took over and rebranded it as X.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Trump told Fox News that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the CEO of Fox Corporation, would likely be part of the investor group taking over TikTok's US operations. That deal—which Trump claimed Thursday was tentatively approved by Chinese President Xi Jinping—was set up to ensure that TikTok complies with a law banning majority ownership of the app by a foreign adversary in order to protect Americans from spying or foreign influence on the algorithm.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/trump-says-tiktok-should-be-tweaked-to-become-100-maga/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Most guns are tools for doing harm, but a team of American and Korean scientists has developed one that does the opposite, helping to patch up bone injuries. It comes a bit short of the Medigun from <em>Team Fortress 2</em> or Ana’s Biotic Rifle, which featured in <em>Overwatch</em>. But it’s probably one of the first shots we have at making healing guns real.</p>
<h2>3D printing on the fly</h2>
<p>In more complex bone problems like severe, irregular fractures or resections done as part of bone cancer treatment, the bone won’t heal on its own. The most common means of stabilizing the injured site and making recovery possible is metal-based grafts, implants usually made with titanium alloys.</p>
<p>The problem with such implants is that they are difficult and expensive to manufacture, and it’s very hard to make them patient-specific. “3D printing has been highlighted as a novel approach to make such personalized implants, but this also requires substantial time and money,” said Jung Seung Lee, a biomedical engineering researcher at the Sungkyunkwan University in Korea. So his team wanted to find a way to make bone implants that would be faster and cheaper than a 3D printer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/scientists-want-to-treat-complex-bone-fractures-with-a-bone-healing-gun/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/improving-oversight-of-federal-grantmaking/">issued an executive order</a> asserting political control over grant funding, including all federally supported research. In general, the executive order inserts a layer of political control over both the announcement of new funding opportunities and the approval of individual grants. Now, a coalition of more than 50 scientific and medical organizations is firing back, <a href="https://aas.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/Grantmaking%20Executive%20Order%20-%20Multi%20Society%20Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issuing a letter</a> to the US Congress expressing grave concerns over the order's provisions and urging Congress to protect the integrity of what has long been an independent, merit-based, peer-review system for awarding federal grants.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/new-executive-order-puts-all-grants-under-political-control/">previously reported</a>, the order requires that any announcement of funding opportunities be reviewed by the head of the agency or someone they designate, which means a political appointee will have the ultimate say over what areas of science the US funds. Individual grants will also require clearance from a political appointee and "must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President’s policy priorities."</p>
<p>The order also instructs agencies to formalize the ability to cancel previously awarded grants at any time if they're considered "no longer advance agency priorities." Until a system is in place to enforce the new rules, agencies are forbidden from starting new funding programs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/50-scientific-societies-sign-letter-objecting-to-trump-executive-order/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft and Asus revealed the ROG Xbox Ally handheld PC gaming line <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">in June</a> and promised an October 16 launch date <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/asus-and-microsofts-xbox-handhelds-arrive-october-16-but-pricing-remains-a-mystery/">in August</a>. But they waited all the way until Thursday night to reveal preorder pricing set at $599.99 for the base ROG Xbox Ally hardware and a whopping $999.99 for the souped-up ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>
<p>Those prices put the baseline ROG Xbox Ally units in the same general price tier as competition like Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">Steam Deck OLED</a>, Lenovo's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">Legion Go S</a>, and even Nintendo's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-the-ars-technica-review/">Switch 2</a>. But the higher-grade ROG Xbox Ally X is significantly more expensive than almost all competing gaming handhelds, thanks in part to components like a Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/all-about-neural-processing-units-npus-e77a5637-7705-4915-96c8-0c6a975f9db4">an NPU</a> that Asus says will ensure it is ready for a future when "AI enhancements" are rolling out in new games.</p>
<p>That may seem like overkill when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/steamdecktopplayed"><em>Steam Deck</em> users seem content</a> using their handheld mainly for low-end games like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Hades</em>. But Asus said that, in pre-release hardware tests, the ROG Xbox Ally X gets "up to a 30% performance boost" over 2024's ROG Ally X on high-end games like <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. The newer hardware also gets "up to twice the battery life" over the ROG Ally X on a game like <em>Hollow Knight Silksong</em>, Asus said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/ready-for-a-1000-handheld-gaming-pc-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-set-to-find-out/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.12 of the Rocket Report! We often hear from satellite operators<span class="s1">—from the military to venture-backed startups</span><span class="s1">—about their appetite for more launch capacity. With so many rocket launches happening around the world, some might want to dismiss these statements as a corporate plea for more competition, and therefore lower prices. SpaceX is on pace to launch more than 150 times this year. China could end the year with more than 70 orbital launches. These are staggering numbers compared to global launch rates just a few years ago. But I'm convinced there's room for more alternatives for reliable (and reusable) rockets. All of the world's planned mega-constellations will need immense launch capacity just to get off the ground, and if successful, they'll go into regular replacement and replenishment cycles. Throw in the still-undefined Golden Dome missile shield and many nations' desire for a sovereign launch capability, and it's easy to see the demand curve going up.</span></p>

<p><b>Sharp words from Astra’s Chris Kemp. </b>Chris Kemp, the chief executive officer of Astra, apparently didn't get the memo about playing nice with his competitors in the launch business. Kemp made some spicy remarks at the Berkeley Space Symposium 2025 earlier this month, billed as the largest undergraduate aerospace event at the university (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLCf88Qw8wc">see video of the talk</a>). During the speech, Kemp periodically deviated from building up Astra to hurling insults at several of his competitors in the launch industry, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/astras-chris-kemp-woke-up-one-recent-morning-and-chose-violence/">Ars reports</a>. To be fair to Kemp, some of his criticisms are not without a kernel of truth. But they are uncharacteristically rough all the same, especially given Astra's uneven-at-best launch record and financial solvency to date.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/rocket-report-keeping-up-with-kuiper-new-glenns-second-flight-slips/">Read full article</a></p>

Now the company is leaning into that even more with the Raspberry Pi 500+, an amped-up version of the keyboard computer with 16GB of RAM instead of 8GB, a 256GB NVMe SSD instead of microSD storage, and a fancier keyboard with mechanical switches, replaceable keycaps, and individually programmable RGB LEDs.</p>
<p>The computer is <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-500-plus/">currently available to purchase</a> from the usual suspects like CanaKit and Micro Center, and generally starts at $200, twice the price of the Pi 500.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In late 2017, a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809">study</a> by Krefeld Entomological Society looked at protected areas across Germany and discovered that two-thirds of the insect populations living in there had vanished over the last 25 years. The results spurred the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html">media</a> to declare we’re living through an “insect apocalypse,” but the reasons behind their absence were unclear. Now, a joint team of Japanese and Australian scientists have completed a new, multi-year study designed to get us some answers.</p>
<h2>Insect microcosm</h2>
<p>“In our work, we focused on ants because we have systematic ways for collecting them,” says Alexander Mikheyev, an evolutionary biologist at the Australian National University. “They are also a group with the right level of diversity, where you have enough species to do comparative studies.” Choosing the right location, he explained, was just as important. “We did it in Fiji, because Fiji had the right balance between isolation—which gave us a discrete group of animals to study—but at the same time was diverse enough to make comparisons,” Mikheyev adds.</p>
<p>Thus, the Fijian archipelago, with its 330 islands, became the model the team used to get some insights into insect population dynamics. A key difference from the earlier study was that Mikheyev and his colleagues could look at those populations across thousands of years, not just the last 25.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/fijis-ants-might-be-the-canary-in-the-coal-mine-for-the-insect-apocalypse/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Multiple whistleblowers alleged that DOGE uploaded a highly sensitive Social Security Administration (SSA) database to an unmonitored cloud environment, according to a <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/DOGE_REPORT_FINAL_7.pdf">report</a> by Senate Democratic staff. The staff report describes an investigation into DOGE activities at three agencies, including a site visit at the General Services Administration (GSA) in which DOGE officials appeared to be hiding certain areas from view.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/doge-accused-of-copying-entire-social-security-database-to-insecure-cloud-system/">reported last month,</a> then-SSA Chief Data Officer Chuck Borges alleged that DOGE officials created "a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight." At least one other whistleblower has apparently made the same allegation.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers, including Borges, alleged "that Edward Coristine, the 19-year-old DOGE staffer who was previously fired from a job for leaking company data to a competitor, and other DOGE personnel had been granted permission to move highly sensitive SSA data into an unmonitored cloud environment," the Senate Democratic report said. "The whistleblowers said that DOGE has uploaded a live copy of NUMIDENT, which contains highly sensitive personal data on anyone who has held a Social Security number, including every American. This includes Social Security numbers (SSNs), place and date of birth, work permit status, and parents' names, among other sensitive personal information, for all Americans, to a cloud environment."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/senate-staff-probes-doge-finds-locked-doors-and-windows-covered-with-trash-bags/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>On Thursday, NASA, confirming <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/is-the-dream-chaser-space-plane-ever-going-to-launch-into-orbit/">an earlier</a><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/is-the-dream-chaser-space-plane-ever-going-to-launch-into-orbit/"> Ars Technica</a><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/is-the-dream-chaser-space-plane-ever-going-to-launch-into-orbit/"> report</a>, said the first flight of the winged spacecraft will no longer berth with the International Space Station. Rather, the space agency said, the Dream Chaser program would be "best served" by a free flight demonstration.</p>
<p>"Development of new space transportation systems is difficult and can take longer than what’s originally planned," said Dana Weigel, manager of NASA's International Space Station Program, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/nasa-sierra-space-modify-commercial-resupply-services-contract/">in a news release</a>. "As NASA and its partners look toward space station deorbit in 2030, this mutually agreed to decision enables testing and verification to continue on Dream Chaser, as well as demonstrating the capabilities of the spaceplane for future resupply missions in low Earth orbit."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/sierras-dream-chaser-is-starting-to-resemble-a-nightmare/">Read full article</a></p>

I thought it was hilarious; my aging and extremely "proper" great aunt—God rest her soul—did not, and at one Thanksgiving dinner, she let me know. Chastened, I never used a whoopee cushion again. Nor, as the decades passed, did I think much more about the possible humor value of fake farts.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After the posting—and apparent editing—of a job opening spotted this week, it's expected that Amazon will bring its homegrown operating system to Fire TV devices this year.</p>
<p>Most of Amazon’s Fire-branded devices, which include tablets, currently run some version of Fire OS, which is an Android fork based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). For years, Fire OS’s reliance on AOSP has resulted in Amazon devices coming out with older software, such as 2024’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVDN4QS6">Amazon Fire HD 8</a> tablet, which came out with Fire OS 8, which is <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tablets/fire-os-8.html#:~:text=Fire%20OS%208%20incorporates%20updates%20from%20Android,(API%2029)%20and%20Android%2011%20(API%2030).">based on</a> 2020’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/android-11-the-ars-technica-review/">Android 11</a>.</p>
<p>Some devices already run Amazon’s proprietary software, reportedly codenamed Vega OS. The current <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/amazon-echo-hub-vega-os">Echo Hub</a> smart home control panel, <a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2023-11/amazon-vega-os/">Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen)</a> smart home display, and <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-charges-ahead-with-its-in-house-vega-os-on-yet-another-new-device/">Echo Spot</a> smart speaker all run an OS based on the Linux 5.16 kernel, per details in Amazon’s <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/amazon-echo-hub-vega-os">source code notice</a> for Alexa devices. However, Amazon has never publicly acknowledged that the OS exists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/amazon-fire-tv-devices-expected-to-ditch-android-for-linux-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>
