                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Adobe <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/2024/10/101424-adobe-launches-firefly-video-model">announced</a> Firefly Video Model, a new AI-powered text-to-video generation tool that can create novel videos from written prompts. It joins similar offerings from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/we-made-a-cat-drink-a-beer-with-runways-ai-video-generator-and-it-sprouted-hands/">Runway</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/google-unveils-veo-a-high-definition-ai-video-generator-that-may-rival-sora/">Google</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/metas-new-movie-gen-ai-system-can-deepfake-video-from-a-single-photo/">Meta</a> in an increasingly crowded field. Unlike the competition, Adobe claims that Firefly Video Model is trained exclusively on licensed content, potentially sidestepping ethical and copyright issues that have plagued other generative AI tools.</p>
<p>Because of its licensed training data roots, Adobe calls <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly/features/ai-video-generator.html">Firefly Video Model</a> "the first publicly available video model designed to be commercially safe." However, the San Jose, California-based software firm hasn't announced a general release date, and during a beta test period, it's only granting access to people on a waiting list.</p>

<p>In the works since at least <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/adobe-teases-generative-ai-video-tools/">April 2023</a>, the new model builds off of techniques Adobe developed for its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ethical-ai-art-generation-adobe-firefly-may-be-the-answer/">Firefly</a> image synthesis models. Like its text-to-image generator, which the company later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/adobe-photoshops-new-generative-fill-ai-tool-lets-you-manipulate-photos-with-text/">integrated</a> into Photoshop, Adobe hopes to aim Firefly Video Model at media professionals, such as video creators and editors. The company claims its model can produce footage that blends seamlessly with traditionally created video content.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/adobe-unveils-ai-video-generator-trained-on-licensed-content/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>For a while now, companies like OpenAI and Google have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">touting advanced "reasoning" capabilities</a> as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/google-ai-earns-silver-medal-equivalent-at-international-mathematical-olympiad/">the next big step</a> in their latest artificial intelligence models. Now, though, a new study from six Apple engineers shows that the mathematical "reasoning" displayed by advanced large language models can be extremely brittle and unreliable in the face of seemingly trivial changes to common benchmark problems.</p>
<p>The fragility highlighted in these new results helps support previous research suggesting that LLMs use of probabilistic pattern matching is missing the formal understanding of underlying concepts needed for truly reliable mathematical reasoning capabilities. "Current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning," the researchers hypothesize based on these results. "Instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data."</p>
<h2>Mix it up</h2>
<p>In "GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models"—currently available <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229">as a pre-print paper</a>—the six Apple researchers start with <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k">GSM8K's standardized set of over 8,000 grade-school level mathematical word problems</a>, which is <a href="https://klu.ai/glossary/GSM8K-eval">often used as a benchmark</a> for modern LLMs' complex reasoning capabilities. They then take the novel approach of modifying a portion of that testing set to dynamically replace certain names and numbers with new values—so a question about Sophie getting 31 building blocks for her nephew in GSM8K could become a question about Bill getting 19 building blocks for his brother in the new GSM-Symbolic evaluation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/llms-cant-perform-genuine-logical-reasoning-apple-researchers-suggest/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A New York judge recently called out an expert witness for using Microsoft's Copilot chatbot to inaccurately estimate damages in a real estate dispute that partly depended on an accurate assessment of damages to win.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2024/2024-ny-slip-op-24258.html">order</a> Thursday, judge Jonathan Schopf warned that "due to the nature of the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and its inherent reliability issues" that any use of AI should be disclosed before testimony or evidence is admitted in court. Admitting that the court "has no objective understanding as to how Copilot works," Schopf suggested that the legal system could be disrupted if experts started overly relying on chatbots en masse.</p>
<p>His warning came after an expert witness, Charles Ranson, dubiously used Copilot to cross-check calculations in a dispute over a $485,000 rental property in the Bahamas that had been included in a trust for a deceased man's son. The court was being asked to assess if the executrix and trustee—the deceased man's sister—breached her fiduciary duties by delaying the sale of the property while admittedly using it for personal vacations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-confronts-expert-witness-who-used-copilot-to-fake-expertise/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Ward Christensen, co-inventor of the computer bulletin board system (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/my-secret-life-as-an-11-year-old-bbs-sysop/">BBS</a>), died at age 78 in Rolling Meadows, Illinois. Christensen, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Suess">Randy Suess</a>, created the first BBS in Chicago in 1978, leading to an important cultural era of digital community-building that presaged much of our online world today.</p>

<p>Friends and associates remember Christensen as humble and unassuming, a quiet innovator who never sought the spotlight for his groundbreaking work. Despite creating one of the foundational technologies of the digital age, Christensen maintained a low profile throughout his life, content with his long-standing career at IBM and showing no bitterness or sense of missed opportunity as the Internet age dawned.</p>
<p>"Ward was the quietest, pleasantest, gentlest dude," said <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/"><em>BBS: The Documentary</em></a> creator Jason Scott in a conversation with Ars Technica. Scott documented Christensen's work extensively in a 2002 interview for that project. "He was exactly like he looks in his pictures," he said, "like a groundskeeper who quietly tends the yard."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/ward-christensen-bbs-inventor-and-architect-of-our-online-age-dies-at-age-78/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Internet Archive has brought its Wayback Machine back online "in a provisional, read-only manner" as it continues to recover from attacks that took the site down last week, founder Brewster Kahle said in a <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1845688309085065571">post</a> last night. The <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> home page points users to the now-functional <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> but notes that other Internet Archive services are temporarily offline.</p>
<p>Kahle said it was "safe to resume" the Wayback Machine's operations, but that it "might need further maintenance, in which case it will be suspended again." The Wayback Machine's "Save Page Now" feature that lets users capture a webpage manually is currently unavailable. The related <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">openlibrary.org</a> book-preservation website was still offline today.</p>
<p>Founded in 1996, the nonprofit Internet Archive <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/wayback-machine-general-information/">crawls the web</a> to preserve pages that are publicly available and has captured 916 billion web pages so far. It has a <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/where-does-my-donation-go/">staff of 150 people</a> and also provides free access to many videos, audio files, and books (though it was recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/internet-archive-forced-to-remove-500000-books-after-publishers-court-win/">forced to delete 500,000 books</a> after losing a copyright case).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/the-internet-archive-and-its-916-billion-saved-webpages-are-back-online/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Has your dentist ever told you that it's recommended to get routine dental X-rays every year? My (former) dentist's office did this year—in writing, even. And they claimed that the recommendation came from the American Dental Association.</p>
<p>It's a common refrain from dentists, but it's false. The American Dental Association <em>does not</em> recommend annual routine X-rays. And this is not new; it's been that way for well over a decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-org/files/resources/library/oral-health-topics/dental_radiographic_examinations_2012.pdf?rev=fd33893f4d634cbaab92733c2313c354&amp;hash=45F728CEF900B5B654539635A9147AA9">The association's guidelines from 2012</a> recommended that adults who don't have an increased risk of dental caries (myself included) need only bitewing X-rays of the back teeth every two to three years. Even people with a higher risk of caries can go as long as 18 months between bitewings. The guidelines also note that X-rays should not be preemptively used to look for problems: "Radiographic screening for the purpose of detecting disease before clinical examination should not be performed," the guidelines read. In other words, dentists are supposed to examine your teeth <em>before</em> they take any X-rays.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/do-you-really-need-those-routine-dental-x-rays-probably-not/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What if there was a way to sneak malicious instructions into Claude, Copilot, or other top-name AI chatbots and get confidential data out of them by using characters large language models can recognize and their human users can’t? As it turns out, there was—and in some cases still is.</p>
<p>The invisible characters, the result of a quirk in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> text encoding standard, create an ideal covert channel that can make it easier for attackers to conceal malicious payloads fed into an LLM. The hidden text can similarly obfuscate the exfiltration of passwords, financial information, or other secrets out of the same AI-powered bots. Because the hidden text can be combined with normal text, users can unwittingly paste it into prompts. The secret content can also be appended to visible text in chatbot output.</p>
<p>The result is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganographic</a> framework built into the most widely used text encoding channel.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/ai-chatbots-can-read-and-write-invisible-text-creating-an-ideal-covert-channel/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The world is full of people who have excessive confidence in their own abilities. This is famously described as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/11/revisiting-why-incompetents-think-theyre-awesome/">the Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, which describes how people who lack expertise in something will necessarily lack the knowledge needed to recognize their own limits. Now, a different set of researchers has come out with what might be viewed as a corollary to Dunning-Kruger: People have a strong tendency to believe that they always have enough data to make an informed decision—regardless of what information they actually have.</p>
<p>The work, done by Hunter Gehlbach, Carly Robinson, and Angus Fletcher, is based on an experiment in which they intentionally gave people only partial, biased information, finding that people never seemed to consider they might only have a partial picture. "Because people assume they have adequate information, they enter judgment and decision-making processes with less humility and more confidence than they might if they were worrying whether they knew the whole story or not," they write. The good news? When given the full picture, most people are willing to change their opinions.</p>
<h2>Ignorant but confident</h2>
<p>The basic setup of the experiment is very straightforward. The researchers developed a scenario where an ongoing water shortage was forcing a school district to consider closing one of its schools and merging its students into another existing school. They then wrote an article that described the situation and contained seven different pieces of information: three that favored merging, three that disfavored it, and one that was neutral. Just over half of the control group that read the full article favored merging the two schools.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/people-think-they-already-know-everything-they-need-to-make-decisions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AeroGarden, which sells Wi-Fi-connected indoor gardening systems, is going out of business on January 1. While Scotts Miracle-Gro has continued selling AeroGarden products after announcing the impending shutdown, the future of the devices' companion app is uncertain.</p>
<p>AeroGarden systems use hydroponics and LED lights to grow indoor gardens without requiring sunlight or soil. The smart gardening system arrived in 2006, and Scotts Miracle-Gro took over complete ownership <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2020/11/23/scotts-miracle-gro-completes-aerogrow-acquisition.html">in 2020</a>. Some AeroGardens work with the iOS and Android apps that connect to the gardens via Wi-Fi and tell users when their plants need water or nutrients. AeroGarden also marketed the app as a way for users to easily monitor multiple AeroGardens and control the amount of light, water, and nutrients they should receive. The app offers gardening tips and can access AeroGarden customer service representatives and AeroGarden communities on Facebook and other social media outlets.</p>

      Rebecca Ferguson returns as Juliette in the second season of Apple TV's <em>Silo</em>.

<p>Apple TV's dystopian sc-fi drama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)"><em>Silo</em></a>, based on the trilogy by novelist Hugh Howey, was one of the more refreshing surprises on streaming television in 2023: a twist-filled combination of political thriller and police procedural set in a post-apocalyptic world. We included it in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tv-technica-2023-these-were-our-favorite-shows-and-binges-of-the-year/">our year-end TV roundup</a>, calling the series "one of the more intriguing shows of the year." The official trailer recently dropped for S2, and it looks like we can expect another suspenseful season full of surprising revelations.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tv-technica-2023-these-were-our-favorite-shows-and-binges-of-the-year/">we wrote</a> in last year's roundup, <em>Silo</em> is set in a self-sustaining underground city inhabited by a community whose recorded history only goes back 140 years, generations after the silo was built by the founders. Outside is a toxic hellscape that is only visible on big screens in the silo's topmost level. Inside, 10,000 people live together under a pact: Anyone who says they want to "go out" is immediately granted that wish—cast outside in an environment suit on a one-way trip to clean the cameras. But those who make that choice inevitably die soon after because of the toxic environment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/rebellion-brews-underground-in-silo-s2-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Organizations and individuals will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/post-2025-windows-10-updates-for-businesses-start-at-61-per-pc-go-up-from-there/">still be able to pay</a> for three more years of updates, with prices that go up steadily each year (Microsoft still hasn't provided pricing for end users, only saying that it will release pricing info "closer to the October 2025 date.") But for most PCs running Windows 10, the end of the line is in sight.</p>
<p>Normally, this wouldn't be a huge deal; the last dregs of support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 dried up <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/closing-time-windows-7-and-windows-8-1-have-received-their-last-updates/">in January 2023</a>, and the world didn't end even though some PCs continue to run those OS versions.

<p>A New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania.html">article</a> titled "Musk Is Going All In to Elect Trump" said that "the relationship [between Trump and Musk] has proved significant in other ways. After a reporter's publication of hacked Trump campaign information last month, the campaign connected with X to prevent the circulation of links to the material on the platform, according to two people with knowledge of the events. X eventually blocked links to the material and suspended the reporter's account."</p>
<p>We contacted X today and will update this article if it provides comment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/musks-x-blocked-links-to-jd-vance-dossier-after-hearing-from-trump-campaign/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The human mind may find it difficult to conceptualize: a cosmic cloud so colossal it surrounds the Sun and eight planets as it extends trillions of miles into deep space.</p>
<p>The spherical shell known as the Oort Cloud is, for all practical purposes, invisible. Its constituent particles are spread so thinly, and so far from the light of any star, including the Sun, that astronomers simply cannot see the cloud, even though it envelops us like a blanket.</p>
<p>It is also theoretical. Astronomers infer the Oort Cloud is there because it’s the only logical explanation for the arrival of a certain class of comets that sporadically visit our solar system. The cloud, it turns out, is basically a gigantic reservoir that <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/oort-cloud/facts/">may hold billions of icy celestial bodies</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/two-comets-will-be-visible-in-the-night-skies-this-month/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>BOCA CHICA BEACH, Texas—SpaceX accomplished a groundbreaking engineering feat Sunday when it launched the fifth test flight of its gigantic Starship rocket and then caught the booster back at the launch pad in Texas with mechanical arms seven minutes later.</p>
<p>This achievement is the first of its kind, and it's crucial for SpaceX's vision of rapidly reusing the Starship rocket, enabling human expeditions to the Moon and Mars, routine access to space for mind-bogglingly massive payloads, and novel capabilities that no other company—or country—seems close to attaining.</p>
<p>The test flight began with a thundering liftoff of the 398-foot-tall (121.3-meter) Starship rocket at 7:25 am CDT (12:25 UTC) from SpaceX's Starbase launch site in South Texas, a few miles north of the US-Mexico border. The rocket's Super Heavy booster stage fired 33 Raptor engines, generating nearly 17 million pounds of thrust and gulping 20 tons of methane and liquid oxygen propellants per second at full throttle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/spacex-catches-returning-rocket-in-mid-air-turning-a-fanciful-idea-into-reality/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On October 10, 2018, Tyndall Air Force Base on the Gulf of Mexico—a pillar of American air superiority—found itself under aerial attack. Hurricane Michael, first spotted as a Category 2 storm off the Florida coast, unexpectedly hulked up to a Category 5. Sustained winds of 155 miles per hour whipped into the base, flinging power poles, flipping F-22s, and totaling more than 200 buildings. The sole saving grace: Despite sitting on a peninsula, Tyndall avoided flood damage. Michael’s 9- to 14-foot storm surge swamped other parts of Florida. Tyndall’s main defense was luck.</p>
<p>That $5 billion disaster at Tyndall was just one of a mounting number of extreme-weather events that convinced the US Department of Defense that it needed new ideas to protect the 1,700 coastal bases it’s responsible for globally. As hurricanes Helene and Milton have just shown, beachfront residents face compounding threats from climate change, and the Pentagon is no exception. Rising oceans are chewing away the shore. Stronger storms are more capable of flooding land.</p>
<p>In response, Tyndall will later this month test a new way to protect shorelines from intensified waves and storm surges: a prototype artificial reef, designed by a team led by Rutgers University scientists. The 50-meter-wide array, made up of three chevron-shaped structures each weighing about 46,000 pounds, can take 70 percent of the <i>oomph</i> out of waves, according to tests. But this isn’t your grandaddy’s seawall. It’s specifically designed to be colonized by oysters, some of nature’s most effective wave-killers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/can-walls-of-oysters-protect-shores-against-hurricanes-darpa-wants-to-know/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Early Sunday morning, SpaceX will try something no one has ever done before. If all goes according to plan, around seven minutes after lifting off from South Texas, the huge stainless steel booster from SpaceX's Starship rocket will come back to the launch pad and slow to a hover, allowing powerful mechanical arms to capture it in midair.</p>
<p>This is SpaceX's approach to recovering Starship's Super Heavy booster. If it works, this method will make it easier and faster to reuse the rocket than it is to recycle boosters from SpaceX's smaller Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Falcon 9's boosters usually come down on a floating drone ship stationed hundreds of miles out to sea, requiring SpaceX to return the rocket to shore for refurbishment.</p>
<p>“We’re going for high reusability," said Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX's vice president of build and flight reliability.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/starship-is-about-to-launch-on-its-fifth-flight-and-this-time-theres-a-catch/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Pamela Goodwin has received hundreds of emails from patients asking if they should take a cheap, readily available drug, metformin, to treat their cancer.</p>
<p>It’s a fair question: Metformin, commonly used to treat diabetes, has been investigated for treating a range of cancer types <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=metformin+cancer&amp;sort=date">in thousands of studies</a> on laboratory cells, <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2024/evolution-of-multicelled-life">animals</a>, and people. But Goodwin, an epidemiologist and medical oncologist treating breast cancer at the University of Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital, advises against it. No gold-standard trials have proved that metformin helps treat breast cancer—and her recent research suggests it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Metformin’s development was inspired by centuries of use of French lilac, or goat’s rue (<em>Galega officinalis</em>), for diabetes-like symptoms. In 1918, researchers discovered that a compound from the herb lowers blood sugar. Metformin, a chemical relative of that compound, has been a top type 2 diabetes treatment in the United States since it was approved in 1994. It’s cheap—<a href="https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/metformin">less than a dollar per dose</a>—and readily available, with few side effects. Today, more than 150 million people worldwide take the stuff.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/why-a-diabetes-drug-fell-short-of-anticancer-hopes/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As attempts to clean up after Hurricane Milton are beginning, scientists at the World Weather Attribution project have taken a quick look at whether climate change contributed to its destructive power. While <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/yet-another-hurricane-wetter-windier-and-more-destructive-because-of-climate-change/">the analysis</a> is limited by the fact that not all the meteorological data is even available yet, by several measures, climate change made aspects of Milton significantly more likely.</p>
<p>This isn't a huge surprise, given that Milton traveled across the same exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/helenes-carolina-rainfall-made-70-percent-more-likely-by-climate-change/">Helene had recently transited</a>. But the analysis does produce one striking result: Milton would have been a Category 2 storm at landfall if climate change weren't boosting its strength.</p>
<h2>From the oceans to the skies</h2>
<p>Hurricanes strengthen while over warm ocean waters, and climate change has been slowly cranking up the heat content of the oceans. But it's important to recognize that the slow warming is an average, and that can include some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/03/ocean-heat-waves-remake-pacific-and-caribbean-habitats/">localized extreme events</a>. This year has seen <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/what-you-need-to-know-about-record-breaking-heat-in-the-atlantic/">lots of ocean temperature records set</a> in the Atlantic basin, and that seems to be true in the Gulf of Mexico as well. The researchers note that a different rapid analysis released earlier this week showed that the ocean temperatures—which had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/hurricane-milton-becomes-second-fastest-storm-to-reach-category-5-status/">boosted Milton to a Category 5 storm</a> during its time in the Gulf—were <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-shift-index-alert/hurricane-milton-october-2024">between 400 and 800 times more likely</a> to exist thanks to climate change.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/climate-change-boosted-miltons-landfall-strength-from-category-2-to-3/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Former Twitter executives, including former CEO Parag Agrawal, are <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agrawal-v-Musk-Motion-to-Open-Discovery-10-10-24.pdf">urging</a> a court to open discovery in a dispute over severance and other benefits they allege they were wrongfully denied after Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022.</p>
<p>According to the former executives, they've been blocked for seven months from accessing key documents proving they're owed roughly $200 million under severance agreements that they say Musk willfully tried to avoid paying in retaliation for executives forcing him to close the Twitter deal. And now, as X's value tanks lower than ever—<a href="https://www.actionsxchangerepository.fidelity.com/ShowDocument/ComplianceEnvelope.htm?_fax=-18%2342%23-61%23-110%23114%2378%23117%2320%23-1%2396%2339%23-62%23-21%2386%23-100%2337%2316%2335%23-68%2391%23-66%2354%23103%23-16%2369%23-30%2358%23-20%2376%23-84%23-11%23-87%2348%23-52%23-21%23-96%23-58%23-33%23-107%23-46%2393%23113%23-112%23127%23-42%23-97%2330%23-58%23-24%23-27%23-119%2394%23-121%23-102%23-69%23-71%23-99%2338%2353%23-51%2361%23-106%23-18%23-43%23-106%23-20%23-31%2385%23-55%235%2388%23-74%2371%23107%23-82%23-3%23-86%23-27%23-57%23-125%2342%23119%2357%23-111%2321%2363%23-99%2317%23-28%2320%23-38%23-101%23113%2380%23-77%23-4%23">reportedly</a> worth 80 percent less than when Musk bought it—the ex-Twitter leaders fear their severance claims "may be compromised" by Musk's alleged "mismanagement of X," their court filing said.</p>
<p>The potential for X's revenue loss to impact severance claims appears to go beyond just the former Twitter executives' dispute. According to their <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agrawal-v-Musk-Complaint-3-4-2024.pdf">complaint</a>, "there are also thousands of non-executive former employees whom Musk terminated and is now refusing to pay severance and other benefits" and who have "sued in droves."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/ex-twitter-execs-push-for-200m-severance-as-elon-musk-runs-x-into-ground/">Read full article</a></p>
