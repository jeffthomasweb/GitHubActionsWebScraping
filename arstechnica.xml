<p>The US Space Force announced Thursday it is partnering with two companies, Rocket Lab and True Anomaly, for a first-of-its-kind mission to demonstrate how the military might counter "on-orbit aggression."</p>
<p>On this mission, a spacecraft built and launched by Rocket Lab will chase down another satellite made by True Anomaly, a Colorado-based startup. "The vendors will exercise a realistic threat response scenario in an on-orbit space domain awareness demonstration called Victus Haze," the Space Force's Space Systems Command said in a statement.</p>
<p>This threat scenario could involve a satellite performing maneuvers that approach a US spacecraft or a satellite doing something else unusual or unexpected. In such a scenario, the Space Force wants to have the capability to respond, either to deter an adversary from taking action or to defend a US satellite from an attack.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016629#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016629&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The complex cells that underlie animals and plants have a large collection of what are called organelles—compartments surrounded by membranes that perform specialized functions. Two of these were formed through a process called endosymbiosis, in which a once free-living organism is incorporated into a cell. These are the mitochondrion, where a former bacteria now handles the task of converting chemical energy into useful forms, and the chloroplast, where photosynthesis happens.</p>
<p>The fact that there are only a few cases of organelles that evolved through endosymbiosis suggests that it's an extremely rare event. Yet researchers may have found a new case, in which an organelle devoted to fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere is in the process of evolving. The resulting organelle, termed a nitroplast, is still in the process of specialization.</p>
<h2>Getting nitrogen</h2>
<p>Nitrogen is one of the elements central to life. Every DNA base, every amino acid in a protein contains at least one, and often several, nitrogen atoms. But nitrogen is remarkably difficult for life to get ahold of. N<sub>2</sub> molecules might be extremely abundant in our atmosphere, but they're extremely difficult to break apart. The enzymes that can, called nitrogenases, are only found in bacteria, and they don't work in the presence of oxygen. Other organisms have to get nitrogen from their environment, which is one of the reasons we use so much energy to supply nitrogen fertilizers to many crops.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016827#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016827&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon has had a rocky history with big, geeky properties making their way onto Prime Video. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/the-wheel-of-time-season-two/"><em>The Wheel of Time</em></a> wasn’t for everyone, and I have almost nothing good to say about <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em>.</p>
<p><em>Fallout</em>, the first season of which premiered this week, seems to break that bad streak. All the episodes are online now, but I’ve watched three episodes so far. I love it.</p>
<p>I’ve spent hundreds of hours playing the games that inspired it, so I can only speak to that experience; I don’t know how well it will work for people who never played the games. But as a video game adaptation, it’s up there with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-one/"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016786#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016786&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sketchy cosmetic injections of what seem to be counterfeit Botox are behind a multistate outbreak of botulism-like illnesses, state health officials report.</p>
<p>So far, at least six people have fallen ill in two states: <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/news/2024/4/5/tdh-investigating-cases-of-botulism-like-illness-following-cosmetic-injections.html">four in Tennessee</a> and <a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/resource-center/news/2024/april/2024-04-08---idph-alerts-healthcare-providers-to-cluster-of-illn.html">two in Illinois</a>. Four of the six people required hospitalization for their condition (two in Tennessee and both cases in Illinois).</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/botulism-botox-fake-us-states-cdc-rcna147275">reportedly planning to nationwide alert</a> to notify clinicians of the potentially counterfeit Botox and advise them to be on the lookout for botulism-like illnesses. The agency did not immediately respond to Ars' request for information.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016788#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016788&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Alexa hasn't worked out the way Amazon originally planned.</p>
<p>There was a time when it thought that Alexa would yield a robust ecosystem of apps, or Alexa Skills, that would make the voice assistant an integral part of users' lives. Amazon envisioned tens of thousands of software developers building valued abilities for Alexa that would grow the voice assistant's popularity—and help Amazon make some money.</p>
<p>But about seven years after launching a rewards program to encourage developers to build Skills, Alexa's most preferred abilities are the basic ones, like checking the weather. And on June 30, Amazon will stop giving out the monthly Amazon Web Services credits that have made it free for third-party developers to build and host Alexa Skills. The company also recently told devs that its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/amazon-expands-program-that-pays-alexa-developers-for-top-performing-voice-apps/">Alexa Developer Rewards</a> program was ending, virtually disincentivizing third-party devs to build for Alexa.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016625#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016625&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/vision-2024-gaudi-3-ai-accelerator.html#gs.794k93">revealed</a> a new AI accelerator chip called Gaudi 3 at its Vision 2024 event in Phoenix. With strong claimed performance while running large language models (like those that power <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>), the company has positioned Gaudi 3 as an alternative to Nvidia's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/hopper-time-nvidias-most-powerful-ai-chip-yet-ships-in-october/">H100</a>, a popular data center GPU that has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-chip-shortages-leave-ai-startups-scrambling-for-computing-power/">subject to shortages</a>, though apparently that is <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-h100-ai-gpu-shortages-ease-as-lead-times-drop-from-up-to-four-months-to-8-12-weeks">easing somewhat</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to Nvidia's H100 chip, Intel projects a 50 percent faster training time on Gaudi 3 for both OpenAI's GPT-3 175B LLM and the 7-billion parameter version of Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/">Llama 2</a>. In terms of inference (running the trained model to get outputs), Intel claims that its new AI chip delivers 50 percent faster performance than H100 for Llama 2 and <a href="https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B">Falcon 180B</a>, which are both relatively popular open-weights models.</p>

<p>Intel is targeting the H100 because of its <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/analysts-estimate-nvidia-owns-98-of-the-data-center-gpu-market">high market share</a>, but the chip isn't Nvidia's most powerful AI accelerator chip in the pipeline. Announcements of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/nvidia-introduces-its-most-powerful-gpu-yet-designed-for-accelerating-ai/">H200</a> and the Blackwell <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">B200</a> have since surpassed the H100 on paper, but neither of those chips is out yet (the H200 is <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/micron-hbm3e-in-production-set-for-nvidia-h200-use-in-q2-2024/">expected</a> in the second quarter of 2024—basically any day now).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016421#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016421&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amid a flurry of lawsuits over AI models' training data, US Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has introduced a <a href="https://schiff.house.gov/imo/media/doc/the_generative_ai_copyright_disclosure_act.pdf">bill</a> that would require AI companies to disclose exactly which copyrighted works are included in datasets training AI systems.</p>
<p>The Generative AI Disclosure Act "would require a notice to be submitted to the Register of Copyrights prior to the release of a new generative AI system with regard to all copyrighted works used in building or altering the training dataset for that system," Schiff said in a <a href="https://schiff.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-schiff-introduces-groundbreaking-bill-to-create-ai-transparency-between-creators-and-companies">press release</a>.</p>
<p>The bill is retroactive and would apply to all AI systems available today, as well as to all AI systems to come. It would take effect 180 days after it's enacted, requiring anyone who creates or alters a training set not only to list works referenced by the dataset, but also to provide a URL to the dataset within 30 days before the AI system is released to the public. That URL would presumably give creators a way to double-check if their materials have been used and seek any credit or compensation available before the AI tools are in use.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016595#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016595&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Remember when "web3 gaming" was the hot new thing in the game industry? In 2022, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/video-games-in-2022-massive-mergers-and-peculiar-portables/">it seemed like every other game maker</a> was flirting with "NFT integration" or "blockchain support" or some other crypto-adjacent buzzword in one form or another. Then, throughout 2023, the whole idea <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/gamestop-citing-regulatory-uncertainty-winds-down-its-crypto-and-nft-wallet/">quickly faded away</a> as generative AI became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/game-developer-survey-50-work-at-a-studio-already-using-generative-ai-tools/">the latest Silicon Valley obsession</a>.</p>
<p>But some are apparently not willing to give up on the crypto gaming dream. Playtron and Mysten Labs have <a href="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1777990298385219986">announced</a> the <a href="https://sui.io/suiplay0x1">SuiPlay0X1</a>, a new Steam Deck-alike that is being billed as "the world's first blockchain native handheld games console."</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING: announcement from onstage at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuiBasecamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SuiBasecamp</a>: we’re excited to share the first handheld gaming device with native Web3 capabilities – the SuiPlay0X1, powered by <a href="https://twitter.com/PLAYTR0N?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PLAYTR0N</a>! <a href="https://t.co/Zubhx6gyXG">pic.twitter.com/Zubhx6gyXG</a></p>

<p>Currently, the device seems to exist only as a few concept renders and vague promises about finally making "web3 gaming" accessible to the ignorant masses who don't even know how much they need crypto features integrated into their gaming portable. But even if those promises all pan out (a very big if), it's hard to see any real value that the 0X1 would provide over the current slate of gaming handhelds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016612#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016612&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Elon Musk's clumsy brand shift from Twitter to X caused a potentially big problem this week when the social network started automatically changing "twitter.com" to "x.com" in links. The automatic text replacement reportedly applied to any URL ending in "twitter.com" even if it wasn't actually a twitter.com link.</p>
<p>The change apparently went live on X's app for iOS, but not on the web version. It seems to have been a problem for a day or two before the company fixed the automatic text replacement so that it wouldn't affect non-Twitter.com domains.</p>
<p>Security reporter Brian Krebs called the move "a gift to phishers" in an <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/twitters-clumsy-pivot-to-x-com-is-a-gift-to-phishers/">article</a> yesterday. It was a phishing risk because scammers could register a domain name like "netflitwitter.com," which would appear as "netflix.com" in posts on X, but clicking the link would take a user to netflitwitter.com.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016566#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016566&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has always had a strong preference that only its own parts be used in repairs, but only if they're brand-new. Now, soon after Oregon passed a repair bill forbidding devices from rejecting parts with software locks, or "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/oregon-governor-signs-nations-first-right-to-repair-bill-that-bans-part-pairing/">parts pairing</a>," Apple says it will allow for used Apple parts in future iPhone repairs.</p>
<p>While noting that "pairing" is "critical to preserving the privacy, security, and safety of an iPhone," <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.5.0&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2024%2F04%2Fapple-to-expand-repair-options-with-support-for-used-genuine-parts%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=e9e071cfbfa1a6e870c0b32ffb268527&amp;xjsf=other_click__contextmenu%20%5B2%5D">Apple states</a> that it has worked for two years to allow for reusing Face ID and Touch ID sensors (i.e., biometric sensors) as well as moving part calibration from its remote repair certification tools onto the iPhone itself. As a result, "select iPhone models" this fall will allow for reusing biometric sensors and other parts, and anyone ordering parts from Apple can skip sending a device's serial number, so long as the repair doesn't involve a new main logic board.</p>
<p>The new policy "is designed to maintain an iPhone user's privacy, security, and safety, while offering consumers more options, increasing product longevity, and minimizing the environmental impact of a repair," according to Apple's release.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016470#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016470&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hardware sold for years by the likes of Intel and Lenovo contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability that will never be fixed. The cause: a supply chain snafu involving an open source software package and hardware from multiple manufacturers that directly or indirectly incorporated it into their products.</p>
<p>Researchers from security firm Binarly have confirmed that the lapse has resulted in Intel, Lenovo, and Supermicro shipping server hardware that contains a vulnerability that can be exploited to reveal security-critical information. The researchers, however, went on to warn that any hardware that incorporates certain generations of baseboard management controllers made by Duluth, Georgia-based AMI or Taiwan-based AETN are also affected.</p>
<h2>Chain of fools</h2>
<p>BMCs are tiny computers soldered into the motherboard of servers that allow cloud centers, and sometimes their customers, to streamline the remote management of vast fleets of servers. They enable administrators to remotely reinstall OSes, install and uninstall apps, and control just about every other aspect of the system—even when it's turned off. BMCs provide what’s known in the industry as “lights-out” system management. AMI and AETN are two of several makers of BMCs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016577#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016577&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In 2000, after a decadeslong public health battle and a Herculean vaccination program, the US won a coveted status: measles elimination. The designation means that the extremely infectious measles virus is no longer endemic in the US—defined as continuous transmission in the country over 12 or more months while in the presence of an effective disease monitoring system. The country went from having 3 to 4 million children fall ill with the severe infection each year, to tallying just dozens of mostly travel-linked cases.</p>
<p>But in an alarming turn, the country's elimination status is now at risk. Measles cases in the first quarter of 2024 have increased more than 17-fold over the cases seen in the first quarters of 2000 to 2023. Measles vaccination rates among kindergarteners have slipped in that time, too, with vaccination coverage in the last three consecutive years below the 95 percent target that is needed to prevent sustained transmission. Outside the US, measles cases are exploding in the wake of pandemic-related disruptions to routine childhood vaccination programs. Altogether, the conditions are prime for measles to regain its foothold in the country—and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is clearly anxious.</p>
<p>"The rapid increase in the number of reported measles cases during the first quarter of 2024 represents a renewed threat to elimination," CDC researchers write in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a1.htm?s_cid=mm7314a1_w">a new analysis of the country's measles cases and surveillance system</a>. The analysis was published Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016561#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016561&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google Photos is <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-editing-features-availability/">opening up</a> its premium editing tools to more users. The company says features like Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, and Portrait Light will be open to everyone, though the editor will have some usage limits for free users. Previously these were exclusive to Pixel devices or users subscribing to Google One.</p>
<p>All of these AI-powered photo manipulators will be hit-or-miss depending on your exact photo, but "Portrait Light" will brighten up people's faces, and "Photo unblur" claims to be able to remove blur from movement or camera shake from your photos. Magic Eraser is Google's much-touted photo feature that lets you circle an item and have some AI processing remove it, generating a new background from the existing picture. These features will now all be free to Android and iOS users.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dk3zK5EtCHE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>For an even bigger extension of Magic Eraser, there's "Magic Editor" that lets you remove things and move them around. Magic Editor lets you imprecisely circle objects via your touchscreen, and it's entirely up to the AI system to both 1) correctly identify and cut out the object you <em>very </em>roughly circled and 2) replace the background where it used to be. It's a lot to ask of a photo editor. Moving an item won't correct its perspective, and Google's examples all do their best to stay away from that with landscape shots and moving an object only a small amount. The nicest part of the editor is that when it has to generate something, you'll get several different solutions presented in a lineup and can pick the one that looks the best.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016435#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016435&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sometime around 660 CE, silver coinage replaced gold as the dominant form of currency in northwest Europe. But what was the source of all that silver? According to a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/byzantine-plate-and-frankish-mines-the-provenance-of-silver-in-northwest-european-coinage-during-the-long-eighth-century-c-660820/EE2DE1D7955D055FA4225257755BF340">recent paper</a> published in the journal Antiquity, silver for the earlier post-Roman coins during this period came from Byzantine silver plate, while silver for the later coins most likely came from mines located in Melle, Aquitaine.</p>
<p>“This was such an exciting discovery," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1039659?">said co-author Rory Naismith</a>, a medieval historian at the University of Cambridge. "I proposed Byzantine origins a decade ago but couldn’t prove it. Now we have the first archaeometric confirmation that Byzantine silver was the dominant source behind the great seventh-century surge in minting and trade around the North Sea.”</p>
<p>There are a number of high-tech tools that can be used to learn more about historic currencies. For instance, Michael Wiescher, a nuclear physicist at the University of Notre Dame, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/history-detective-using-physics-to-track-currency-fraud-forgery-through-history/">has combined</a> XRF scaling with PIXE mapping of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169433219320318">Roman denarii</a> to test the currency's quality and learn more about the production techniques. Working with his undergraduate students, he has also used electron spectroscopy to measure the silver content of each coin and learn about how the impurities were distributed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015495#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015495&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Among the many things upended by the pandemic was the traditional American car-buying experience. Factories were idled to safeguard public health, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/the-chaos-of-war-and-covid-continues-to-close-car-factories/">supply chains broke down</a>, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/automotive-chip-shortages-to-continue-throughout-2023-industry-says/">chip shortage took hold</a>. Dealer inventories dried up, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/buying-a-new-car-this-database-might-help-save-thousands-in-dealer-markups/">hefty markups became the norm</a>, causing new car prices to skyrocket. Those days are over, with inventory growing and both new and used prices dropping, particularly for electric vehicles, according to a new study from the digital marketplace <a href="https://www.carscommerce.inc/insights-report/">cars.com</a>.</p>
<p>Although automakers like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/fords-q1-ev-sales-grew-86-but-its-shifting-focus-to-hybrids/">Ford</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/after-ditching-its-hybrids-gm-says-it-needs-to-build-more-hybrids/">General Motors</a> have scaled back their EV ambitions, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/car-dealers-say-they-cant-sell-evs-tell-biden-to-slow-their-rollout/">a chorus of complaining car dealers</a> in the background, it looks like increasing numbers of US car buyers are considering going electric.</p>
<p>Searches for new EVs on <a href="http://cars.com">cars.com</a> were up 14.9 percent year over year (14.7 percent month over month). And there are many more cars for buyers to pick from, with 107.7 percent more inventory than in March 2023 (or 8.8 percent more than this February). Those EVs are hanging around on lots longer than dealers might like, with an average of 91 days of inventory—the industry prefers to keep less than 60 days of inventory on hand and averaged 65 days for March 2024.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016439#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016439&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A board member of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which owns <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/truth-social/">Truth Social</a>, has been accused of hacking one of the executives who helped bring the firm public as part of a corporate coup attempt, according to a lawsuit filed in the Southern District of Florida.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-truth-social-publicly-traded-company/">Trump Media became a publicly traded company</a> last month when it merged with Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC), a special purpose acquisition company. DWAC was first led by Patrick Orlando, one of the original architects of the deal to take Truth Social public. Orlando was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/22/trump-linked-digital-world-acquisition-corp-fires-ceo.html">fired</a> in March 2023, after that deal was delayed, and replaced immediately by Eric Swider. That ouster is the focus of the lawsuit, which was filed in March of this year by a company Orlando controls called Benessere Investment Group.</p>

<p>On the sidelines of the state visit by the Japanese prime minister to Washington this week, US and Japanese officials have signed an agreement to cement a partnership that will pave the way for a Japanese astronaut to walk on the Moon.</p>
<p>The Japanese astronaut, still unnamed, will become the first international astronaut to walk on the Moon under the auspices of the NASA-led Artemis program. Astronauts from NASA's other major partners on Artemis—the European Space Agency (ESA), Canada, and the United Arab Emirates—will also get a chance to fly to the Moon, either to the planned Gateway space station in lunar orbit or on trips to the surface.</p>
<p>But Japan will get the first international seat on a lunar landing mission, President Biden announced Wednesday during a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Other topics on the agenda for the official visit included deepening economic, military, scientific, and educational ties between the two nations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016320#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016320&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            The Frankenstein's monster of a GamePad hack responsible for the creation of Trimming the Herbs.                          [credit:
                              Ahoyo                            ]

<p>Last month, the <em>Super Mario Maker</em> community was rocked by the shocking admission that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/the-super-mario-maker-community-faces-its-final-boss/">the game's last uncleared level</a>—an ultra-hard reflex test named "Trimming the Herbs" (TTH)—had been secretly created and uploaded <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/super-mario-makers-final-boss-was-a-fraud-all-along/">using the assistance of automated, tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) techniques</a> back in 2017. That admission didn't stop <em>Super Mario Maker</em> streamer Sanyx from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yvVJbji0U">finally pulling off a confirmed human-powered clear of the level</a> last Friday, just days before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/wii-u-3ds-online-servers-to-shut-down-in-six-months/">Nintendo's final shutdown of the Wii U's online servers</a> Sunday would have made that an impossibility.</p>
<p>But while "Trimming the Herbs" itself was solved in the nick of time, the mystery of the level's creation remained at least partially unsolved. Before TTH creator Ahoyo admitted to his TAS exploit last month, the player community at large didn't think it was even <em>possible</em> to precisely automate such pre-recorded inputs on the Wii U.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7yvVJbji0U?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">The first confirmed clear of Trimming the Herbs by a human. </p></div>
<p>Now, speaking to Ars, Ahoyo has finally explained the console hacking that went into his clandestine TAS so many years ago and opened up about the physical and psychological motivations for the level's creation. He also discussed the remorse he feels over what ended up being a years-long fraud on the community, which is still struggling with frame-perfect input timing issues that seem inherent to the Wii U hardware.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015151#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015151&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://iii-initiative.com/">Triple-i initiative</a> is a gaming showcase that gets it, and is also in on the joke.</p>
<p>The thing Triple-i gets is that most gaming "showcases" are full of corporate fluff, go on way too long, and are often anchored around a couple huge titles. Triple-i's first event on Wednesday delivered 30-plus game trailers and teases within 45 minutes, and there was a consistent intrigue to all of them. There were some big names with some bigger studios loosely attached, and the definition of what is "triple-i" is quite vague, maybe intentionally. But there were a lot of games worth noting, especially on PC.</p>
<p>What kind of games? Triple-i's website notes the announcement "may contain traces of rogue-lites." At a breakpoint in the showcase, the omniscient text narrator notes there are "only a few more rogue-lites (promise)." Triple-i was stuffed full of rogue-lites, roguelikes, survival, city-builders, deckbuilders, <em>Hades</em>-likes, 16-bit-esque platformers, <em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors </em>and its progeny, turn-based tacticals, and then a car that sometimes has legs. There are strong trends in indie and indie-adjacent gaming, but also some real surprises.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016286#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016286&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AT&amp;T is notifying millions of current or former customers that their account data has been compromised and published last month on the dark web. Just how many millions, the company isn't saying.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/3778e1fc-2ed5-461d-9cc5-df15c07f687c.shtml">mandatory filing</a> with the Maine Attorney General’s office, the telecommunications company said 51.2 million account holders were affected. On its corporate website, AT&amp;T put the number at <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000101995">73 million</a>. In either event, compromised data included one or more of the following: full names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, AT&amp;T account numbers, and AT&amp;T passcodes. Personal financial information and call history didn’t appear to be included, AT&amp;T said, and data appeared to be from June 2019 or earlier.</p>
<p>The disclosure on the AT&amp;T site said the 73 million affected customers comprised 7.6 million current customers and 65.4 million former customers. The notification said AT&amp;T has reset the account PINs of all current customers and is notifying current and former customers by mail. AT&amp;T representatives haven’t explained why the letter filed with the Maine AG lists 51.2 million affected and the disclosure on its site lists 73 million.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016342#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016342&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
