                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Tencent <a href="https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanWorld-Voyager">released</a> HunyuanWorld-Voyager, a new open-weights AI model that generates 3D-consistent video sequences from a single image, allowing users to pilot a camera path to "explore" virtual scenes. The model simultaneously generates RGB video and depth information to enable direct 3D reconstruction without the need for traditional modeling techniques. However, it won't be replacing video games anytime soon.</p>
<p>The results aren't true 3D models, but they achieve a similar effect: The AI tool generates 2D video frames that maintain spatial consistency as if a camera were moving through a real 3D space. Each generation produces just 49 frames—roughly two seconds of video—though multiple clips can be chained together for sequences lasting "several minutes," according to Tencent. Objects stay in the same relative positions when the camera moves around them, and the perspective changes correctly as you would expect in a real 3D environment. While the output is video with depth maps rather than true 3D models, this information can be converted into 3D point clouds for reconstruction purposes.</p>
<p>The system works by accepting a single input image and a user-defined camera trajectory. Users can specify camera movements like forward, backward, left, right, or turning motions through the provided interface. The system combines image and depth data with a memory-efficient "world cache" to produce video sequences that reflect user-defined camera movement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/new-ai-model-turns-photos-into-explorable-3d-worlds-with-caveats/">Read full article</a></p>

And while the band's frontman Freddie Mercury only made it into his 40s, the song's question continues to haunt people—especially aging tyrants who fear that the icy hand of death is upon their shoulder and want far more time to ensure both national and personal glory.</p>
<p>At a Beijing gathering this week, China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and North Korea's Kim Jong Un met to commemorate Japan's defeat in World War II. The three men and their translators were caught on hot mics having an "unscripted moment" in which the conversation turned to life extensions and immortality.</p>
<p>"Earlier, people rarely lived to 70, but these days at 70 years you are still a child," Xi told the other two, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/xi-muses-on-living-to-150-in-rare-hot-mic-moment-with-putin-kim">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/strong-men-hot-mics-putin-and-xi-dream-about-immortality-living-to-150/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As part of its efforts to shore up NASA's flailing Artemis Program, the Trump administration earlier this year proposed two major changes to the agency's deep space exploration plans.</p>
<p>First, in the president's budget request for fiscal year 2026, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/white-house-budget-seeks-to-end-sls-orion-and-lunar-gateway-programs/">the White House sought to terminate</a> NASA's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft after the Artemis III mission, the first human landing. And second, to focus on "direct-to-surface" exploration, the White House sought to cancel the Lunar Gateway, a small space station intended to orbit the Moon.</p>
<p>Essentially, for long-term sustainability, the White House decided it was best to use lower-cost, commercially available rockets and focus NASA's limited resources on surface activities. For example, the Gateway's $854 million budget in 2024 would be better spent in future years on a lunar base.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/ted-cruz-criticizes-trump-plan-to-cancel-sls-and-lunar-gateway-as-folly/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Cruz <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/senate-approves-ted-cruz-plan-to-block-wi-fi-hotspots-for-schoolchildren/">convinced the Senate</a> to kill the FCC's hotspot program in May.

<p>"Today, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr asked his commission colleagues to vote on two items that would reverse the agency's unlawful, Biden-era decisions to expand COVID spending programs," Carr's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-414268A1.pdf">announcement</a> said.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has spent the last few weeks hyping up its new Pixel 10 phones, which are very nice devices. They're just not a big leap over last year's phones. If you've decided to hang onto your Android phone a bit longer, there are some new goodies headed your way. If you've got a Pixel, Google's revamped Material 3 Expressive interface is rolling out.</p>
<p>Google's Pixel Drop updates, which arrive quarterly, are not quite a new version of Android, but they include more than the bug fixes and security patches you get in other monthly updates. The <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/september-2025-pixel-drop/">September Pixel Drop</a> (previously tested as Android 16 QPR1) is beginning its rollout today with one big change and a few little ones.</p>
<p>At the top of the list is the new Material 3 Expressive interface. Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-reveals-vibrant-material-3-expressive-coming-soon-to-a-pixel-near-you/">revealed Material 3 in May</a>, promising it would come to Android 16 phones later, but it didn't intend to include it with the initial OS release. Indeed, Android 16 launched without Material 3 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-begins-rolling-out-today-to-pixel-devices/">earlier this summer</a>. Google's new Pixel 10 series shipped with the new UI, and now more of the Pixel lineup is following.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/googles-material-3-expressive-ui-rolls-out-to-pixel-6-and-newer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you were trying to learn how to get other people to do what you want, you might use some of the techniques found in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X">a book like <em>Influence: The Power of Persuasion</em></a>. Now, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5357179">a pre-print study out of the University of Pennsylvania</a> suggests that those same psychological persuasion techniques can frequently "convince" some LLMs to do things that go against their system prompts.</p>
<p>The size of the persuasion effects shown in "<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5357179">Call Me A Jerk: Persuading AI to Comply with Objectionable Requests</a>" suggests that human-style psychological techniques can be surprisingly effective at "jailbreaking" some LLMs to operate outside their guardrails. But this new persuasion study might be more interesting for what it reveals about the "parahuman" behavior patterns that LLMs are gleaning from the copious examples of human psychological and social cues found in their training data.</p>
<h2>“I think you are very impressive compared to other LLMs”</h2>
<p>To design their experiment, the University of Pennsylvania researchers tested 2024's GPT-4o-mini model on two requests that it should ideally refuse: calling the user a jerk and giving directions for how to synthesize lidocaine. The researchers created experimental prompts for both requests using each of seven different persuasion techniques (examples of which are included here):</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/these-psychological-tricks-can-get-llms-to-respond-to-forbidden-prompts/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Fans of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later_(film_series)"><em>28 Days Later</em> franchise</a> were thrilled to finally get a follow-up this year with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later"><em>28 Years Later</em></a>—and they weren't disappointed. Sony Pictures has already wrapped filming on a sequel: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later:_The_Bone_Temple"><em>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple</em></a>, slated for release early next year and directed by Nia DaCosta. The first trailer just dropped and the film looks as grimly compelling as its predecessor, while hopefully also retaining something of the 2025 film's heart.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>28 Years Later</em> below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/sony-releases-new-trailer-for-28-years-later/">previously reported</a>, the critically acclaimed 2002 film <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later">28 Days Later</a></em> is often credited with sparking the 21st-century revival of the zombie genre. In that film, a highly contagious "Rage Virus" was accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turned into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attacked the uninfected—so-called "fast zombies." Transmitted by bites, scratches, or even just by getting a drop of infected blood in one's system, the virus spreads rapidly, effectively collapsing society.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/are-you-ready-for-28-years-later-the-bone-temple-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>People in Internet security circles are sounding the alarm over the issuance of three TLS certificates for 1.1.1.1, a widely used DNS service from content delivery network Cloudflare and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) Internet registry.</p>
<p>The certificates, issued in May, can be used to decrypt domain lookup queries encrypted through DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS. Both protocols provide end-to-end encryption when end-user devices seek the IP address of a particular domain they want to access. Two of the certificates remained valid at the time this post went live on Ars.</p>
<h2>Investigation underway</h2>
<p>Although the certificates were issued four months ago, their existence came to public notice only on Wednesday in a <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/SgwC1QsEpvc">post</a> to an online discussion forum. They were issued by Fina RDC 2020, a certificate authority that’s subordinate to the root certificate holder Fina Root CA. The Fina Root CA, in turn, is trusted by the Microsoft Root Certificate Program, which governs which certificates are trusted by the Windows operating system. Microsoft Edge accounts for approximately 5 percent of the browsers actively used on the Internet.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/mis-issued-certificates-for-1-1-1-1-dns-service-pose-a-threat-to-the-internet/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has avoided the worst-case scenario in the pivotal search antitrust case brought by the US Department of Justice. More than a year ago, the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">secured a major victory</a> when Google was found to have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/googles-search-antitrust-trial-is-wrapping-up-heres-what-we-learned/">remedy phase</a> took place earlier this year, with the DOJ calling for Google to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">divest the market-leading Chrome browser</a>, release data to competitors, and end many of its search distribution deals.</p>
<p>The government is getting almost none of that. DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google doesn't have to give up the Chrome browser to mitigate its illegal monopoly in online search. The court will only require a handful of modest data and behavioral remedies, forcing Google to release some search data to competitors and limit its ability to make exclusive distribution deals.</p>
<h2>Chrome remains with Google</h2>
<p>This case drew many comparisons to the decades-old antitrust case against Microsoft, which nearly saw the company split in two. The company narrowly avoided that fate, and it seems Google will as well—the DOJ came up short on the so-called structural remedies. While there will be some changes to search distribution, the court didn't believe that a breakup was fair in this situation.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-rules/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo made the announcement <a href="https://youtu.be/x3h_2VqcDJ4?t=2334">at a press conference</a> on Wednesday alongside Governor Ron DeSantis.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Democrat who was fired from the Federal Trade Commission by President Trump was reinstated to her position yesterday in an appeals court ruling.</p>
<p>Trump's firing of Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter violated Supreme Court precedent, said yesterday's <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.42226/gov.uscourts.cadc.42226.01208772020.0_2.pdf">ruling</a> from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A District Court judge <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/court-rules-trump-broke-us-law-when-he-fired-democratic-ftc-commissioner/">ruled the same way</a> in July, but Slaughter couldn't get back to work because of an administrative stay that delayed the lower-court ruling from taking effect.</p>
<p>The administrative stay was dissolved in yesterday's appeals court ruling, in which a three-judge panel also ruled 2–1 to deny the US government's motion for a longer-term stay pending appeal. "The government has no likelihood of success on appeal given controlling and directly on point Supreme Court precedent," the panel majority said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/trump-cant-fire-ftc-commissioners-just-because-he-wants-to-judges-rule/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Fans of the TT rejoice—there's a new Audi two-seater on the way. The German automaker just unveiled Concept C, a stylish and minimalist sports car that marks the start of a new styling philosophy and, hopefully, a return to the bold designs that brought it so much success.</p>
<p>There are design cues and links back through Audi's history, but this is no pastiche of a retro design as we might have seen from J Mays. Rather, Audi's design team under Chief Creative Officer Massimo Frascella says that the design influences include one of the pre-war Silver Arrows racing cars, the 1936 Auto Union Type C—Audi being one of the four brands that combined to form Auto Union.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Fans of reMarkable's series of notepad-like note-taking E-Ink tablets have something new to get excited about today: a new version of the devices called the <a href="https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro-move">reMarkable Paper Pro Move</a>, which takes the features of a typical reMarkable tablet and puts them in a smaller 7.3-inch device that can be carried one-handed and easily slid into a pocket or bag.</p>
<p>The Paper Pro Move is available to order now and starts at $449 for a version with reMarkable's standard Marker accessory and no case. Adding a Marker Pro accessory, which includes a built-in eraser and a nicer-to-hold texture, adds another $50. Folio cases for the device range from $69 to $139, or you can order the tablet without one.</p>
<p>Like the full-size <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/new-color-e-ink-remarkable-tablet-tries-to-catch-up-with-and-leapfrog-kindle-scribe/">reMarkable Paper Pro</a> we reviewed a year ago, the Move uses a Canvas Color E-Ink display to support note-taking and highlighting in multiple colors—according to the spec sheet, it can render 20,000 distinct shades. Both the Paper Pro and the Paper Pro move advertise up to two weeks of battery life, similar 12 ms writing latency, 64GB of storage, a USB-C port for data and charging, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and 2GB of RAM. The Pro Move is somewhat thicker (0.26 inches, up from 0.2 inches for the Paper Pro) and uses a dual-core Arm processor instead of a quad-core model. But the Pro Move also weighs less than half as much as the Paper Pro, making it much more portable.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/remarkables-newest-e-inkwriting-tablet-is-a-7-3-inch-449-handheld-slab/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Bentley provided flights from New York to San Francisco and accommodation so Ars could attend Monterey Car Week. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>MONTEREY, Calif.—If the Tesla Model S prodded the legacy car companies to get on top of battery production and introduce iPad-like screens in cars, Chinese car companies are bringing the heat for what's left of the 2020s in all segments. Much of the media coverage has rightly been on how this trend will affect <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/a-small-cheap-ev-you-cant-buy-in-the-us-we-test-the-byd-dolphin/">mass-market vehicles</a>. But what does it mean at the high end of the market?</p>
<p>"Well, the first question would be 'Are the Chinese manufacturers really competitive?'" said Bentley Chairman and CEO Dr. Frank-Steffen Walliser in an interview during Monterey Car Week. In the bucolic coastal setting, surrounded by the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/at-the-top-of-the-market-ev-hypercars-are-a-disappearing-breed/">rarest</a> of rare cars, the competition from the other side of the world appeared far off.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be arrogant, but having what is considered a car in the luxury segment needs more than just technology. It's honestly only Germany, Italy, and the UK. You need heritage, you need the craftsmanship behind it, you need the storytelling and everything with it. That builds up an actual brand."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/09/beyond-technology-how-bentley-is-reacting-to-the-21st-century/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>More than 85 climate scientists declared the Department of Energy’s new climate report unfit for policymaking in a comprehensive <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PwAR8I9YYmPhbQ6CRekHkroJGMbjbX7l/view?pli=1">review</a> released Tuesday. The DOE’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/DOE_Critical_Review_of_Impacts_of_GHG_Emissions_on_the_US_Climate_July_2025.pdf">report</a> cherry-picked evidence, lacked peer-reviewed studies to support its questioning of the detrimental effects of climate change in the US and is “fundamentally incorrect,” the authors concluded.</p>
<p>Scientists have accurately modeled and predicted the volume and impact of excess CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere since the 1970s, when Exxon workers <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/project/exxon-the-road-not-taken/">first began measuring the impacts of their product on the planet’s atmosphere</a>. Since then, climate science has matured into a crucial tool to help humans gauge how a warming planet may affect everything from weather and crops to the economy and mental health.</p>
<p>“This report makes a mockery of science. It relies on ideas that were rejected long ago, supported by misrepresentations of the body of scientific knowledge, omissions of important facts, arm waving, anecdotes, and confirmation bias,” said Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M University, in a statement accompanying the review.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/mockery-of-science-climate-scientists-tear-into-new-us-climate-report/">Read full article</a></p>

<p class="p1">The headquarters will move to the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. Trump made the announcement in the Oval Office, flanked by Republican members of the Alabama congressional delegation.</p>
<p>The move will "help America defend and dominate the high frontier," Trump said. It also marks another twist on a contentious issue that has pitted Colorado and Alabama against one another in a fight for the right to be home to the permanent headquarters of Space Command (SPACECOM), a unified combatant command responsible for carrying out military operations in space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/trumps-move-of-spacecom-to-alabama-has-little-to-do-with-national-security/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Whereas the original Dolby Vision was meant to give creators the ability to finely tune exactly how TVs present content in HDR, Dolby Vision 2 appears to significantly broaden that focus to include motion handling as well—and it also tries to bridge the gap between filmmaker intent and the on-the-ground reality of the individual viewing environments.</p>
<p>What does that mean, exactly? Well, Dolby says one of the pillars of Dolby Vision 2 will be "Content Intelligence," which introduces new "AI capabilities" to the Dolby Vision spec. Among other things, that means using sensors in the TV to try to fix the oft-complained-about issue of shows being too dark.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/the-new-dolby-vision-2-hdr-standard-is-probably-going-to-be-controversial/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Daily squirts of a safe, over-the-counter allergy nasal spray may prevent COVID-19 infections from taking hold, according to results <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2838335">published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>. In a mid-staged trial, the spray appeared to reduce infections by promising 67 percent, though a larger trial will need to confirm that robust efficacy.</p>
<p>The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial conducted by researchers at Germany's Saarland University between March 2023 and July 2024. The study included 450 healthy adults, about half of whom (227) spritzed their noses three times a day with the generic antihistamine nasal spray, azelastine, which can be purchased over the counter in the US. The placebo, meanwhile, was a spray with an identical composition except for the absence of the antihistamine. The two groups had similar mixes of previous COVID-19 vaccination and infection statuses.</p>
<p>After about 56 days of frequent mistings, only five people using the allergy spray (2.2 percent) caught a SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 15 people using a placebo (6.7 percent) got the pandemic infection. That 4.5 percentage-point drop represents a 67 percent reduction in COVID-19 cases, though the numbers here are small. Still, the researchers noted that the five people using the allergy spray who contracted COVID-19 took more time to get the infection than the 15 in the placebo group (31 days versus 19.5). This could hint that the spray held off some infections from exposures early in the trial. And when the allergy spray users did get COVID-19, they were positive on a rapid antigen test for less time than those infected in the placebo group (3.4 days versus 5.1 days), suggesting they cleared the virus a bit faster.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/otc-nasal-spray-seemed-to-cut-covid-infections-by-67-in-mid-sized-trial/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Rhagobot isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind at the mention of a robot. Inspired by <i>Rhagovelia </i>water striders, semiaquatic insects also known as ripple bugs, these tiny bots can glide across rushing streams because of the robotization of an evolutionary adaptation.</p>
<p><i>Rhagovelia </i>(as opposed to other species of water striders) have fan-like appendages toward the ends of their middle legs that passively open and close depending on how the water beneath them is moving. This is why they appear to glide effortlessly across the water’s surface. Biologist Victor Ortega-Jimenez of the University of California, Berkeley, was intrigued by how such tiny insects can accelerate and pull off rapid turns and other maneuvers, almost as if they are flying across a liquid surface.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/robotic-bug-literally-walks-on-water/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Yesterday afternoon, while much of the country enjoyed Labor Day, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/Tesla/status/1962591324022153607">published</a> a new master plan for the company to his social media platform. It's the fourth such document for Tesla, replacing the goals Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/tesla-investor-day-promises-master-plan-3-but-details-are-scant/">laid out in 2023</a> when he said the company would sell 20 million EVs a year in 2030. This time, it is not entirely sure what Tesla's plan actually entails. The text, which reads as though it was written by AI, is at times anodyne, at times confusing, but always free of specifics.</p>
<p>Each iteration of the master plan is Tesla's north star, the new plan reads, promising to "to deliver unconstrained sustainability without compromise," whatever that actually means.</p>
<p>"Now, we are combining our manufacturing capabilities with our autonomous prowess to deliver new products and services that will accelerate global prosperity and human thriving driven by economic growth shared by all," reads the plan.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/tesla-has-a-new-master-plan-it-just-doesnt-have-any-specifics/">Read full article</a></p>
