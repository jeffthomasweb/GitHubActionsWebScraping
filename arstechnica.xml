                            <![CDATA[<p>Amazon forced all Prime Video subscribers onto a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-jacks-up-price-of-ad-free-prime-video-by-2-99-starting-in-2024/">new ad-based subscription tier</a> in January 2024 unless users paid more for their subscription type. Now, the tech giant is reportedly showing twice as many ads to subscribers as it did when it started selling ad-based streaming subscriptions.</p>
<p>Currently, anyone who signs up for Amazon Prime (which is $15 per month or $139 per year) gets Prime Video with ads. If they don’t want to see commercials, they have to pay an extra $3 per month. One can also subscribe to Prime Video alone for $9 per month with ads or $12 per month without ads.</p>
<p>When Amazon originally announced the ad tier, it said it would deliver “meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers." Based on “six ad buyers and documents” ad trade publication <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-doubles-prime-video-ad-load/">AdWeek</a> reported viewing, Amazon has determined the average is four to six minutes of advertisements per hour.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/amazon-prime-video-subscribers-sit-through-up-to-6-minutes-of-ads-per-hour/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Human vision relies on photoreceptor cells in the retina that react to visible light and trigger neurons in the optic nerve to send signals to the brain. Degradation of these photoreceptors is the leading cause of vision impairments, including blindness.</p>
<p>However, a team of scientists at China’s Fudan University has recently built prototype retinal implants that can replace the failing photoreceptors and potentially provide infrared vision as a bonus. Sadly, they’ve only been tested in animals, so we’re still rather far away from making them work like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>-style eye augments.</p>
<h2>Vision on chip</h2>
<p>Earlier work on retinal implants that restored at least some degree of vision to the blind involved using electrode arrays that electrically stimulated neurons in the back of the retina, taking the place of the damaged photoreceptor cells. A patient had to wear a camera mounted on a pair of glasses that sent signals to the implant to activate this signaling. These implants required a power source to work, were unreliable, difficult to use, and had limited resolution, and the surgical procedure necessary to put them in the eye was extremely complicated.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/experimental-retina-implants-give-mice-infrared-vision/">Read full article</a></p>

Kennedy Jr. took to social media Wednesday to announce the names of <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1932899858920120692">eight people he is appointing</a> to a critical federal vaccine advisory committee—which is currently empty after Kennedy abruptly fired all 17 previous members Monday.</p>
<p>In the past, the vetting process for appointing new members to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) could take years. But Kennedy has taken just two days.</p>
<p>The panel, typically stocked with vaccine, infectious disease, and public health experts, carefully and publicly reviews, analyzes, and debates vaccine data and offers recommendations to the CDC via votes. The CDC typically adopts the recommendations, which set clinical practices nationwide and determine insurance coverage for vaccinations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/yep-rfk-jr-appoints-anti-vaccine-advocates-to-cdc-vaccine-panel/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—When Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi introduced the new multitasking UI in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apple-aims-for-more-personal-and-expressive-ios-26-with-new-liquid-glass-design/">iPadOS 26</a> at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference this week, he did it the same way he introduced the Calculator app for the iPad last year, or timers in the iPad's Clock app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/ipados-18-could-ship-with-built-in-calculator-app-after-14-calculator-less-years/">the year before</a>—with a hint of sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Wow," Federighi enthuses in a lightly exaggerated tone about an hour and 19 minutes into <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/101/">a 90-minute presentation</a>. "More windows, a pointier pointer, and a menu bar? Who would've thought? We've <em>truly</em> pulled off a <em>mind-blowing </em>release!"</p>
<p>This elicits a sensible chuckle from the gathered audience of developers, media, and Apple employees watching the keynote on the Apple Park campus, where I have grabbed myself a good-not-great seat to watch the largely pre-recorded keynote on a gigantic outdoor screen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apples-craig-federighi-on-the-long-road-to-the-ipads-mac-like-multitasking/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In early June, Apple researchers <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">released</a> a study suggesting that simulated reasoning (SR) models, such as OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">o1</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">o3</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">DeepSeek-R1</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking</a>, produce outputs consistent with pattern-matching from training data when faced with novel problems requiring systematic thinking. The researchers found similar results to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/">recent study by the United States of <span data-huuid="4951512150826999828">America Mathematical Olympiad</span></a> (USAMO) in April, showing that these same models achieved low scores on novel mathematical proofs.</p>
<p>The new study, titled "The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity," comes from a team at Apple led by Parshin Shojaee and Iman Mirzadeh, and it includes contributions from Keivan Alizadeh, Maxwell Horton, Samy Bengio, and Mehrdad Farajtabar.</p>
<p>The researchers examined what they call "large reasoning models" (LRMs), which attempt to simulate a logical reasoning process by producing a deliberative text output sometimes called "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">chain-of-thought</a> reasoning" that ostensibly assists with solving problems in a step-by-step fashion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/new-apple-study-challenges-whether-ai-models-truly-reason-through-problems/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>This coming weekend will see the annual 24 Hours of Le Mans take place in France. In total, <a href="https://assets.lemans.org/explorer/pdf/courses/2025/24-heures-du-mans/Affiches/guide-spotter-24h-2025.pdf">62 cars will compete</a>, split into three different classes. At the front of the field are the very fastest hypercars—wickedly fast prototypes that are also all hybrids, with the exception of the V12 Aston Martin Valkyries. In the middle are the pro-am LMP2s, followed by 24 GT3 cars—modified versions of performance cars that include everything from Ford Mustangs to McLaren 720s. It is racing nirvana. But with so many different makes and models of cars in the Hypercar class, some two-wheel drive, others with all-wheel drive, how do they ensure it's a fair race?</p>
<h2>Get ready for some acronyms</h2>
<p>Sports car racing can be (needlessly) complicated at times. Take the Hypercar class at Le Mans. The 21 cars that will contest it are actually built to two separate rulebooks.</p>
<p>One, called LMH (for Le Mans Hypercar), was written by the organizers of Le Mans and the World Endurance Championship. These prototypes can be hybrids, with the electric motor on the front axle: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/the-499p-meet-ferraris-beautiful-new-le-mans-hybrid-prototype/">Ferrari</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/peugeot-plans-to-win-le-mans-in-2022-with-this-9x8-hybrid-prototype/">Peugeot</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/toyota-wants-to-win-le-mans-with-its-new-gr010-hybrid-prototype/">Toyota</a> have all taken this route. But they don't have to be; the Aston Martin Valkyrie already had to lose a lot of power to meet the rules, so it just relies on its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/12-cylinders-11000rpm-aston-martins-new-engine-is-a-monster/">big V12</a> to do all the work. Most of the cars are purpose-built for the race, but Aston Martin <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/aston-martin-will-take-a-detuned-valkyrie-hypercar-endurance-racing-in-2025/">went the other route and converted a road car</a> for racing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/how-does-le-mans-ensure-a-fair-race-between-different-makes-of-car/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Generative AI is permeating the Internet, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/cursor-ai-support-bot-invents-fake-policy-and-triggers-user-uproar/">chatbots</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/the-gmail-app-will-now-create-ai-summaries-whether-you-want-them-or-not/">AI summaries</a> popping up faster than we can keep track. Even Wikipedia, the vast repository of knowledge famously maintained by an army of <em>volunteer</em> human editors, is looking to add robots to the mix. The site began testing AI summaries in some articles over the past week, but the project has been frozen after editors voiced their opinions. And that opinion is: "yuck."</p>
<p>The seeds of this project were planted at Wikimedia's 2024 conference, where foundation representatives and editors <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Readers/2024_Reader_and_Donor_Experiences/Content_Discovery/Wikimania_2024,_%22Written_by_AI%22_How_do_editors_and_machines_collaborate_to_create_content">discussed</a> how AI could advance Wikipedia's mission. The wiki on the so-called "Simple Article Summaries" notes that the editors who participated in the discussion believed the summaries could improve learning on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/">404 Media</a>, Wikipedia announced the opt-in AI pilot on June 2, which was set to run for two weeks on the mobile version of the site. The summaries appeared at the top of select articles in a collapsed form. Users had to tap to expand and read the full summary. The AI text also included a highlighted "Unverified" badge.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/yuck-wikipedia-pauses-ai-summaries-after-editor-revolt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, Disney and <span data-schema="smart-brevity">NBCUniversal</span> filed a lawsuit against AI image-synthesis company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/midjourney-introduces-first-new-image-generation-model-in-over-a-year/">Midjourney</a>, accusing the company of copyright infringement for allowing users to create images of characters like Darth Vader and Shrek, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-universal-midjourney-1236262563/">reports</a> The Hollywood Reporter. The complaint, filed in US District Court in Los Angeles, marks the first major legal action by Hollywood studios against a generative AI company.</p>
<p>Midjourney is a subscription image-synthesis service and community that allows its users to submit written descriptions called prompts to an AI model that generates new images based on them. It has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artist-finds-private-medical-record-photos-in-popular-ai-training-data-set/">well-known for years</a> that AI image-synthesis models such as the ones that power Midjourney have been trained on copyrighted artworks without rights holder permission.</p>
<p>The lawsuit describes San Francisco-based Midjourney as a "bottomless pit of plagiarism" that enables users to generate what the studios call "AI slop"—personalized images of copyrighted characters. Disney Enterprises, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century, Universal City Studios Productions, and DreamWorks Animation joined forces in the legal filing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/in-landmark-suit-disney-and-universal-sue-midjourney-for-ai-character-theft/">Read full article</a></p>

A Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/x-twitter-ad-revenue-campaign-lawsuit-a882b5c6">report</a> yesterday said that Verizon and other companies started advertising on X after lawsuit threats.</p>
<p>X <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/elon-musk-declares-it-is-war-on-ad-industry-as-x-sues-over-illegal-boycott/">sued some advertisers</a> last year over what it claims is an illegal boycott and reportedly threatened to add other companies to the lawsuit if they didn't buy ads. The WSJ article said that Verizon, which hadn't advertised on X since 2022, was told late last year that it would be added to the lawsuit if it didn't buy ads. Verizon subsequently pledged to spend at least $10 million on the platform this year, the article said.</p>
<p>"Fashion company Ralph Lauren also agreed to resume buying ads on X after receiving a lawsuit threat, people familiar with the matter said," according to the report. "All told, at least six companies that had either received lawsuit threats or were motivated in part by pressure tactics have struck ad deals with X, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The agreements include both firm ad-spending commitments and nonbinding targets."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/verizon-bought-10m-in-ads-on-x-to-avoid-lawsuit-from-musk-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">announced</a> that o3-pro, a new version of its most capable simulated reasoning model, is now available to ChatGPT Pro and Team users, replacing o1-pro in the model picker. The company also reduced API pricing for o3-pro by 87 percent compared to o1-pro while cutting o3 prices by 80 percent. While "reasoning" is useful for some analytical tasks, new studies have posed fundamental questions about what the word actually means when applied to these AI systems.</p>
<p>We'll take a deeper look at "reasoning" in a minute, but first, let's examine what's new. While OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-releases-new-simulated-reasoning-models-with-full-tool-access/">originally launched</a> o3 (non-pro) in April, the o3-pro model focuses on mathematics, science, and coding while adding new capabilities like web search, file analysis, image analysis, and Python execution. Since these tool integrations slow response times (longer than the already slow o1-pro), OpenAI recommends using the model for complex problems where accuracy matters more than speed. However, they do not necessarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/">confabulate less</a> than "non-reasoning" AI models (they still introduce factual errors), which is a significant caveat when seeking accurate results.</p>
<p>Beyond the reported performance improvements, OpenAI announced a substantial price reduction for developers. O3-pro costs $20 per million input tokens and $80 per million output tokens in the API, making it 87 percent cheaper than o1-pro. The company also reduced the price of the standard o3 model by 80 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amid all the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/gemini-2-5-is-leaving-preview-just-in-time-for-googles-new-250-ai-subscription/">Gemini hype</a> at Google I/O last month, the company also turned one of its experiments into a (kind of) real product. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/google-is-serious-about-its-giant-video-chat-booths-starts-real-world-testing/">Project Starline</a> was reborn as Google Beam, a 3D video conferencing system that makes it look like you're in the same room with the other party. Google said HP would reveal the first Beam setup, and now it has. The HP Dimension is coming this year, and the price tag is a predictably hefty $24,999.</p>
<p>Google Beam calls for a lot of advanced hardware, so the high price isn't a surprise. The HP Dimension uses six high-speed cameras positioned around the display to capture the speaker from multiple angles. This visual data is then fed into Google's proprietary volumetric video model, which merges the streams together into a 3D reconstruction of the speaker.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be Beam systems of various sizes, but the HP model comes with a big 65-inch display. All Beam systems will use light field screen technology, which can show the volumetric model in 3D, eliminating the need to wear a headset or glasses for the 3D effect. Google says Beam can show minute details at 60 fps with millimeter-scale precision.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/hp-reveals-first-google-beam-3d-video-conferencing-setup-priced-at-25000/">Read full article</a></p>

<p><em>Foundation</em>, Apple TV+'s lavish adaptation (or re-mix, if you prefer) of Isaac Asimov's seminal sci-fi series, returns for its third season next month, and the streaming platform has dropped an official trailer to give us a taste of what's in store.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/the-third-crisis-dawns-in-foundation-s3-teaser/">previously reported</a>, the first season ended with a major time jump of 138 years, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/07/catching-up-with-foundation-s2-as-the-second-crisis-unfolds/">S2 focused</a> on the Second Crisis: imminent war between Empire and the Foundation, along with an enemy seeking to destroy Empire from within. The Foundation, meanwhile, adopted the propaganda tactics of religion to recruit new acolytes to the cause. We also met a colony of "Mentalics" with psionic abilities. We're getting another mega time jump for the Third Crisis.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The governing body for world motorsport met in Macau yesterday. Among the jobs for the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile was to sign off on various calendars for next season, which is why there's now a clash between the F1 Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans and also between the Indy 500 and F1's annual visit to Canada. The Formula E calendar was also announced, although with a pair of blank TBCs in the middle, I'll hold off calling it finalized.</p>
<p>The US round will now take place in late January, and it's moving venues yet again. No longer will you need to drive an hour south of Miami; instead, the northern outskirts of the city will suffice. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/formula-e-still-searching-for-a-place-in-america-to-call-home/">The infield at Homestead is no more</a>, and the sport has negotiated a race at the Hard Rock Stadium, albeit on a different layout than the one used by F1. It seems that Formula E's recent "Evo Sessions" <a href="https://www.the-race.com/formula-e/what-actually-happened-at-formula-es-celebrity-race-extravaganza/">race between influencers</a>, which was held at the stadium, proved convincing.</p>
<p>The really interesting Formula E news from Macau won't take effect until the 2026–2027 season, and that's the arrival of the Gen4 car.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/all-wheel-drive-evs-at-210-mph-formula-es-next-car-gets-massive-upgrade/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a post on his Truth Social network on Wednesday the US president hailed a breakthrough reached in bilateral talks in London late the night before.</p>
<p>The deal revived a trade truce agreed in Geneva last month that subsequently faltered because of differences over Chinese rare earth exports and US export controls.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/trade-war-truce-between-us-and-china-is-back-on/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Audi provided flights from Washington, DC, to Denver and accommodation so Ars could drive the Q5 and SQ5, as well as two other models you can read about next week. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>ASPEN, Colo.—There's a lot riding on Audi's next Q5. The model has been Audi's bread and butter here since the model went on sale in the US in 2009, as tastes changed and sedans fell out of favor. The third-generation Q5 is built on an all-new platform and is one of a new generation of software-defined vehicles that's meant to ditch a lot of legacy crud for a clean sheet approach. You would have known all of that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/audi-replaces-its-bestseller-heres-the-next-q5-suv/">from our look at the new Q5 in a studio last year</a>, when Audi briefed us on its new platform. What you wouldn't have known from that piece is how it drives, particularly on US roads. The answer is: surprisingly well.</p>
<h2>PPC</h2>
<p>Just a few years ago, the world's big car brands were telling us that soon everyone would be driving electric cars, and that it would be wonderful. Things haven't quite panned out the way people thought they might when prognosticating in 2018, though. Electric powertrains have yet to reach price parity, in many places infrastructure still lags, and so <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/porsche-and-audi-among-the-oems-planning-more-ice-and-hybrids/">automakers are developing new combustion-powered vehicles</a>, particularly for markets like the US, where adoption remains far behind Europe or China.</p>
<p>For Audi and the other premium brands within the Volkswagen Group empire, that's a new platform called PPC, or Premium Platform Combustion. PPC will provide the bones for new vehicles in a range of sizes and shapes, the same way the MLB (and MLB Evo) platforms have done until now. In a week, you can read about the A5, for example, but as the sales figures show, SUVs are what people want, so the Q5 comes first.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/the-new-version-of-audis-best-selling-q5-suv-arrives-in-the-us/">Read full article</a></p>

What they were lacking, though, was a way to quickly connect this natural movement to perception—the robotic equivalent of the reflexes that let you catch a ball or duck in an instant to avoid getting hit.</p>
<p>So, a team of scientists at ETH Zürich got busy fixing this problem. “I wanted to fuse perception and body movement,” said Yuntao Ma, a roboticist who led a team developing an AI-powered, badminton-playing robot.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/scientists-built-a-badminton-playing-robot-with-ai-powered-skills/">Read full article</a></p>

So it was with no small sense of urgency that the group scrambled to assemble a jury-rigged antenna to talk to a spacecraft that would soon come whizzing over the horizon.
