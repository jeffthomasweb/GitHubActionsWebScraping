<p>When Tesla recorded <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/tesla-reports-its-first-annual-profit/">its first annual profit in 2020</a>, it had done something fairly remarkable. Starting a new car company has never been easy. It's harder still when those cars are electric and outside your average buyer's comfort zone; <a href="https://jalopnik.com/15-failed-electric-vehicle-startups-that-never-made-it-1850510650/">more than a dozen</a> have tried <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/18/why-so-many-electric-vehicle-startups-fail.html">and failed</a> since Tesla was founded in 2003. Even mighty Apple, with all its billions in the bank, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/after-a-decade-of-stops-and-starts-apple-kills-its-electric-car-project/">thought better of it</a>. So why, after all that hard work, would Tesla's CEO now tell everyone that Tesla is an AI company?</p>
<p>The company's greatest successes have come when it innovates, like when it realized that laptop cells were about energy-dense enough to power a sports car if you just had enough of them. Building out a reliable fast-charging network was another such innovation. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also never been afraid to chase a trend, and the hype du jour is artificial intelligence, a field that attracted more than $67 billion in investment last year.</p>
<p>"We are an AI, robotics company; if you value us otherwise, the right answer is impossible to the questions being asked," Musk told investors and journalists in April.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040824#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040824&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hackers delivered malware to Windows and Mac users by compromising their Internet service provider and then tampering with software updates delivered over unsecure connections, researchers said.</p>
<p>The attack, researchers from security firm Volexity said, worked by hacking routers or similar types of device infrastructure of an unnamed ISP. The attackers then used their control of the devices to poison domain name system responses for legitimate hostnames providing updates for at least six different apps written for Windows or macOS. The apps affected were the 5KPlayer, Quick Heal, Rainmeter, Partition Wizard, and those from Corel and Sogou.</p>
<h2>These aren’t the update servers you’re looking for</h2>
<p>Because the update mechanisms didn’t use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> or cryptographic signatures to authenticate the connections or downloaded software, the threat actors were able to use their control of the ISP infrastructure to successfully perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">machine-in-the-middle</a> (MitM) attacks that directed targeted users to hostile servers rather than the ones operated by the affected software makers. These redirections worked even when users employed non-encrypted public DNS services such as Google’s 8.8.8.8 or Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 rather than the authoritative DNS server provided by the ISP.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041175#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041175&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The dose makes the medicine—and for many critical prescription drugs, the dose depends on a patient's body weight. Usually, this is not a problem; weight changes large enough to significantly affect dosages often occur gradually, over periods long enough for doctors to notice and adjust prescriptions. But, in the era of new weight loss drugs, that may no longer be the case.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2821728">a cautionary tale published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>, researchers at the University of Colorado reported the case of a man who lost nearly 30 percent of his body weight in a six-month period using a new weight loss drug. Then, he showed up at an emergency department with heart palpitations, excessive sweating, confusion, fever, and hand tremors. Tests indicated the man had <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atrial-fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</a>, an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to heart failure and stroke without treatment.</p>
<p>The 62-year-old had no history of atrial fibrillation, but he had previously been diagnosed with obesity, Type 1 diabetes, and hypothyroidism (a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone). For his hypothyroidism, he took levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone that is dosed by weight.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041166#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041166&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a">The Wall Street Journal</a>, there's internal conflict at OpenAI over whether or not to release a watermarking tool that would allow people to test text to see whether it was generated by ChatGPT or not.</p>
<p>To deploy the tool, OpenAI would make tweaks to ChatGPT that would lead it to leave a trail in the text it generates that can be detected by a special tool. The watermark would be undetectable by human readers without the tool, and the company's internal testing has shown that it does not negatively affect the quality of outputs. The detector would be accurate 99.9 percent of the time. It's important to note that the watermark would be a pattern in the text itself, meaning it would be preserved if the user copies and pastes the text or even if they make modest edits to it.</p>
<p>Some OpenAI employees have campaigned for the tool's release, but others believe that would be the wrong move, citing a few specific problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041148#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041148&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's long been a hotly debated open question regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramid_construction_techniques">how the great pyramids of Egypt were built</a>, given the sheer size and weight of the limestone blocks used for the construction. Numerous speculative (and controversial) hypotheses have been proposed, including the use of ramps, levers, cranes, winches, hoists, pivots, or any combination thereof. Now we can add the possible use of a hydraulic lift to those speculative scenarios. According to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306690">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE, ancient Egyptians during the Third Dynasty may have at least partly relied on hydraulics to build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser">Step Pyramid of Djoser</a>.</p>
<p>"Many theories on pyramid construction suggest that pure human strength, possibly aided by basic mechanical devices like levers and ramps, was utilized," co-author Xavier Landreau, of Paleotechnic in Paris and Universite Grenoble Alpes, told Ars. "Our analysis led us to the utilization of water as a means of raising stones. We are skeptical that the largest pyramids were built using only known ramp and lever methods."</p>
<p>The Step Pyramid was built around 2680 BCE, part of a funerary complex for the Third Dynasty pharaoh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djoser">Djoser</a>. It's located in the Saqqara necropolis and was the first pyramid to be built, almost a "proto-pyramid" that originally stood some 205 feet high. (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a>, by contrast, stood 481 feet high and was the tallest human-made structure for nearly 4,000 years.) Previous monuments were made of mud brick, but Djoser's Step Pyramid is made of stone (specifically limestone); it's widely thought that Djoser's vizier, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imhotep">Imhotep</a>, designed and built the complex. The third century BCE historian Manetho once described Imhotep as the "inventor of building in stone." As such, the Djoser Pyramid influenced the construction of later, larger pyramids during the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Dynasties.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040905#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040905&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google just lost a massive antitrust trial over its sprawling search business, as US district judge Amit Mehta released his <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/US-v-Google-Opinion-8-5-2024.pdf">ruling</a>, showing that he sided with the US Department of Justice in the case that could disrupt how billions of people search the web.</p>
<p>"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta wrote in his opinion. “It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.”</p>
<p>The verdict will likely come as a shock to Google, which had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/judge-mulls-sanctions-over-googles-shocking-destruction-of-internal-chats/">long argued</a> that punishing Google for being the best in search would be "unprecedented" and frequently pointed to the DOJ's lack of direct evidence. However, Mehta found the limited direct evidence compelling, especially "Google’s admission that it does not 'consider whether users will go to other specific search providers (general or otherwise) if it introduces a change to its Search product.'"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041103#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041103&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission's hopes of enforcing net neutrality rules was dealt a major setback last week. A panel of appeals court judges blocked the regulations on Thursday in a ruling that said broadband providers are likely to win the case on the merits.</p>
<p>The US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/net-neutrality-rules-temporarily-stayed-as-judges-weigh-impact-of-scotus-ruling/">issued an administrative stay</a> that delayed enforcement of the rules for a few weeks, which didn't necessarily indicate much about the judges' view of the lawsuit. But on Thursday, the judges issued an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/net-neutrality-block-august-2024.pdf">order</a> that stays the net neutrality rules until the court makes a final ruling, and judges made it clear they believe the Internet service providers have a stronger case than the FCC.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Google Chrome's long, long project to implement a new browser extension platform is seemingly going to happen, for real, after six years of cautious movement.</p>
<p>One of the first ways people are seeing this is if they use uBlock Origin, a popular ad-blocking extension, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-chrome-warns-ublock-origin-may-soon-be-disabled/">as noted by Bleeping Computer</a>. Recently, Chrome users have seen warnings pop up that "This extension may soon no longer be supported," with links asking the user to "Remove or replace it with similar extensions" from Chrome's Web Store. You might see a similar warning on some extensions if you head to Chrome's Extensions page (chrome://extensions).</p>
<p>What's happening is Chrome preparing to make Manifest V3 required for extensions that want to run on its platform. <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/trustworthy-chrome-extensions-by-default.html">First announced in 2018</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-starts-deprecating-older-more-capable-chrome-extensions-next-week/">last word</a> on Manifest V3 was that V2 extensions would start being nudged out in early June on the Beta, Dev, and Canary update channels. Users will be able to manually re-enable V2 extensions "for a short time," <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline">Google has said</a>, "but over time, this toggle will go away as well." The shift for enterprise Chrome deployments is expected to be put off until June 2025.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041032#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041032&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/breaking-elon-musk-drops-claims-that-openai-abandoned-mission/">withdrawing his lawsuit in June</a> for unknown reasons, Elon Musk has revived a complaint accusing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of fraudulently inducing Musk to contribute $44 million in seed funding by promising that OpenAI would always open-source its technology and prioritize serving the public good over profits as a permanent nonprofit.</p>
<p>Instead, Musk alleged that Altman and his co-conspirators—"preying on Musk’s humanitarian concern about the existential dangers posed by artificial intelligence"—always intended to "betray" these promises in pursuit of personal gains.</p>
<p>As OpenAI's technology advanced toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and strove to surpass human capabilities, "Altman set the bait and hooked Musk with sham altruism then flipped the script as the non-profit’s technology approached AGI and profits neared, mobilizing Defendants to turn OpenAI, Inc. into their personal piggy bank and OpenAI into a moneymaking bonanza, worth billions," Musk's complaint said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041054#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041054&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Distracted driving isn't only a result of drivers using their phones when they should be paying attention. But it is a significant cause of the problem, accounting for at least 13 percent of distracted driving deaths and rising to 1 in 5 for young drivers. Now, a study conducted with customers of the Progressive insurance company has tested different strategies to get those drivers to put their phones down in the car, and it found two that significantly reduced handheld use, with the effect persisting after the end of the study.</p>
<p>The study recruited 1,653 customers already enrolled in its Progressive Snapshot program, which involves the use of a smartphone app that detects phone use while driving. Before the start of the trial, the participants all averaged more than 6.4 minutes per hour of handheld use while driving—Progressive says its safest customers have handheld usage of less than 1 minute per hour while driving.</p>
<h2>Five test groups</h2>
<p>The drivers were split into five different arms, each with increasing amounts of intervention. The first group just received education about the problem, such as statistics about state laws that ban phone use while driving, increased crash risks, and recommendations to use hands-free options like a phone mount or casting interface instead.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041031#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041031&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>NASA is planning to significantly delay the launch of the Crew 9 mission to the International Space Station due to ongoing concerns about the Starliner spacecraft currently attached to the station.</p>
<p>While the space agency has not said anything publicly, sources say NASA should announce the decision this week. Officials are contemplating moving the Crew-9 mission from its <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/07/26/nasa-spacex-targeting-aug-18-for-crew-9-mission-to-space-station/">current date</a> of August 18 to September 24, a significant slip.</p>
<p>Nominally, this Crew Dragon mission will carry NASA astronauts Zena Cardman, spacecraft commander; Nick Hague, pilot; and Stephanie Wilson, mission specialist; as well as Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, for a six-month journey to the space station. However, NASA has been considering alternatives to the crew lineup—possibly launching with two astronauts instead of four—due to ongoing discussions about the viability of Starliner to safely return astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to Earth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040999#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040999&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>CrowdStrike has hit back at Delta Air Lines’ threat of litigation against the cyber security company over a botched software update that grounded thousands of flights, denying it was responsible for the carrier’s own IT decisions and days-long disruption.</p>
<p>In a letter on Sunday, lawyers for CrowdStrike argued that the US carrier had created a “misleading narrative” that the cyber security firm was “grossly negligent” in an incident that the US airline has said will cost it $500 million.</p>
<p>Delta took days longer than its rivals to recover when CrowdStrike’s update brought down millions of Windows computers around the world last month. The airline has alerted the cyber security company that it plans to seek damages for the disruptions and hired litigation firm Boies Schiller Flexner.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041007#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041007&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 1972, Janet Rowley sat at her dining room table and cut tiny chromosomes from photographs she had taken in her laboratory. One by one, she snipped out the small figures her children teasingly called paper dolls. She then carefully laid them out in 23 matching pairs—and warned her kids not to sneeze.</p>
<p>The physician-scientist had just mastered a new chromosome-staining technique in a year-long sabbatical at Oxford. But it was in the dining room of her Chicago home where she made the discovery that would dramatically alter the course of cancer research.</p>

<p>As often happens during the month of July, the Atlantic tropics entered a lull after Hurricane Beryl struck Texas and short-lived Tropical Storm Chris moved into Mexico. But now, with African dust diminishing from the atmosphere and August well underway, the oceans have awoken.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/095141.shtml?cone#contents">Tropical Storm Debby</a> formed this weekend, and according to forecasters with the National Hurricane Center, the system is likely to reach Category 1 hurricane status before making landfall along the coastal bend of western Florida on Monday.</p>
<p>As hurricanes go, this is not the most threatening storm the Sunshine State has seen in recent years. Yes, no one likes a hurricane, or the storm surge it brings. But Debby is likely to strike a relatively unpopulated area of Florida, venting much of its fury on preserves and wildlife areas. This won't be pleasant by any means, but as hurricanes go this one should be fairly manageable from a wind and surge standpoint.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040979#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040979&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When lawmakers in Washington set out to expand a lucrative tax break for the state’s data center industry in 2022, they included what some considered an essential provision: a study of the energy-hungry industry’s impact on the state’s electrical grid.</p>
<p>Gov. Jay Inslee vetoed that provision but let the tax break expansion go forward.

<p>Among the many obstacles to enacting federal limits on climate pollution, none has been more daunting than the Supreme Court. That is where the Obama administration’s efforts to regulate power plant emissions met their demise and where the Biden administration’s attempts will no doubt land.</p>
<p>A forthcoming study seeks to inform how courts consider challenges to these regulations by establishing once and for all that the lawmakers who shaped the Clean Air Act in 1970 knew scientists considered carbon dioxide an air pollutant, and that these elected officials were intent on limiting its emissions.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040871#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040871&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Have you seen Google's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgtHJKn0Mck">"Dear Sydney" ad</a>? The one where a young girl wants to write a fan letter to Olympic hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone? To which the girl's dad responds that he is "pretty good with words but this has to be <em>just right"</em>? And so, to be <em>just right</em>, he suggests that the daughter get Google's Gemini AI to write a first draft of the letter?</p>
<p>If you're watching the Olympics, you have undoubtedly seen it—because the ad has been everywhere. Until today. After a string of negative commentary about the ad's dystopian implications, Google has pulled the "Dear Sydney" ad from TV. In a statement to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/google-pulls-dear-sydney-gemini-ai-ad-olympics-1235965087/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the company said, "While the ad tested well before airing, given the feedback, we have decided to phase the ad out of our Olympics rotation."</p>
<p>The backlash was similar to that against Apple's recent ad in which an enormous hydraulic press crushed TVs, musical instruments, record players, paint cans, sculptures, and even emoji into… the newest model of the iPad. Apple apparently wanted to show just how much creative and entertainment potential the iPad held; critics read the ad as a warning image about the destruction of human creativity in a technological age. Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/apple-apologizes-for-ad-that-crushes-the-sum-total-of-human-artistic-endeavor/">apologized</a> soon after.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040972#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040972&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Buying counterfeit weight loss drugs from illegal online pharmacies that don't require prescriptions is, in fact, a very bad idea, according to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821882">study published Friday in JAMA Network Open</a>.</p>
<p> The counterfeit drugs are sold as equivalents to the blockbuster semaglutide drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, which are prescription only. When researchers got their hands on three illegal versions, they found that the counterfeit drugs had low-purity semaglutide, had dosages that exceeded the labeled amount, and one had signs of bacterial contamination.</p>
<p>The three substandard drugs tested came from three different illegal online pharmacies, which sold them as generic semaglutide drugs for weight loss, appetite suppression, diabetes, and cardiovascular health. However, the researchers, led by scientists at the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Pécs in Hungary, had initially tried purchasing counterfeit drugs from six such sellers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040959#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040959&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Department of Justice <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/US-v-ByteDance-Complaint-8-2-2024.pdf">sued</a> TikTok today, accusing the short-video platform of illegally collecting data on millions of kids and demanding a permanent injunction "to put an end to TikTok’s unlawful massive-scale invasions of children’s privacy."</p>
<p>The DOJ said that TikTok had violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA Rule), claiming that TikTok allowed kids "to create and access accounts without their parents’ knowledge or consent," collected "data from those children," and failed to "comply with parents’ requests to delete their children’s accounts and information."</p>
<p>The COPPA Rule requires TikTok to prove that it does not target kids as its primary audience, the DOJ said, and TikTok claims to satisfy that "by requiring users creating accounts to report their birthdates."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040944#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040944&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If there was something wrong with an old game, or you wanted to make a different version of it, and you wanted people to help you fix that, you typically did that on RomHacking.net. After this week, you'll have to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, the site has been home to some remarkable remakes, translations, fix-ups, and experiments. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/so-long-slowdown-new-hack-runs-snes-star-fox-at-up-to-60-fps/"><em>Star Fox </em>running at 60 fps</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/a-christmas-gift-from-game-boy-rom-hackers-super-mario-land-2-in-color/"><em>Super Mario Land 2</em> in color</a>, a fix for <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s bad smoke, even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/we-traced-namcos-new-pac-man-demake-to-its-source-a-2008-fan-romhack/">a <em>Pac-Man</em> "demake" that Namco spiffed up and resold</a>—and that's not even counting the stuff that was pulled down by corporate cease-and-desist actions. It's a remarkable collection, one that encompasses both very obscure and mainstream games and well worth preserving.</p>
<p>Preserved it will be, but it seems that the RomHacking site will not go on further. The site's founder <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=39405">posted a sign-off statement to the site Thursday night</a>, one that in turn praised the community, decried certain members of it, and looked forward to what will happen with "the next generation."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040891#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040891&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
