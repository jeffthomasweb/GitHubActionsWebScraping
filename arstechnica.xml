              <![CDATA[<p>In what is becoming a sadly regular occurrence, two popular free software projects, X.org/Freedesktop.org and Alpine Linux, need to rally some of their millions of users so that they can continue operating.</p>
<p>Both services have largely depended on free server resources provided by <a href="https://www.equinix.com/">Equinix</a> (formerly Packet.net) and its Metal division for the past few years. Equinix announced recently that it was <a href="https://deploy.equinix.com/blog/sunsetting-equinix-metal/">sunsetting its bare-metal sales and services</a>, or renting out physically distinct single computers rather than virtualized and shared hardware. As <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Alpine-Linux-Infra-Crisis">reported by the Phronix blog</a>, both free software organizations have until the end of April to find and fund new hosting, with some fairly demanding bandwidth and development needs.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/-/issues/655">issue ticket</a> on Freedesktop.org's GitLab repository provides the story and the nitty-gritty needs of that project. Both the X.org foundation (home of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-x-window-system-is-40-archaic-as-heck-and-still-relevant/">the 40-year-old window system</a>) and Freedesktop.org (a shared base of specifications and technology for free software desktops, including Wayland and <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/">many more</a>) used Equinix's donated space.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/popular-linux-orgs-freedesktop-and-alpine-linux-are-scrambling-for-new-web-hosting/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like a lot of the rest of the federal government right now, NASA is reeling during the first turbulent days of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The last two weeks have brought a change in leadership in the form of interim administrator Janet Petro, whose ascension was a surprise. Her first act <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/nasa-moves-swiftly-to-end-dei-programs-ask-employees-to-report-violations/">was to tell agency employees</a> to remove diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility contracts and to "report" on anyone who did not carry out this order. Soon, civil servants began receiving emails from the US Office of Personnel Management that some perceived as an effort to push them to resign.</p>
<p>Then there are the actions of SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Last week <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/why-did-elon-musk-just-say-trump-wants-to-bring-two-stranded-astronauts-home/">he sowed doubt</a> by claiming NASA had "stranded" astronauts on the space station. (The astronauts are perfectly safe and have a ride home.) Perhaps more importantly, he owns the space agency's most important contractor and, in recent weeks, has become deeply enmeshed in operating the US government through his Department of Government Efficiency. For some NASA employees, whether or not it is true, there is now an uncomfortable sense that they are working for Musk and to dole out contracts to SpaceX.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/as-nasa-flies-into-turbulence-the-agency-could-use-a-steady-hand/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Study provides evidence that our relatives have a "theory of mind."]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A lot of human society requires what's called a "theory of mind"—the ability to infer the mental state of another person and adjust our actions based on what we expect they know and are thinking. We don't always get this right—it's easy to get confused about what someone else might be thinking—but we still rely on it to navigate through everything from complicated social situations to avoid bumping into people on the street.</p>
<p>There's some mixed evidence that other animals have a limited theory of mind, but there are alternate interpretations for most of it. So two researchers at Johns Hopkins, Luke Townrow and Christopher Krupenye, came up with a way of testing whether some of our closest living relatives, the bonobos, could infer the state of mind of a human they were cooperating with. The work clearly showed that the bonobos could tell when their human partner was ignorant.</p>
<h2>Now you see it...</h2>
<p>The experimental approach is quite simple, and involves a setup familiar to street hustlers: a set of three cups, with a treat placed under one of them. Except in this case, there's no sleight-of-hand in that the chimp can watch as one experimenter places the treat under a cup, and all of the cups remain stationary throughout the experiment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/bonobos-know-when-youre-clueless/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Even the most permissive corporate AI models have sensitive topics that their creators would prefer they not discuss (e.g., weapons of mass destruction, illegal activities, or, uh, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/the-questions-the-chinese-government-doesnt-want-deepseek-ai-to-answer/">Chinese political history</a>). Over the years, enterprising AI users have resorted to everything from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/08/researchers-figure-out-how-to-make-ai-misbehave-serve-up-prohibited-content/">weird text strings</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/researchers-use-ascii-art-to-elicit-harmful-responses-from-5-major-ai-chatbots/">ASCII art</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/sob-story-about-dead-grandma-tricks-microsoft-ai-into-solving-captcha/">stories about dead grandmas</a> in order to jailbreak those models into giving the "forbidden" results.</p>
<p>Today, Claude model maker Anthropic has <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers">released a new system of Constitutional Classifiers</a> that it says can "filter the overwhelming majority" of those kinds of jailbreaks. And now that the system has held up to over 3,000 hours of bug bounty attacks, Anthropic is inviting the wider public to <a href="https://claude.ai/constitutional-classifiers">test out the system</a> to see if it can fool it into breaking its own rules.</p>
<h2>Respect the constitution</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18837">a new paper</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers">accompanying blog post</a>, Anthropic says its new Constitutional Classifier system is spun off from the similar <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073">Constitutional AI system</a> that was used to build its Claude model. The system relies at its core on a "constitution" of natural language rules defining broad categories of permitted (e.g., listing common medications) and disallowed (e.g., acquiring restricted chemicals) content for the model.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/anthropic-dares-you-to-jailbreak-its-new-ai-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Artemiy Pavlov, the founder of a small but mighty music software brand called Sinesvibes, spent more than 15 years building a YouTube channel with all original content to promote his business' products. Over all those years, he never had any issues with YouTube's automated content removal system—until Monday, when YouTube, without issuing a single warning, abruptly deleted his entire channel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"What a 'nice' way to start a week!" Pavlov <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sinevibes.bsky.social/post/3lhazuyn5as2t">posted</a> on Bluesky. "Our channel on YouTube has been deleted due to 'spam and deceptive policies.' Which is the biggest WTF moment in our brand's history on social platforms. We have only posted demos of our own original products, never anything else...."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Officially, YouTube told Pavlov that his channel violated YouTube's "spam, deceptive practices, and scam policy," but Pavlov could think of no videos that might be labeled as violative.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/youtube-briefly-banned-15-year-old-channel-with-no-strikes-and-wont-say-why/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>According to Amazonian folklore, the area's male river dolphins are shapeshifters <em>(encantade</em>), transforming at night into handsome young men who seduce and impregnate human women. The legend's origins may lie in the fact that dolphins have rather human-like genitalia. A group of Canadian biologists didn't spot any suspicious shapeshifting behavior over the four years they spent monitoring a dolphin population in central Brazil, but they did document 36 cases of another human-like behavior: what appears to be some sort of cetacean pissing contest.</p>
<p>Specifically, the male dolphins rolled over onto their backs, displayed their male members, and launched a stream of urine as high as 3 feet into the air. This usually occurred when other males were around, who seemed fascinated in turn by the arching streams of pee, even chasing after them with their snouts. It's possibly a form of chemical sensory communication and not merely a need to relieve themselves, according to the biologists, who described their findings in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635725000117?via%3Dihub">a paper</a> published in the journal Behavioral Processes.

            <![CDATA[“A little pain”: Trump finally admits tariffs heap costs on Americans.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over the weekend, President Trump issued executive orders heaping significant additional tariffs on America's biggest trading partners, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/imposing-duties-to-address-the-flow-of-illicit-drugs-across-our-national-border/">Canada</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/imposing-duties-to-address-the-synthetic-opioid-supply-chain-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">China</a>, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/imposing-duties-to-address-the-situation-at-our-southern-border/">Mexico</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To justify the tariffs—"a 25 percent additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent additional tariff on imports from China"—Trump claimed that all partners were allowing drugs and immigrants to illegally enter the US. Declaring a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump's orders seemed bent on "downplaying" the potential economic impact on Americans, AP News <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trumps-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-taxes-910cf9a18fce654597a30dbaaa8d1576">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But very quickly, the trade policy sparked inflation fears, with industry associations representing major US firms from many sectors warning of potentially derailed supply chains and spiked consumer costs of cars, groceries, consumer technology, and more. Perhaps the biggest pain will be felt by car buyers already frustrated by high prices if car prices go up by $3,000, as Bloomberg <a href="ttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-02/car-prices-face-3-000-increase-as-trump-tariffs-hit-auto-sector">reported</a>. And as Trump eyes expanding tariffs to the European Union next, <a href="https://shop.cta.tech/collections/Research/products/how-the-proposed-trump-tariffs-increase-prices-for-consumer-technology-products-january-2025?_gl=1*cw7o63*_gcl_au*MTYxMjQwMDY0OS4xNzM4NjAxMTg0*_ga*MTE1MDkyNzEyNi4xNzM4NjAxMTg0*_ga_5P7N8TBME7*MTczODYwMTE4My4xLjEuMTczODYwMTE5OC40NS4wLjA.&amp;_ga=2.193131365.991597469.1738601184-1150927126.1738601184">January research</a> from the Consumer Technology Association showed that imposing similar tariffs on all countries would increase the cost of laptops by as much as 68 percent, game consoles by up to 58 percent, and smartphones perhaps by 37 percent.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/tariffs-on-biggest-us-trading-partners-likely-to-spike-cost-of-cars-tech/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Two new independent estimates of revenue from SpaceX's Starlink Internet service suggest it is rapidly growing, having nearly tripled in just two years.</p>
<p>An updated projection from the analysts at <a href="https://www.quiltyspace.com/">Quilty Space</a> estimates that the service produced $7.8 billion in revenue in 2024, with about 60 percent of that coming from consumers who subscribe to the service. Similarly, the media publication Payload <a href="https://payloadspace.com/estimating-spacexs-2024-revenue/">estimated</a> that Starlink generated $8.2 billion in revenue last year.</p>
<p>These estimates indicate that Starlink produced a few hundred million dollars in free cash flow for SpaceX in 2024. However, with revenues expected to leap in 2025 to above $12 billion, Quilty Space estimates that free cash flow will grow to about $2 billion. SpaceX is privately held, so its financial numbers are not public.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/starlink-profit-growing-rapidly-as-it-faces-a-moment-of-promise-and-peril/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At this point, anyone following artificial intelligence is familiar with the many (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/26/1107346/the-way-we-measure-progress-in-ai-is-terrible/">often flawed</a>) benchmarks companies use to demonstrate a model's effectiveness at everything from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/new-secret-math-benchmark-stumps-ai-models-and-phds-alike/">math</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/llms-cant-perform-genuine-logical-reasoning-apple-researchers-suggest/">logical reasoning</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/07/can-you-do-better-than-top-level-ai-models-on-these-basic-vision-tests/">vision</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/googles-deepmind-tackles-weather-forecasting-with-great-performance/">weather forecasting</a>. But even careful AI watchers might be less familiar with OpenAI's efforts to test ChatGPT's persuasiveness against users of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/">Reddit's r/ChangeMyView forum</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/o3-mini-system-card.pdf">a system card</a> offered alongside <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-hits-back-at-deepseek-with-o3-mini-reasoning-model/">Friday's public release of the o3-mini simulated reasoning model</a>, OpenAI said it has seen little progress toward the "superhuman" AI persuasiveness capabilities that it warns might eventually become "a powerful weapon for controlling nation states." Still, the company is working to mitigate the risks of even the human-level persuasive writing capabilities shown by its current reasoning models.</p>
<h2>Are you smarter than a Redditor?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/">Reddit's r/ChangeMyView</a> describes itself as "a place to post an opinion you accept may be flawed, in an effort to understand other perspectives on the issue." The forum's 3.8 million members have posted thousands of propositions on subjects ranging from politics and economics (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1igcdhp/cmv_us_brands_are_going_to_get_destroyed_by_trump/">"US Brands Are Going to Get Destroyed By Trump"</a>) to social norms ("<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ig7e7c/cmv_physically_disciplining_your_child_will_never/">Physically disciplining your child will never actually discipline them</a>) to AI itself (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ig67ov/cmv_ai_will_reduce_bias_in_decision_making/">"AI will reduce bias in decision making"</a>), to name just a few. Posters on the forum can award a "delta" to replies that succeed in actually changing their views, providing a vast dataset of actual persuasive arguments that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01103">researchers have been studying for years</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/are-ais-getting-dangerously-good-at-persuasion-openai-says-not-yet/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/home-microsoft-365-plans-use-copilot-ai-features-as-pretext-for-a-price-hike/">announced</a> that it was increasing the prices for consumer Microsoft 365 plans for the first time since introducing them as Office 365 plans more than a decade ago. Microsoft is using new Copilot-branded generative AI features to justify the price increases, which amount to an extra $3 per month or $30 per year for both individual and family plans.</p>
<p>But Microsoft giveth (and chargeth more) and Microsoft taketh away; according to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/end-of-support-privacy-protection-vpn-in-microsoft-defender-for-individuals-8b503da5-732a-4472-833a-e2ddca53036a#cw">a support page</a>, the company is also removing the "privacy protection" VPN feature from Microsoft 365's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-defender-for-individuals">Microsoft Defender</a> app for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. Other Defender features, including identity theft protection and anti-malware protection, will continue to be available. Privacy protection will stop functioning on February 28.</p>

              <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Honda provided flights from Daytona to Columbus then Washington, DC, and accommodation so Ars could visit its factories. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>ANNA, Ohio—Honda's Anna Engine Plant has changed a little since I last visited. As we wound our way past the four-cylinder production line, the green-painted scaffolding and overhead gantries gave way to a more open expanse of the cavernous building. Conveyor belts have been replaced by little robots that move pallets around, and bright LED lights illuminate the yellow-painted walls. In the middle of it all is a series of massive 6,000-ton presses, newly installed to cast the battery packs of Honda's next US-made electric vehicles.</p>
<p>A little more than an hour outside of Columbus, the Anna Engine Plant started building engines for the Goldwing motorcycle, something that would have been of deep interest to me and all the other schoolchildren who were obsessed with what seemed like the world's most excessive two-wheeler.</p>
<p>That was 40 years ago, and in the intervening years, the factory has expanded to encompass 2.8 million square feet (260,000 m2), where 3,000 people build four- and six-cylinder engines for the Hondas and Acuras people drive here in the US. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/1200-uncomfortable-miles-in-a-gorgeous-acura-nsx-hybrid-supercar/">Ars was last there in 2020</a>, back then because it was hand-building the twin-turbo V6 engines for the Acura NSX, which was assembled just down the road.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/honda-cleans-greens-its-ohio-factories-to-add-evs-to-the-mix/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new large-scale </span><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41561-024-01636-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of crevasses on the Greenland Ice Sheet shows that those cracks are widening faster as the climate warms, which is likely to speed ice loss and global sea level rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crevasses are wedge-shaped fractures and cracks that open in glaciers where the ice begins to flow faster. They can grow to more than 300 feet wide, thousands of feet long, and hundreds of feet deep. Water from melting snow on the surface can flow through crevasses all the way to the base of the ice, joining with other hidden streams to form a vast drainage system that affects how fast glaciers and ice sheets flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study found that crevasses are expanding more quickly than previously detected, and somewhere between 50 and 90 percent of the water flowing through the Greenland Ice Sheet goes through crevasses, which can warm deeply submerged portions of the glacier and increase lubrication between the base of the ice sheet and the bedrock it flows over. Both those mechanisms can accelerate the flow of the ice itself, said </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomchudley.bsky.social"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas Chudley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a glaciologist at Durham University in the United Kingdom, who is lead author of the new study.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/greenlands-glaciers-are-falling-apart-faster-than-expected/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There’s a lot of talk of cozy games these days, and Civilization is definitely my personal cozy game. It’s relaxing to get lost in a flow state, making “<a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1015756/Interesting">a series of interesting decisions</a>” for “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnRrTEFZs60">one more turn</a>,” then another, late into the evening.</p>
<p>Change is almost definitionally not cozy, though, and <em>Civilization VII</em> changes quite a lot —especially about the game’s overall structure.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’ve long felt the series peaked with <em>Civilization IV</em>, at least for me. But after playing <em>VII</em> for a couple of dozen hours, there’s a chance it’s at least as good as <em>Civilization V</em>, and it has the potential to even match <em>IV</em> with just a little more refinement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The seventh test flight of SpaceX's gigantic Starship rocket came to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/fire-destroys-starship-on-its-seventh-test-flight-raining-debris-from-space/">disappointing end</a> a little more than two weeks ago. The in-flight failure of the rocket's upper stage, or ship, about eight minutes after launch on January 16 rained debris over the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIe5Ao6R39s">Amateur videos</a> recorded from land, sea, and air showed fiery debris trails streaming overhead at twilight, appearing like a fireworks display gone wrong. Within hours, posts on social media showed small pieces of debris recovered by residents and tourists in the Turks and Caicos. Most of these items were modest in size, and many appeared to be chunks of tiles from Starship's heat shield.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded Starship and ordered an investigation into the accident on the day after the launch. This decision came three days before the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Elon Musk's close relationship with Trump, coupled with the new administration's appetite for cutting regulations and reducing the size of government, led some industry watchers to question whether Musk's influence might change the FAA's stance on SpaceX.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/it-seems-the-faa-office-overseeing-spacexs-starship-probe-still-has-some-bite/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Large language models like ChatGPT display conversational skills, but the problem is they don’t really understand the words they use. They are primarily systems that interact with data obtained from the real world but not the real world itself. Humans, on the other hand, associate language with experiences. We know what the word “hot” means because we’ve been burned at some point in our lives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Is it possible to get an AI to achieve a human-like understanding of language? A team of researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology built a brain-inspired AI model comprising multiple neural networks. The AI was very limited—it could learn a total of just five nouns and eight verbs. But their AI seems to have learned more than just those words; it learned the concepts behind them.</p>
<h2>Babysitting robotic arms</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The inspiration for our model came from developmental psychology. We tried to emulate how infants learn and develop language,” says Prasanna Vijayaraghavan, a researcher at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and the lead author of the study.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/to-help-ais-understand-the-world-researchers-put-them-in-a-robot/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Food and Drug Administration announced the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-non-opioid-treatment-moderate-severe-acute-pain">approval of a new non-opioid pain medication</a> this week, marking the first time in over two decades that the agency has approved a non-opioid pain drug with a novel mechanism of action.</p>
<p>The drug, Journavx (suzetrigine), is an oral pill that treats acute pain, such as from surgery or injuries. Unlike opioids, which work by latching onto receptor proteins on nerves in the central nervous system, suzetrigine works only in peripheral nerves—that is, those outside the brain and spinal cord. Specifically, the drug <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775738/">inhibits a voltage-gated sodium ion channel called 1.8 (NaV1.8)</a> that is known to relay pain signals, but only in peripheral nerves.</p>
<p>Because it works outside the brain by a different mechanism than opioids, the new medication offers a safe alternative to opioids, which can be highly addictive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/fda-approves-first-non-opioid-pain-medicine-in-more-than-20-years/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission demanded that CBS provide the unedited transcript of a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview with Kamala Harris that is the subject of a complaint to the FCC and a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>CBS News on Wednesday received a letter of inquiry in which the FCC requested "the full, unedited transcript and camera feeds" of the Harris interview, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/business/media/trump-harris-60-minutes-fcc.html">reported</a> today. "We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do," a CBS News spokesperson told media outlets.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr repeatedly echoed Trump's complaints about alleged media bias before the election and has taken steps to punish news broadcasters since Trump promoted him to the chairmanship. Complaints against CBS, ABC, and NBC stations were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/departing-fcc-chair-rejects-complaints-about-tv-news-coverage-of-trump/">dismissed</a> under former Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, but Carr <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-fcc-chair-gets-to-work-on-punishing-news-stations-accused-of-bias/">reversed those dismissals</a> in his first week as chair. Carr also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-fcc-chair-investigates-npr-and-pbs-urges-congress-to-defund-them/">ordered investigations</a> into NPR and CBS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/fcc-demands-cbs-provide-unedited-transcript-of-kamala-harris-interview/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>What exactly is wrong with the batteries in some of Google's Pixel 4a phones still out there? Google has not really said. Now that many Pixel 4a owners are experiencing drastically reduced battery life after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/good-news-bad-news-pixel-4a-is-getting-an-update-but-it-reduces-battery-life/">an uncommon update for an end-of-life phone</a>, they are facing a strange array of options with no path back to the phone they had.</p>
<p>Google's "<a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15701861">Pixel 4a Battery Performance Program</a>," announced in early January, told owners that an automatic update would, for some "Impacted Devices," reduce their battery's runtime and charging performance. "Impacted" customers could choose, within one year's time, between three "appeasement" options: sending in the phone for a battery replacement, getting $50 or the equivalent in their location, or receiving $100 in credit in the Google Store toward a new Pixel phone. No safety or hazard issue was mentioned in the support document.</p>
<p>Ars has reached out to Google about the Pixel 4a battery updates and appeasement options provided and will update this post with any response.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/google-pixel-4as-ruinous-battery-performance-update-is-a-bewildering-mess/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Over the last week, OpenAI's place atop the AI model hierarchy has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/deepseek-spooks-american-tech-industry-as-it-tops-the-apple-app-store/">heavily challenged</a> by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">Chinese model DeepSeek</a>. Today, OpenAI struck back with the public release of o3-mini, its latest simulated reasoning model and the first of its kind the company will offer for free to all users without a subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">First teased last month</a>, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/">brags in today's announcement</a> that o3-mini "advances the boundaries of what small models can achieve." Like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">September's o1-mini before it</a>, the model has been optimized for STEM functions and shows "particular strength in science, math, and coding" despite lower operating costs and latency than o1-mini, OpenAI says.</p>
<h2>Harder, better, faster, stronger</h2>
<p>Users are able to choose from three different "reasoning effort options" when using o3-mini, allowing them to fine-tune a balance between latency and accuracy depending on the task. The lowest of these reasoning levels generally shows accuracy levels comparable to o1-mini in math and coding benchmarks, according to OpenAI, while the highest matches or surpasses the full-fledged o1 model in the same tests.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-hits-back-at-deepseek-with-o3-mini-reasoning-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A longtime Treasury Department official is leaving his job after a dispute with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has reportedly been seeking access to federal payment systems.</p>
<p>"The highest-ranking career official at the Treasury Department is departing after a clash with allies of billionaire Elon Musk over access to sensitive payment systems," The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/31/elon-musk-treasury-department-payment-systems/">reported today</a>, citing three people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The departing official is Fiscal Assistant Secretary <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-lebryk">David Lebryk</a>, who has served in nonpolitical Treasury Department roles during his career of more than 30 years. President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/designation-of-acting-leaders/">named</a> Lebryk the acting secretary of the Treasury, an additional role he held for a week before political appointee Scott Bessent was confirmed by the Senate. But Lebryk "announced his retirement Friday in an email to colleagues obtained by The Washington Post," the newspaper reported.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/musks-doge-clashes-with-treasury-over-access-to-payment-system-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>
