              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.43 of the Rocket Report! There's been a lot of recent news in hypersonic testing. We cover some of that in this week's newsletter, but it's just a taste of the US military's appetite for fielding its own hypersonic weapons, and conversely, the Pentagon's emphasis on the detection and destruction of an enemy's hypersonic missiles. China has already declared its first hypersonic weapons operational, and Russia claims to have them, too. Now, the Pentagon is finally close to placing hypersonic missiles with combat units. Many US rocket companies believe the hypersonics sector is a lucrative business. Some companies have enough confidence in this emerging market<span class="s1">—or lack of faith in the traditional space launch market</span><span class="s1">—to pivot entirely toward hypersonics. I'm interested in seeing if their bets pay off.</span></p>

<p><b>Stratolaunch tests reusable hypersonic rocket plane. </b>Stratolaunch has finally found a use for the world's largest airplane. Twice in the last five months, the company launched a hypersonic vehicle over the Pacific Ocean, accelerated it to more than five times the speed of sound, and autonomously landed at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/stratolaunch-successfully-flies-a-modern-replacement-for-the-x-15-rocket-plane/">Ars reports</a>. Stratolaunch used the same Talon-A vehicle for both flights, demonstrating its reusability, a characteristic that sets it apart from competitors. Zachary Krevor, Stratolaunch's president and CEO, said his team aims to ramp up to monthly flights by the end of the year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-rocket-lab-to-demo-cargo-delivery-americas-new-icbm-in-trouble/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Far fewer babies went to the hospital struggling to breathe from RSV, a severe respiratory infection, after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/cdc-greenlights-rsv-vaccine-during-pregnancy-but-only-for-seasonal-use/">the debut of a new vaccine</a> and treatment this season, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7416a1.htm">an analysis published today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>RSV, or respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants in the US. An estimated 58,000–80,000 children younger than 5 years old are hospitalized each year. Newborns—babies between 0 and 2 months—are the most at risk of being hospitalized with RSV. The virus circulates seasonally, typically rising in the fall and peaking in the winter, like many other respiratory infections.</p>
<p>But the 2024–2025 season was different—there were two new ways to protect against the infection. One is a maternal vaccine, Pfizer's Abrysvo, which is given to pregnant people when their third trimester aligns with RSV season (generally September through January). Maternal antibodies generated from the vaccination pass to the fetus in the uterus and can protect a newborn in the first few months of life. The other new protection against RSV is a long-acting monoclonal antibody treatment, nirsevimab, which is <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/Nirsevemab-Visual-Guide.pdf?_gl=1*1biad03*_gcl_au*OTcwNDQ2OTIwLjE3NDY3Mzc4MjQ.*_ga*NDY1NjY3NzQyLjE3NDExMjMzNDQ.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NDY3Mzc4MjQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NDY3Mzc4MjQkajAkbDAkaDA.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NDY3Mzc4MjQkbzQkZzAkdDE3NDY3Mzc4MjQkajAkbDAkaDA.">given to babies under 8 months old</a> as they enter or are born into their first RSV season and may not be protected by maternal antibodies.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/baby-hospitalizations-from-rsv-fell-up-to-71-with-new-vaccine-treatment/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p class="p1">Kosmos 482, a Soviet-era spacecraft shrouded in Cold War secrecy, will reenter the Earth's atmosphere in the next few days after misfiring on a journey to Venus more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p>On average, a piece of space junk the size of Kosmos 482, with a mass of about a half-ton, falls into the atmosphere about once per week. What's different this time is that Kosmos 482 was designed to land on Venus, with a titanium heat shield built to withstand scorching temperatures, and structures engineered to survive atmospheric pressures nearly 100 times higher than Earth's.</p>
<p>So, there's a good chance the spacecraft will survive the extreme forces it encounters during its plunge through the atmosphere. Typically, space debris breaks apart and burns up during reentry, with only a small fraction of material reaching the Earth's surface. The European Space Agency, one of several institutions that track space debris, says Kosmos 482 is "highly likely" to reach Earth's surface in one piece.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/a-soviet-era-spacecraft-built-to-land-on-venus-is-falling-to-earth-instead/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Using AI can be a double-edged sword, according to new research from Duke University. While generative AI tools may boost productivity for some, they might also secretly damage your professional reputation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.2426766122">published</a> a study showing that employees who use AI tools like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">Claude</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">Gemini</a> at work face negative judgments about their competence and motivation from colleagues and managers.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/leadership-expansion-with-fidji-simo/">announced</a> that Instacart CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidji_Simo">Fidji Simo</a> will join the maker of ChatGPT as "CEO of Applications" later this year, according to a company blog post. Simo, who has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-conduct-did-not-mandate-removal-says-independent-review/">served on the company's board</a> since March 2024, will oversee business and operational teams while continuing to report directly to Altman in the newly created role. Altman will remain the primary CEO of OpenAI.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-talks-hire-senior-executive-major-leadership-role-information-reports-2025-05-08/">Reuters</a>, Simo spent a decade at Meta, including a stint serving as the head of Facebook from 2019 to 2021. She also currently sits on the board of e-commerce services site Shopify.</p>
<p>The announcement came earlier than planned due to what Altman described as "a leak" that "accelerated our timeline." At OpenAI, Simo will manage what Altman called "traditional company functions" as the organization enters its "next phase of growth." The applications category at OpenAI includes products like ChatGPT, the popular AI assistant.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-creates-ceo-of-applications-role-taps-instacarts-fidji-simo/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Login credentials belonging to an employee at both the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Department of Government Efficiency have appeared in multiple public leaks from info-stealer malware, a strong indication that devices belonging to him have been hacked in recent years.</p>
<p>Kyle Schutt is a 30-something-year-old software engineer who, according to <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/doge-fema-funding-access-social-security-numbers">Dropsite News</a>, gained access in February to a “core financial management system” belonging to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As an employee of DOGE, Schutt accessed FEMA’s proprietary software for managing both disaster and non-disaster funding grants. Under his role at CISA, he likely is privy to sensitive information regarding the security of civilian federal government networks and critical infrastructure throughout the US.</p>
<h2>A steady stream of published credentials</h2>
<p>According to journalist <a href="https://micahflee.com/doge-bro-kyle-schutts-computer-infected-by-malware-credentials-found-in-stealer-logs/">Micah Lee</a>, user names and passwords for logging in to various accounts belonging to Schutt have been published at least four times since 2023 in logs from stealer malware. Stealer malware typically infects devices through trojanized apps, phishing, or software exploits. Besides pilfering login credentials, stealers can also log all keystrokes and capture or record screen output. The data is then sent to the attacker and, occasionally after that, can make its way into public credential dumps.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/doge-software-engineers-computer-infected-by-info-stealing-malware/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration's steep staff cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) triggered shutdowns of several climate-related programs Thursday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most notably, the NOAA <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/">announced</a> it would be shuttering the "billion-dollar weather and climate disasters" database for vague reasons. Since 1980, the database made it possible to track the growing costs of the nation's most devastating weather events, critically pooling various sources of private data that have long been less accessible to the public.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In that time, 403 weather and climate disasters in the US triggered more than $2.945 trillion in costs, and NOAA <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/">notes</a> that's a conservative estimate. Considering that CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/climate/noaa-ends-disaster-database">noted</a> the average number of disasters in the past five years jumped from nine annually to 24, shutting down the database could leave communities in the dark on costs of emerging threats. All the NOAA can likely say is to continue looking at the historic data to keep up with trends.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/climate-disasters-that-cost-billions-will-go-untracked-thanks-to-trump-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Senate today voted along party lines to kill a Federal Communications Commission program to distribute Wi-Fi hotspots to schoolchildren, with Democrats saying the Republican-led vote will make it harder for kids without reliable Internet access to complete their homework.</p>
<p>The Senate approved a Congressional Review Act (CRA) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/7">resolution</a> to nullify the hotspot rule, which was issued by the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-approves-rules-support-wi-fi-hotspots-through-e-rate-program-0">in July 2024</a> under then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. The program would be eliminated if the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/33">House version</a> passes and President Trump signs the joint resolution of disapproval.</p>
<p>Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/senator-ted-cruz-is-trying-to-block-wi-fi-hotspots-for-schoolchildren/">announced</a> the plan in January, saying the FCC program would "imped[e] parents' ability to decide what their kids see by subsidizing unsupervised access to inappropriate content." He also alleged that the hotspot program would shift control of Internet access from parents to schools and thus "heightens the risk of censoring kids' exposure to conservative viewpoints."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/senate-approves-ted-cruz-plan-to-block-wi-fi-hotspots-for-schoolchildren/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly overhauled a historically wonky Department of Defense-designed tool that automates layoffs of federal workers.</p>
<p>Expected to expedite DOGE's already rushed efforts to shrink the government, the redesigned software could make it easier for DOGE to quickly dismantle the biggest agencies in a blink, sources familiar with the revamp <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/doge-led-software-revamp-speed-us-job-cuts-even-musk-steps-back-2025-05-08/">told Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>Developed more than two decades ago, AutoRIF (short for automated reductions in force) was deemed too "clunky" to use across government, sources told Reuters. In a <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2003/Jun/27/2001713234/-1/-1/1/03-110.pdf">2003 audit</a>, the DOD's Office of the Inspector General noted, for example, that "specialized reduction-in-force procedures needed for the National Guard technicians made the module impractical." Basically, each department needed to weigh its cuts differently to avoid gutting essential personnel. Despite several software updates since then, Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-autorif-mass-firing-government-workers/">reported</a>, the tool remained subject to errors, sources told Reuters, requiring most federal agencies to continue conducting firings manually rather than risk work stoppages or other negative outcomes from sloppy firings.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/doge-to-roll-out-shadowy-software-to-speed-mass-govt-layoffs-report-says/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Discontinuation of 256GB models gives older Surface PCs an effective price hike.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When Microsoft announced new Surface devices earlier this week, we noted that there wasn't a lot of daylight between the starting prices of the new but lower-end devices ($799 for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsofts-12-inch-surface-pro-is-cheaper-but-unfixes-a-decade-old-design-problem/">12-inch Surface Pro</a>, $899 for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/lighter-cheaper-surface-laptop-saves-a-little-money-but-gives-up-a-lot/">13-inch Surface Laptop</a>) and the starting prices of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/surface-pro-11-and-laptop-7-review-an-apple-silicon-moment-for-windows/">older-but-higher-end Surfaces from last spring</a> ($999 for both).</p>
<p>It appears Microsoft has quietly solved this problem by discontinuing the 256GB versions of the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 and the 13-inch Surface Pro 11. Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/buy-surface-laptop">retail pages for both devices</a> list only 512GB and 1TB configurations, with regular prices starting at $1,199. Though not technically a price hike—the 512GB versions of both devices also cost $1,199 before—it does amount to an effective price increase for last year's Surface hardware, especially given that both devices have user-replaceable storage that can easily be upgraded for less than the $200 that Microsoft charged for the 256GB-to-512GB upgrade.</p>
<p>The upshot is that the new Surface PCs make more sense now than they did on Tuesday in relative terms, but it's only because you'll pay more to buy a Surface Pro 11 or Surface Laptop 7 than you would before. The 15-inch version of the Surface Laptop 7 still lists a 256GB configuration and a $1,299 starting price, but the 256GB models are currently out of stock.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/echoing-xbox-prices-are-going-up-for-high-end-surfaces-and-some-accessories/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">antitrust trial</a> targeting Google's search business is heading into the home stretch, and the outcome could forever alter Google—and the web itself. The company is scrambling to protect its search empire, but perhaps market forces could pull the rug out from under Google before the government can. Apple SVP of Services Eddie Cue suggested in his testimony on Wednesday that Google's search traffic might be falling. Not so fast, says Google.</p>
<p>In an unusual move, Google issued a statement late in the day after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/05/cue-apple-will-add-ai-search-in-mobile-safari-challenging-google/">Cue's testimony</a> to dispute the implication that it may already be losing its monopoly. During questioning by DOJ attorney Adam Severt, Cue expressed concern about losing the Google search deal, which is a major source of revenue for Apple. This contract, along with a similar one for Firefox, gives Google default search placement in exchange for a boatload of cash. The DOJ contends that is anticompetitive, and its proposed remedies call for banning Google from such deals.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Cue noted in his testimony that search volume in Safari fell for the first time ever in April. Since Google is the default search provider, that implies fewer Google searches. Apple devices are popular, and a drop in Google searches there could be a bad sign for the company's future competitiveness. Google's <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/statement-press-reports-about-search-traffic/">statement</a> on this comes off as a bit defensive.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-dismisses-apple-execs-claim-that-search-volume-is-falling/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Many horses, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/spotify-jumps-on-apples-court-loss-gets-approved-for-non-app-store-payments/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/05/for-the-first-time-ever-amazon-kindle-users-on-ios-can-tap-a-button-to-buy-books/">Amazon's Kindle Store</a>, have already left the barn. But Apple is moving quickly to shut the external payments door opened by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fortnite-will-return-to-ios-after-court-slams-apples-obvious-cover-up/">last week's ruling</a> that the company willfully failed to comply with court orders regarding anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/apple_epic_emergency2.pdf">an emergency motion filing late Wednesday</a> (PDF), Apple described US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' "extraordinary Order" as including an injunction that "permanently precludes Apple from exercising control over core aspects of its business operations, including charging for use of its property and protecting the integrity of its platform and in-app purchase mechanism." A <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.1d02a68e-bb7c-4021-af16-ed352facf157/gov.uscourts.ca9.1d02a68e-bb7c-4021-af16-ed352facf157.6.0.pdf">certificate</a> (PDF) accompanying the emergency filing states that the order "fundamentally changes Apple's business and creates destabilizing effects" for App Store customers.</p>
<p>The restrictions, "which will cost Apple substantial sums annually," are not based on the company's conduct, Apple claims, but "were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance" with the 2021 injunction. In <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Contempt-order.pdf">her ruling</a> (PDF), Gonzalez Rogers described Apple as conducting an "obvious cover-up" and said that Apple "at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/apple-motion-says-external-payments-fundamentally-change-its-app-store/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The vast majority of people these days use some form of social media, but some develop what's known as problematic social media use (PSMU). It's not yet deemed a clinical addiction, but it does share some symptoms with addiction and substance abuse disorders. And according to a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0321361">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE, someone who exhibits PSMU is also more likely to believe in—and share—fake news online, contributing to the rampant spread of misinformation that is the bane of the 21st-century Internet.</p>
<p>"If someone struggles with a substance dependency, it's the decision-making process in their brain where they have difficulties stopping," co-author Dar Meshi of Michigan State University told Ars. "They take their drug and have a negative outcome: get a DUI or crash their car. Most people learn from a bad outcome and don't do it again, but someone with a substance use disorder continues to do that action."</p>
<p>In the case of PSMU, someone might feel bad if they are unable to access social media for an extended period (withdrawal), or their use of social media might lead to losing a job, poor grades, or mental health issues.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/social-media-addicts-more-likely-to-believe-fake-news/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced plans to rescind and replace a Biden-era rule regulating the export of high-end AI accelerator chips worldwide, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/trump-to-rescind-global-chip-curbs-amid-ai-restrictions-debate">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-administration-will-rescind-biden-era-ai-chip-export-curbs-bloomberg-news-2025-05-07/">Reuters</a> reported.</p>
<p>A Department of Commerce spokeswoman told Reuters that officials found the previous framework "overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation" and pledged to create "a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance."</p>
<p>The Biden administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/biden-administration-puts-quotas-on-global-ai-chip-sales/">issued</a> the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion in January during its final week in office. The regulation represented the last salvo of a four-year effort to control global access to so-called "advanced" AI chips (such as GPUs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/nvidia-thinks-ai-boom-is-far-from-over-as-gpu-sales-drive-big-earnings-win/">made by Nvidia</a>), with a focus on restricting China's ability to obtain tech that could enhance its military capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/trump-admin-to-roll-back-bidens-ai-chip-restrictions/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>"We are an AI, robotics company," Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-an-ai-company-now-heres-how-plausible-that-is/">announced last April</a>. Despite the fact that the company's revenues are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/teslas-death-is-not-close-says-musk-as-operating-margin-drops-to-2/">overwhelmingly derived from selling new electric vehicles</a>, such prosaic activities hold no luster for the boss. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Instead, Tesla's future, according to Musk, depends upon a (claimed) sub-$30,000 driverless two-seater, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed to the world last October</a> in a staged demonstration on a film set.</span> But Musk's plans just hit a snag: The company must find some new names.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/teslas-robotaxi-and-cybercab-trademarks-hit-roadblocks-ahead-of-june-launch/">As spotted by Sean O'Kane at TechCrunch</a>, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has informed Tesla that it will not be allowed to trademark the word "robotaxi" to describe the vehicle. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">According to the USPTO, the term is far too generic. Indeed, a <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=robotaxi&amp;year_start=2000&amp;year_end=2022&amp;corpus=en&amp;smoothing=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google n-gram</a></span><a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=robotaxi&amp;year_start=2000&amp;year_end=2022&amp;corpus=en&amp;smoothing=3"> search</a> shows a steady growth in the use of "robotaxi" starting more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>According to the USPTO, the term is merely descriptive. <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn98795389&amp;docId=NFIN20250506110959&amp;linkId=1#docIndex=0&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The agency cites</a> evidence from Wikipedia, The Verge, and the Amazon-backed autonomous vehicle startup Zoox in its denial of Tesla's trademark application.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/robotaxi-and-cybercab-are-too-unoriginal-to-trademark-uspto-tells-tesla/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>NASA is considering scaling back its activities on the International Space Station, according to multiple sources. The changes, which are being considered primarily due to shortfalls in the space station budget, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the size of the crew complement of Crew Dragon missions from four to three, starting with Crew-12 in February 2026</li>
<li>Extending the duration of space station missions from six to eight months</li>
<li>Canceling all upgrades to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/nasa-is-planning-a-daring-repair-mission-to-save-a-2-billion-particle-detector/">Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer</a> science instrument attached to the station</li>
</ul>
<p>The changes align with a desire that was reflected in the Trump administration's "skinny budget" proposal for NASA, released last Friday, which seeks to have the US space agency reduce its activities on the ISS.</p>
<p>"The Budget reduces the space station’s crew size and onboard research, preparing for a safe decommissioning of the station by 2030 and replacement by commercial space stations," stated the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">budget request for fiscal year 2026</a>. "Crew and cargo flights to the station would be significantly reduced. The station’s reduced research capacity would be focused on efforts critical to the Moon and Mars exploration programs."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/nasa-scrambles-to-cut-iss-activity-after-trump-budget-its-options-are-not-great/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The world has been abuzz for weeks now about the inclusion of a journalist in a group message of senior White House officials discussing plans for a military strike. In that case, the breach was the result of then-National Security Advisor Mike Waltz accidentally adding The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the group chat and no one else in the chat noticing. But what if someone controlling or hacking a messenger platform could do the same thing?</p>
<p>When it comes to WhatsApp—the Meta-owned messenger that’s frequently touted for offering end-to-end encryption—it turns out you can.</p>
<h2>A clean bill of health except for...</h2>
<p>A team of researchers confirmed that behavior in a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/794.pdf">recently released</a> formal analysis of WhatsApp group messaging. They reverse-engineered the app, described the formal cryptographic protocols, and provided theorems establishing the security guarantees that WhatsApp provides. Overall, they gave the messenger a clean bill of health, finding that it works securely and as described by WhatsApp.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/whatsapp-provides-no-cryptographic-management-for-group-messages/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Over the last century or more, humanity has been developing an ever-growing number of new chemicals that have never been seen before by Earth's creatures. Many of these chemicals end up being toxic contaminants that we'd love to get rid of, but we struggle to purify them from the environment or break them down once we do. And microbes haven't had much chance to evolve the ability to break them down for us.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, however, we've found a growing number of cases where bacteria have evolved the ability to break down such chemicals, like industrial contaminants and plastics. Unfortunately, these bacteria are all different species, target different individual contaminants, and thrive in different environments. But now, researchers have developed a new way to take the genes from all these species and place them in a single bacterial strain that can decontaminate complex waste mixtures.</p>
<h2>Targeting contaminants</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this work was the fact that a lot of this industrial contamination contains a mixture of toxic organic molecules that are commonly found in brackish or salty water. So, the research team, based in Shenzhen, China, started by simply testing a number of lab bacteria strains to develop one that could survive these conditions. The one that seemed to survive the best was <em>Vibrio natriegens</em>. These bacteria were discovered in a salt marsh, and their primary claim to fame is an impressive growth rate, with a population being able to double about every 10 minutes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/researchers-engineer-bacteria-to-clean-up-industrial-wastewater/">Read full article</a></p>
