                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/improving-oversight-of-federal-grantmaking/">issued an executive order</a> asserting political control over grant funding, including all federally supported research. The order requires that any announcement of funding opportunities be reviewed by the head of the agency or someone they designate, which means a political appointee will have the ultimate say over what areas of science the US funds. Individual grants will also require clearance from a political appointee and "must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President’s policy priorities."</p>
<p>The order also instructs agencies to formalize the ability to cancel previously awarded grants at any time if they're considered to "no longer advance agency priorities." Until a system is in place to enforce the new rules, agencies are forbidden from starting new funding programs.</p>
<p>In short, the new rules would mean that all federal science research would need to be approved by a political appointee who may have no expertise in the relevant areas, and the research can be canceled at any time if the political winds change. It would mark the end of a system that has enabled US scientific leadership for roughly 70 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/new-executive-order-puts-all-grants-under-political-control/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is hamstringing its upcoming review of broadband availability by ignoring the prices consumers must pay for Internet service, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez said in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-413527A1.pdf">statement</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>"Some point to existing law to argue that availability is the only metric Congress allows to measure broadband deployment success. But the law does not require this agency to view broadband availability with one eye closed and the other one half-open," said Gomez, the only Democrat on the Republican-majority commission.</p>
<p>The FCC <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-413494A1.pdf">said on Tuesday</a> that it voted to kick off the next annual review with a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) that "reorients the Commission's approach to the Section 706 Report by adhering more closely to the plain language of the statute and takes a fresh look at this question of whether broadband 'is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion.'" That would remove affordability as a factor in the review.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/fcc-democrat-trump-admin-is-declaring-mission-accomplished-on-broadband/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some stone tools found near a river on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi suggest that the first hominins had reached the islands by at least 1.04 million years ago. That's around the same time that the ancestors of the infamously diminutive “Hobbits” may have reached the island of Flores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archaeologist Budianto Hakim of Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency and his colleagues were the ones who recently unearthed the tools from a site on Sulawesi. Although a handful of stone flakes from that island don't tell us who the ancestors of the small species were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or how they reached remote islands like Flores and Luzon, the tools are one more piece in the puzzle. And this handful of stone flakes may eventually play a role in helping us understand how other hominin species conquered most of the world long before we came along. </span></p>
<h2><b>Crossing the ocean a million years ago</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the deep past leaves the smallest traces. At the Calio site, a sandstone outcrop in what's now a cornfield outside the village of Ujung in southern Sulawesi, people left behind just a handful of sharp stone flakes roughly a million years ago. There are seven of them, ranging from 22 to 60 millimeters long, and they're scratched, worn, and chipped from tumbling around at the bottom of a river. But it's still clear that they were once shaped by skilled human—or at least human-like—hands that used hard stones as hammers to make sharp-edged chert flakes for cutting and scraping.</span></p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/stone-tools-may-hint-at-ancestors-of-homo-floresiensis/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In June, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/voice-phishing-data-extortion">said</a> it unearthed a campaign that was mass-compromising accounts belonging to customers of Salesforce. The means: an attacker pretending to be someone in the customer's IT department feigning some sort of problem that required immediate access to the account. Two months later, Google has disclosed that it, too, was a victim.</p>
<p>The series of hacks are being carried out by financially motivated threat actors out to steal data in hopes of selling it back to the targets at sky-high prices. Rather than exploiting software or website vulnerabilities, they take a much simpler approach: calling the target and asking for access. The technique has proven remarkably successful. Companies whose Salesforce instances have been breached in the campaign, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-suffers-data-breach-in-ongoing-salesforce-data-theft-attacks/">Bleeping Computer reported, </a>include Adidas, Qantas, Allianz Life, Cisco, and the LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany &amp; Co.</p>
<h2>Better late than never</h2>
<p>The attackers abuse a Salesforce feature that allows customers to link their accounts to third-party apps that integrate data with in-house systems for blogging, mapping tools, and similar resources. The attackers in the campaign contact employees and instruct them to connect an external app to their Salesforce instance. As the employee complies, the attackers ask the employee for an eight-digit security code that the Salesforce interface requires before a connection is made. The attackers then use this number to gain access to the instance and all data stored in it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/google-sales-data-breached-in-the-same-scam-it-discovered/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After seeking advice on health topics from ChatGPT, a 60-year-old man who had a "history of studying nutrition in college" decided to try a health experiment: He would eliminate all chlorine from his diet, which for him meant eliminating even table salt (sodium chloride). His ChatGPT conversations led him to believe that he could replace his sodium chloride with sodium bromide, which he obtained over the Internet.</p>
<p>Three months later, the man showed up at his local emergency room. His neighbor, he said, was trying to poison him. Though extremely thirsty, the man was paranoid about accepting the water that the hospital offered him, telling doctors that he had begun distilling his own water at home and that he was on an extremely restrictive vegetarian diet. He did not mention the sodium bromide or the ChatGPT discussions.</p>
<p>His distress, coupled with the odd behavior, led the doctors to run a broad set of lab tests, revealing multiple micronutrient deficiencies, especially in key vitamins. But the bigger problem was that the man appeared to be suffering from a serious case of "bromism." That is, an excess amount of the element bromine had built up in his body.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/after-using-chatgpt-man-swaps-his-salt-for-sodium-bromide-and-suffers-psychosis/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Human remains from 11 individuals recovered from El Mirador Cave in Spain showed evidence of cannibalism, archaeologists have concluded. According to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10266-w">new paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports, the cannibalism was likely the result of a violent episode between competing Late Neolithic herding communities about 5,700 years ago.</p>
<p>“Cannibalism is one of the most complex behaviors to interpret, due to the inherent difficulty of understanding the act of humans consuming other humans," said co-author Palmira Saladié, a<span lang="ES-TRAD"> researcher at IPHES-CERCA and the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV). "Moreover, in many cases we lack all the necessary evidence to associate it with a specific behavioral context. Finally, societal biases tend to interpret it invariably as an act of barbarism.”</span></p>
<p>The El Mirador Cave is located at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_site_of_Atapuerca">Sierra de Atapuerca</a>, an archaeological site in the Burgos province of northern Spain. There is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17492670/#:~:text=Abstract,clear%20case%20of%20gastronomic%20cannibalism.">prior evidence</a> of cannibalism at the Atapuerca site, including the remains of six Early Bronze Age humans, which included <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440320300029">skull caps</a> possibly used as containers during ceremonial consumption. In addition, since 1994, more than 160 bone fragments have been recovered from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_site_of_Atapuerca#Trinchera_Dolina_(1981_to_present)">Aurora Stratum</a> (TD-6) in the Gran Dolina cavern at Sierra de Atapuerca. Over 30 percent of those fragments <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/653807">showed signs</a> of butchering and consumption, such as slice marks, scrape marks, and chop marks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/archaeologists-unearth-fresh-evidence-of-neolithic-cannibalism/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/gpt-5/">announced</a> GPT-5 and three variants—GPT-5 Pro, GPT-5 mini, and GPT-5 nano—what the company calls its "best AI system yet," with availability for some of the models across all ChatGPT tiers, including free users. The new model family arrives with claims of reduced confabulations, improved coding capabilities, and a new approach to handling sensitive requests that OpenAI calls "safe completions."</p>
<p>It's also the first time OpenAI has given free users access to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">simulated reasoning</a> AI model, which breaks problems down into multiple steps using a technique that tends to improve answer accuracy for logical or analytical questions.</p>
<p>GPT-5 represents OpenAI's latest attempt to unify its various AI capabilities into a single system. The company says the GPT-5 family acts as a "unified system" with a smart, efficient model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model called "GPT-5 thinking" for harder problems, and a real-time router that decides which approach to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and user intent. Like GPT-4o, GPT-5 is a multimodal system that can interact via images, voice, and text.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-launches-gpt-5-free-to-all-chatgpt-users/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>REIDEN, Germany—There is a lot to be said for testing a car on the roads it was developed on. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/a-beginners-guide-to-the-world-of-weird-and-wonderful-japanese-import-cars/">Kei car</a>, for example, makes more sense in downtown Tokyo than on one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/microcar-madness-at-the-lane-motor-museum/">Nashville's arterial highways</a>, surrounded by construction trucks. Likewise the German supersedans. For decades, an arms race has been conducted between rival engineers in Munich, Ingolstadt, Stuttgart, and Zuffenhausen, each trying to best the others and build the ultimate four-door, four-wheel Autobahn crusher, fit for the fattest fat-cat captains of industry. The Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid is Porsche's entry into this heavyweight bout.</p>
<p>In most of the world, the horsepower war has little relevance. Huge engine outputs, short acceleration times, and ridiculous top speeds that result from a casual indifference to fitting a speed limiter are at best of interest to the bench racers and are otherwise academic. Not so in Germany. After inventing the motorway in 1932, the country declined to impose speed limits on some sections, a practice it maintains as long as there's daylight and the weather is good. And drivers there make use of that privilege—in the fast lane, at least.</p>
<p>Seen in this context, the $239,000 Panamera Turbo S starts making more sense. It's the most powerful Panamera to date, combining a (fruity-sounding) 591 hp (441 kW) 4.0 L V8 that has been reworked compared to the version you might find under the hood of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/the-porsche-panamera-turbo-sport-turismo-to-hybrid-or-not-to-hybrid/">the last version</a>. New monoscroll turbochargers and a higher peak combustion chamber pressure help warm up the catalytic converters quicker, and instead of cylinder deactivation at low load, the engine can change how much and how long it opens its intake valves, shortening the travel and duration under those conditions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/2025-porsche-panamera-turbo-s-a-different-approach-to-a-luxury-sedan/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Tariffs that US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/">announced</a> last week take effect today, including a 19 percent tariff on goods imported from Malaysia (the levy is said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/en/malaysian-pharmaceuticals-semiconductors-exempt-us-tariffs-minister-says-2025-08-01/">not to apply to semiconductors</a> and was cut down from a 25 percent tariff that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/malaysia-optimistic-of-deal-to-lower-us-tariffs-before-deadline">Trump threatened</a> in July.)

In an apparent effort to secure this exemption, Apple promised to increase its total investment commitment in the US by $100 billion, while also gifting Trump a one-of-a-kind statue that Apple CEO Tim Cook had engraved with Trump's name.</p>
<p>It serves as a bizarre love letter to Trump's push to bring tech manufacturing into the US, despite Apple resisting that push for its most popular product.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/trump-wanted-a-us-made-iphone-apple-gave-him-a-gold-statue/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Framework’s main claim to fame is its commitment to modular, upgradeable, repairable laptops. The jury’s still out on early 2024’s Framework Laptop 16 and mid-2025’s Framework Laptop 12, neither of which has seen a hardware refresh, but so far, the company has released half a dozen iterations of its flagship Framework Laptop 13 in less than five years. If you bought one of the originals right when it first launched, you could go to Framework’s site, buy an all-new motherboard and RAM, and get a substantial upgrade in performance and other capabilities without having to change anything else about your laptop.</p>
<p>Framework’s laptops haven’t been adopted as industry-wide standards, but in many ways, they seem built to reflect the flexibility and modularity that has drawn me to desktop PCs for more than two decades.</p>
<p>That's what makes the Framework Desktop so weird. Not only is Framework navigating into a product category where its main innovation and claim to fame is totally unnecessary. But it’s actually doing that with a desktop that’s <em>less</em> upgradeable and modular than any given self-built desktop PC.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/review-framework-desktop-is-a-mash-up-of-a-regular-desktop-pc-and-the-mac-studio/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Subaru WRX has always been the equivalent of an automotive shrug. Not because it lacks character but because it simply doesn't care what others think. It's a punk rock band with enough talent to fill stadiums but band members who don't seem to care about chasing fame. And the STI versions of yesteryear proved so talented that fame chased them.</p>
<p>For 2025, Subaru updated the WRX to now include the tS, which at first glance appears to be the same flannel-wearing street fighter. But looks can be deceiving. The tS hides sharpened tools underneath, translating to better handling and responsiveness.</p>
<h2>What does “tS” really mean?</h2>
<p>Subaru positions the tS as being tuned by STI, but it's not an STI return. Sure, that's technically true; only Subaru can name something STI. And to be clear, there's no extra power here, no gigantic wing that takes out flocks of birds, and no pink STI badge on the trunk. But the tS is imbued with enough STI-ness to make a case.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/2025-subaru-wrx-ts-review-a-scalpel-sharp-chassis-lets-this-car-dance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has called for the newly appointed chief executive of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, to resign, alleging that the semiconductor industry veteran is “highly conflicted.”</p>
<p>“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump said in his post on his Truth Social website on Thursday. “There is no other solution to this problem.”</p>
<p>The US president’s post did not provide details of Tan’s alleged conflicts of interest. Trump’s broadside follows a letter from Republican Senator Tom Cotton to the US chipmaker’s board chair this week expressing “concern about the security and integrity of Intel’s operations” and Tan’s ties to China.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/president-trump-says-intels-new-ceo-must-resign-immediately/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If anyone needed a reminder that US health secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has no background in science or medicine, look no further than <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766">the video he posted on social media</a> Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>In the two-and-a-half-minute clip, Kennedy announced that he is cancelling nearly $500 million in funding for the development of mRNA-based vaccines against diseases that pose pandemic threats. The funding will be clawed back from 22 now-defunct contracts awarded through the federal agency tasked with developing medical countermeasures to public health threats. The agency is the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).</p>
<p>Kennedy is generally opposed to vaccines, but he is particularly hostile to mRNA-based vaccines. Since the remarkably successful debut of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic—which were developed and mass-produced with unprecedented speed—Kennedy has continually disparaged and spread misinformation about them.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/rfk-jr-defends-500m-cut-for-mrna-vaccines-with-pseudoscience-gobbledygook/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>By now, you’ve likely heard of fraudulent calls that use AI to clone the voices of people the call recipient knows. Often, the result is what sounds like a grandchild, CEO, or work colleague you’ve known for years reporting an urgent matter requiring immediate action, saying to wire money, divulge login credentials, or visit a malicious website.</p>
<p>Researchers and <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/increasing_threats_of_deepfake_identities_0.pdf">government officials</a> have been warning of the threat for years, with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/09/12/nsa-fbi-and-cisa-release-cybersecurity-information-sheet-deepfake-threats">saying</a> in 2023 that threats from deepfakes and other forms of synthetic media have increased “exponentially.” Last year, Google’s Mandiant security division <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/ai-powered-voice-spoofing-vishing-attacks">reported</a> that such attacks are being executed with “uncanny precision, creating for more realistic phishing schemes.”</p>
<h2>Anatomy of a deepfake scam call</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, security firm Group-IB <a href="https://www.group-ib.com/blog/voice-deepfake-scams/">outlined</a> the basic steps involved in executing these sorts of attacks. The takeaway is that they’re easy to reproduce at scale and can be challenging to detect or repel.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/heres-how-deepfake-vishing-attacks-work-and-why-they-can-be-hard-to-detect/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>"Crypto mixers" exist because of a peculiar feature of cryptocurrencies—most are fully traceable using their public blockchain ledgers. To provide more privacy to crypto account owners, a mixer will let people toss their crypto into a large pool, where it is "mixed" with other people's crypto. At a later date, each crypto owner can choose to withdraw their money from the pool into a new, anonymous wallet, thus making the movement of the crypto harder to track.</p>
<p>Of course, the obfuscation doesn't work well if the blockchain shows 1,231.7 BTC entering a mixer and 1,231.7 BTC being withdrawn to a new wallet. So mixers will take steps to disguise the transactions. Tornado Cash, which operated on the Ethereum blockchain, mandated that users could only deposit money into its pools in 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ETH increments, making it far harder to spot specific amounts entering and leaving the mixer.</p>
<p>Tornado Cash also used a complex system of "relayers" to pay the Ethereum "gas fees" charged for transactions on the network; without doing this, it would be clear which old account was paying to "mix" money into which new account. The whole process relied on the use of irrevocable "smart contracts," all of which sounds rather technically daunting, but Tornado put a nice user interface atop the details that made the service far easier to use than it might sound.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/tornado-cash-sold-crypto-privacy-the-us-saw-money-laundering-a-jury-isnt-sure-what-to-think/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The deal was announced just one day after the US General Services Administration (GSA) signed a blanket deal to allow OpenAI and rivals like Google and Anthropic to supply tools to federal workers.</p>
<p>The workers will have access to ChatGPT Enterprise, a type of account that includes access to frontier models and cutting-edge features with relatively high token limits, alongside a more robust commitment to data privacy than general consumers of ChatGPT get. ChatGPT Enterprise has been trialed over the past several months at several corporations and other types of large organizations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-announces-deal-to-offer-chatgpt-to-us-executive-branch-at-almost-no-cost/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Bob Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company, announced today that Disney will "fully integrate" Hulu into the Disney+ app in 2026. Although a company representative told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/">Variety</a> that people will still be able to buy standalone subscriptions to Hulu, we can't help but wonder how long that will last.</p>
<p>A prim and polished app combining the catalogs, recommendations, and profiles for Disney+ and Hulu subscribers could make a standalone Hulu app redundant. In fact, the ability to successfully combine those two<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/these-are-the-best-streaming-services-you-arent-watching/"> streaming services</a> into one platform could, depending on how executives look at it, make the entire Hulu business redundant.</p>
<p>Some are reporting that Iger means that the Hulu app will be <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/">phased out next year</a>, while others are saying that the death of the Hulu app is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-hulu-app-may-not-be-long-for-this-world-2000639568">likely but not yet guaranteed</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/hulus-days-look-numbered-but-theres-reason-for-disney-to-keep-it-around/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Library of Congress today said a coding error resulted in the deletion of parts of the US Constitution from Congress' website and promised a fix after many Internet users pointed out the missing sections this morning.</p>
<p>"It has been brought to our attention that some sections of Article 1 are missing from the Constitution Annotated (<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/">constitution.congress.gov</a>) website," the Library of Congress <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/librarycongress.bsky.social/post/3lvqilhwb6k2x">said today</a>. "We've learned that this is due to a coding error. We have been working to correct this and expect it to be resolved soon."</p>
<p>The missing portions of the Constitution were restored to <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/">one part of the website</a> a few hours after the Library of Congress statement and reappeared on a <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/">different part of the website</a> another hour or so later. The Constitution Annotated website carried a notice saying it "is currently experiencing data issues.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has often bristled at the implication that its obsession with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/">AI search is harming web traffic</a>, and now search head Liz Reid has penned a <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-search-driving-more-queries-higher-quality-clicks/">blog post</a> on the topic. According to Reid, clicks aren't declining, AI is driving more searches, and everything is fine on the Internet. But despite the optimistic tone, the post stops short of providing any actual data to back up those claims.</p>
<p>This statement feels like a direct response to a recent Pew Research Center analysis that showed searches with AI Overviews resulted in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/research-shows-google-ai-overviews-reduce-website-clicks-by-almost-half/">lower click-through rates</a>. Google objected to the conclusions and methodology of that study, and the new blog post expands on its rationale.</p>
<p>The banner claim in this post is that Google is not sending fewer clicks to websites. According to Reid, "total organic click volume" has remained "relatively stable year-over-year." Meanwhile, Google is seeing more searches on its end, which is the most important metric for the company. Google's blog also notes (fairly) that the web is unfathomably vast, and it's common for trends to shift.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/08/google-search-boss-says-ai-isnt-killing-search-clicks/">Read full article</a></p>
