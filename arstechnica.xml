                            <![CDATA[<p>AI poses an obvious danger to the millennia-long human fight to find the truth. Large language model "hallucinations," vocal deepfakes, and now increased use of video deepfakes have all had a blurring effect on facts, letting bad actors around the globe brush off even recorded events as mere "fake news."</p>
<p>The danger is perhaps most acute in the political realm, where deepfake audio and video can make any politician say or appear to do anything. In such a climate, our most senior elected officials have a special duty to model truth-seeking behavior and responsible AI use.</p>
<p>But what's the fun in that, when you can just blow up negotiations over a budget impasse by posting a deepfake video of your political opponents calling themselves "a bunch of woke pieces of shit" while mariachi music plays in the background? Oh—and did I mention the fake mustache? Or the CGI sombrero?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/ai-leadership-trump-posts-deepfakes-of-dems-calling-themselves-woke-pieces-of-s-t/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Without explanation, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under the Trump administration has reverted from using the disease name "mpox" to the obsolete "monkeypox," which the world abandoned in 2022 because it was seen as racist and stigmatizing.</p>
<p>Mpox is the name of the disease caused by <em><a href="https://ictv.global/taxonomy/taxondetails?taxnode_id=202404771&amp;taxon_name=Orthopoxvirus%20monkeypox#release_40">Orthopoxvirus monkeypox</a></em>, a relative of smallpox and cowpox that has exploded to global prominence in recent years.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amazon’s voice assistant is hanging on by a thread. And that thread is generative AI—or, in Amazon’s case, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/">Alexa+</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon hasn’t had a problem getting people to buy cheap, Alexa-powered gadgets. However, the Alexa in millions of homes today doesn’t make Amazon money. It’s largely used for simple tasks unrelated to commerce, like setting timers and checking the weather. As a result, Amazon’s Devices business has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/">reportedly been siphoning money</a>, and the clock is ticking for Alexa to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/">prove its worth.</a></p>
<p>Alexa+, a subscription-based generative AI service ($20 per month or included with Prime, which starts at $15/month), is supposed to solve Amazon's woes with Alexa. More conversational and powerful than the original Alexa, Alexa+ is designed to play a more central role in user transactions, enabling, in theory, Amazon to finally make money from voice assistants after 11 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/alexas-survival-hinges-on-you-buying-more-expensive-amazon-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As OpenAI tells it, the company has been consistently rolling out safety updates ever since parents, Matthew and Maria Raine, sued OpenAI, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-helped-teen-plan-suicide-after-safeguards-failed-openai-admits/">alleging that "ChatGPT killed my son."</a></p>
<p>On August 26, the day that the lawsuit was filed, OpenAI seemed to publicly respond to claims that ChatGPT acted as a "suicide coach" for 16-year-old Adam Raine by posting a <a href="https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/">blog</a> promising to do better to help people "when they need it most."</p>
<p>By September 2, that meant <a href="https://openai.com/index/building-more-helpful-chatgpt-experiences-for-everyone/">routing all users' sensitive conversations</a> to a reasoning model with stricter safeguards, sparking backlash from users who feel like ChatGPT is handling their prompts with kid gloves. Two weeks later, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/building-towards-age-prediction/">announced</a> it would start predicting users' ages to improve safety more broadly. Then, this week, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-parental-controls/">introduced parental controls</a> for ChatGPT and its video generator Sora 2. Those controls allow parents to limit their teens' use and even get access to information about chat logs in "rare cases" where OpenAI's "system and trained reviewers detect possible signs of serious safety risk."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/critics-slam-openais-parental-controls-while-users-rage-treat-us-like-adults/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Many of the most interesting bodies in our Solar System aren't planets, but the moons that orbit them. They have active volcanoes, hydrocarbon oceans, geysers, and moon-wide oceans buried under icy crusts. And, as far as we can tell, the physics of the processes that produce large planets should make moon formation inevitable. Given how common planets are, our galaxy should be teeming with moons.</p>
<p>Yet, despite some tantalizing hints, we've not found a clear indication of a moon orbiting an exoplanet. What we have found are a few very young exoplanets that appear to have moon-forming disks around them. Now, the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a spectrum of the ring-forming disk around a giant super-Jupiter, and found that it's rich in small carbon-based molecules. That's despite the fact that the star it's orbiting seems to have a planet-forming disk that's mostly water.</p>
<h2>Finding disks</h2>
<p>We search for exo-moons and moon-forming disks using completely different methods. To spot an actual moon, we rely on its gravitational influence. At some points in its orbit, it will be towing its planet forward to speed up its orbit; at others, it will be holding its planet back. This introduces subtle variations in the timing of when the planet arrives in front of the star from Earth's perspective.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/researchers-find-a-carbon-rich-moon-forming-disk-around-giant-exoplanet/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>False claims of voter fraud abounded in the wake of the 2020 US general election, when Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump for the presidency. Trump himself amplified those false claims, culminating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">violent attack</a> on the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021. Two years later, Brazil faced a similar scenario in the wake of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Brazilian_general_election">2022 general election</a> in which voters ousted incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro. Once again, claims of fraud ran rampant as Bolsonaro supporters stormed their country's capital.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/research-roundup-six-cool-stories-we-almost-missed/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In the age of cloud computing, protections baked into chips from Intel, AMD, and others are essential for ensuring confidential data and sensitive operations can’t be viewed or manipulated by attackers who manage to compromise servers running inside a data center. In many cases, these protections—which work by storing certain data and processes inside encrypted enclaves known as TEEs (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+tee+sgx&amp;t=vivaldi&amp;atb=v481-1&amp;ia=web">Trusted Execution Enclaves</a>)—are essential for safeguarding secrets stored in the cloud by the likes of <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">Signal Messenger</a> and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/private-processing-technical-whitepaper">WhatsApp</a>. All major cloud providers recommend that customers use it. Intel calls its protection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">SGX</a>, and AMD has named it <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html">SEV-SNP</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, researchers have repeatedly broken the security and privacy promises that Intel and AMD have made about their respective protections. On Tuesday, researchers independently published two papers laying out separate attacks that further demonstrate the limitations of SGX and SEV-SNP. One attack, dubbed Battering RAM, defeats both protections and allows attackers to not only view encrypted data but also to actively manipulate it to introduce software backdoors or to corrupt data. A separate attack known as Wiretap is able to passively decrypt sensitive data protected by SGX and remain invisible at all times.</p>
<h2>Attacking deterministic encryption</h2>
<p>Both attacks use a small piece of hardware, known as an interposer, that sits between CPU silicon and the memory module. Its position allows the interposer to observe data as it passes from one to the other. They exploit both Intel’s and AMD’s use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_encryption">deterministic encryption</a>, which produces the same ciphertext each time the same plaintext is encrypted with a given key. In SGX and SEV-SNP, that means the same plaintext written to the same memory address always produces the same ciphertext.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/intel-and-amd-trusted-enclaves-the-backbone-of-network-security-fall-to-physical-attacks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Ever wonder why ChatGPT slows down during long conversations? The culprit is a fundamental mathematical challenge: Processing long sequences of text <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/why-ai-language-models-choke-on-too-much-text/">requires</a> massive computational resources, even with the efficiency tricks that companies have already deployed. While US tech giants can afford to throw more hardware at the problem, Chinese AI company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/deepseek-spooks-american-tech-industry-as-it-tops-the-apple-app-store/">DeepSeek</a>, which is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/nvidia-ai-chips-worth-1b-smuggled-to-china-after-trump-export-controls/">cut off</a> from a steady supply of some advanced AI chips by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-cant-keep-china-from-getting-ai-chips-tsmc-suggests/">export restrictions</a>, has extra motivation to squeeze more performance from less silicon.</p>
<p>On Monday, DeepSeek <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250929">released</a> an experimental version of its latest simulated reasoning language model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, which introduces what it calls "DeepSeek Sparse Attention" (DSA). It's the company's implementation of a computational technique likely already used in some of the world's most prominent AI models. OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sparse-transformers/">pioneered</a> sparse transformers in 2019 and <a href="https://newsletter.theaiedge.io/p/understanding-the-sparse-transformers">used</a> the technique to build GPT-3, while Google Research published work on "<a href="https://research.google/blog/reformer-the-efficient-transformer/">Reformer</a>" models using similar concepts in 2020. (The full extent to which Western AI companies currently use sparse attention in their latest models remains undisclosed.)</p>
<p>Despite sparse attention being a known approach for years, DeepSeek claims its version achieves "fine-grained sparse attention for the first time" and has cut API prices by 50 percent to demonstrate the efficiency gains. But to understand more about what makes DeepSeek v3.2 notable, it's useful to refresh yourself on a little AI history.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/deepseek-tests-sparse-attention-to-slash-ai-processing-costs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Fresh off his crusade against Jimmy Kimmel and ABC, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission may eliminate TV station ownership limits in a potential gift for station owners like Sinclair and Nexstar.</p>
<p>When FCC Chairman Brendan Carr <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-chairman-unconvincingly-claims-he-never-threatened-abc-station-licenses/">threatened ABC affiliates with license revocations</a> for carrying Jimmy Kimmel's show, he said that national networks exert too much control over local TV stations and that he's trying "to empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities." Taking a cue from Carr, Sinclair and Nexstar continued blocking <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> on their ABC affiliates even after ABC and its owner Disney ended Kimmel's suspension.</p>
<p>Within days, Sinclair and Nexstar decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/sinclair-gets-nothing-it-asked-for-puts-jimmy-kimmel-back-on-anyway/">put Kimmel back on the air</a>. Pressure from viewers and advertisers likely played a major role in the reversal. But for Carr, the episode might reinforce his belief that station groups should have more influence over national programming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/after-threatening-abc-over-kimmel-fcc-chair-may-eliminate-tv-ownership-caps/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>With a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/09/29/vibe-working-introducing-agent-mode-and-office-agent-in-microsoft-365-copilot/">new set of Microsoft 365 features</a>, knowledge workers will be able to generate complex Word documents or Excel spreadsheets using only text prompts to Microsoft's chatbot. Two distinct products were announced, each using different models and accessed from within different tools—though the similar names Microsoft chose make it confusing to parse what's what.</p>
<p>Driven by OpenAI's GPT-5 large language model, Agent Mode is built into Word and Excel, and it allows the creation of complex documents and spreadsheets from user prompts. It's called "agent" mode because it doesn't just work from the prompt in a single step; rather, it plans multistep work and runs a validation loop in the hopes of ensuring quality.</p>
<p>It's only available in the web versions of Word and Excel at present, but the plan is to bring it to native desktop applications later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/with-new-agent-mode-for-excel-and-word-microsoft-touts-vibe-working/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's biggest product event of the year happens in September, when the company puts out a new batch of iPhones and Apple Watches and other odds and ends. But in most years, Apple either has another smaller event or just a handful of additional product announcements later in the fall in October or November—usually the focus is on the Mac, the iPad, or both.</p>
<p>It seems like a new iPad Pro could be one of the announcements on tap. Russian YouTube channel Wylsacom has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnzkC2q-iGI">posted</a> an unboxing video and early tour of what appears to be a retail boxed version of a new 256GB 13-inch iPad Pro, as well as an M5 processor that we haven't seen in any other Apple product yet. This would be the first new iPad Pro since May 2024, when Apple introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/m4-ipad-pro-review-well-now-youre-just-showing-off/">the current M4 version</a>.</p>
<p>The same channel also got hold of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4E8716KFgw">the M4 MacBook Pro early</a>, so it seems likely that this is genuine. And while the video is mostly dedicated to complaining about packaging, the wattage of the included power adapter, and how boring it is that Apple doesn't introduce dramatic design changes every generation, it does also give us some early performance numbers for the new M5.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/youtuber-unboxes-what-seems-to-be-a-pre-release-version-of-an-m5-ipad-pro/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The rocket's Super Heavy booster will again splash down in the Gulf of Mexico just offshore from SpaceX's launch site in South Texas. And Starship, the rocket's upper stage, will fly on a suborbital arc before reentering the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean for a water landing northwest of Australia.</p>
<p>SpaceX will again test the rocket's satellite deployer and reignite one of the ship's Raptor engines in space to adjust the vehicle's path for reentry. These demonstrations will pave the way for future Starship flights into low-Earth orbit. All of the rocket's ascents to date have, by design, ended before reaching orbital velocity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/spacex-has-a-few-tricks-up-its-sleeve-for-the-last-starship-flight-of-the-year/">Read full article</a></p>

The first of those bug fix updates has arrived this week in the form of iOS 26.0.1, macOS 26.0.1, iPadOS 26.0.1, and equivalent updates for most of the devices across Apple's ecosystem.</p>
<p>The release notes for most of the updates focus on device- and platform-specific early adopter problems, particularly for buyers of the new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone Air.</p>
<p>The iOS 26.0.1 update fixes a bug that could prevent phones from connecting to cellular networks, a bug that could cause app icons to appear blank, and the VoiceOver feature becoming disabled on devices that have it on. Camera, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth bugs with the new iPhones have also been patched. The iPadOS update also fixes a bug that was causing the floating software keyboard to move around.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/ios-26-0-1-macos-26-0-1-updates-fix-install-bugs-new-phone-problems-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/">signed</a> the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act into law, requiring AI companies to disclose their safety practices while stopping short of mandating actual safety testing. The law requires companies with annual revenues of at least $500 million to publish safety protocols on their websites and report incidents to state authorities, but it lacks the stronger enforcement teeth of the bill Newsom <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/california-governor-vetoes-controversial-ai-safety-bill/">vetoed</a> last year after tech companies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/outcry-from-big-ai-firms-over-california-ai-kill-switch-bill/">lobbied heavily</a> against it.</p>
<p>The legislation, <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB53/id/3270002">S.B. 53</a>, replaces Senator Scott Wiener's previous attempt at AI regulation, known as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/from-sci-fi-to-state-law-californias-plan-to-prevent-ai-catastrophe/">S.B. 1047</a>, that would have required safety testing and "kill switches" for AI systems. Instead, the new law asks companies to describe how they incorporate "national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices" into their AI development, without specifying what those standards are or requiring independent verification.</p>
<p>"California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive," Newsom said in a statement, though the law's actual protective measures remain largely voluntary beyond basic reporting requirements.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/californias-newly-signed-ai-law-just-gave-big-tech-exactly-what-it-wanted/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>By the time you read this, the World Endurance Championship will be 100 races old. Once centered on the mega-expensive, mega-fast <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/03/2016s-wec-hybrids-this-years-coolest-racing-cars-take-to-the-track/">LMP1 hybrids</a>, it's all about the Hypercars now. These are purpose-built, closed-top race cars, with some of the most complex hybrid systems you'll find outside of Formula 1, clad in bodywork that could give the Batmobile a run for its money. These Hypercars are designed to last the distance. During the 24 hours of Le Mans this year, the winning car covered 3,276 miles (5,273 km); for context, an F1 race is usually 190 miles (305 km), and at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/f1-in-italy-look-what-happens-when-the-downforce-comes-off/">Monza this year</a>, the race lasted little more than an hour. Here's another difference with F1: When it comes to endurance racing, Ferrari has been winning a lot.</p>
<p>In fact, it's taken victory at Le Mans for three years in a row, scoring a hat trick after 50 years away from this corner of the sport. This year has been even better: Ferrari leads the manufacturer's championship and the driver's championship with the #51 factory car. Its closest rival for the driver's title is another 83 Ferrari, this one entered as a privateer car by the AF Corsa team. When the invite arrived to join the team for its race at the Circuit of the Americas in Texas, it seemed like a perfect opportunity to watch it in action and find out the key to that success.</p>
<p>"It has been an amazing challenge for us because after 50 years, it was not simple to restart in the pinnacle of motorsport," said Antonello Coletta, head of Ferrari's endurance racing program. Eighteen months after the car was greenlit, it was racing at Sebring in early 2023, a notoriously bumpy WWII bomber base in Florida that is as hard a test on a race car as any. Later that year, the 499P won Le Mans <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/how-ferrari-won-le-mans-for-the-first-time-in-58-years/">on its first try</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/behind-the-scenes-with-the-most-beautiful-car-in-racing-the-ferrari-499p/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A fossil skull from China that made headlines last week may or may not be a million years old, but it's probably closely related to Denisovans.</p>
<p>The fossil skull, dubbed Yunxian 2, is one of three unearthed from a terrace alongside the Han River, in central China, in a layer of river sediment somewhere between 600,000 and 1 million years old. Archaeologists originally identified them as <i>Homo erectus</i>, but Hanjiang Normal University paleoanthropologist Xiaobo Feng and his colleagues’ recent digital reconstruction of Yunxian 2 suggests the skulls may actually have belonged to someone a lot more similar to us: a hominin group defined as a species called <i>Homo longi</i> or a Denisovan, depending on who’s doing the naming.</p>
<p>The recent paper adds fuel—and a new twist—to that debate. And the whole thing may hinge on a third skull from the same site, still waiting to be published.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/is-the-million-year-old-skull-from-china-a-denisovan-or-something-else/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Subaru provided flights from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon, and accommodation so Ars could drive the new Crosstrek. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Even at a brief glance, the Subaru Crosstrek clearly prioritizes rugged design and personality over any semblance of aerodynamic efficiency. Subaru’s best-seller also comes only in all-wheel drive, to stay true to customer expectations of all-weather confidence and the appeal of an aspirational adventure lifestyle. And yet, the latest-generation Crosstrek’s new hybrid variant improves power and torque output significantly, while simultaneously resulting in the most efficient Crosstrek to date.</p>
<p>Any consideration of aerodynamic improvements for this generation can best be thought of as minor. And yet, the wheel well vents do reduce turbulence and pressure while more cleanly skirting air around the side panels. And some mild smoothing versus the previous generations include tiny elements like the forward-facing edge of the roof rail mounts. However, reduced plastic cladding on the hybrid Crosstreks that might seem intended to improve airflow counterintuitively came about only because Subaru builds the hybrids in Japan for all international markets, and only Americans prefer going overboard on tacky plastic trim pieces.</p>
<p>More importantly than aero, the Crosstrek now shares a hybrid powertrain with the Forester SUV. If a naturally aspirated 2.5 L horizontally opposed Boxer four-cylinder engine sounds familiar from Subarus over the past four decades, in reality, this hybrid system significantly works over the flat-four versus even current internal-combustion siblings. This year introduces a host of mechanical modifications to the cylinder head, block, camshaft, crank pulley, fuel system, intake, exhaust, cooling, and more. But more importantly, the engine now runs on an Atkinson cycle, which holds the intake valves open longer to reduce piston resistance during the expansion stroke, resulting in reduced power output but improved fuel efficiency.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/the-most-efficient-crosstrek-ever-subarus-hybrid-gets-a-bit-rugged/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>LEIPZIG, Germany—Porsche is synonymous with sports cars in which the engine lives behind the driver. From the company's first open-top 356/1—which it let us drive a couple of years ago—to the latest stupendously clever 911 variants, these are the machines most of us associate with the Stuttgart-based brand. And indeed, the company has sold more than a million 911s since the model's introduction in 1963. But here's the bald truth: It's the SUVs that keep the lights on. Without their profit, there would be no money to develop the next <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/porsches-best-daily-driver-911-the-2025-carrera-gts-t-hybrid-review/">T-Hybrid</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/01/weight-saving-and-aero-optimization-feature-in-the-2025-porsche-911-gt3/">GT3</a>. The first Cayenne was introduced just 23 years ago; since then, Porsche has sold more than 1.5 million of them. And the next one will be electric.</p>
<p>Of course, this won't be Porsche's first electric SUV. That honor goes to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/we-drive-the-two-sweet-spots-in-porsches-2025-macan-ev-lineup/">electric Macan</a>, which is probably becoming a more common sight on the streets in more well-heeled neighborhoods. Like the Macan, the Cayenne Electric is based on Volkswagen Group's Premium Platform Electric, but this is no mere scaled-up Macan.</p>
<p>"It's not just a product update; it's a complete new chapter in the story," said Sajjad Khan, a member of Porsche's management board in charge of car IT.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/09/heres-what-we-know-about-porsches-electric-cayenne-suv/">Read full article</a></p>
