                            <![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="bolded">n May, </span>President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors and the development of nuclear energy technology; the orders aim to cut red tape, ease approval processes, and reshape the role of the main regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.”</p>
<p>Self-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/nuclear-energy">nuclear fission</a>, in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/trump-aims-for-400-gw-of-nuclear-by-2050-10-large-reactors-under-construct/749107/">400 gigawatts</a> by 2050. To help achieve that goal, scientific institutions like the Idaho National Laboratory, a leading research institute in nuclear energy, are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel. Companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs, a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector. For example, Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based nuclear power company, plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/the-us-is-trying-to-kick-start-a-nuclear-energy-renaissance/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Six decades have now passed since some of the most iconic Project Gemini spaceflights. The 60th anniversary of Gemini 4, when Ed White conducted the first US spacewalk, came in June. The next mission, Gemini 5, ended just two weeks ago, in 1965. These missions are now forgotten by most Americans, as most of the people alive during that time are now deceased.</p>
<p>However, during these early years of spaceflight, NASA engineers and astronauts cut their teeth on a variety of spaceflight firsts, flying a series of harrowing missions during which it seems a miracle that no one died.</p>
<p>Because the Gemini missions, as well as NASA's first human spaceflight program Mercury, yielded such amazing stories, I was thrilled to realize that a new book has recently been published—<em><a href="https://www.apolloremastered.com/gemini-and-mercury-remastered">Gemini &amp; Mercury Remastered</a></em>—that brings them back to life in vivid color.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/60-years-after-gemini-newly-processed-images-reveal-incredible-details/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>This year's budget expires at the end of this month, and Congress must act before October 1 to avert a government shutdown. If Congress passes a budget before then, it will most likely be in the form of a continuing resolution, an extension of this year's funding levels into the first few weeks or months of fiscal year 2026.</p>
<p>The White House's budget request for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 25 percent cut to NASA's overall budget, and a nearly 50 percent reduction in funding for the agency's Science Mission Directorate. These cuts would cut off money for at least 41 missions, including 19 already in space and many more far along in development.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/scientists-its-do-or-die-time-for-americas-primacy-exploring-the-solar-system/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Under ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr, federal health officials are working to link COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to the deaths of 25 children, and may further restrict access to the shots, possibly recommending them for people aged 75 and up, instead of 65 and up, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/12/covid-vaccine-child-death-cdc/">according to The Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Four unnamed sources close to the situation told the Post that Trump administration health officials appear to be using information from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to make the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed children. VAERS is a system in which anyone can report anything they think is an adverse event related to a vaccination. The reports are completely unverified upon submission, and the <span id="_M5PEaKv_DKK40PEP4NbYkAI_25" class="wtBS9">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> staff follow up on serious reports to try to substantiate claims and assess if they were actually caused by a vaccine. They rarely are.</p>
<h2>Vaccine safety</h2>
<p>Federal health experts continuously monitor VAERS and other safety surveillance systems, exhaustively assessing the safety of vaccines. After billions of COVID-19 doses have been administered worldwide, they—like other governments, health organizations, and academic researchers around the world—have found the shots to be remarkably safe. While they have been linked to a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart and surrounding tissue, respectively), that risk is low and the cases are generally mild. During the 2023–2024 COVID-19 season, the incidence rate of heart conditions was 27 cases per million doses for males aged 12 to 24, who have the highest risk of any group. The shots have not been linked to deaths or heart transplants, according to data presented by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/04-Meyer-COVID-508.pdf">staff experts at the CDC</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/covid-shot-access-could-tighten-rfk-jr-may-claim-they-cause-child-deaths/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In <em>Animal Crossing</em>, Tom Nook runs the town shop and provides home loans (paid out in bells, the in-game currency) that keep players perpetually in debt, which is a core mechanic of the game.</p>
<p>"Predictably, it escalated into an anti-Tom Nook movement," Fonseca <a href="https://joshfonseca.com/blogs/animal-crossing-llm">wrote</a> in a detailed post documenting his hack that bridges a 2002 game to cloud-based AI without modifying any game code. While Fonseca frames the uprising as a type of emergent phenomenon in his post and a YouTube video, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/10/animal-crossing-llm/">examination of the source code</a> by AI researcher Simon Willison shows that Fonseca specifically instructed the villagers to behave this way and even <a href="https://github.com/vuciv/animal-crossing-llm-mod/blob/cc9b6b571da1be062d979d50aa86e2ac1dce7a44/dialogue_prompt.py#L165-L184">escalate</a> the unrest over time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/animal-crossing-mod-uses-ai-to-orchestrate-anti-tom-nook-villager-revolt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>While the Trump administration has continued to refer to efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change as a scam, it has done almost nothing to counter the copious scientific evidence that demonstrates that climate change is real and doing real damage to the citizens of the US. The lone exception has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/analysis-the-trump-administrations-assault-on-climate-action/">a draft Department of Energy report</a> prepared by a handful of carefully chosen fringe figures that questioned the mainstream understanding of climate change. The shoddy work and questionable conclusions of that report were so extensive that an analysis of it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/mockery-of-science-climate-scientists-tear-into-new-us-climate-report/">required over 450 pages</a> to detail all of its shortcomings.</p>
<p>But its shortcomings may not have been limited to the science, as a lawsuit alleges that its preparation violated a law that regulates the activities of federal advisory panels. Now, in an attempt to avoid dealing with that lawsuit, the Department of Energy is claiming that it dissolved the committee that prepared the report, making the lawsuit moot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Congress is also attempting to muddy the waters. In response to the DOE report, the National Academies of Science announced that it would prepare a report describing the current state of climate science. Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight have responded by announcing an investigation of the National Academies "for undermining the EPA."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/department-of-energy-gets-rid-of-climate-skeptics-group-to-dodge-lawsuit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The conservative broadcaster/provocateur Charlie Kirk—murdered this week during a visit to a Utah college—had tweeted some life advice this summer: "When things are moving very fast and people are losing their minds, it’s important to stay grounded. Turn off your phone, read scripture, spend time with friends, and remember internet fury is not real life. It’s going to be ok."</p>
<p>Kirk was not himself always a great role model for staying grounded, thoughtful, or caring to others. He was better known for "look at me" stunts like offering <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/charlie-kirk-reaction-taylor-swift-143436452.html">completely unsolicited commentary upon Taylor Swift's engagement</a>, calling the singer a "cat lady" and telling her to "engage in reality more," to "reject feminism," and to "submit to your husband" because "you're not in charge."</p>
<p>But his advice itself isn't all bad. Social media so often feeds most hungrily upon our darker emotions; constant reinforcement of anger, fear, frustration, and even jealously (FOMO, anyone?) cannot possibly be good for us to marinate in so often. Maintaining a connection to the physical world and the physical presence of others can be immensely stabilizing—sometimes even helpfully "boring"—after we become too addicted to the rush of emotions caused by one more Internet outrage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/after-kirk-shooting-utah-governor-calls-social-media-a-cancer-will-we-treat-it-like-one/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Here's some good news for a Friday afternoon: For 2025 through August, global electric vehicle sales have grown by 25 percent compared to the same eight months in 2024, according to the analysts at Rho Motion. That amounts to 12.5 million EVs, although the data combines both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs for the total.</p>
<p>However, that's for global sales. In fact, EV adoption is moving even faster in Europe, which has grown by 31 percent so far this year (Rho says that BEV sales grew by 31 percent but PHEV sales by just 30 percent)—a total of 2.6 million plug-in vehicles. In some European countries, the increase has been even more impressive: up by 45 percent in Germany, 41 percent in Italy, and by 100 percent in Spain.</p>
<p>But despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/electric-vehicle-sales-grew-25-worldwide-but-just-6-in-north-america/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>California's legislature this week approved a bill to let renters opt out of bulk-billing arrangements that force them to pay for Internet service from a specific provider.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB1414/2025">bill</a> says that by January 1, a landlord must "allow the tenant to opt out of paying for any subscription from a third-party Internet service provider, such as through a bulk-billing arrangement, to provide service for wired Internet, cellular, or satellite service that is offered in connection with the tenancy." If a landlord fails to do so, the tenant "may deduct the cost of the subscription to the third-party Internet service provider from the rent," and the landlord would be prohibited from retaliating.</p>
<p>The bill <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/rollcall/AB1414/id/1601642">passed</a> the state Senate in a 30–7 vote on Wednesday but needs Gov. Gavin Newsom's signature to become law.

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, CBC News <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/education-accord-nl-sources-dont-exist-1.7631364">reported</a> that a major education reform <a href="https://educationaccordnl.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EANL_Final-Report_web.pdf">document</a> prepared for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador contains at least 15 fabricated citations that academics suspect were generated by an AI language model—despite the same report calling for "ethical" AI use in schools.</p>
<p>"A Vision for the Future: Transforming and Modernizing Education," released August 28, serves as a 10-year roadmap for modernizing the province's public schools and post-secondary institutions. The 418-page document took 18 months to complete and was unveiled by co-chairs Anne Burke and Karen Goodnough, both professors at Memorial University's Faculty of Education, alongside Education Minister Bernard Davis.</p>
<p>One of the fake citations references a 2008 National Film Board movie called "Schoolyard Games" that does not exist, according to a board spokesperson. The exact citation reportedly appears in a University of Victoria style guide, a document that teaches students how to format references using fictional examples. The style guide warns on its first page that "Many citations in this guide are fictitious," meaning they are made-up examples used only to demonstrate proper formatting. Yet someone (or some AI chatbot) copied the fake example directly into the Education Accord report as if it were a real source.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/education-report-calling-for-ethical-ai-use-contains-over-15-fake-sources/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Even as Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/virtual-console/">endlessly mined</a> its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/hands-on-nes-classic-edition-puts-old-games-in-a-very-small-package/">classic consoles</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-super-nes-classic-edition/">nostalgic re-releases</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/the-year-of-mario-a-ton-of-classic-3d-games-reportedly-coming-to-switch-in-2020/">recent decades</a>, the company has seemed to completely ignore the existence of the Virtual Boy—its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/virtual-boy-the-bizarre-rise-and-quick-fall-of-nintendos-enigmatic-red-console/">abortive 1990s dip into the world of early virtual reality</a>. That's finally set to change next February with Nintendo's first-ever official re-release of Virtual Boy games—at least for players who <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">invest $100 in a required Virtual Boy-shaped Switch dock</a> (or a cheaper cardboard holder) to make them work.</p>

<p>Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online in the US and Canada will soon be able to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">purchase that $100 dock</a>, which Nintendo says "recreates the form of the original Virtual Boy hardware," or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">a slender $25 cardboard alternative</a>. Then, starting on February 17, those players will be able to play downloaded Virtual Boy games (included with an Expansion Pack subscription) by inserting a Switch or Switch 2 into one of those retro replicas. The system will presumably display those games in a split-screen mode that can be viewed through special lenses to replicate the Virtual Boy's original 384×224 resolution, four-shades-of-red stereoscopic display.</p>
<p>Nintendo's announcement says you'll "need this dedicated accessory" to play Virtual Boy titles through a Switch, suggesting that flat-screen play on a console without one of the custom docks won't be possible. And while "purchase limits apply" to the plastic Virtual Boy replica (which seems likely to be a collectible available only in limited supplies), the cheaper cardboard model seems designed for wider availability.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/over-three-decades-later-nintendo-remembers-the-virtual-boy-exists/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Lots of people are excited about the idea of using plants to help us draw down some of the excess carbon dioxide we've been pumping into the atmosphere. It would be nice to think that we could reforest our way out of the mess we're creating, but recent studies have indicated there's simply not enough productive land for this to work out.</p>
<p>One alternative might be to get plants to take up carbon dioxide more efficiently. Unfortunately, the enzyme that incorporates carbon dioxide into photosynthesis, called RUBISCO, is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/key-plant-proteins-that-grab-co%E2%82%82-finally-made-in-bacteria/">remarkably inefficient</a>. So, a team of researchers in Taiwan decided to try something new—literally. They put together a set of enzymes that added a new-to-nature biochemical cycle to plants that let it incorporate carbon far more efficiently. The resulting plants grew larger and incorporated more carbon.</p>
<h2>Cycles and recycles</h2>
<p>In the abstract, incorporating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the biochemistry of the cell seems simple—you just link up a few of the carbon atoms and you're off. But in reality, it's fiendishly complicated. Carbon dioxide is an extremely stable molecule, so incorporating it requires a very energetically favorable reaction. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_cycle">Calvin cycle</a> of photosynthesis, that reaction involves linking the carbon dioxide as part of a reaction that breaks apart a modified five-carbon sugar, creating two three-carbon molecules. Some of those molecules get fed into the cell's metabolism, while others get built up into a five-carbon sugar again, restarting the cycle.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/new-pathway-engineered-into-plants-lets-them-suck-up-more-co%e2%82%82/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Nissan provided flights from Austin to San Diego and then to Washington, DC, and accommodation so Ars could drive the Nissan Leaf. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>SAN DIEGO—The original Nissan Leaf was a car with a mission. Long before Elon Musk set his sights on Tesla selling vast numbers of electric vehicles to the masses, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/01/ex-nissan-boss-flees-japan-by-plane-turkey-arrests-pilots/">then-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn</a> wanted Nissan to shift half a million Leafs a year in the early 2010s. That didn't quite come to pass, but by 2020, it had sold its 500,000th EV, which went from its factory in Sunderland, England, to a customer in Norway.</p>
<p>Pioneering though they were, both first- and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/nissans-bigger-battery-bev-the-2019-leaf-plus-review/">second-generation</a> Leafs were compromised. They were adapted from existing internal combustion engine platforms, with the electric powertrains shoehorned inside. The cars' real handicaps were a lack of liquid cooling for the battery packs. Like an older Porsche 911, the Leaf was air-cooled, albeit with none of the collector value. That's all changed for generation three.</p>
<p>The new Leaf is built on a dedicated EV platform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault%E2%80%93Nissan_Common_Module_Family">shared</a> with Nissan's alliance partners Renault and Mitsubishi, and which we have previously seen used to good effect in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/nissans-all-wheel-drive-ariya-is-finally-on-sale-and-ars-has-driven-it/">Nissan Ariya</a>. The benefits of using a platform purpose-designed for electric propulsion are obvious from the space efficiency. The new car is 3 inches (75 mm) shorter from the outside, but offers nearly 9 inches (221 mm) more rear leg room (yes, really), making it a much more suitable place to put adults.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/small-affordable-efficient-a-lot-to-like-about-the-2026-nissan-leaf/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A former employee of a multinational DVD company was sentenced to four years in prison for stealing hundreds of pre-release DVDs and Blu-rays and leaking blockbuster movies online, the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/employee-multinational-dvd-company-sentenced-over-four-years-prison-stealing-selling-pre">confirmed</a> Thursday.</p>
<p>Back in May, Steven Hale <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/man-who-stole-1000-dvds-from-employer-strikes-plea-deal-over-movie-leaks/">pleaded guilty</a> to spending about a year between 2021 and 2022 stealing discs from his employer and selling them online through e-commerce sites. Among movies that Hale uploaded for illegal download were highly anticipated titles like <em>Dune</em>, as well as sequels to popular films like <em>F9: The Fast Saga</em> and <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>.</p>
<p>But according to the DOJ, Hale did the most damage by leaking advance copies of <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>. That particular movie, released exclusively in theaters in 2021, became the first movie after the COVID pandemic started to gross $1 billion at the box office. Likely DVD sales were expected to be just as explosive, but for many fans too cautious to return to movie theaters at the time, DVD leaks became too enticing to pass up. Hale wasn't the only one to recognize the high demand online, with illegal downloads of the movie becoming so widespread that ReasonLabs <a href="https://reasonlabs.com/blog/spider-miner-with-great-power-comes-great-problems">reported</a> that scammers started planting malware in illegal copies of the movie to "lure in as many victims as possible."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/ex-dvd-company-employee-gets-4-years-for-leaking-spider-man-blu-ray/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The probe, which began after a 2020 complaint from Slack, now part of Salesforce, accused Microsoft of abusing its market dominance by tying its video conferencing tool to its widely used suite of productivity applications.</p>
<p>Since the initial complaint, Microsoft has unbundled Teams from Office 365 in the EU, but critics said the changes were too narrow.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/microsoft-dodges-eu-fine-by-unbundling-teams-from-office/">Read full article</a></p>

Dear readers, if everything goes according to plan, four astronauts are less than six months away from traveling around the far side of the Moon and breaking free of low-Earth orbit for the first time in more than 53 years.

But many of us who were born after the Apollo Moon landings have been waiting for this moment our whole lives. It is almost upon us.</p>

<p><b>North Korea fires solid rocket motor. </b>North Korea said Tuesday it had conducted the final ground test of a solid-fuel rocket engine for a long-range ballistic missile in its latest advancement toward having an arsenal that could viably threaten the continental United States, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-rocket-engine-icbm-kim-jong-un-a72c2076435402c08ea57f47faac1d5f">the Associated Press reports</a>. The test Monday observed by leader Kim Jong Un was the ninth of the solid rocket motor built with carbon fiber and capable of producing 1,971 kilonewtons (443,000 pounds) of thrust, more powerful than past models, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/rocket-report-russias-rocket-engine-predicament-300th-launch-to-the-iss/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Consider the cul-de-sac. It leads off the main street past buildings of might-have-been to a dead-end disconnected from the beaten path. Computing history, of course, is filled with such terminal diversions, most never to be fully realized, and many for good reason. Particularly when it comes to user interfaces and how humans interact with computers, a lot of wild ideas deserved the obscure burials they got.</p>
<p>But some deserved better. Nearly every aspiring interface designer believed the way we were forced to interact with computers was limiting and frustrating, but one man in particular felt the emphasis on design itself missed the forest for the trees. Rather than drowning in visual metaphors or arcane iconographies doomed to be as complex as the systems they represented, the way we deal and interact with computers should stress functionality first, simultaneously considering both what users need to do and the cognitive limits they have. It was no longer enough that an interface be usable by a human—it must be <em>humane</em> as well.</p>
<p>What might a computer interface based on those principles look like? As it turns out, we already know.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/jef-raskins-cul-de-sac-and-the-quest-for-the-humane-computer/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>"Microsoft and OpenAI have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our partnership," the companies wrote in a joint statement. "We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety."</p>
<p>The announcement comes as OpenAI seeks to restructure from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity, a transition that requires Microsoft's approval, as the company is OpenAI's largest investor, with more than $13 billion committed since 2019.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/openai-and-microsoft-sign-preliminary-deal-to-revise-partnership-terms/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A child in Los Angeles has died of a measles-related brain disorder stemming from an infection in infancy, <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135">the Los Angeles County health department reported Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the child died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but always fatal complication that strikes years after an initial measles infection. The health department's announcement offered few details about the child, including the child's age, but said that the child had contracted the virus before they were old enough to be vaccinated against measles. The first of two <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html">recommended doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine</a> is given between 12 and 15 months.</p>
<p>"This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members," Muntu Davis, a Los Angeles County health officer, said in a statement. "Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity. Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself—it's about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/child-dies-of-horrifying-measles-complication-in-los-angeles/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA's interim administrator, Sean Duffy, was fired up on Wednesday when he joined a teleconference <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/has-perseverance-found-a-biosignature-on-mars/">to talk about new scientific findings</a> that concerned the potential for life to have once existed on Mars.</p>
<p>"This is exciting news," said Duffy about an arrow-shaped rock on Mars found by NASA's Perseverance rover. The rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. The findings were intriguing, but not conclusive. Further study of the rocks in an advanced lab on Earth might prove more definitive.</p>
<p>Duffy was ready, he said, to discuss the scientific results along with NASA experts on the call with reporters. However, the very first question—and for any space reporter, the obvious one—concerned NASA's on-again, off-again plan to return rocks from the surface of Mars for study on Earth. This mission, called Mars Sample Return, has been on hold for nearly two years after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/independent-review-finds-mars-sample-return-mission-important-but-broken/">an independent analysis found</a> that NASA's bloated plan would cost at least $8 billion to $11 billion. President Trump has sought to cancel it outright.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/nasa-found-intriguing-rocks-on-mars-so-where-does-that-leave-mars-sample-return/">Read full article</a></p>
