              <![CDATA[<p>When satellites first started peering down on the craggy, glaciated Antarctic Peninsula about 40 years ago, they saw only a few tiny patches of vegetation covering a total of about 8,000 square feet—less than a football field.</p>
<p>But since then, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed rapidly, and a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01564-5">study</a> shows that mosses, along with some lichen, liverworts and associated algae, have colonized more than 4.6 square miles, an area nearly four times the size of New York’s Central Park.</p>
<p>The findings, published Friday in Nature Geoscience, based on a meticulous analysis of Landsat images from 1986 to 2021, show that the greening trend is distinct from natural variability and that it has accelerated by 30 percent since 2016, fast enough to cover nearly 75 football fields per year.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/greening-of-antartica-shows-how-climate-change-affects-the-frozen-continent/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Dozens of neo-Nazis are fleeing Telegram and moving to a relatively unknown secret chat app that has received funding from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>In a report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/neo-nazi-accelerationists-seek-new-digital-refuge-amid-looming-telegram-crackdown">published on Friday morning</a>, researchers found that in the wake of the arrest of Telegram founder <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pavel-durov-defends-telegram-privacy-changes/">Pavel Durov</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/terrorgram-collective-indictments/">charges against leaders of the so-called Terrorgram Collective</a>, dozens of extremist groups have moved to the app SimpleX Chat in recent weeks over fears that Telegram’s privacy policies expose them to being arrested. The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/terrorgram-collective-indictments/">Terrorgram Collective</a> is a neo-Nazi propaganda network that calls for acolytes to target government officials, attack power stations, and murder people of color.</p>

      </figure>
While ISD stopped short of naming SimpleX in its report, the researchers point out that the app promotes itself as “having a different burner email or phone for each contact, and no hassle to manage them.” This is exactly how SimpleX refers to itself <a href="https://simplex.chat/">on its website</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/neo-nazis-head-to-encrypted-simplex-chat-app-bail-on-telegram/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>London's Great Exhibition of 1851 attracted some 6 million people eager to experience more than 14,000 exhibitors showcasing 19th-century marvels of technology and engineering. The event took place in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace">Crystal Palace</a>, a 990,000-square-foot building of cast iron and plate glass originally located in Hyde Park. And it was built in an incredible 190 days. According to a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17581206.2024.2391984">recent paper</a> published in the International Journal for the History of Engineering and Technology, one of the secrets was the use of a standardized screw thread, first proposed 10 years before its construction, although the thread did not officially become the British standard until 1905.</p>
<p>“During the Victorian era there was incredible innovation from workshops right across Britain that was helping to change the world," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1058094">said co-author John Gardner</a> of Anglia Ruskin University (ARU). "In fact, progress was happening at such a rate that certain breakthroughs were perhaps never properly realized at the time, as was the case here with the Crystal Palace. Standardization in engineering is essential and commonplace in the 21st century, but its role in the construction of the Crystal Palace was a major development."</p>
<p>The design competition for what would become the Crystal Palace was launched in March 1850, with a deadline four weeks later, and the actual, fully constructed building opened on May 1, 1851. The winning design, by Joseph Patterson, wasn't chosen until quite late in the game after numerous designs had been rejected—most because they were simply too far above the 100,000-pound budget.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-londons-crystal-palace-was-built-so-quickly/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[
<p>The old-school <em>Diablo</em> games endure for a lot of reasons. Some players like the deep lore and world-building. Some like partnering with friends and working through dungeons as a team. Some like hunting for incredibly rare loot and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">maybe selling it on a livestream</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, you dive into high-level <em>Diablo</em> just for a chance to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsNx0DGrSW8">kill a screen full of monsters really quickly</a>.</p>
<p>If that kind of high-density enemy killing is what you're looking for, <em>Halls of Torment</em>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdQweTEsOUE">recent Version 1.0 release</a> is a near-perfect take on the concept. Despite the decidedly old-school presentation, the game takes very modern inspiration from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> and its quick-hit bursts of leveling up through overwhelming enemy hordes. In doing so, it has become my absolute favorite way to wipe out enemies at rates approaching and exceeding 50,000/hour, at some points.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/halls-of-torment-is-diablo-cranked-up-to-50000-kills-hour/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Apple released the first software updates for its devices since last month's rollout of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.</p>
<p>Those who've been following along know that several key features that didn't make it into the initial release of iOS 18 are expected in iOS 18.1, but that's not the update we got on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rather, Apple pushed out a series of smaller updates that fixed several bugs but did not add new features. The updates are labeled iOS 18.0.1, iPadOS 18.0.1, visionOS 2.0.1, macOS Sequoia 15.0.1, and watchOS 11.0.1.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/no-more-bricked-ipads-apple-fixes-several-bugs-in-ios-ipados-macos-updates/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, under contract for dozens of flights for the US military and Amazon's Kuiper broadband network, lifted off from Florida on its second test flight Friday, suffered an anomaly with one of its strap-on boosters, and still achieved a successful mission, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>This test flight, known as Cert-2, is the second certification mission for the new Vulcan rocket, a milestone that paves the way for the Space Force to clear ULA's new rocket to begin launching national security satellites in the coming months.</p>
<p>While ULA said the Vulcan rocket continued to hit its marks during the climb into orbit Friday, engineers are investigating what happened with one of its solid rocket boosters shortly after liftoff.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/ulas-second-vulcan-rocket-lost-part-of-its-booster-and-kept-going/">Read full article</a></p>

          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, OpenAI unveiled <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/">Canvas</a>, a new interface for ChatGPT designed to enhance collaboration on writing and coding projects. The feature bears similarities to a feature called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/#page-2">Artifacts</a> in Anthropic's Claude AI assistant, introduced in June. Canvas displays content in a separate window alongside the AI chat history, allowing users to keep an eye on working document drafts or programming code while collaborating with the AI assistant.</p>
<p>OpenAI began rolling out canvas to ChatGPT Plus and Team users globally on Thursday, while Enterprise and Education users will gain access next week. The company also plans to make canvas available to all free ChatGPT users once it exits the beta stage.</p>
<p>Like Artifacts, Canvas is sort of a scratch pad, a way to visually separate portions of the active working context (the user prompt) to keep them from getting lost in the chat backlog. From our experience, Artifacts can ease the process of working on projects with Claude that require editing and revisions, and Canvas functions in a very similar way.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openais-canvas-eases-collaborations-with-chatgpt/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Two men involved in an elaborate scheme duping Apple into replacing about 6,000 counterfeit iPhones with genuine iPhones were sentenced to prison this week, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-foreign-nationals-sentenced-multimillion-dollar-scheme-defraud-apple-inc-out-6000">announced</a> Thursday.</p>
<p>Together with their co-conspirators, the 34-year-old scammers, Haotian Sun and Pengfei Xue, squeezed Apple for about $2.5 million, as employees for years failed to detect what the DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/two-maryland-residents-found-guilty-multimillion-dollar-scheme-defraud-apple-inc-out">described</a> as a rather "sophisticated" scheme between 2017 and 2019.</p>
<p>Now Sun has been sentenced to 57 months in prison and must pay more than $1 million to Apple in restitution. For his part, Xue was sentenced to 54 months and ordered to pay $397,800 in restitution, the DOJ said. Additionally, both men must also serve three years of supervised release and forfeit thousands more following the judgment.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fraudsters-faked-out-apple-with-bogus-iphones-in-2-5m-repair-scam/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>When a research team led by Amrit Kirpalani, a medical educator at Western University in Ontario, Canada, evaluated ChatGPT’s performance in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/passing-part-of-a-medical-licensing-exam-doesnt-make-chatgpt-a-good-doctor/">diagnosing medical cases</a> back in August 2024, one of the things that surprised them was the AI’s propensity to give well-structured, eloquent but blatantly wrong answers.</p>
<p>Now, in a study recently published in Nature, a different group of researchers tried to explain why ChatGPT and other large language models tend to do this. “To speak confidently about things we do not know is a problem of humanity in a lot of ways. And large language models are imitations of humans,” says Wout Schellaert, an AI researcher at the University of Valencia, Spain, and co-author of the paper.</p>
<h2>Smooth operators</h2>
<p>Early large language models like GPT-3 had a hard time answering simple questions about geography or science. They even struggled with performing simple math such as “how much is 20 +183.” But in most cases where they couldn’t identify the correct answer, they did what an honest human being would do: They avoided answering the question.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/the-more-sophisticated-ai-models-get-the-more-likely-they-are-to-lie/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Whether you care about Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant or not, many new PCs introduced this year have included a dedicated Copilot key on the keyboard; this is true whether the PC meets the requirements for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">Microsoft's Copilot+ PC program</a> or not. Microsoft's commitment to putting AI features in all its products runs so deep that the company changed the Windows keyboard for the first time in three decades.</p>
<p>But what happens if you don't use Copilot regularly, or you've disabled or uninstalled it entirely, or if you simply don't need to have it available at the press of a button? Microsoft is making allowances for you in a new Windows Insider Preview build in the Dev channel, which will <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/10/04/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26120-1930-dev-channel/">allow the Copilot key to be reprogrammed</a> so that it can launch more than just Copilot.</p>

<p>There are restrictions. To appear in the menu of options in the Settings app, Microsoft says an app must be "MSIX packaged and signed, thus indicating the app meets security and privacy requirements to keep customers safe." Generally an app installed via the Microsoft Store or apps built into Windows will meet those requirements, though apps installed from other sources may not. But you can't make the Copilot key launch any old executable or batch file, and you can't customize it to do anything other than launch apps (at least, not without using third-party tools for reconfiguring your keyboard).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/new-windows-11-build-lets-you-use-copilot-key-to-launch-things-that-arent-copilot/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Meta announced a preview of <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/movie-gen/">Movie Gen</a>, a new suite of AI models designed to create and manipulate video, audio, and images, including creating a realistic video from a single photo of a person. The company claims the models outperform other video-synthesis models when evaluated by humans, pushing us closer to a future where anyone can synthesize a full video of any subject on demand.</p>
<p>The company does not yet have plans of when or how it will release these capabilities to the public, but Meta says Movie Gen is a tool that may allow people to "enhance their inherent creativity" rather than replace human artists and animators. The company envisions future applications such as easily creating and editing "day in the life" videos for social media platforms or generating personalized animated birthday greetings.</p>
<p>Movie Gen builds on Meta's previous work in video synthesis, following 2022's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/write-text-get-video-meta-announces-ai-video-generator/">Make-A-Scene</a> video generator and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/metas-new-ai-image-generator-was-trained-on-1-1-billion-instagram-and-facebook-photos/">Emu</a> image-synthesis model. Using text prompts for guidance, this latest system can generate custom videos with sounds for the first time, edit and insert changes into existing videos, and transform images of people into realistic personalized videos.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/metas-new-movie-gen-ai-system-can-deepfake-video-from-a-single-photo/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the outer reaches of the Solar System, beyond the ice giant Neptune, lies a ring of comets and dwarf planets known as the Kuiper Belt. The closest of these objects are billions of kilometers away. There is, however, an outer limit to the Kuiper Belt. Right?</p>
<p>Until now, it was thought there was nothing beyond 48 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun, (one AU is slightly over 150 million km). It seemed there was little beyond that. That changed when NASA’s New Horizons team detected 11 new objects lurking from 60 to 80 AU. What was thought to be empty space turned out to be a gap between the first ring of Kuiper Belt objects and a new, second ring. Until now, it was thought that our Solar System is unusually small when compared to exosolar systems, but it evidently extends farther out than anyone imagined.</p>
<p>While these objects are only currently visible as pinpoints of light, and Fraser is allowing room for error until the spacecraft gets closer, what their existence could tell us about the Kuiper Belt and the possible origins of the Solar System is remarkable.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/new-kuiper-belt-objects-lurk-farther-away-than-we-ever-thought/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) remains on the hook for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/elon-musks-x-fined-380k-over-serious-child-safety-concerns-watchdog-says/">an approximately $400,000 fine</a> after failing to respond to an Australia eSafety Commission 2023 inquiry, which largely sought to probe measures X is currently taking to combat an alleged proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on its platform.</p>
<p>To void the fine, X tried to persuade Australian Judge Michael Wheelahan that X had no obligation to comply with an Online Safety Act notice issued to Twitter because Twitter "ceased to exist" a few weeks after receiving the notice—when Musk merged the app into his company X Corp.</p>
<p>Wheelahan summarized X's argument as saying that "X Corp was not obliged to prepare any report in Twitter Inc’s place, as X Corp was not the same person as the provider to whom the notice was issued."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/x-loses-appeal-of-400k-australia-child-safety-fine-now-faces-more-fines/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p class="p2">The team behind iA Writer, a distraction-free writing app that syncs across platforms, has left its Android app "<a href="https://ia.net/topics/our-android-app-is-frozen-in-carbonite">frozen in carbonite</a>." The app is still alive for those who had it installed, but it cannot sync with Drive or be updated. That's because, citing Google's security policies and the economics of paid Android apps, the iA team has given up on Android development, which it considers "an ever-tightening Force Choke."</p>
<p class="p2">In follow-up emails with Ars after announcing the move on iA's blog on September 26, Oliver Reichenstein, founder of Information Architects (iA), described feedback from users as surprisingly positive, saying he has been “stunned and pleased that our Android users understand us so well.”</p>
<p class="p2">“I expected a lot more people to be upset,” Reichenstein wrote. “But our inbox is full of people that understand and support our decision.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/ia-pulls-its-writer-app-from-android-citing-red-tape-piracy-and-review-spam/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There has been a lot of research on the types of <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000392.pdf">people who believe conspiracy theories</a>, and their <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/201801/why-do-people-believe-in-conspiracy-theories">reasons for doing so</a>. But there’s a wrinkle: My colleagues and I have found that there are a number of people sharing conspiracies online who don’t believe their own content.</p>
<p>They are opportunists. These people share conspiracy theories to promote conflict, cause chaos, recruit and radicalize potential followers, make money, harass, or even just to get attention.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.14 of the Rocket Report! For readers who don't know, my second book was published last week. It's titled <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/759707/reentry-by-eric-berger/"><em>Reentry</em></a>, and tells the story behind the story of SpaceX's development of the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft. The early reviews are great, and it made USA Today's bestseller list this week. If you're interested in rockets, and since you're reading this newsletter we already know the answer to that, the book is probably up your alley.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Vega C cleared for next launch in November</strong>. Italian rocket firm Avio successfully tested a redesigned Zefiro-40 solid rocket motor for the second time on Thursday, <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Vega/Last_rocket_motor_firing_clears_path_for_Vega-C_launch">the European Space Agency said</a>. This second firing follows an initial firing test of the motor in May 2024 and concludes the qualification tests for the new engine nozzle design of the Zefiro-40. This rocket motor powers the second stage of the Vega C rocket.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/rocket-report-ula-supremely-confident-in-vulcan-impulse-space-rakes-it-in/">Read full article</a></p>
