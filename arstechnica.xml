                            <![CDATA[<p>Shortly after the Trump Administration took office, it started cancelling grants for things it had disagreements with: funding for pandemic preparation, efforts to diversify the scientific workforce, those that targeted minority health issues, and more. These terminations were challenged in court, and a consolidated case was heard in the District of Massachusetts, pitting the government against individual researchers, organizations that represent them, and states that host research institutions.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/judge-slams-nih-grant-cuts-as-racist-appalling-white-house-attacks-judge/">a decisive win</a> for the scientists. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/doge-told-the-nih-which-grants-to-cancel-with-no-scientific-review/">the ruling explained</a>, the government's termination efforts violated a statute against "arbitrary and capricious" policies, resulting in a stay that both blocked implementation of the policy and restored the flow of research funding.</p>
<p>That stay remained intact through appeals that brought it to the Supreme Court, which released its ruling on Thursday. As the result is a complicated split among the Justices, the stay against the policy itself remains intact. However, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a103_kh7p.pdf">a slim majority</a> decided that government funding issues are required to be heard by a different court, and cannot be issued as part of the same ruling. So, researchers who lost their funding due to the now-defunct policy will remain de-funded.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/deeply-divided-supreme-court-lets-nih-grant-terminations-continue/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told reporters at a private dinner that investors are overexcited about AI models. "Someone" will lose a "phenomenal amount of money," he said, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/759965/sam-altman-openai-ai-bubble-interview">The Verge</a>. The statement came as his company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/15/openai-6-billion-stock-500-billion-valuation.html">negotiates</a> a secondary share sale at a $500 billion valuation—up from $300 billion just months earlier.</p>
<p>"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes," Altman told the journalists, comparing the current market to the dot-com crash of the 1990s. Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-is-on-track-to-out-talk-humanity/">reported</a> that he also predicted his company will spend "trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future" and that ChatGPT will soon serve "billions of people a day."</p>
<p>For context, Facebook <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/5380/facebook-user-engagement/">serves</a> about 3 billion monthly active users. Altman's projection would require ChatGPT to reach nearly half the world's population as daily users (not monthly, like Facebook), which is an extraordinarily optimistic outlook.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/sam-altman-calls-ai-a-bubble-while-seeking-500b-valuation-for-openai/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[A new report looks at barriers to EV charging.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about electric vehicle adoption here in the US. The current administration has made no secret of its hostility toward EVs and, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/on-trumps-chopping-block-evs-charger-funding-californias-emissions/">as promised,</a> has ended as many of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/gop-wants-ev-tax-credit-gone-it-would-be-a-disaster-for-tesla/">existing EV subsidies</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/feds-let-automakers-off-the-hook-for-fuel-economy-violations/">vehicle pollution regulations</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/trumps-trade-and-environment-policies-are-a-disaster-for-car-makers/">as it could</a>. After more than a year of month-on-month growth, EV sales <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/05/volvo-ev-sales-sink-32-as-buyers-turn-their-back-on-batteries/">started to contract</a>, and brands like Genesis and Volvo have seen their customers reject their electric offerings, forcing portfolio rethinks. But wait, it gets worse.</p>
<p>Time and again, surveys and studies show that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/heres-how-to-survive-your-relatives-ignorant-anti-ev-rant-this-thanksgiving/">fears</a> and concerns about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/">charging</a> are the main barriers standing in the way of someone switching from gas to EV. A new market research study by Telemetry Vice President Sam Abuelsamid confirms this, as it analyzes the charging infrastructure needs over the next decade. And one of the biggest hurdles—one that has gone mostly unmentioned across the decade-plus we've been covering this topic—is all the junk clogging up Americans' garages.</p>
<h2>Want an EV? Clean out your garage</h2>
<p>That's because, while DC fast-charging garners all the headlines and much of the funding, the overwhelming majority of EV charging is AC charging, usually at home—80 percent of it, in fact. People who own and live in a single family home are overrepresented among EV owners, and <a href="https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81065.pdf">data</a> from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory from a few years ago found that 42 percent of homeowners park near an electrical outlet capable of level 2 (240 V) AC charging.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/junk-filled-garages-hurt-ev-sales-as-people-dont-have-room-for-chargers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A local Neolithic community in northeastern France may have clashed with foreign invaders, cutting off limbs as war trophies and otherwise brutalizing their prisoners of war, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adv3162">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances. The findings challenge conventional interpretations of prehistoric violence as bring indiscriminate or committed for pragmatic reasons.</p>
<p>Neolithic Europe was no stranger to collective violence of many forms, such as the odd execution and massacres of small communities, as well as armed conflicts. For instance, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/archaeologists-unearth-fresh-evidence-of-neolithic-cannibalism/">recently reported</a> on an analysis of human remains from 11 individuals recovered from El Mirador Cave in Spain, showing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10266-w">evidence of cannibalism</a>—likely the result of a violent episode between competing Late Neolithic herding communities about 5,700 years ago. Microscopy analysis revealed telltale slice marks, scrape marks, and chop marks, as well as evidence of cremation, peeling, fractures, and human tooth marks.</p>
<p>This indicates the victims were skinned, the flesh removed, the bodies disarticulated, and then cooked and eaten. Isotope analysis indicated the individuals were local and were probably eaten over the course of just a few days. There have been similar Neolithic massacres in Germany and Spain, but the El Mirador remains provide evidence of a rare systematic consumption of victims.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/neolithic-people-took-gruesome-trophies-from-invading-tribes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> will be <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/11xf7azcuebhybgossfhdc0mphiqbs-en88t-53h3w">released on September 4</a>. It will come out simultaneously on Windows, macOS, Linux, Xbox, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, the Nintendo Switch, and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>On paper, "game gets release date" isn't particularly groundbreaking news, and the six-year wait between the game's announcement and release is long but nowhere near record-breaking. People have waited longer for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> (announced 2017, releasing this fall), <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> (announced 1997, released 2011), the fourth <em>BioShock </em>game (in development for a decade at a studio that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development">just got ravaged by layoffs</a>), and <em>Half-Life 3 </em>(never actually announced, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/">hope springs eternal</a>), just to name a few.</p>
<p>But fans of 2017's <em>Hollow Knight</em> managed to make the wait for <em>Silksong</em> into a meme. It's hard to explain <em>why</em> if you haven't already been following along, but it's probably got something to do with the expected scale of the game, the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>'s popularity, and the almost total silence of the small staff at Team Cherry, the game's developer.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/explaining-the-internets-obsession-with-silksong-which-finally-comes-out-sept-4/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Starlink operator SpaceX isn't getting the broadband money it demanded from state governments despite the Trump administration rewriting the rules of a $42 billion grant program. Instead of directing the lion's share of money to Elon Musk's space and satellite company, early results indicate that states still plan to deploy fiber broadband networks to most of their unserved households.</p>
<p>When the Trump administration <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/">announced its overhaul</a> of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program in March, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/commerce-to-overhaul-internet-for-all-plan-expanding-starlink-funding-prospects-74664efc">estimates published</a> by The Wall Street Journal suggested that SpaceX could receive $10 billion to $20 billion under the new rules. Musk clearly expected a big windfall; as we've written, SpaceX alleges that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-tries-to-block-virginias-plan-to-bring-fiber-internet-to-residents/">Virginia</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-keeps-trying-to-block-fiber-deployment-says-us-must-nix-louisiana-plan/">Louisiana</a> violated the Trump administration's rules by allocating most of the money to fiber providers instead of Starlink's satellite service.</p>
<p>Assuming Virginia and Louisiana don't back down, SpaceX has indicated it will ask the Trump administration to reject their grant proposals. SpaceX might end up filing similar objections in many other states after more of them reveal their plans. A third state, West Virginia, <a href="https://broadband.wv.gov/news/west-virginia-bead-final-proposal-available-for-public-comment/">revealed its plan</a> on Tuesday, and SpaceX isn't likely to be happy with it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-wants-billions-in-grants-but-state-governments-arent-cooperating/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Monterey Car Week is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/monterey-car-week/">an annual celebration of automotive culture at the extremes</a>: extreme performance, extreme rarity, and extreme value. Cars offering more than 1,000 hp (746 kW) are de rigueur, "unique" models are everywhere you look, and machines costing well into seven figures are entry-level.</p>
<p>A few years ago, many of the new cars debuting during Car Week focused on outright speed and performance above all else, relying on electric powertrains to deliver physics-defying acceleration and ballistic speed. Lately, there's been a shift back toward the fundamentals of driver engagement, emotional design, and purity of feel.</p>
<p>Internal combustion is again at the fore. One of the main reasons is a renewed interest in what was old—so long as that old thing is actually new.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/at-the-top-of-the-market-ev-hypercars-are-a-disappearing-breed/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fsunion.org.au/Hub/Content/News_and_publications/Member_updates/2025/WIN-CBA-backflips-on-customer-service-job-cuts.aspx">statement</a> Thursday flagged <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-21/commonwealth-bank-reverses-job-cuts-decision-over-ai-chatbots">by Bloomberg</a>, Australia's main financial services union, the Finance Sector Union (FSU), claimed a "massive win" for 45 union members whom the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) had replaced with an AI-powered "voice bot."</p>
<p>The FSU noted that some of these workers had been with CBA for decades. Those workers in particular were shocked when CBA announced last month that their jobs had become redundant. At that time, CBA claimed that launching the chatbot supposedly "led to a reduction in call volumes" by 2,000 a week, FSU said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/bank-forced-to-rehire-workers-after-lying-about-chatbot-productivity-union-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p><strong>STARBASE, Texas</strong>—I first visited SpaceX's launch site in South Texas a decade ago. Driving down the pocked and barren two-lane road to its sandy terminus, I found only rolling dunes, a large mound of dirt, and a few satellite dishes that talked to Dragon spacecraft as they flew overhead.</p>
<p>A few years later, in mid-2019, the company had moved some of that dirt and built a small launch pad. A handful of SpaceX engineers working there at the time shared some office space nearby in a tech hub building, "Stargate." <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley <a href="https://www.utrgv.edu/umc/news/building-our-future/stargate/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proudly opened</a> this state-of-the-art technology center </span>just weeks earlier. That summer, from Stargate's second floor, engineers looked on as the Starhopper prototype made its first two flights a couple of miles away.</p>
<p>Over the ensuing years, as the company began assembling its Starship rockets on site, SpaceX first erected small tents, then much larger tents, and then towering high bays in which the vehicles were stacked. Starbase grew and evolved to meet the company's needs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacex-has-built-the-machine-to-build-the-machine-but-what-about-the-machine/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Advanced driver assistance systems—also known as ADAS—come in a few variations. Blind spot monitoring, collision warnings, and emergency braking act like a second pair of eyes and ears, monitoring the car's environment to warn the driver, or possibly intervene, if a crash looks imminent. Other systems are better thought of as convenience features—things like adaptive cruise control and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/partial-automated-driving-systems-dont-make-driving-safer-study-finds/">lane keeping</a>, which relieve some of the burden of driving.</p>
<p>Among the newer of these is the traffic jam assist. It's a variant of adaptive cruise plus lane keeping designed for low-speed stop-start driving on limited-access highways, usually cutting out around 40 mph. But we're still talking about a so-called "level 2" system, where the human driver is responsible for maintaining situational awareness; even more advanced "level 3" assists exist—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/mercedes-benzs-level-3-autonomous-driving-system-takes-over-in-heavy-traffic/">these allow the driver to completely disengage from the task</a>—but are not the topic for today.</p>
<p>AAA recently put five (unnamed) ADAS systems to the test in the Los Angeles area, blessed as it is with dependable heavy freeway traffic. The testers went out together in morning and afternoon weekday traffic, covering the same routes simultaneously. The vehicles were driven an average of 342 miles (550 km) over 16.2 hours, with the ADAS operated according to each vehicle's user manual. And the cars were instrumented with cameras and GPS to record traffic conditions, behavior, and so on.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/humans-intervened-every-9-minutes-in-aaa-test-of-driver-assists/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When Hurricane Helene ravaged western North Carolina in September 2024, one of its many victims was a manufacturing plant that made intravenous fluids. The sterile IV solutions produced in the plant are essential supplies for hospitals and other medical facilities, which use them in various treatments, from rehydration to drug delivery and kidney dialysis. And the plant damaged by Helene—Baxter International's North Cove manufacturing facility in Marion—didn't just make <em>some</em> of the US supply; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/helene-ravaged-the-nc-plant-that-makes-60-of-the-countrys-iv-fluid-supply/">it made 60 percent</a>.</p>
<p>With the Baxter plant down, hospitals around the country began <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/as-hospitals-struggle-with-iv-fluid-shortage-nc-plant-restarts-production/">rationing supplies</a>. They changed treatment strategies and, in some cases, canceled or delayed surgeries. In one poll, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/over-86-of-surveyed-health-care-providers-are-short-on-iv-fluids/">over 86 percent</a> of health care providers said they were affected by the nationwide shortage. The federal government, for its part, loosened importation rules and granted extensions to expiration dates to offer some relief from the dire shortage.</p>
<p>This secondary emergency was yet another reminder of just how fragile the US drug supply chain has become. Just months before the catastrophic hurricane in North Carolina, drug shortages in the US reached an all-time high, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/us-drug-shortages-reach-record-high-with-323-meds-now-in-short-supply/">323 active and ongoing shortages</a>. Although they've fallen since then, they remain high, with shortages in the first quarter of this year at <a href="https://www.ashp.org/drug-shortages/shortage-resources/drug-shortages-statistics?loginreturnUrl=SSOCheckOnly">253</a>, according to data collected by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/most-us-drug-facilities-are-in-areas-hit-by-natural-disasters-risking-shortages/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At first glance, Nam-Joon Cho’s lab at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University looks like your typical research facility—scientists toiling away, crowded workbenches, a hum of machinery in the background. But the orange-yellow stains on the lab coats slung on hooks hint at a less-usual subject matter under study.</p>
<p>The powdery stain is pollen: microscopic grains containing male reproductive cells that trees, weeds, and grasses release seasonally. But Cho isn’t studying irksome effects like hay fever, or what pollen means for the plants that make it. Instead, the material scientist has spent a decade pioneering and refining techniques to remodel pollen’s rigid outer shell—made of a polymer so tough it’s sometimes called <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-diamond-of-the-plant-world-helped-land-plants-evolve-20220719/">“the diamond of the plant world”</a>—transforming the grains to a jam-like consistency.</p>
<p>This microgel, Cho believes, could be a versatile building block for many eco-friendly materials, including paper, film, and sponges.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/using-pollen-to-make-paper-sponges-and-more/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>After the Trump administration confirmed a rumor that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/us-may-purchase-stake-in-intel-after-trump-attacked-ceo/">US is planning to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel</a>, US Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came forward Wednesday to voice support for the highly unusual plan, finding rare common ground with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the plan would see the US disbursing approved CHIPS Act grants only after acquiring non-voting shares of Intel and likely other chipmakers. That would allow the US to profit off its investment in chipmakers, Lutnick suggested, and Sanders <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-sanders-favors-trump-plan-take-stake-intel-others-2025-08-20/">told Reuters</a> that he agreed American taxpayers could benefit from the potential deals.</p>
<p>"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment," Sanders said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/bernie-sanders-backs-trumps-plan-to-buy-stake-in-intel/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When updating a piece of software as large and complex and old as Windows, you're inevitably going to break something every once in a while. Microsoft tracks known issues <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-23h2#3640msgdesc">here</a>—generally they affect lesser-used features or obscure edge cases, but every once in a while you run into something bigger and more disruptive.</p>
<p>August's updates have introduced a couple of more noticeable problems. The first was caused by <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-12-2025-kb5063875-os-builds-22621-5768-and-22631-5768-c67aac47-127c-4bd1-b92d-ebd9093f031d">update KB5063875</a>, a relatively minor security update for older versions of Windows 10 and 11. This update broke Windows' built-in reset and recovery features, used to restore a Windows installation to its factory defaults if you're experiencing a problem or are planning on handing down or otherwise getting rid of your PC. After installing the update, users of Windows 11 23H2 and 22H2 and Windows 10 22H2 who tried to reset their PCs would see the process silently fail with no explanation.</p>
<p>Microsoft quickly resolved this one with update KB5066189—the issue was opened on August 18 and marked as resolved on August 19—so if you're still having issues, check for the update that will fix your update.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/having-recovery-and-or-ssd-problems-after-recent-windows-updates-youre-not-alone/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you were to design the strangest diet possible, eating nothing but ants and termites would probably make the shortlist. Yet over the past 66 million years, mammals across the globe have repeatedly gone down this path—not once or twice, but at least a dozen times. From anteaters and aardvarks to pangolins and aardwolves, the so-called myrmecophages (animals that feed on ants and termites) have evolved similar traits: they’ve lost most or all of their teeth, grown long sticky tongues, and learned to consume insects by the tens to hundreds of thousands each day.</p>
<p>A new study reveals that this extreme dietary specialization, once thought rare and mysterious, has emerged independently in mammals at least 12 times in the last 66 million years (i.e., since the Cenozoic era began). This is a striking <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/01/red-and-giant-pandas-share-similarities-at-the-gene-level-too/">example of convergent evolution</a> and shows just how powerful ants and termites have been in shaping mammalian history.</p>
<p>“The number of distinct origins for myrmecophagy was certainly surprising, as was the discovery that their origins seem to quite neatly follow the trend of growth across ant and termite colony sizes throughout the Cenozoic,” Thomas Vida, first author of the study and a researcher at the University of Bonn, told Ars Technica.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/mammals-that-chose-ants-and-termites-as-food-almost-never-go-back/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>US defense officials have long worried that China's Guowang satellite network might give the Chinese military access to the kind of ubiquitous connectivity US forces now enjoy with SpaceX's Starlink network.</p>
<p>It turns out the Guowang constellation could offer a lot more than a homemade Chinese alternative to Starlink's high-speed consumer-grade broadband service. China has disclosed little information about the Guowang network, but there's mounting evidence that the satellites may provide Chinese military forces a tactical edge in any future armed conflict in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>The megaconstellation is managed by a secretive company called China SatNet, which was established by the Chinese government in 2021. SatNet has released little information since its formation, and the group doesn't have a website. Chinese officials have not detailed any of the satellites' capabilities or signaled any intention to market the services to consumers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/china-may-have-taken-an-early-lead-in-the-race-for-a-military-megaconstellation/">Read full article</a></p>

Pricing for all current versions of the PlayStation 5 console will increase by $50 starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>The price of the PS5 Digital Edition will increase from $450 to $500; the standard PS5 will increase from $500 to $550; and the PS5 Pro will increase from $700 to $750. If you've been on the fence about buying any of these, retailers like Target and Best Buy are still using the old prices as of this writing—for other console price hikes, retailers have sometimes bumped the prices up before the date announced by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>"Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment," wrote Sony Global Marketing VP Isabelle Tomatis. "As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/sony-joins-xbox-and-nintendo-in-hiking-playstation-5-prices-in-the-us/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has shifted its product timeline in 2025. Android 16 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/android-16-begins-rolling-out-today-to-pixel-devices.1507822/">dropped in May</a>, an earlier release aimed at better lining up with smartphone launches. Google's annual hardware refresh is also happening a bit ahead of the traditional October window. The company has unveiled its thoroughly leaked 2025 Pixel phones and watches, and you can preorder most of them today.</p>
<p>The new Pixel 10 phones don't look much different from last year, but there's an assortment of notable internal changes, and you might not like all of them. They have a new, more powerful Tensor chip (good), a lot more AI features (debatable), and no SIM card slot (bad). But at least the new Pixel Watch 4 won't become e-waste if you break it.</p>
<h2>Same on the outside, new on the inside</h2>
<p>If you liked Google's big Pixel redesign last year, there's good news: Nothing has changed in 2025. The Pixel 10 series looks the same, right down to the almost identical physical dimensions.
