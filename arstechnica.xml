                            <![CDATA[<p>"Crypto mixers" exist because of a peculiar feature of cryptocurrencies—most are fully traceable using their public blockchain ledgers. To provide more privacy to crypto account owners, a mixer will let people toss their crypto into a large pool, where it is "mixed" with other people's crypto. At a later date, each crypto owner can choose to withdraw their money from the pool into a new, anonymous wallet, thus making the movement of the crypto harder to track.</p>
<p>Of course, the obfuscation doesn't work well if the blockchain shows 1,231.7 BTC entering a mixer and 1,231.7 BTC being withdrawn to a new wallet. So mixers will take steps to disguise the transactions. Tornado Cash, which operated on the Ethereum blockchain, mandated that users could only deposit money into its pools in 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ETH increments, making it far harder to spot specific amounts entering and leaving the mixer.</p>
<p>Tornado Cash also used a complex system of "relayers" to pay the Ethereum "gas fees" charged for transactions on the network; without doing this, it would be clear which old account was paying to "mix" money into which new account. The whole process relied on the use of irrevocable "smart contracts," all of which sounds rather technically daunting, but Tornado put a nice user interface atop the details that made the service far easier to use than it might sound.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/tornado-cash-sold-crypto-privacy-the-us-saw-money-laundering-a-jury-isnt-sure-what-to-think/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The deal was announced just one day after the US General Services Administration (GSA) signed a blanket deal to allow OpenAI and rivals like Google and Anthropic to supply tools to federal workers.</p>
<p>The workers will have access to ChatGPT Enterprise, a type of account that includes access to frontier models and cutting-edge features with relatively high token limits, alongside a more robust commitment to data privacy than general consumers of ChatGPT get. ChatGPT Enterprise has been trialed over the past several months at several corporations and other types of large organizations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-announces-deal-to-offer-chatgpt-to-us-executive-branch-at-almost-no-cost/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Bob Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company, announced today that Disney will "fully integrate" Hulu into the Disney+ app in 2026. Although a company representative told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/">Variety</a> that people will still be able to buy standalone subscriptions to Hulu, we can't help but wonder how long that will last.</p>
<p>A prim and polished app combining the catalogs, recommendations, and profiles for Disney+ and Hulu subscribers could make a standalone Hulu app redundant. In fact, the ability to successfully combine those two streaming services into one platform could, depending on how executives look at it, make the entire Hulu business redundant.</p>
<p>Some are reporting that Iger means that the Hulu app will be <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/">phased out next year</a>, while others are saying that the death of the Hulu app is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-hulu-app-may-not-be-long-for-this-world-2000639568">likely but not yet guaranteed</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/hulus-days-look-numbered-but-theres-reason-for-disney-to-keep-it-around/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Library of Congress today said a coding error resulted in the deletion of parts of the US Constitution from Congress' website and promised a fix after many Internet users pointed out the missing sections this morning.</p>
<p>"It has been brought to our attention that some sections of Article 1 are missing from the Constitution Annotated (<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/">constitution.congress.gov</a>) website," the Library of Congress <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/librarycongress.bsky.social/post/3lvqilhwb6k2x">said today</a>. "We've learned that this is due to a coding error. We have been working to correct this and expect it to be resolved soon."</p>
<p>The missing portions of the Constitution were restored to <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/">one part of the website</a> a few hours after the Library of Congress statement and reappeared on a <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/">different part of the website</a> another hour or so later. The Constitution Annotated website carried a notice saying it "is currently experiencing data issues. We are working to resolve this issue and regret the inconvenience."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/coding-error-blamed-after-parts-of-constitution-disappear-from-us-website/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google has often bristled at the implication that its obsession with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/zero-click-searches-googles-ai-tools-are-the-culmination-of-its-hubris/">AI search is harming web traffic</a>, and now search head Liz Reid has penned a <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-search-driving-more-queries-higher-quality-clicks/">blog post</a> on the topic. According to Reid, clicks aren't declining, AI is driving more searches, and everything is fine on the Internet. But despite the optimistic tone, the post stops short of providing any actual data to back up those claims.</p>
<p>This statement feels like a direct response to a recent Pew Research Center analysis that showed searches with AI Overviews resulted in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/research-shows-google-ai-overviews-reduce-website-clicks-by-almost-half/">lower click-through rates</a>. Google objected to the conclusions and methodology of that study, and the new blog post expands on its rationale.</p>
<p>The banner claim in this post is that Google is not sending fewer clicks to websites. According to Reid, "total organic click volume" has remained "relatively stable year-over-year." Meanwhile, Google is seeing more searches on its end, which is the most important metric for the company. Google's blog also notes (fairly) that the web is unfathomably vast, and it's common for trends to shift.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/08/google-search-boss-says-ai-isnt-killing-search-clicks/">Read full article</a></p>

      Snowball the dancing cockatoo gets down with his bad self to the Backstreet Boys.

          </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>In 2008, a YouTube video featuring an Eleanora <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatoo">cockatoo</a> named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_(cockatoo)">Snowball</a> dancing to the beat of the Backstreet Boys went viral. His killer moves stunned scientists, since the ability to synchronize body movements to music was believed to be a uniquely human activity. Nor is Snowball an isolated case. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@griffithedancingcockatoo">Griffi the Dancing Cockatoo</a> has his own YouTube channel, for example, and a recent <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bellatrixiecorbin/video/7511969034510929183">TikTok video</a> showed two sister cockatoos engaging in a dance-off to Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's "September." But it's Snowball who <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/587385-most-dance-moves-by-a-bird">holds the Guinness World Record</a> for most dance moves performed by a bird.</p>
<p>Snowball's record might be in jeopardy, however. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328487">new paper</a> published in the journal PLoS ONE investigated dancing behavior in several parrot species and identified 30 distinct dance moves that the birds executed—17 of which had never been observed scientifically before and were performed by just one bird. So dancing in cockatoos and other parrot species seems to be much more complex and varied than previously thought. It's still unclear why parrots in captivity love to dance so much, but encouraging such behavior could help birds like these thrive in an environment they often find challenging.</p>
<p>Researchers at Charles Sturt University (CSU) in Australia scoured YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok for video footage of dancing birds, particularly cockatoos. For videos to be selected for inclusion in the study, they had to meet several criteria: They had to show a cockatoo in a domestic setting where music was being played at the same time the bird was dancing (videos where music had been added to the footage were omitted); the bird must demonstrate at least two different dance moves; and the camera angle had to provide a good view of the dancing bird. And each video had to feature a different bird.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/cockatoos-know-30-distinct-dance-moves/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Generative AI systems have proliferated across the technology industry over the last several years to such a degree that it can be hard to avoid using them. Google and other big names in AI spend a lot of time talking about AI safety, but the ever-evolving capabilities of AI have also led to a changing landscape of malware threats—or as researchers from Tel Aviv University would say, "promptware." Using simple calendar appointments, this team managed to trick Gemini into manipulating Google smart home devices, which may be the first example of an AI attack having real-world effects.</p>
<p>Gemini has the barest of agentic capabilities by virtue of its connection to the wider Google app ecosystem. It can access your calendar, call on Assistant smart home devices, send messages, and more. That makes it an appealing target for malicious actors looking to cause havoc or steal data. The researchers used Gemini's web of connectivity to perform what's known as an indirect <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/researchers-claim-breakthrough-in-fight-against-ais-frustrating-security-hole/">prompt injection attack</a>, in which malicious actions are given to an AI bot by someone other than the user. And it worked startlingly well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/invitation-is-all-you-need">promptware attack</a> begins with a calendar appointment containing a description that is actually a set of malicious instructions. The hack happens when the user asks Gemini to summarize their schedule, causing the robot to process the poisoned calendar event. Here's an example of one of those prompts.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/08/researchers-use-calendar-events-to-hack-gemini-control-smart-home-gadgets/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An ill wind blows through the automotive industry. Yesterday, after the market closed, Rivian reported its results for the second quarter of 2025, and they weren't great. Unlike the last two quarters, Rivian did not make a gross profit, and it's estimating it will have a larger loss this year than it first predicted. A day earlier, it was Lucid's turn: The Saudi-backed EV startup also missed analyst estimates for the quarter, and Lucid says it will build fewer cars this year than originally planned.</p>
<p>"We delivered solid performance despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, thanks to the adaptability and focus of our team in navigating a dynamic environment," said Taoufiq Boussaid in an elegant bit of business-speak that elides the true horror of the situation.</p>
<p>In both cases, the reasons for these underwhelming performances were the same: US government policies. Since taking office in January, President Trump and the Republican Party have been hard at work tearing up environmental regulations and overturning policies meant to encourage EV adoption, as well as fomenting a global trade war through the imposition of irrational and costly tariffs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/trumps-trade-and-environment-policies-are-a-disaster-for-car-makers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Biology is an area of science where AI and machine-learning approaches have seen some spectacular successes, such as designing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/">enzymes to digest plastics</a> and proteins to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/researchers-use-ai-to-design-proteins-that-block-snake-venom-toxins/">block snake venom</a>. But in an era of seemingly endless AI hype, it might be easy to think that we could just set AI loose on the mounds of data we've already generated and end up with a good understanding of most areas of biology, allowing us to skip a lot of messy experiments and the unpleasantness of research on animals.</p>
<p>But biology involves a whole lot more than just protein structures. And it's extremely premature to suggest that AI can be equally effective at handling all aspects of biology. So we were intrigued to see a study comparing a set of AI software packages designed to predict how active genes will be in cells exposed to different conditions. As it turns out, the AI systems couldn't manage to do any better than a deliberately simplified method of predicting.</p>
<p>The results serve as a useful caution that biology is incredibly complex, and developing AI systems that work for one aspect of it is not an indication that they can work for biology generally.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/some-ai-tools-dont-understand-biology-yet/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), who earlier this year introduced and championed an effort to <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-080625a-nasa-decision-space-shuttle-move-houston.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocate the space shuttle Discovery</a> from the Smithsonian to Space Center Houston, issued a statement on Tuesday evening (August 5) applauding the decision by acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy.</p>
<p>"There is no better place for one of NASA's space shuttles to be displayed than Space City," said Cornyn in the statement. "Since the inception of our nation's human space exploration program, Houston has been at the center of our most historic achievements, from training the best and brightest to voyage into the great unknown to putting the first man on the moon."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/houston-youve-got-a-space-shuttle-only-nasa-wont-say-which-one/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In a small randomized controlled trial, people lost twice as much weight when their diet was limited to minimally processed food compared to when they switched to a diet that included ultraprocessed versions of foods but was otherwise nutritionally matched.</p>
<p>The trial, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0">published in Nature Medicine</a> by researchers at University College London, adds to a growing body of evidence that food processing, in addition to simple nutrition content, influences our weight and health. Ultraprocessed foods have already been vilified for their link to obesity—largely through weaker observational studies—but researchers have struggled to shore up the connection with high-quality studies and understand their impact on health.</p>
<p>The ultraprocessed foods researchers provided in the new trial were relatively healthy ones—as ultraprocessed foods go. They included things like multigrain breakfast cereal, packaged granola bars, flavored yogurt cups, fruit snacks, commercially premade chicken sandwiches, instant noodles, and ready-made lasagna. But, in the minimally processed trial diet, participants received meals from a caterer rather than ones from a grocery store aisle. The diet included overnight oats with fresh fruit, plain yogurt with toasted oats and fruit, handmade fruit and nut bars, freshly made chicken salad, and from-scratch stir fry and spaghetti Bolognese.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/in-trial-people-lost-twice-as-much-weight-by-ditching-ultraprocessed-food/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple released a new developer beta build of macOS 26 Tahoe today, and it came with another big update for a familiar icon. The old Macintosh HD hard drive icon, for years represented by a facsimile of an old spinning hard drive, has been replaced with something clearly intended to resemble a solid-state drive (the SSD in your Mac <em>actually</em> looks like a handful of chips soldered to a circuit board, but we'll forgive the creative license).</p>
<p>The Macintosh HD icon became less visible a few years back, when new macOS installs stopped showing your internal disk on the desktop by default. It has also been many years since Apple shifted to SSDs as the primary boot media for new Macs. It's not clear why the icon is being replaced now, instead of years ago—maybe the icon had started <a href="https://www.securedatarecovery.com/blog/hard-drive-clicking">clicking</a>, and Apple just wanted to replace it before it suffered from catastrophic icon failure—but regardless, the switch is logical (this is a computer storage pun).</p>
<h2>An iconic life</h2>
<p>The original hard drive icon dates back to 2000, when Apple introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2000/01/macos-x-gui/">the new look and feel of Mac OS X</a> to the public through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/09/macos-x-beta/">the third of four public developer betas</a> (scroll down far enough in our original coverage, and you can spot the hard drive icon in some of the screenshots).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/rip-to-the-macintosh-hd-hard-drive-icon-2000-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration is telling states they will be shut out of a $42 billion broadband deployment fund if they set the rates that Internet service providers receiving subsidies are allowed to charge people with low incomes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/BEAD_FAQs_v13.pdf">latest version</a> of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) FAQ on the grant program, released today, is a challenge to states considering laws that would force Internet providers to offer cheap plans to people who meet income eligibility guidelines. One state already has such a law: New York requires ISPs with over 20,000 customers in the state to offer $15 broadband plans with download speeds of at least 25Mbps, or $20-per-month service with 200Mbps speeds.</p>
<p>Other states have been considering similar laws and were initially emboldened by New York winning a yearslong court battle against ISPs that tried to invalidate the state law. But states may now be dissuaded by the Trump administration's stance against price mandates being applied to the grant program.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/trump-admin-warns-states-dont-try-to-lower-broadband-prices/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>His company used "intimidation tactics" to sidestep regulatory scrutiny, it was a "toxic" workplace, and its safety culture was "critically flawed." The <em>Titan</em> itself was "undocumented, unregistered, non-certificated, [and] unclassed." As for Rush, he managed to "completely ignore vital inspections, data analyses, and preventative maintenance procedures." The result was a "catastrophic event" that occurred when 4,930 pounds per square inch of water pressure cracked the sub open and crushed its five occupants during a dive to the <em>Titanic</em> wreckage site.</p>
<p>Had Rush somehow survived, the report says, he would have been referred for prosecution.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/titan-sub-implosion-caused-by-absolutely-bonkers-toxic-workplace-environment/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/epa-plans-to-ignore-science-stop-regulating-greenhouse-gases/">made lots of headlines</a> by rejecting the document that establishes its ability to regulate the greenhouse gases that are warming our climate. While the legal assault on regulations grabbed most of the attention, it was paired with two other actions that targeted other aspects of climate change: the science underlying our current understanding of the dramatic warming the Earth is experiencing, and the renewable energy that represents our best chance of limiting this warming.</p>
<p>Collectively, these actions illuminate the administration's strategy for dealing with a problem that it would prefer to believe doesn't exist, despite our extensive documentation of its reality. They also show how the administration is tailoring its approach to different audiences, including the audience of one who is demanding inaction.</p>
<h2>When in doubt, make something up</h2>
<p>The simplest thing to understand is an action by the Department of the Interior, which handles permitting for energy projects on federal land—including wind and solar, both onshore and off. That has placed the Interior in an awkward position. Wind and solar are now generally the cheapest ways to generate electricity and are currently in the process of a spectacular boom, with solar now accounting for over 80 percent of the newly installed capacity in the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/analysis-the-trump-administrations-assault-on-climate-action/">Read full article</a></p>
