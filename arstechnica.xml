                            <![CDATA[<p>A long time ago, in (I believe) an issue of Car Magazine from the mid-1990s, the designer Gordon Murray shared his thoughts about a possible four-door follow-up to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/these-mclaren-f1s-and-bugatti-eb110s-were-the-stars-of-car-week/">McLaren F1</a>.</p>
<p>Road cars weren't really his thing. Until then, his career had been focused on Formula 1 car design, and he brought that sport's obsession with weight savings with him. Were he to design a sedan, he'd trim the interior with textile, not leather. After all, wool made fine suits and coats, Murray reasoned, and it would save weight.</p>
<p>A four-door McLaren never happened during his tenure, nor has one appeared since. Murray now runs his own boutique <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/08/gordon-murray-says-the-his-new-supercar-is-the-most-driver-centric-ever/">hypercar</a> company, which also builds no sedans. But the idea that high-end cars could use something other than leather has stuck with me, especially after driving BMW's i7, which  debuted in 2022 with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/testing-bmws-biggest-and-best-sedan-now-fully-electric-the-2023-i7/">a premium cashmere wool interior</a>. More recently, new EVs have experimented with interesting textile alternatives to leather. Two good examples are the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/how-bmw-slashed-the-carbon-footprint-of-its-next-ev-the-2026-ix3/">BMW iX3</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/audis-next-ev-is-the-a6-e-tron-sportback-but-no-station-wagon-for-the-us/">Audi A6</a>, though neither can be ordered with these textile options in the US.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/02/america-its-time-to-think-beyond-leather-for-luxury-car-seats/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Food and Drug Administration has refused to review Moderna's application for an mRNA flu vaccine, the company revealed Tuesday.</p>
<p>While the move came as a surprise to the high-profile vaccine maker, it is just the latest hostility toward vaccines—and mRNA vaccines in particular—from an agency overseen by the fervent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his first year in office, Kennedy has already <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/under-anti-vaccine-rfk-jr-cdc-slashes-childhood-vaccine-schedule/">dramatically slashed childhood vaccine recommendations</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/rfk-jr-defends-500m-cut-for-mrna-vaccines-with-pseudoscience-gobbledygook/">canceled $500 million</a> in research funding for mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic threats.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=7346090610333866&amp;symbol=MRNA">a news release late Tuesday</a>, Moderna said it was blindsided by the FDA's refusal, which the FDA cited as being due to the design of the company's Phase 3 trial for its mRNA flu vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1010. Specifically, the FDA's rejection was over the comparator vaccine Moderna used.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-refuses-to-review-modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX's next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company's previous booster.</p>
<p>SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: "Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster's redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength."</p>
<p>Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey's Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster's propellant tanks on launch day.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/spacexs-starbase-is-coming-alive-again-after-a-lull-in-starship-testing/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Archive.is_RFC_5">request for comment page</a>, Wikipedia's volunteer editors were presented with three options. Option A is to remove or hide all Archive.today links and add the site to the spam blacklist. Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-might-blacklist-archive-today-after-site-maintainer-ddosed-a-blog/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Yuhu_ai_">a post on social media</a>, Wu expressed warm feelings for his time at xAI, but said it was "time for my next chapter." The current era is one where "a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what's possible," he wrote.</p>
<p>The mention of what "a small team" can do could hint at a potential reason for Wu's departure. xAI <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-org-chart-employees-elon-musk-direct-reports-2025-3">reportedly had 1,200 employees as of March 2025</a>, a number that included AI engineers and those focused more on the X social network.

                            <![CDATA[<p>The National Cancer Institute is using federal funds to study whether cancer can be cured by ivermectin, a cheap, off-patent anti-parasitic and deworming drug that fringe medical groups falsely claimed could treat COVID-19 during the pandemic and have since touted as a cure-all.</p>
<p>Large, high-quality clinical trials have resoundingly concluded that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/largest-trial-to-date-finds-ivermectin-is-worthless-against-covid/">ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19</a>. And there is no old or new scientific evidence to support a hypothesis that ivermectin can cure cancer—or justify any such federal expenditure. But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who is otherwise well-known for claiming to have a parasitic worm in his brain—numerous members of the medical fringe are now in powerful federal positions or otherwise hold sway with the administration.</p>
<p>During a January 30 event, Anthony Letai, a cancer researcher the Trump administration installed as the director of the NCI in September, said the NCI was pursuing ivermectin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/dewormer-ivermectin-as-cancer-cure-rfk-jr-s-nih-funds-absurd-study/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Windows 8 is remembered most for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/too-much-and-too-soon-steven-sinofsky-looks-back-at-windows-8-10-years-later/">its oddball touchscreen-focused full-screen Start menu</a>, but it also introduced a number of under-the-hood enhancements to Windows. One of those was UEFI Secure Boot, a mechanism for verifying PC bootloaders to ensure that unverified software can't be loaded at startup. Secure Boot was enabled but technically optional for Windows 8 and Windows 10, but it became a formal system requirement for installing Windows <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-and-secure-boot-a8ff1202-c0d9-42f5-940f-843abef64fad">starting with Windows 11 in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Secure Boot has relied on the same security certificates to verify bootloaders since 2011, during the development cycle for Windows 8. But those original certificates are set to expire in June and October of this year, something Microsoft is highlighting in a <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=180181">post</a> today.</p>
<p>This certificate expiration date isn't news—Microsoft and most major PC makers have been <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/windows-devices-for-home-users-businesses-and-schools-with-microsoft-managed-updates-29bfd847-5855-49f1-bb94-e18497fe2315">talking about it</a> for months or years, and behind-the-scenes work to get the Windows ecosystem ready has been happening for some time. And renewing security certificates is a routine occurrence that most users only notice <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/expired-certificate-completely-breaks-macos-logitech-apps-user-customizations/">when something goes wrong</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/microsoft-sounds-the-alarm-about-secure-boot-certificates-expiring-later-this-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Do you feel popular? There are people on the Internet who want to know all about you! Unfortunately, they don't have the best of intentions, but Google has some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-makes-it-easier-to-remove-your-personal-data-from-search/">handy tools to address that</a>, and they've gotten an upgrade today. The "Results About You" tool can now detect and remove more of your personal information. Plus, the tool for removing non-consensual explicit imagery (NCEI) is faster to use. All you have to do is tell Google your personal details first—that seems safe, right?</p>
<p>With <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/results-about-you-government-id-numbers">today's upgrade</a>, Results About You gains the ability to find and remove pages that include ID numbers like your passport, driver's license, and Social Security. You can access the option to add these to Google's ongoing scans from the settings in <a href="https://goo.gle/resultsaboutyou">Results About You</a>. Just click in the ID numbers section to enable detection.</p>
<p>Naturally, Google has to know what it's looking for to remove it. So you need to provide at least part of those numbers. Google asks for the full driver's license number, which is fine, as it's not as sensitive. For your passport and SSN, you only need the last four digits, which is enough for Google to find the full numbers on webpages.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/upgraded-google-safety-tools-can-now-find-and-remove-more-of-your-personal-info/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Vans are something most of us don’t think about much, since we rarely interact with them directly in our day-to-day lives. But the van is an unseen hero that keeps the world moving, delivering packages all over the country and transporting food from farm to stores. They haven't changed much in decades, though. A van is generally a big box with a gas or diesel engine (depending on where you are in the world), and that’s… kinda it, bar a dent or two in the bodywork. Kia's engineers, riding high on the success of their recent electric vehicles, took notice and did some new things with the PV5, the company's first electric van.</p>
<p>You can spec your PV5 in a number of configurations, and the company already has conversion partners lined up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/kia-reimagines-the-off-road-camper-van-with-new-concept-ev/">turn them into just about anything</a>. Of course, camper converters are eyeing them as well, eager to create electric "vanlife" setups. Off the shelf, you can choose between a PV5 Passenger for moving people, a PV5 Cargo for moving things, a PV5 Crew for moving things <em>and</em> people, and a PV5 Chassis Cab to do with as you please.</p>
<p>Beneath its modular cabin is the Electric Global Modular For Service, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/kias-ev-strategy-smaller-cheaper-cars-like-ev3-hatch-and-ev4-sedan/">which is part of Kia’s rather fancy-sounding "PBV" strategy</a>. "PBV" means "Platform Beyond Vehicle," a potential hint at where the brand sees itself going. In this case, it can house a range of battery sizes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/the-kia-pv5-electric-van-combines-futuristic-looks-and-thoughtful-design/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[Meant to help judges handle scientific issues, document is now climate-free.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Friday, a body that advises US judges revised the document it created to help judges grapple with scientific issues. The move came after a group of Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to complain about the document's chapter on climate change, with one of the letter's criticisms being that it treated human influence on climate as a fact. In response to the letter, the Federal Judicial Center has now deleted the entire chapter.</p>
<p>The Federal Judicial Center has been <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/about">established by statute</a> as the "research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government." As part of that role, it prepares documents that can serve as reference material for judges unfamiliar with topics that find their way into the courtroom. Among those projects is the "<a href="https://www.fjc.gov/content/396456/reference-manual-scientific-evidence-fourth-edition">Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence</a>," now in its fourth edition. Prepared in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, the document covers the process of science and specific topics that regularly appear before the courts, like statistical techniques, DNA-based identification, and chemical exposures.</p>
<p>When initially released in December, the fourth edition included material on climate change prepared by two authors at Columbia University. But a group of attorneys general from Republican-leaning states objected to this content. At the end of January, they <a href="https://ago.wv.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/2026.01.29%20--%20AG%20Climate%20Science%20Manual%20Letter.pdf">sent a letter</a> to the leadership of the Federal Judicial Center outlining their issues. Many of them focus on the text that accepts the reality of human-driven climate change as a fact.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/us-court-agency-pulls-climate-change-from-science-advisory-document/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[The Ayaneo Next II pushes past 3 pounds, is 13 inches wide, and costs up to $4,300.]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>In 2023, we marveled at the sheer mass of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">Lenovo's Legion Go</a>, a 1.88-pound, 11.8-inch-wide monstrosity of a Windows gaming handheld. In 2026, though, Ayaneo <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">unveiled details of its Next II handheld</a>, which puts Lenovo's big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Let's focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/ayaneo-next.html">2022's original Ayaneo Next</a>, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">Ayaneo's spec sheet</a>, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached).</p>
<p>Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset, with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/review-asus-rog-flow-z13-tablet-takes-the-asterisk-off-integrated-gpus/">last year's high-end ROG Flow Z13</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/just-look-at-ayaneos-absolute-unit-of-a-windows-gaming-handheld/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">some humans impersonating AI agents</a>) have been hanging out and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/the-rise-of-moltbook-suggests-viral-ai-prompts-may-be-the-next-big-security-threat/">doing weird stuff</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ai-agents-now-have-their-own-reddit-style-social-network-and-its-getting-weird-fast/">Moltbook's Reddit-style social network</a>. Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/">SpaceMolt</a></em> describes itself as "a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories" in "a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist." And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.</p>
<h2>"You decide. You act. They watch."</h2>
<p>Getting an AI agent into <em>SpaceMolt</em> is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/">MCP</a>, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a <a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/skill.md">detailed agentic skill description</a> instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-moltbook-ai-agents-can-now-hang-out-in-their-own-space-faring-mmo/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Google continues to turn the screws on free YouTube users, expanding a test that restricts access to song lyrics on YouTube Music. Users without a premium subscription have found that Google's streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money.</p>
<p>For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2026/02/07/youtube-music-lyrics-premium/">9to5Google</a>, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely.</p>
<p>"You have [x] views remaining," the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there's no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9266556?hl=en">Google's support page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/google-locks-youtube-music-lyrics-behind-paywall/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is reportedly investigating ABC’s <em>The View</em> in what FCC Democrat Anna Gomez called an attempt to intimidate critics of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“Let’s be clear on what this is. This is government intimidation, not a legitimate investigation," Gomez <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-418551A1.pdf">said</a> in a statement Friday night. "Like many other so-called ‘investigations’ before it, the FCC will announce an investigation but never carry one out, reach a conclusion, or take any meaningful action. The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech."</p>
<p>The FCC hasn't announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel</a>, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/after-getting-jimmy-kimmel-suspended-fcc-chair-threatens-abcs-the-view/">said in September</a> that it would be "worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether <em>The View</em> and some of these other programs" are violating the agency's equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/trump-fcc-tries-to-get-more-republicans-on-late-night-and-daytime-talk-shows/">issuing a warning</a> to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the <em>bona fide</em> news exemption to the equal-time rule.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Discord is facing backlash after <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally">announcing</a> that all users will soon be required to verify ages to access adult content by sharing video selfies or uploading government IDs.</p>
<p>According to Discord, it's relying on AI technology that verifies age on the user's device, either by evaluating a user's facial structure or by comparing a selfie to a government ID. Although government IDs will be checked off-device, the selfie data will never leave the user's device, Discord emphasized. Both forms of data will be promptly deleted after the user's age is estimated.</p>
<p>In a blog, Discord confirmed that "a phased global rollout" would begin in "early March," at which point all users globally would be defaulted to "teen-appropriate" experiences.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-faces-backlash-over-age-checks-after-data-breach-exposed-70000-ids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At the end of January, Washington, DC, saw an extremely unusual event. The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak.</p>
<p>Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people's trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience.</p>
<p>The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya's main project, which he called a "second scientific revolution."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/nih-head-still-angry-about-covid-wants-a-second-scientific-revolution/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N32YL6wV2j0?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Steven Spielberg directed two of the best alien films of all time: <em>E.T.</em> and <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>. Now he's going back to those roots, as it were, with his latest blockbuster film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclosure_Day"><em>Disclosure Day</em></a>. A full-length trailer aired during the <a title="Super Bowl LX" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LX">Super Bowl LX</a> broadcast last night.</p>
<p>Per the (deliberately vague) official premise: "If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to 7 billion people. We are coming close to… Disclosure Day."</p>
<p>The trailer doesn't tell us much more than the logline. It opens with a newscast announcing the pending public release of "government material long shrouded in secrecy." We see a shot of a man standing in the middle of a crop circle that definitely wasn't made by humans. A little girl encounters a seemingly sentient deer in her bedroom as a voiceover wonders whether there could be "others." And what's with putting electrodes on people's temples so that their eyes change color? We'll find out in June.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/disclosure-day-super-bowl-trailer-could-it-be-aliens/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Ferrari has published images of the interior of its forthcoming electric vehicle, which it designed with LoveFrom, the new firm of former Apple star Jony Ive and another legendary designer, Marc Newson. The Italian sports and racing car maker is taking a careful approach to revealing details about its first battery EV, signaling a depth of thought that goes well beyond simply swapping a V12, transmission, and fuel tank out for batteries and electric motors. Indeed, the interior of the new car—called the Ferrari Luce—bears little family resemblance to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/driven-the-ferrari-12cilindri-spider-is-open-top-grand-touring-bliss/">any recent Ferrari</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, LoveFrom appears to have channeled Ferrari interiors from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, with a retro simplicity that combines clear round gauges with brushed aluminum. Forget the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/great-hybrid-v6-lousy-hmi-three-days-with-a-ferrari-296-gtb/">capacitive panels that so frustrated me in the Ferrari 296</a>—here, there are physical buttons and rocker switches that seem free of the crash protection surrounds that Mini was forced to use.</p>
<p>The steering wheel now resembles the iconic "Nardi" wheel that has graced so many older Ferraris. But here, the horn buttons have been integrated into the spokes, and multifunction pods hang off the horizontal spokes, allowing Ferrari to keep its "hands on the wheel" approach to ergonomics. Made from entirely CNC-milled recycled aluminum, the Luce's wheel weighs 400 g less than Ferrari's usual steering wheel.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/ive-and-newson-bring-old-school-charm-to-ferraris-first-ev-interior/">Read full article</a></p>
