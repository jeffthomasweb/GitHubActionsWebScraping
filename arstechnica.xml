              <![CDATA[<p>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-19/sonos-woes-spark-apple-deal-talk-mail-with-ai-coming-in-macos-15-4-iphone-se">Mark Gurman in Bloomberg</a> makes the very reasonable suggestion that automatic email categorization in Apple Mail, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/ios-18-is-all-about-customization-but-also-improves-android-users-sms-life/">already present since iOS 18 arrived on the iPhone</a>, is coming to Macs and iPads in a few months. The feature should arrive with macOS 15.4 and possibly iPadOS 18.4, both due in April.</p>
<p>Similar to Google's server-side Gmail sorting, which <a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html">debuted in May 2013</a>, Apple's Mail app on iOS sorts email into categories: "Primary," "Transactions," "Updates," and "Promotions." Moving an email manually from one category to another generally fixes the categorization for that sender from then on. You cannot create new categories, however, or alter how Apple's sorting functions.</p>
<p>Some may prefer the simplicity of a single scroll of messages, versus having to check four separate inboxes to ensure that nothing got missorted or is more important than the label implies. I've used sorting on iOS and generally found it helpful, though I also use the Filters button in the lower-left corner on iOS to do a double-check of all the mail addressed specifically to me. On a Mac desktop, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/mimestream-the-ars-pick-for-mac-gmail-client-hits-1-0-with-new-features/">I'm partial to Mimestream</a>, but that's because all my mail comes through Google/Workspace accounts. I'll be watching to see how Mail's sorting translates to macOS.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/report-apple-mail-is-getting-automatic-categories-on-ipados-and-macos/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For decades, we have been imaging the surface of Mars with ever-finer resolution, cataloging a huge range of features on its surface, studying their composition, and, in a few cases, dispatching rovers to make on-the-ground readings. But a catalog of what's present on Mars doesn't give us answers to what's often the key question: how did a given feature get there? In fact, even with all the data we have available, there are a number of major bits of Martian geography that have produced major academic arguments that have yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>In Monday's issue of Nature Geoscience, a team of UK-based researchers tackle a big one: Mars' dichotomy, the somewhat nebulous boundary between its relatively elevated southern half, and the low basin that occupies its northern hemisphere, a feature that some have proposed also served as an ancient shoreline. The new work suggests that the edge of the dichotomy was eroded back by hundreds of kilometers during the time when an ocean might have occupied Mars' northern hemisphere.</p>
<h2>Close to the edge</h2>
<p>To view the Martian dichotomy, all you need to do is color-code a relief map of the Martian surface, something that NASA has <a href="https://attic.gsfc.nasa.gov/mola/images.html">conveniently done for us</a>. Barring a couple of enormous basins, the entire southern hemisphere of the red planet is elevated by a kilometer or more, and sits atop a far thicker crust. With the exception of the volcanic Tharsis region the boundary between these two areas runs roughly along the equator.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/field-of-mounds-on-mars-may-be-sign-of-erosion-at-the-edge-of-an-ocean/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Veterinarians in the Washington, DC region have been put on alert for any unusual illnesses in their non-human patients amid today's presidential inauguration—a nod to the significance of potential zoonotic bioterror threats.</p>
<p>In a recent letter to Virginia veterinarians, the state health department requested assistance in the "enhanced surveillance," while noting that, currently, there is no report of threats or bioterrorism-related illnesses.</p>
<p>"As with any large-scale public event, there will be heightened security, and the region will be on alert or signs of bioterrorism or other potential threats," the letter read. "Enhanced surveillance is being conducted out of an abundance of caution."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/dc-area-veterinarians-on-heightened-alert-amid-potential-inauguration-risks/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>When it comes to fine-tuned motor skills like playing the piano, practice, they say, makes perfect. But expert musicians often experience a "ceiling effect," in which their skill level plateaus after extensive training. Passive training using a robotic exoskeleton hand could help pianists overcome that ceiling effect, according to a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adn3802">paper</a> published in the journal Science Robotics.</p>
<p>“I’m a pianist, but I [injured] my hand because of overpracticing,” coauthor Shinichi Furuya of Kabushiki Keisha Sony Computer Science Kenkyujo <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2464473-robotic-exoskeleton-can-train-expert-pianists-to-play-faster/">told New Scientist</a>. “I was suffering from this dilemma, between overpracticing and the prevention of the injury, so then I thought, I have to think about some way to improve my skills without practicing.” Recalling that his former teachers used to place their hands over his to show him how to play more advanced pieces, he wondered if he could achieve the same effect with a robotic hand.</p>
<p>So Furuya et al. used a custom-made exoskeleton robot hand capable of moving individual fingers on the right hand independently, flexing and extending the joints as needed. Per the authors, prior studies with robotic exoskeletons focused on simpler movements, such as assisting in the movement of limbs stabilizing body posture, or helping grasp objects. That sets the custom robotic hand used in these latest experiments apart from those used for haptics in virtual environments.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/robotic-hand-helps-pianists-overcome-ceiling-effect/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I have one standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack">rack</a> appliance in my home: a Unifi Dream Machine Pro. It is mounted horizontally in a coat closet, putting it close to my home's fiber input and also incidentally keeping our jackets gently warm. I can fit juuuuuust about one more standard rack-size device in there (maybe a rack-mount UPS?) before I have to choose between outer-wear and overly ambitious networking. Were I starting over, I might think a bit more about scalability.</p>
<p>Along those lines, technologist and YouTube maker Jeff Geerling has launched the <a href="https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com/">Project Mini Rack</a> page for folks who have similarly server-sized ambitions, coupled with a lack of square footage. "I mean, if you want to cosplay as a sysadmin, you need a rack, right?" Geerling says in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GCIwLm3is">the announcement video</a>. It's a keen launching point for a new "homelab" or "minilab" project, also known as bringing the networking and hardware challenges of a commercial network deployment into your home for "fun."</p>

<p>It's a good time fall into the compact computing space. As Geerling notes in <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/project-mini-rack-compact-and-portable-homelabs">a blog post</a> announcing the project, there's a whole lot of small-form-factor PCs on the market. You can couple them with single-board computers, power-over-Ethernet devices, and network-accessible solid state drives that allow you to stuff a whole lab into a cube you can carry around in your hands.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/project-mini-rack-wants-to-help-you-make-your-non-closet-sized-homelab-a-reality/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Our bodies rely on their lymphatic system to drain excessive fluids and remove waste from tissues, feeding those back into the blood stream. It’s a complex yet efficient cleaning mechanism that works in every organ except the brain. “When cells are active, they produce waste metabolites, and this also happens in the brain. Since there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain, the question was what was it that cleaned the brain,” Natalie Hauglund, a neuroscientist at Oxford University who led a recent study on the brain-clearing mechanism, told Ars.</p>
<p>Earlier studies done mostly on mice discovered that the brain had a system that flushed its tissues with cerebrospinal fluid, which carried away waste products in a process called glymphatic clearance. “Scientists noticed that this only happened during sleep, but it was unknown what it was about sleep that initiated this cleaning process,” Hauglund explains.</p>
<p>Her study found the glymphatic clearance was mediated by a hormone called norepinephrine and happened almost exclusively during the NREM sleep phase. But it only worked when sleep was natural. Anesthesia and sleeping pills shut this process down nearly completely.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/how-sleeping-pills-interfere-with-the-brains-internal-cleaning-mechanism/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When ya gotta go, ya gotta go, and if it sometimes seems like the urge to pee seems more pressing when others nearby are letting loose—well, there's now a bit of science to back that up. It turns out that humans may not be the only species to experience "contagious urination," according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01594-X">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology. Chimpanzees living at the Kumamoto Sanctuary in Japan are also more likely to relieve themselves when others are doing so nearby, and the behavior seems to be hierarchical, "flowing down" from dominant chimps to more passive ones.</p>
<p>“In humans, urinating together can be seen as a social phenomenon,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1069719?">said coauthor Ena Onishi</a> of Kyoto University. “An Italian proverb states, ‘Whoever doesn’t pee in company is either a thief or a spy’ (<em>Chi non piscia in compagnia o è un ladro o è una spia</em>), while in Japanese, the act of urinating with others is referred to as 'Tsureshon' (連れション). This behavior is represented in art across centuries and cultures and continues to appear in modern social contexts. Our research suggests that this phenomenon may have deep evolutionary roots.”</p>
<p>Onishi, et al decided to study the phenomenon after noticing that many chimps in the sanctuary seemed to synchronize when they peed, and they wondered whether the phenomenon might be similar to how one person yawning can trigger others to follow suit—another "semi-voluntary physiological behavior." There had been no prior research into contagious peeing. So they filmed the 20 captive chimps over 600 hours, documenting over 1,300 "urination events."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/peeing-is-contagious-among-chimps/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>From the flamboyant blossoms and birds of rainforests to the living rainbows of coral reefs, Earth’s surface is teeming with life. But some of its most diverse and fascinating biomes are thriving in the darkness below.</p>
<p>We used to think that the subsurface was a far-from-ideal place for living things. Habitats that can soak up light and warmth from the Sun have the energy to sustain many forms of life and so were viewed as the most diverse. That view is now changing.</p>
<p>Led by Emil Ruff of the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Mass., new research has unearthed communities of underground microbes that are almost as—and sometimes more—diverse than even reefs and rainforests. Ruff and his team found that subsurface bacteria and archaea are flourishing, even at depths where the energy supply is orders of magnitude lower than enjoyed by organisms in habitats that see the sun.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/life-is-thriving-in-the-subsurface-depths-of-earth/">Read full article</a></p>

TikTok is gradually resuming service in the US, but it has an unclear road ahead.</p>
<p>TikTok started greeting US users late Saturday night with a notice stating that "Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now," noting that "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US."</p>
<p>The message changed after it was first deployed, adding a note that "We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.

              <![CDATA[<p>With just hours left in office, President Joe Biden has issued a preemptive pardon for Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert.</p>
<p>For nearly four decades, Fauci directed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He advised seven presidents, beginning with Ronald Reagan and, among his many accomplishments, played a crucial role in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Fauci was a leading architect of PEPFAR, the global AIDS response program begun by President George W. Bush that is estimated to have <a href="https://www.state.gov/results-and-impact-pepfar/">saved 25 million lives</a>. Fauci served as Biden's medical advisor until his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/fauci-to-step-down-in-december-biden-extends-deepest-thanks/">retirement at the end of 2022</a>.</p>
<p>"For more than half a century, Dr. Fauci served our country," Biden said <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/20/statement-from-president-joe-biden-15/">in a statement released this morning</a>. "He saved countless lives by managing the government’s response to pressing health crises, including HIV/AIDS, as well as the Ebola and Zika viruses. During his tenure as my Chief Medical Advisor, he helped the country tackle a once-in-a-century pandemic. The United States is safer and healthier because of him."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/biden-preemptively-pardons-anthony-fauci-top-us-infectious-disease-expert/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>There is renewed talk of a coal power comeback in the United States, inspired by Donald Trump’s return to the presidency and forecasts of soaring electricity demand.</p>
<p>The evidence so far only shows that some plants are getting small extensions on their retirement dates. This means a slowdown in coal’s rate of decline, which is bad for the environment, but it does little to change the long-term trajectory for the domestic coal industry.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/has-trump-changed-the-retirement-plans-for-the-countrys-largest-coal-plants/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Late last year, California passed a law against the possession or distribution of child sex abuse material (CSAM) that has been generated by AI. The law went into effect on January 1, and Sacramento police announced yesterday that they have already arrested their first suspect—a 49-year-old Pulitzer-prize-winning cartoonist named Darrin Bell.</p>
<p>The new law, which <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1831">you can read here</a>, declares that AI-generated CSAM is harmful, even without an actual victim. In part, says the law, this is because all kinds of CSAM can be used to groom children into thinking sexual activity with adults is normal. But the law singles out AI-generated CSAM for special criticism due to the way that generative AI systems work.</p>
<p>"The creation of CSAM using AI is inherently harmful to children because the machine-learning models utilized by AI have been trained on datasets containing thousands of depictions of known CSAM victims," it says, "revictimizing these real children by using their likeness to generate AI CSAM images into perpetuity."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/under-new-law-cops-bust-famous-cartoonist-for-ai-generated-child-sex-abuse-images/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Photography enthusiasts pay a lot for their very powerful cameras. How much more should they pay to put them to much, much easier work as a webcam? However many hundreds of dollars you paid, Canon thinks you should pay $5 per month—or, heck, just $50 per year—to do that.</p>
<p>Roman Zipp detailed his journey from incredulousness to grim resignation in <a href="https://romanzipp.com/blog/no-you-cant-use-your-6299-canon-camera-as-a-webcam">a blog post</a>. He bought his <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/compacts/canon_g5xii">Canon PowerShot G5 X Mark II</a> for something like $900 last year. The compact model gave him the right match of focal length and sensor size for concert pics. What it did not give him was the ability to change anything at all about his webcam feed using Canon's software. (The "$6,299 camera" referenced in Zipp's blog post title is his indication that all models of Canon's cameras face this conundrum, regardless of price point.)</p>
<p>Ah, but that's because Zipp did not pay. If you head to Canon's site, provide a name and email, and manage to grab the EOS Webcam utility when Canon's servers are not failing, you can connect one camera, with one default scene, at 720p, 30 frames per second and adjust everything on the camera itself if you need to. Should you pay $5 per month, or $50 per year, you can unlock <a href="file:///C:/Users/kspur/Downloads/How%20to%20Subscribe.pdf">EOS Webcam Utility Pro</a> (PDF link), which provides full 60 fps video and most of the features you'd expect out of a webcam that cost hundreds fewer dollars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/canon-charges-50-per-year-to-use-a-900-camera-as-a-functional-webcam/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Visionary filmmaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch">David Lynch</a>—whose work spanned midnight movie staples like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead"><em>Eraserhead</em></a> (1977), neo-noir psychological thrillers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)"><em>Mulholland Drive</em></a> (2001), and beyond—<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/david-lynch-dead-twin-peaks-blue-velvet-elephant-man-1236258625/">has died</a> at 78. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/david-lynch-dead-twin-peaks-blue-velvet-elephant-man-1236258625/">Deadline Hollywood</a>, the director had to evacuate his home due to the LA wildfires. He had been diagnosed with severe emphysema a few years ago and rarely left his house due to COVID-19 fears. Following the evacuation, his health deteriorated, and he <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/01/16/legendary-director-david-lynch-dead-at-78/">died</a> at his daughter's house.</p>
<p>“It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,” the director's family said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl&amp;id=100044613211418&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;_rdr">in a statement</a>. “We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.’ It’s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.”</p>
<p>Reactions <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/david-lynch-hollywood-tributes-reactions-1236258776/">from Hollywood</a> were swift and heartfelt. Kyle MacLachlan, who became a star when Lynch cast him as Paul Atreides in 1984's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(1984_film)">Dune</a>,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_(film)"><em>Blue Velvet</em></a> (1986), and the TV series <em>Twin Peaks</em>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/kyle-maclachlan-david-lynch-death-twin-peaks-1236259035/">described the director</a> as "the most authentically alive person I'd ever met":</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/hollywood-mourns-the-loss-of-david-lynch/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>General Motors and its subsidiary OnStar agreed to a settlement that prohibits them from sharing driver location and behavior data with third parties, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-takes-action-against-general-motors-sharing-drivers-precise-location-driving-behavior-data">announced</a> yesterday. The proposed settlement comes less than a year after GM responded to public backlash by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/gm-stops-sharing-driver-data-with-brokers-amid-backlash/">announcing</a> that it stopped sharing driving data from its connected cars with companies such as LexisNexis.</p>
<p>The FTC said it "is taking action against General Motors (GM) and OnStar over allegations they collected, used, and sold drivers' precise geolocation data and driving behavior information from millions of vehicles—data that can be used to set insurance rates—without adequately notifying consumers and obtaining their affirmative consent." GM did not admit to or deny the allegations.</p>
<p>GM and OnStar "will be banned for five years from disclosing consumers' sensitive geolocation and driver behavior data to consumer reporting agencies," the FTC said. Under the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/242_3052_-_general_motors_decisionandorder.pdf">settlement</a>, "consumer reporting agency" means a firm that collects or evaluates "consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to other parties and which uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/gm-faces-ban-on-selling-driver-data-that-can-be-used-to-raise-insurance-rates/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Post-pandemic, my creed became <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1732ytz/bicycles_deliver_the_freedom_that_auto_ads_promise/">"Bicycles deliver the freedom that auto ads promise."</a> That belief is why I’ve almost exclusively used a bike to move myself around Portland, Oregon since (yes, I have become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3nMnr8ZirI"><i>Portlandia </i>stereotype</a>).</p>
<p>However, that lifestyle is a lot more challenging without some pedal assistance. For a few summers, I showed up sweaty to appointments after pedaling on a $200 single-speed. So in 2024, I purchased the FX+ 2, based primarily on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/the-trek-fx-2-e-bike-is-a-jack-of-all-trades/">my managing editor’s review</a>. It’s since been a workhorse for my daily transportation needs for the past year; I've put more than 1,000 miles on it in eight months.</p>
<p>So given my experience with that bike, I was the natural choice to review Trek’s upgraded version, <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/hybrid-bikes/electric-hybrid-bikes/fx/fx-7s/p/47897/">the FX+ 7S</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/fx-7s-review-treks-jack-of-all-trades-e-bike-gets-a-luxury-upgrade/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Thursday's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">teaser trailer for the Switch 2</a> made it abundantly clear that the upcoming console will be quite a bit larger than the original Switch that came before it. But Nintendo is still being coy about the specific dimensions of the Switch 2's expanded tablet and Joy-Cons.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the trailer itself features a number of head-on shots of the Switch 2 hardware next to a known quantity—the original Switch Joy-Cons. Using the established measurements of that older controller (<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/ph/hardware/switch/modal/specs/joy-con.html">102×35.9 mm</a>) and some Photoshop pixel counting, we can use freeze frames from that trailer to extrapolate a rough size and shape for the Switch 2 hardware.</p>

      Using the original Switch Joy-Cons as a reference, we can estimate the size of the Switch 2 shown in the trailer.

<p>After spending a good chunk of Thursday performing just those calculations, we're ready to estimate that the Switch 2 hardware features a roughly 7.9-inch screen (measured diagonally), up from 6.2 inches on the Switch and 7 inches on the Switch OLED. We also learned that the Switch tablet itself has a roughly 33 percent larger footprint than that of the original Switch (in terms of total area), while the joysticks on the Switch 2 Joy-Cons have a roughly 26 percent larger diameter than those on the Switch.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple released new beta versions of iOS 18.3 to developers and the public yesterday, and one of the changes coming with the new software update will (at least temporarily) disable Apple Intelligence notification summaries for all apps in the App Store's News and Entertainment category, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>Apple said <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/apple-plans-software-update-after-ai-summaries-get-news-headlines-wrong/">earlier this month</a> that it would be instituting updates to how these notifications are handled after complaints from news organizations, and the company has apparently decided to turn them off entirely while it decides what those updates will look like. Most prominently, one user's notification summary from the BBC suggested that Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died of suicide; this was not true. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/geoffreyfowler.bsky.social/post/3lfsep7n4322l">Other examples</a> have been cropping up since then.</p>
<p>For the notification summaries that remain, Apple is instituting changes to make it clearer when users are reading summaries and to make it easier to turn those summaries off. Notification summaries in iOS 18.3 will be italicized to help further distinguish them from individual non-summarized notifications—before, there was a small icon next to the text to indicate you were looking at a summary. Apple is also making it possible to turn off summaries on a per-app basis directly from the lock screen without diving into the Settings app to do it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/01/ios-18-3-beta-disables-news-notification-summaries-after-high-stakes-errors/">Read full article</a></p>
