                            <![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/kff-health-tracking-poll-public-weighs-political-consequences-of-health-policy-legislation/">new polling data</a>, nearly 80 percent of Americans support extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of this year—and are at the center of a funding dispute that led to a shutdown of the federal government this week.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by KFF and released Friday, found that 78 percent of Americans want the tax credits extended, including 92 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of Republicans—and even a majority (57 percent) of Republicans who identify as Donald Trump-aligned MAGA (Make America Great Again) supporters.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/">separate analysis</a> published by KFF earlier this week found that if the credits are not extended, monthly premiums for ACA Marketplace plans would more than double on average. Specifically, the current average premium of $888 would jump to $1,904 in 2026, a 114 percent increase.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/most-americans-want-aca-tax-credits-extended-even-57-of-maga-supporters/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A new listing of the 50 most concerning pieces of space debris in low-Earth orbit is dominated by relics more than a quarter-century old, primarily dead rockets left to hurtle through space at the end of their missions.</p>
<p>"The things left before 2000 are still the majority of the problem," said Darren McKnight, lead author of a paper presented Friday at the International Astronautical Congress in Sydney. "Seventy-six percent of the objects in the top 50 were deposited last century, and 88 percent of the objects are rocket bodies. That's important to note, especially with some disturbing trends right now."</p>
<p>The 50 objects identified by McKnight and his coauthors are the ones most likely to drive the creation of more space junk in low-Earth orbit (LEO) through collisions with other debris fragments. The objects are whizzing around the Earth at nearly 5 miles per second, flying in a heavily trafficked part of LEO between 700 and 1,000 kilometers (435 to 621 miles) above the Earth.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/everyone-but-china-has-pretty-much-stopped-littering-in-low-earth-orbit/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, a team of researchers led by Microsoft announced that they had discovered, and possibly patched, what they're terming a biological zero-day—an unrecognized security hole in a system that protects us from biological threats. The system at risk screens purchases of DNA sequences to determine when someone's ordering DNA that encodes a toxin or dangerous virus. But, the researchers argue, it has become increasingly vulnerable to missing a new threat: AI-designed toxins.</p>
<p>How big of a threat is this? To understand, you have to know a bit more about both existing biosurveillance programs and the capabilities of AI-designed proteins.</p>
<h2>Catching the bad ones</h2>
<p>Biological threats come in a variety of forms. Some are pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Others are protein-based toxins, like the ricin that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_ricin_letters">sent to the White House</a> in 2003. Still others are chemical toxins that are produced through enzymatic reactions, like the molecules <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycotoxin">associated with red tide</a>. All of them get their start through the same fundamental biological process: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then used to make proteins.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/do-ai-designed-proteins-create-a-biosecurity-vulnerability/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>As we careen toward a future in which Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-will-block-sideloading-of-unverified-android-apps-starting-next-year/">has final say over what apps you can run</a>, the company has sought to assuage the community's fears with a blog post and a casual "backstage" video. Google has said again and again since announcing the change that sideloading isn't going anywhere, but it's definitely not going to be as easy. The <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/09/lets-talk-security-answering-your-top.html">new information</a> confirms app installs will be more reliant on the cloud, and devs can expect new fees, but there will be an escape hatch for hobbyists.</p>
<p>Confirming app verification status will be the job of a new system component called the Android Developer Verifier, which will be rolled out to devices in the next major release of Android 16. Google explains that phones must ensure each app has a package name and signing keys that have been registered with Google at the time of installation. This process may <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/f-droid-calls-for-regulators-to-stop-googles-crackdown-on-sideloading/">break the popular FOSS storefront F-Droid</a>.</p>
<p>It would be impossible for your phone to carry a database of all verified apps, so this process may require Internet access. Google plans to have a local cache of the most common sideloaded apps on devices, but for anything else, an Internet connection is required. Google suggests alternative app stores will be able to use a pre-auth token to bypass network calls, but it's still deciding how that will work.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-confirms-android-dev-verification-will-have-free-and-paid-tiers-no-public-list-of-devs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Acting on a demand from the Trump administration, Apple has removed apps that let iPhone users report the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.</p>
<p>"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store—and Apple did so," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/apple-takes-down-ice-tracking-app-after-pressure-from-ag-bondi">statement to Fox News</a> yesterday. "ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed."</p>
<p>Apple confirmed it removed multiple apps after hearing from law enforcement. "We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps," an Apple statement to news organizations said. "Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/apple-bends-to-trump-admin-demand-to-remove-ice-tracking-apps-like-iceblock/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[
<p>Over the years, racing sims <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/assetto-corsa-are-ps4-and-xbox-one-ready-for-a-true-driving-simulator/">have come a long way</a>. Gaming PCs and consoles have become more powerful, physics and tire models have become more accurate, and after COVID, it seems like nearly everyone has a sim rig setup at home. Sim racing has even become an accepted route into the world of real-life motorsport (not to be confused with the Indy Racing League).</p>
<p>But what if you aren't looking to become the next Max Verstappen? What if you miss the more carefree days of old, where the fidelity wasn't quite so high, nor were the stakes? <em>Rally Arcade Classics </em>is worth a look.</p>
<p>Developed by NET2KGAMES, you might think of <em>RAC</em> as a spiritual successor to legendary titles like Sega Rally and Colin McRae Rally. Forget about the Nürburgring or even street circuits laid out in famous cities you might have visited; instead, this game is about point-to-point racing against the clock—mostly—across landscapes that long-time World Rally Championship fans will remember.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rally-arcade-classics-is-a-fun-90s-throwback-racing-game/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Apple's "Pro" iPhones usually look and feel a lot like the regular ones, just with some added features stacked on top. They've historically had better screens and more flexible cameras, and there has always been a Max option for people who really wanted to blur the lines between a big phone and a small tablet (Apple's commitment to the cheaper "iPhone Plus" idea has been less steadfast). But the qualitative experience of holding and using one wasn't all that different compared to the basic aluminum iPhone.</p>
<p>This year's iPhone 17 Pro looks and feels like more of a departure from the basic iPhone, thanks to a new design that prioritizes function over form. It's as though Apple anticipated the main complaints about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/iphone-air-review-apples-different-est-phone-in-years-is-appealing-despite-itself/">the iPhone Air</a>—why would I want a phone with worse battery and fewer cameras, why don't they just make the phone <em>thicker</em> so they can fit in more <em>things</em>—and made a version of the iPhone that they could point to and say, "We already make that phone—it's that one over there."</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/review-apples-injects-just-the-right-amount-of-pro-into-the-regular-iphone-17/">the regular iPhone 17</a> is so good, and because it uses the same 6.3-inch OLED ProMotion screen, I think the iPhone 17 Pro is playing to a narrower audience than usual this year. But Apple's changes and additions are also tailor-made to serve that audience. In other words, fewer people even need to consider the iPhone Pro this time around, but there's a lot to like here for actual "pros" and people who demand a lot from their phones.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/apple-iphone-17-pro-review-come-for-the-camera-stay-for-the-battery/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Fermenting milk to make yogurt, cheeses, or kefir is an ancient practice, and different cultures have their own traditional methods, often preserved in oral histories. The forests of Bulgaria and Turkey have an abundance of red wood ants, for instance, so a time-honored Bulgarian yogurt-making practice involves dropping a few live ants (or crushed-up ant eggs) into the milk to jump-start fermentation. Scientists have now figured out why the ants are so effective in making edible yogurt, according to <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)01856-5">a paper</a> published in the journal iScience. The authors even collaborated with chefs to create modern recipes using ant yogurt.</p>
<p>“Today’s yogurts are typically made with just two bacterial strains,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1099671?">said co-author Leonie Jahn</a> from the Technical University of Denmark. “If you look at traditional yogurt, you have much bigger biodiversity, varying based on location, households, and season. That brings more flavors, textures, and personality.”</p>
<p>If you want to study traditional culinary methods, it helps to go where those traditions emerged, since the locals likely still retain memories and oral histories of said culinary methods—in this case, Nova Mahala, Bulgaria, where co-author Sevgi Mutlu Sirakova's family still lives. To recreate the region's ant yogurt, the team followed instructions from Sirakova's uncle. They used fresh raw cow milk, warmed until scalding, "such that it could 'bite your pinkie finger,'" per the authors. Four live red wood ants were then collected from a local colony and added to the milk.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/how-ants-can-kick-start-fermentation-to-make-yogurt/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The largest electric utility in Illinois is rolling out a program for a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) electric school bus-charging pilot with three Chicagoland school districts, testing the functionality of bidirectional chargers that could make energy cheaper for customers and reduce grid load.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd) announced in September that it would begin the testing phase of its novel V2G electric school bus charging pilot, the first of its kind in northern Illinois, coinciding with the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>The utility began testing with the River Trails, Troy, and Wauconda school districts—which have all had electric buses for more than two years—in northern Illinois. It is currently collecting data from bidirectional chargers, EV chargers that flow energy both ways. Its testing will determine how the chargers and buses can best transfer energy when parked and plugged into the grid.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/illinois-utility-tries-using-electric-school-buses-for-bidirectional-charging/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 8.13 of the Rocket Report! It's difficult for me to believe, but we have now entered the fourth quarter of the year. Accordingly, there are three months left in 2025, with a lot of launch action still to come. The remainder of the year will be headlined by Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket making its second flight (and landing attempt), and SpaceX's Starship making its final test flight of the year. There is also the slim possibility that Rocket Lab's Neutron vehicle will make its debut this year, but it will almost certainly slip into 2026.</p>

<p><strong>An Alpha rocket blows up on the pad</strong>. The booster stage for Firefly Aerospace's next Alpha rocket was destroyed Monday in a fiery accident on the company's vertical test stand in Central Texas, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/after-another-fiery-setback-it-seems-fireflys-alpha-rocket-is-still-in-beta/">Ars reports</a>. Firefly released a statement confirming the rocket "experienced an event that resulted in a loss of the stage." The company confirmed all personnel were safe and said ground teams followed "proper safety protocols." Imagery posted on social media platforms showed a fireball engulfing the test stand and a column of black smoke rising into the sky over Firefly's facility roughly 40 miles north of Austin.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/rocket-report-alpha-explodes-on-test-stand-europe-wants-a-mini-starship/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At this point, you sort of expect Donald Trump's big-picture assaults on free speech, foreigners, and the rule of law. (Sometimes, as in the case of the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">outright attack on US higher ed</a>, all three are packaged in one convenient wrapper.) Although troubling and dangerous, these kinds of attacks are all at least <em>predictably</em> unhinged; most are drawn from the standard authoritarian playbook or its more recent "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy">illiberal democracies</a>" update.</p>
<p>It's when you look into the details, though, that one is constantly reminded: Nothing is too petty to be corrupted in Trumpworld.</p>

<p>A successful launch would also nudge Blue Origin closer to winning certification from the Space Force to begin launching national security satellites.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/blue-origin-aims-to-land-next-new-glenn-booster-then-reuse-it-for-moon-mission/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When a robotics pioneer who has spent decades building humanoid machines recommends that you stand at least nine feet away from any full-size walking robot, you should probably listen.</p>
<p>"My advice to people is to not come closer than 3 meters to a full-size walking robot," Rodney Brooks <a href="https://rodneybrooks.com/why-todays-humanoids-wont-learn-dexterity/">writes</a> in a technical essay titled "Why Today’s Humanoids Won’t Learn Dexterity" published on his blog last week. "Until someone comes up with a better version of a two-legged walking robot that is much safer to be near, and even in contact with, we will not see humanoid robots get certified to be deployed in zones that also have people in them."</p>
<p>Brooks, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks">MIT professor emeritus</a> who co-founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRobot">iRobot</a> (of Roomba fame) and Rethink Robotics, believes companies pouring billions into humanoid development are chasing an expensive fantasy. Among other problems yet to be addressed, he warns that today's bipedal humanoids are fundamentally unsafe for humans to be near when they walk due to the massive kinetic energy they generate while maintaining balance. That stored-up energy can cause severe injury if the robot falls or its limbs strike someone.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/why-irobots-founder-wont-go-within-10-feet-of-todays-walking-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As respiratory virus season draws near, no federal health official has signed off on recommendations for this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines, leaving the federal vaccination schedule without an update and access to the shots in limbo for some low-income children.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/30/covid-shot-delay-stymies-vaccines-for-children-program/">reporting by Stat</a> news earlier this week, two immunization program experts—who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal from the Trump administration—said that because there is no sign-off, states are not yet able to order COVID-19 shots for children who receive vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The federal program provides vaccines to children who are Medicaid-eligible and under- or uninsured, which includes around half of all children in the US.</p>
<p>Typically, federal vaccination recommendations come about after a panel of expert advisors for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)—publicly reviews vaccine data and votes on recommendations for use. Then, the CDC director decides whether to adopt those recommendations. While directors don't always adopt ACIP's recommendations, they usually do—and often on the same day as the ACIP vote. After that, the recommendation becomes part of federal vaccine guidance, and insurance companies and federal programs are required to cover the recommended shots.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/rfk-jr-drags-feet-on-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations-delaying-shots-for-kids/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration had <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-universities-compact-federal-funds-agreement-df158493?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgqusOM65R0yAEf1pPKrFTL_lsq15BH9c-Uq0R7wNPYv8y5BuTkPS7JJAimHrc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68de6932&amp;gaa_sig=Q8i3d0gupSNY3yTIQ6DgsmVOzincu2488WO3tiM5cKUpzq-_-7lbPZTlhxU_hEC5oV0-wTPpzgHaU_M1MQvKVQ%3D%3D">offered nine schools a deal</a>: manage your universities in a way that aligns with administration priorities and get “substantial and meaningful federal grants," along with other benefits. Failure to accept the bargain would result in a withdrawal of federal programs that would likely cripple most universities. The offer, sent to a mixture of state and private universities, would see the government dictate everything from hiring and admissions standards to grading and has provisions that appear intended to make conservative ideas more welcome on campus.</p>
<p>The document was sent to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Virginia. However, independent reporting indicates that the administration will ultimately extend the deal to all colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Ars has obtained a copy of the proposed "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education," which makes the scope of the bargain clear in its introduction. "Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits," it suggests, while mentioning that those benefits include access to fundamental needs, like student loans, federal contracts, research funding, tax benefits, and immigration visas for students and faculty.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Legendary primatologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Goodall">Jane Goodall</a>, whose immersive field research living among chimpanzees in the 1960s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/science/earth/jane-goodall-dead.html">essentially redefined</a> the relationship between humans and animals, has died at the age of 91. <a href="https://janegoodall.org/jane-goodall-renowned-ethologist-conservationist-and-animal-behavior-expert-passes-away-at-age-91/">According to the Jane Goodall Institute</a> (JGI), Goodall died of natural causes while in California as part of a US speaking tour.</p>
<p>"Jane was passionate about empowering young people to become involved in conservation and humanitarian projects and she led many educational initiatives focused on both wild and captive chimpanzees," the institute <a href="https://janegoodall.org">wrote in a statement</a>. "[Her] discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science. She was always guided by her fascination with the mysteries of evolution, and her staunch belief in the fundamental need to respect all forms of life on Earth."</p>
<p>Born in April 1934, Goodall loved nature and wildlife from a very young age, so much so that her father once gave her a stuffed monkey doll that young Jane named Jubilee and kept for the rest of her life. Goodall found an early mentor in paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey, who employed her as a secretary at the National Museum in Nairobi. She accompanied Leakey and his wife, Mary Leakey, on a hunt for fossils at the Olduvai Gorge. Impressed with the young woman's potential, Leakey sent her to Tanzania to study chimpanzees in the Gombe forest. He also arranged for her to enter the PhD program in ethology at Cambridge University; Goodall completed her PhD in 1965 with a thesis based on that initial Gombe study. The research program she founded is still active today.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/world-famous-primatologist-jane-goodall-dead-at-91/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This morning, Tesla published its production and delivery numbers for the third quarter of the year. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/tesla-sales-and-production-slumped-heavily-in-q1-2025/">We've heard</a> the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-q2-2025-sales-dropped-more-than-13-year-over-year/">same story</a> for a while, one of diminishing sales as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/tesla-shows-no-sign-of-improvement-in-may-sales-data/">customers tire</a> of a stale product lineup and are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-sales-fall-by-62-in-the-uk-46-in-germany/">repulsed</a> by the politics of the company's CEO. But Q3 2025 tells a different tale. It's been a good three months for the beleaguered automaker, one that appears to have cleared out a lot of old inventory.</p>
<p>Tesla built a total of 447,450 electric vehicles between July and September this year. That's actually a 4.8 percent decrease compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/tesla-reverses-sales-slump-sees-modest-growth-in-q3/">the same three months last year</a>.</p>
<p>The Models 3 and Y production lines saw less of a slowdown—Tesla built 435,826 of these EVs, a 1.8 percent decline on last year. But the Models S and X, grouped together with the US-only Cybertruck, saw the greatest cutbacks. Just 11,624 of these collected models were produced, a 55.1 percent decrease compared to Q3 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-reverses-sales-decline-in-q3-sells-50k-more-cars-than-it-built/">Read full article</a></p>
