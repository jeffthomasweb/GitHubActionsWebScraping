              <![CDATA[<p>After closing a $69 billion deal to buy virtualization technology company VMware a year ago, Broadcom wasted no time ushering in big changes to the ways customers and partners buy and sell VMware offerings—and many of those clients aren't happy.</p>
<p>To get a deeper look at the impact that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/">rising costs</a> and overhauls like the end of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">VMware perpetual license sales</a> have had on VMware users, Ars spoke with several companies in the process of quitting the software due to Broadcom's changes.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q1/press-release-webcast">reported</a> quarterly earnings that impressed investors and showed how resilient the company is even as it spends heavily on AI.</p>
<p>Some investors have been uneasy about the company's aggressive spending on AI, while others have demanded it. During this quarter, Microsoft reported that it spent $20 billion on capital expenditures, nearly double what it had spent during the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>However, the company satisfied both groups of investors, as it revealed it has still been doing well in the short term amid those long-term investments. The fiscal quarter, which covered July through September, saw overall sales rise 16 percent year over year to $65.6 billion. Despite all that AI spending, profits were up 11 percent, too.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/microsoft-reports-big-profits-amid-massive-ai-investments/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Slivered onions are the likely source of the<a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-one-dead-49-sickened-across-10-states-so-far/"> multi-state <em>E. coli </em>outbreak</a> linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/mcdonalds-outbreak-rises-to-75-cases-12-new-hospitalizations-3-new-states/">continues to grow</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>Onions were one of two primary suspects when the CDC announced the outbreak on October 22, with the other being the beef patties used on the burgers. But onions quickly became the leading suspect. The day after the CDC's announcement, McDonald's onion supplier, Taylor Farms, recalled peeled and diced yellow onion products, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/taco-bell-kfc-pizza-hut-burger-king-pull-onions-amid-mcdonalds-outbreak/">several other fast food chains took onions off the menu</a> as a precaution. (No other restaurants have been linked to the outbreak to date.)</p>
<p>According to the CDC, traceback information and epidemiological data collected since then have all pointed to the onions, and, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/always-putting-food-safety-first.html">according to McDonald's</a>, state and federal testing of the beef patties has all come back negative.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/slivered-onions-are-likely-cause-of-mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-cdc-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, one of the most graphically demanding and visually impressive games in recent years, will soon get a Mac release, according to developer and publisher CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>The announcement was published on <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50947/just-announced-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-coming-to-mac">CD Projekt Red's blog</a> and also appeared briefly during Apple's pre-recorded MacBook Pro announcement video. The game will be sold on the Mac App Store, Steam, GOG, and the Epic Game Store when it launches, and it will be labeled the <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em>, which simply means it also includes <em>Phantom Liberty</em>, the expansion that was released a couple of years after the original game.</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2027</em> launched in a rough state in 2020, especially on low-end hardware. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/it-cost-120m-for-cyberpunk-2077-patches-and-dlc-to-fix-the-games-image/">Subsequent patches and a significant overhaul</a> with <em>Phantom Liberty</em> largely redeemed it in critics' eyes—the result of all that post-launch work is the version Mac users will get.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/intensely-demanding-aaa-game-cyberpunk-2077-is-coming-to-the-mac/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For some, microwaving fish in the employee lunch room is the ultimate work faux pas. But for one (likely mortified) employee of a seafood distribution plant in Maryland, it's probably causing a mass poisoning with the homemade noodle dish they brought to share for lunch. The dish sickened 46 employees, spurring their employer to hastily release a statement assuring customers that it wasn't the company's food that caused the illnesses.</p>
<p>On October 21, first responders and paramedics arrived at the NAFCO Wholesale Fish Distribution Facility in Jessup, where dozens of employees had abruptly fallen ill about three hours after lunch. <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/staph-food-poisoning-cause-of-illness-jessup/62754095">Helicopter footage</a> of the event captured images of workers around picnic tables outside the plant, some doubled over and with their heads down.</p>
<p>Ultimately, 46 people were sickened, and at least 26 were treated at an area hospital with symptoms of food poisoning, according to <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/food-poisoning-jessup-howard-county-6AA2YSCUTFBCLIJXBTXFNKFG6E/">The Baltimore Banner</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple's week of Mac announcements has wrapped up this morning with the launch of the new M4 MacBook Pros, and we now have a full picture of the M4 chip lineup that will drive the Mac for the next year or so (excepting the M4 Ultra, if we end up getting one).</p>
<p>Because Apple staggered its product and chip announcements, we've gathered some basic specs from all versions of the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max to help compare them to the outgoing M2 and M3 chip families, including the slightly cut-down versions that Apple sells in the cheaper new Macs. We've also rounded up some of Apple's performance claims, so people with older Macs can see exactly what they're getting if they upgrade (Apple still likes to use the M1 as a baseline, acknowledging that the year-over-year gains are sometimes minor and that many people are still getting by just fine with some version of the M1 chip).</p>

<p>At least as far as the Mac is concerned, Apple has technically released six different chips this week under three different brand names. The M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max all have one slightly cut-down entry-level version with fewer CPU and GPU cores and one more-expensive, fully enabled version.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apples-m4-m4-pro-and-m4-max-compared-to-past-generations-and-to-each-other/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Dropbox is laying off 528 employees in a move that will reduce its global workforce by 20 percent, CEO Drew Houston <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/an-update-from-drew">announced</a> today.</p>
<p>Houston wrote that Dropbox's core file sync and sharing "business has matured, and we've been working to build our next phase of growth with products like Dash," an "<a href="https://dash.dropbox.com/meet-dash-for-business">AI-powered universal search</a>" product targeted to business customers. The company's "current structure and investment levels" are "no longer sustainable," according to Houston.</p>
<p>"We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business," Houston wrote. "But external factors are only part of the story. We've heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/dropbox-lays-off-528-employees-slashing-total-workforce-by-20-percent/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have found new versions of a sophisticated Android financial-fraud Trojan that’s notable for its ability to intercept calls a victim tries to place to customer-support personnel of their banks.</p>
<p>FakeCall first came to public attention in 2022, when researchers from security firm Kaspersky <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/fakecalls-banking-trojan/44072/">reported</a> that the malicious app wasn’t your average banking Trojan. Besides containing the usual capabilities for stealing account credentials, FakeCall could reroute voice calls to numbers controlled by the attackers.</p>
<h2>A strategic evolution</h2>
<p>The malware, available on websites masquerading as Google Play, could also simulate incoming calls from bank employees. The intention of the novel feature was to provide reassurances to victims that nothing was amiss and to more effectively trick them into divulging account credentials by having the social-engineering come from a live human.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/android-trojan-that-intercepts-voice-calls-to-banks-just-got-more-stealthy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Robert Downey Jr. has declared that he will sue any future Hollywood executives who try to re-create his likeness using AI digital replicas, as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/robert-downey-jr-bans-hollywood-digital-replace-lawsuit-1236192374/">Variety</a>. His comments came during an appearance on the "<a href="https://archive.ph/o/P6pCQ/https://open.spotify.com/episode/5EVu4ms1F11FR2jQtoWnI0?si=6133d6cc16674277">On With Kara Swisher</a>" podcast, where he discussed AI's growing role in entertainment.</p>
<p>"I intend to sue all future executives just on spec," Downey told Swisher when discussing the possibility of studios using AI or deepfakes to re-create his performances after his death. When Swisher pointed out he would be deceased at the time, Downey responded that his law firm "will still be very active."</p>
<p>The Oscar winner expressed confidence that Marvel Studios would not use AI to re-create his Tony Stark character, citing his trust in decision-makers there. "I am not worried about them hijacking my character's soul because there's like three or four guys and gals who make all the decisions there anyway and they would never do that to me," he said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/robert-downey-jr-vows-legal-action-against-future-ai-replica-use/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Streaming in the US has become <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/the-tv-streaming-apps-broke-their-promises-and-now-theyre-jacking-the-price/#page-2">a broken and fiendishly complex tangle of ephemeral choices</a>—and that's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/nfl-player-illegally-streams-his-own-teams-game-garners-mostly-sympathy/?comments-page=1#comments">before you factor in sports</a>. You can see why it might seem somehow easier to stream shows from other countries, where the networks, some of them with public dollars behind them, offer broader access if you seem to be located there.</p>
<p>So it is that privacy-focused Swiss firm Proton has <a href="https://protonvpn.com/blog/apple-tv-app/">released a Proton VPN app for Apple TV</a>. The firm notes that it "offers over 6,200 servers across 100 countries" and its own guides to <a href="https://protonvpn.com/support/streaming-guide/">accessing various regional content providers</a>, such as Britain's BBC and France.tv, or sports and live event channels, "no matter where you are."</p>
<p>That this—virtual geolocation—is mentioned ahead of "privacy and security benefits" is notable, but only if you haven't looked. I typed "VPN" into an Apple TV's App Store search interface today and learned that Proton was now one among dozens and dozens of VPN offerings for Apple TV. "Dozens" is as far as I can go, because I eventually got tired of clicking to keep scrolling down.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/proton-expands-its-vpn-offerings-to-apple-tv-where-the-use-cases-get-tricky/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T improperly obtained money from a government-run broadband discount program by submitting duplicate requests and by claiming subsidies for thousands of subscribers who weren't using AT&amp;T's service. AT&amp;T obtained funding based on false certifications it made under penalty of perjury.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T on Friday agreed to pay $2.3 million in a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-1089A1.pdf">consent decree</a> with the Federal Communications Commission's Enforcement Bureau. That includes a civil penalty of $1,921,068 and a repayment of $378,922 to the US Treasury.</p>
<p>The settlement fully resolves the FCC investigation into AT&amp;T's apparent violations, the consent decree said. "AT&amp;T admits for the purpose of this Consent Decree and for Commission civil enforcement purposes" that the findings described by the FCC "contain a true and accurate description of the facts underlying the Investigation," the document said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/att-praises-itself-after-getting-caught-taking-too-much-money-from-fcc-program/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[With Reddit finally making money, the Reddit of yesteryear isn't coming back. ]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>In May 2023, Reddit announced that its API would no longer be free, signaling the demise of most <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/exploring-reddits-third-party-app-environment-7-months-after-the-apicalypse/">third-party Reddit apps</a> and the start of a new Reddit era. Reddit was always interested in making money, but the social media platform’s drive to reach profitability intensified with its API rule changes, which was followed by it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/report-75k-loyal-redditors-can-snag-shares-before-reddit-goes-public/">going public</a> and other big moves. With Reddit reporting this week that it has finally turned its first profit, we can expect further evolution from Reddit, whether old-time Redditors like it or not.</p>
<p>In its fiscal Q4 2024 results announced on Tuesday [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Reddit-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-2024.pdf">PDF</a>], Reddit said that in the quarter ending on September 30, it made a profit of $29.9 million. This is significant growth from fiscal Q3 2024, when Reddit lost $7.4 million. Revenue, meanwhile, was up 68 percent year over year, going from $207.5 million to $384.4 million. Reddit is expecting $385 to $400 million in revenue for fiscal Q4.</p>
<h2>More Redditors</h2>
<p>During the<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/policy-change-lets-reddit-veto-user-protests/"> Reddit app-ocalypse</a>, many Reddit users and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/are-reddits-replacement-mods-fit-to-fight-misinformation/">moderators</a> said they would quit the platform because they were disgusted with how Reddit treated third-party developers and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/reddit-calls-for-a-few-new-mods-after-axing-polarizing-some-of-its-best/">moderators</a>, particularly during user protests against the API rule changes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amid-controversial-changes-reddit-is-getting-more-popular-and-profitable/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Google's CEO revealed that AI systems now generate more than a quarter of new code for its products, with human programmers overseeing the computer-generated contributions. The statement, made during Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/ai-cloud-boost-alphabet-profits-by-34-percent/">Q3 2024 earnings call</a>, shows how AI tools are already having a sizable impact on software development.</p>
<p>"We're also using AI internally to improve our coding processes, which is boosting productivity and efficiency," Pichai <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/alphabet-earnings-q3-2024/#search">said</a> during the call. "Today, more than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers. This helps our engineers do more and move faster."</p>
<p>Google developers aren't the only programmers using AI to assist with coding tasks. It's difficult to get hard numbers, but according to Stack Overflow's <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai">2024 Developer Survey</a>, over 76 percent of all respondents "are using or are planning to use AI tools in their development process this year," with 62 percent actively using them. A 2023 <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/research/survey-reveals-ais-impact-on-the-developer-experience/">GitHub survey</a> found that 92 percent of US-based software developers are "already using AI coding tools both in and outside of work."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-ceo-says-over-25-of-new-google-code-is-generated-by-ai/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A little more than a year ago, a snippet of video that wasn't supposed to go public made its way onto United Launch Alliance's live broadcast of an Atlas V rocket launch carrying three classified surveillance satellites for the US Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office.</p>
<p>On these types of secretive national security missions, the government typically requests that the launch provider stop providing updates on the ascent into space when the rocket jettisons its two-piece payload fairing a few minutes after launch. And there should be no live video from the rocket released to the public showing the fairing separation sequence, which exposes the payloads to the space environment for the first time.</p>
<p>But the public saw video of the clamshell-like payload fairing falling away from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/united-launch-alliances-atlas-v-rocket-has-a-long-sunset-ahead-of-it/">Atlas V rocket as it fired downrange from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on September 10, 2023</a>. It wasn't pretty. Numerous chunks of material, possibly insulation from the inner wall of the payload shroud's two shells, fell off the fairing. The video embedded below shows the moment of payload fairing jettison.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/while-ula-studies-vulcan-booster-anomaly-its-also-investigating-fairing-issues/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apple-teases-week-of-announcements-about-the-mac-starting-on-monday/">week of Mac announcements</a> isn't extending to an M4 MacBook Air—rumors indicate that the Air, as well as desktops like the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, will get new processors sometime in 2025. But Apple is bringing one of the best features of the new M4 Macs to the M3 MacBook Airs, as well as the entry-level M2 model: All of the base models are being bumped from 8GB to 16GB of RAM for <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">the same prices as before</a>. The M2 MacBook Air still starts at $999, while the 13- and 15-inch M3 versions start at $1,099 and $1,299.</p>
<p>All of these laptops were available with 16GB of RAM before, but it was normally a $200 upgrade. All of them still top out at 24GB of RAM, which is now a $200 upgrade to the 16GB models rather than a $400 upgrade as it was before. All models still start with 256GB of storage.</p>
<p>This week's launches mark the first time since 2012 that Apple has increased the amount of RAM in any of its base-model Macs, and the upgrade addresses one of our single biggest complaints about the laptops. Not all users will immediately notice the benefits of a 16GB RAM upgrade, but it will definitely make the laptops more versatile and capable of keeping up with users as their needs change.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/theres-no-m4-macbook-air-this-week-but-the-8gb-m2-and-m3-models-are-going-away/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In November, Hyundai will formally unveil its next electric vehicle. It's the new Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV that uses Hyundai Motor Group's highly competent E-GMP platform seen in the Ioniq 5 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/the-2023-hyundai-ioniq-6-a-streamlined-look-equals-serious-range/">6</a>. Ahead of that reveal, the automaker shared some teaser images.</p>
<p>Regular readers will know that Hyundai's various design directions always have interesting names, and like the two smaller Ioniqs, the Ioniq 9 will feature "parametric pixels" in its headlamps—the blocky 8-bit look has been used to good effect on the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6.</p>

<p>E-GMP has already given rise to a big electric three-row SUV. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/2024-kia-ev9-first-drive-a-flawed-but-fine-family-flagship/">Kia's EV9</a> has been on sale for a while now and has just about matched the cheaper EV6 in terms of sales for the last nine months, despite a $54,900 starting price that's more than $12,000 greater than the EV6's. (American car buyers really do want larger cars, and they vote with their wallets.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/10/hyundai-teases-a-three-row-ioniq-9-electric-suv/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple is following the M4 iMac and the redesigned Mac mini updates with one more major refresh this week: a new lineup of M4 MacBook Pros. These updates mostly follow the template set by last year's M3 MacBook Pro refresh: there's a 14-inch $1,599 base model with the standard M4, and then beefed up 14- and 16-inch versions with the M4 Pro and M4 Max processors that also offer more RAM, storage, an optional nano-texture display finish, and other amenities for power users.</p>
<p>All three versions of the M4 MacBook Pro are <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro">available for preorder today</a> and begin arriving November 8, the same date as the new iMac and Mac mini refreshes.</p>
<h2>New chips, same designs</h2>
<p>Even without the M4's improvements, the new $1,599 MacBook Pro addresses the biggest gripe about the original: it upgrades the base model from 8GB to 16GB of RAM without increasing the price. If this was the only change Apple made, it would have been a good upgrade (and the company has taken exactly that approach to updating the M2 and M3 MacBook Airs, which also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/theres-no-m4-macbook-air-this-week-but-the-8gb-m2-and-m3-models-are-going-away/">start with 16GB beginning today</a>). Base storage still starts at 512GB.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apple-refreshes-macbook-pro-lineup-with-m4-chips-introduces-the-m4-max/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Alphabet’s profit jumped 34 percent in the third quarter as the parent company of search giant Google reported strong growth in its cloud business amid robust demand for computing and data services used to train and run generative artificial intelligence models.</p>
<p>The solid results released on Tuesday helped alleviate investors’ fears about the financial returns on the vast sums being spent on AI by Alphabet and other Big Tech peers as they seek to dominate the nascent sector. The standout unit was Google Cloud, where revenue increased 35 percent to $11.4 billion and operating profit increased sevenfold to $1.9 billion from $266 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Net income was $26.3 billion compared with $19.7 billion in the same period a year earlier, exceeding analysts’ expectations for $22.8 billion. Revenue rose 15 percent to $88.3 billion in the three months through to the end of September, beating the average estimate for $86.3 billion.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/ai-cloud-boost-alphabet-profits-by-34-percent/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Blue Origin took another significant step toward the launch of its large New Glenn rocket on Tuesday night by rolling the first stage of the vehicle to a launch site at Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p>
<p>Although the company's rocket factory in Florida is only a few miles from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, because of the rocket and transporter's size, the procession had to follow a more circuitous route. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7257265929099587584/">a post on LinkedIn</a>, Blue Origin's chief executive, Dave Limp, said the route taken by the rocket to the pad is 23 miles long.</p>
<p>Limp also provided some details on GERT, the company's nickname for the "Giant Enormous Rocket Truck" devised to transport the massive New Glenn first stage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/new-glenn-rolls-to-the-launch-pad-as-end-of-year-deadline-approaches/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There’s little doubt that some of the most important pillars of modern cryptography will tumble spectacularly once quantum computing, now in its infancy, matures sufficiently. Some experts say that could be in the next couple decades. Others say it could take longer. No one knows.</p>
<p>The uncertainty leaves a giant vacuum that can be filled with alarmist pronouncements that the world is close to seeing the downfall of cryptography as we know it. The false pronouncements can take on a life of their own as they’re repeated by marketers looking to peddle post-quantum cryptography snake oil and journalists tricked into thinking the findings are real. And a new episode of exaggerated research has been playing out for the past few weeks.</p>
<h2>All aboard the PQC hype train</h2>
<p>The last time the PQC—short for post-quantum cryptography—hype train gained this much traction was in early 2023, when scientists presented findings that claimed, at long last, to put the quantum-enabled cracking of the widely used RSA encryption scheme within reach. The claims were repeated over and over, just as claims about research released in September have for the past three weeks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/the-sad-bizarre-tale-of-hype-fueling-fears-that-modern-cryptography-is-dead/">Read full article</a></p>
