                            <![CDATA[<p>Today, Tesla announced a new variant of the Model Y crossover for North America. Tesla fans have long-awaited a cheaper entry-level model; this was supposed to be the $25,000 Model 2. But the development of that electric vehicle was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-scraps-its-plan-for-a-25000-model-2-ev/">shelved earlier last year</a> as CEO Elon Musk began to lose interest with car-making <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/tesla-has-a-new-master-plan-it-just-doesnt-have-any-specifics/">in favor of humanoid robots</a>.</p>
<p>However, car sales still make up the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/tesla-q2-2025-sell-fewer-cars-and-carbon-credits-make-less-money/">overwhelming majority</a> of Tesla's revenue, and the removal of the IRS clean vehicle tax credit at the end of September may have juiced US EV sales in Q3 2025, but sales are expected to dip significantly in the current quarter.</p>
<p>The new Standard Range Model Y starts at $39,990, with 321 miles (516 km) of range from its rear-wheel drive powertrain, compared to the now-Premium rear-wheel drive Model Y, which has an EPA range of 357 miles (574 km). In the past, Tesla has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/tesla-remotely-extends-the-range-of-some-cars-to-help-with-irma/">software-locked</a> batteries to a smaller configuration; however, here we believe the Standard Range Model Y uses a 69 kWh pack.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/teslas-new-cut-price-evs-a-39990-model-y-and-36990-model-3/">Read full article</a></p>

<h2>Here’s what to know</h2>
<p><strong>You still have access and coverage</strong>: For this year, anyone age 6 months and older will still have access to the shots, and the shots should be fully covered under private insurance plans and federal programs—including Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Vaccines for Children Program, and insurance plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>In fact, for private insurance plans, AHIP—the trade organization that represents major insurers—had already stated that regardless of how this year's messy federal recommendations ended up, private insurance plans would <a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage">maintain their previous coverage</a> with no cost sharing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/after-rfk-jr-s-shenanigans-covid-shot-access-will-be-a-lot-like-last-year/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2025/summary/">has been awarded</a> to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis "for the discovery of macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy quantization in an electrical circuit." The Nobel committee said during a media briefing that the laureates' work provides opportunities to develop "the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors." The three men will split the $1.1 million (11 million Swedish kronor) prize money. The presentation ceremony will take place in Stockholm on December 10, 2025.</p>
<p>"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life," Clarke told reporters by phone during this morning's press conference. "Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me. One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work."</p>
<p>When physicists began delving into the strange new realm of subatomic particles in the early 20th century, they discovered a realm where the old, deterministic laws of classical physics no longer apply. Instead, uncertainty reigns supreme. It is a world governed not by absolutes, but by probabilities, where events that would seem impossible on the macroscale occur on a regular basis.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/2025-nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-for-macroscale-quantum-tunneling/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The letter from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/ted-cruz-picks-a-fight-with-wikipedia-accusing-platform-of-left-wing-bias/">accusing Wikipedia of left-wing bias</a> seems to be based on fundamental misunderstandings of how the platform works, according to a lawyer for the nonprofit foundation that operates the online encyclopedia.</p>
<p>"The foundation is very much taking the approach that Wikipedia is actually pretty great and a lot of what's in this letter is actually misunderstandings," <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/profile/jacob-rogers/?referer=2279">Jacob Rogers</a>, associate general counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, told Ars in an interview. "And so we are more than happy, despite the pressure that comes from these things, to help people better understand how Wikipedia works."</p>
<p>Cruz's letter to Wikimedia Foundation CEO Maryana Iskander expressed concern "about ideological bias on the Wikipedia platform and at the Wikimedia Foundation." Cruz alleged that Wikipedia articles "often reflect a left-wing bias." He asked the foundation for "documents sufficient to show what supervision, oversight, or influence, if any, the Wikimedia Foundation has over the editing community," and "documents sufficient to show how the Wikimedia Foundation addresses political or ideological bias."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/wikipedia-rebuts-ted-cruz-attack-says-cruz-just-doesnt-understand-the-site/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Of the many minor to medium-size annoyances that come with a modern Windows 11 installation, the requirement that you sign in with a Microsoft account is one of the most irritating. Sure, all operating systems (including Apple's and Google's) encourage account sign-in as part of their setup process and prevent you from using multiple operating system features until and unless you sign in.</p>
<p>Various <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/#toc-h0">sanctioned and unsanctioned tools and workarounds</a> existed to allow users to set their PCs up with old-fashioned local accounts, and those workarounds haven't changed much in the last three years. But Microsoft is working on tightening the screws in preview builds of Windows, foreshadowing some future version of Windows where getting around the account requirement is even harder than it already is.</p>
<p>In a new update released to the Dev channel of the Windows Insider Preview program yesterday (build number 26220.6772), Microsoft announced it was "removing known mechanisms for creating a local account in the Windows Setup experience (OOBE)." Microsoft says that these workarounds "inadvertently skip critical setup screens, potentially causing users to exit OOBE with a device that is not fully configured for use."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/microsoft-removes-even-more-microsoft-account-workarounds-from-windows-11-build/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>As generative AI has taken off since ChatGPT's debut, inspiring hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and infrastructure developments, the top question on many people's minds has been: Is generative AI a bubble, and if so, when will it pop?</p>
<p>To help us potentially answer that question, I'll be hosting a live conversation with prominent AI critic Ed Zitron on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1nEph7-Viyc">October 7 at 3:30 pm ET</a> as part of the Ars Live series. As Ars Technica's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/author/benjedwards/">senior AI reporter</a>, I've been tracking both the explosive growth of this industry and the mounting skepticism about its sustainability.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openais-sora-2-lets-users-insert-themselves-into-ai-videos-with-sound/">launched the Sora 2 video generator last week</a>, the company <a href="https://openai.com/index/launching-sora-responsibly/">wrote</a> that it was taking measures to "block depictions of public figures" by default. But creators and viewers of Sora 2 videos are finding that prohibition has a rather large loophole, allowing for videos of public figures that happen to be dead.</p>
<p>Examples of celebrities being posthumously inserted into Sora 2 video creations are not hard to find all over social media these days. <a href="https://x.com/johnsavage_eth/status/1973697473035272326">Tupac Shakur chatting with Malcolm X</a>. <a href="https://x.com/ai_exci/status/1973437829494829246">Bruce Lee running a "dragon energy" DJ set</a>. <a href="https://x.com/fAIkout/status/1973603012846502221">Michael Jackson doing kitchen-based standup comedy</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1nz48t1/im_definitely_falling_for_ai_when_im_older/">Stephen Hawking's wheelchair wiping out on a giant skateboard ramp</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1nvlxlc/mr_rogers_on_jackass_sora_2/">Mister Rogers doing a cameo on <em>Jackass</em></a>. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@abominableburner/video/7557941525850721549">Kurt Cobain stealing KFC chicken fingers</a>. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sorasynth/video/7557981958135991583">Martin Luther King Jr. stuttering through a major speech</a>. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>OpenAI places a moving Sora watermark over each generated video, which limits the risk of viewers being fooled by fake footage of real people. Still, seeing these deceased celebrities used as props by an AI tool can obviously be upsetting to their living relatives and fans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/dj-bruce-lee-and-jackass-mr-rogers-dead-celebrities-become-puppets-in-sora-2-videos/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Smartphone processor and modem maker Qualcomm is acquiring Arduino, the Italian company known mainly for its open source ecosystem of microcontrollers and the software that makes them function.

<p>"Arduino will retain its independent brand, tools, and mission, while continuing to support a wide range of microcontrollers and microprocessors from multiple semiconductor providers as it enters this next chapter within the Qualcomm family," Qualcomm said in its press release. "Following this acquisition, the 33M+ active users in the Arduino community will gain access to Qualcomm Technologies’ powerful technology stack and global reach. Entrepreneurs, businesses, tech professionals, students, educators, and hobbyists will be empowered to rapidly prototype and test new solutions, with a clear path to commercialization supported by Qualcomm Technologies’ advanced technologies and extensive partner ecosystem."</p>
<p>Qualcomm didn't disclose what it would pay to acquire Arduino. The acquisition also needs to be approved by regulators "and other customary closing conditions."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/arduino-retains-its-brand-and-mission-following-acquisition-by-qualcomm/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Changes are coming to the Play Store in spite of a concerted effort from Google to maintain the status quo. The company asked the US Supreme Court to freeze parts of the Play Store antitrust ruling while it pursued an appeal, but the high court has rejected that petition. That means the first elements of the antitrust remedies won by Epic Games will have to be implemented in mere weeks.</p>
<p>The app store case is one of three ongoing antitrust actions against Google, but it's the furthest along of them. Google lost the case in 2023, and in 2024, US District Judge James Donato ordered a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-orders-google-to-distribute-third-party-app-stores-on-google-play/">raft of sweeping changes</a> aimed at breaking Google's illegal monopoly on Android app distribution. In July, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/google-loses-app-store-antitrust-appeal-must-make-sweeping-changes-to-play-store/">lost its initial appeal</a>, leaving it with little time before the mandated changes must begin.</p>
<p>Its petition to the Supreme Court was Google's final Hail Mary to avoid opening the Play Store even a crack. Google asked the justices to pause remedies pending its appeal, but the court has declined to do so, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-supreme-court-allows-order-forcing-google-make-app-store-reforms-2025-10-06/">Reuters reports</a>. Hopefully, Google planned for this eventuality because it must implement the first phase of the remedies by October 22.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/supreme-court-refuses-to-pause-play-store-changes-while-google-appeals-antitrust-case/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>We're generally fans of the new windowed multitasking features in iPadOS 26—for people who want to use their iPads more like traditional laptops, the new system is more powerful, flexible, and predictable than the old Stage Manager, and it works on a wider range of iPads.</p>
<p>But some users on Reddit and elsewhere objected to Apple's wholesale removal of the old multitasking mode, Split View (which allowed two apps onscreen at a time with a handle for adjusting the amount of screen they took up) and Slide Over (which allowed a small window to be swiped over top of your screen and then quickly dismissed when you were done with it).</p>
<p>Split View was reasonably easy to recreate with the new system, but users who had relied on Slide Over bemoaned the lack of an equivalent feature in iPadOS 26. Apple apparently agrees because the second developer beta of the upcoming iPadOS 26.1 adds Slide Over support back into the operating system (as reported by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/06/ipados-26-1-slide-over-multitasking/">MacRumors</a>). Like the old Slide Over window, the new one sits on top of all your other apps and can be invoked and dismissed whenever you want.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/newest-developer-beta-backtracks-on-one-ipados-26-multitasking-decision/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their collective work in the discovery of specialized immune cells that roam the body and keep potentially harmful immune responses in check—preventing them from attacking the body directly (autoimmune responses) or causing harm with overzealous responses to invaders.</p>
<p>Those specialized cells—regulatory T cells—are now well established as playing a key role in peripheral immune tolerance. That is, a non-central process that allows the immune system to strike a delicate balance between being appropriately responsive and aggressive toward intruding germs or foreign dangers while also not running amok.</p>
<p>Before the trio of prize winners came along, researchers thought that such immune tolerance occurred centrally, in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that sits in the center of the chest. There, T cells mature, including into two key types: T helper cells, which go on to trigger immune responses when they recognize foreign dangers; and the aptly named T killer cells, which kill cells, including foreign cells, cancer cells, and cells infected by a virus.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/discovery-of-cells-that-keep-immune-responses-in-check-wins-medicine-nobel-prize/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent a letter to the nonprofit operator of Wikipedia alleging a pattern of liberal bias in articles on the collaborative encyclopedia.</p>
<p>"I write to request information about ideological bias on the Wikipedia platform and at the Wikimedia Foundation," Cruz wrote to Wikimedia Foundation CEO Maryana Iskander in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025.10.03-Letter-to-Wikimedia-Foundation.pdf">letter</a> dated October 3. "Wikipedia began with a noble concept: crowdsource human knowledge using verifiable sources and make it free to the public. That's what makes reports of Wikipedia's systemic bias especially troubling."</p>
<p>Citing research from the conservative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Institute_for_Policy_Research">Manhattan Institute</a>, Cruz wrote that "researchers have found that articles on the site often reflect a left-wing bias." Cruz alleged that "bias is particularly evident in Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources">reliable sources/perennial sources</a> list" because it describes "MSNBC and CNN as 'generally reliable' sources, while listing Fox News as a 'generally unreliable' source for politics and science. The left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center gets a top rating, but the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank, is a 'blacklisted' and 'deprecated' source that Wikipedia's editors have determined 'promotes disinformation.'"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/ted-cruz-picks-a-fight-with-wikipedia-accusing-platform-of-left-wing-bias/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS1YqcewH0c">an OpenAI Dev Days keynote today</a>, CEO Sam Altman announced that the company is launching an SDK preview that will allow developers the ability "to build real apps inside of ChatGPT." Altman said that, starting today, the new SDK will give developers "full stack" control over app data, action triggers, and even interactive user interfaces for apps that can appear inline as part of an existing ChatGPT conversation window.</p>
<p>The SDK is built on <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro">the open source Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP), Altman said. That means developers that already use MCP only need to add an HTML resource to enable ChatGPT integration, he added.</p>
<p>The new integration means a ChatGPT user can directly ask Figma to turn a sketch into a diagram, for instance, and get results integrated into their ChatGPT conversation. It also means that ChatGPT can suggest apps that might be suited to a more general query, like recommending and creating a Spotify playlist when someone asks for song suggestions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openai-wants-to-make-chatgpt-into-a-universal-app-frontend/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>“Illusions are fun, but they are also a gateway to perception,” says Hyeyoung Shin, assistant professor of neuroscience at Seoul National University. Shin is the first author of a new study in Nature Neuroscience that has identified a specific population of neurons in the visual cortex—dubbed IC-encoders—and shows their direct role in representing a visual illusion. The work is the result of a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Allen Institute in Seattle, and Seoul National University.</p>
<h2>What the brain “knows”</h2>
<p>Illusory contours are edges we see even though they aren’t physically there. A classic example is the <a href="https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/kanizsa-triangle">Kanizsa triangle</a>: three “Pac-Man” shapes make us perceive a bright white triangle floating on top. Hide the Pac-Men with your fingers and the trick is revealed: There is no border, just a uniform background. Neurophysiology agrees with perception here: For over 20 years, studies in primates and later imaging in humans and mice have described neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond to real and illusory contours.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Environmental Protection Agency was sued Wednesday over an allegedly politically motivated decision to end a program that Congress intended to help low-income and disadvantaged communities across the US save money on electricity bills through rooftop and community solar programs.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rhode-Island-AFL-CIO-v-EPA-Complaint-10-6-25.pdf">complaint</a>, a group of plaintiffs who would have benefited from the EPA's "Solar for All" program—including a labor union, several businesses, and a homeowner who cannot afford her electricity bills without it—accused the EPA of violating federal law and the Constitution by unlawfully terminating the program.</p>
<p>Solar for All was "expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills during and after the five-year program, providing energy bill relief for more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households," plaintiffs noted. Additionally, it was "expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years and generate 200,000 new jobs."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trumps-epa-sued-for-clawing-back-7b-in-solar-energy-funds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/deloitte-to-refund-government-after-admitting-ai-errors-in-440k-report-20251005-p5n05p">Australian Financial Review reports</a> that Deloitte Australia will offer the Australian government a partial refund for a report that was littered with AI-hallucinated quotes and references to nonexistent research.</p>
<p>Deloitte's "Targeted Compliance Framework Assurance Review" was finalized in July and published by Australia's Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) in August (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250905115547/https://www.dewr.gov.au/download/17099/targeted-compliance-framework-assurance-review-final-report/40749/targeted-compliance-framework-independent-review-final-report/pdf">Internet Archive version of the original</a>). The report, which <a href="https://www.tenders.gov.au/Cn/Show/05c19be8-a95f-4379-bd35-630cc2f472c6">cost Australian taxpayers nearly $440,000 AUD</a> (about $290,000 USD), focuses on the technical framework the government uses to automate penalties under the country's welfare system.</p>
<p>Shortly after the report was published, though, Sydney University Deputy Director of Health Law Chris Rudge noticed citations to multiple papers and publications that did not exist. That included multiple references to nonexistent reports by Lisa Burton Crawford, <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/law/about/our-people/academic-staff/l-crawford.html">a real professor</a> at the University of Sydney law school.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/deloitte-will-refund-australian-government-for-ai-hallucination-filled-report/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Few modern F1 venues are as dazzling as the Marina Bay circuit in Singapore. If you watch the early practice or the young women of F1 Academy in their races, you'll get an idea of the street circuit's relationship to the city in daylight as it takes in landmarks and crosses the water. At night, the brilliant white ribbon of racetrack throws the rest of the surroundings into darkness. Unlike a Le Mans car, there are no headlights in F1.</p>
<p>Just over 1,600 lights are needed for the job, which got underway in mid-June. They're LED now, a switch made in 2023 that cut energy consumption by a noticeable 30 percent. The light itself is even carefully tuned—a color of 5,700 K and a color rendering index of 90 best replicate daylight for the drivers. Oh, and there can't be any flickering that could affect the TV broadcast. The results look spectacular, especially in 4K.</p>
<p>As for the racing this year? Perhaps not so much. Past Singaporean Grands Prix have tended to be action-packed—or even chaotic. In the inaugural 2008 race, Red Bull came away convinced that <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/red-bull-still-puzzled-by-singapore-failure-4423929/4423929/">electromagnetic interference from an underground train line</a> caused the failure of one of its race cars, as well as a sister car belonging to the team we now call Racing Bulls. Other teams <a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2015/09/19/magnetic-field-affects-hybrid-f1-cars-in-singapore/">remained worried</a> about this phenomenon as late as 2015, although no similar failures had been recorded. <a href="https://blog.sgtrains.com/2022/10/mrt-gearbox-interference-singapore-gp/">For the record</a>, Singapore's Land Transit Authority says there was no train track below the relevant corner of the circuit—the nearest train tunnel is more than 600 feet away (200 m) and 32 feet (10 m) below ground level.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/f1-in-singapore-trophy-for-the-hero-of-race/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, AMD <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1260/amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus">announced</a> it will supply AI chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal worth tens of billions of dollars annually that gives the ChatGPT creator an option to acquire up to 10 percent of the chipmaker's stock for 1 cent per share, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-signs-ai-chip-supply-deal-with-openai-gives-it-option-take-10-stake-2025-10-06/">reports</a>. The agreement covers hundreds of thousands of AMD's AI graphics processing units over several years starting in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>The deal marks a major endorsement of AMD's AI hardware and software capabilities as the company competes with Nvidia for dominance in the AI chip market. AMD executives project the agreement will generate more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers who follow OpenAI's lead.</p>
<p>"We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD Executive Vice President Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday. The chipmaker will start booking income from the deal next year when OpenAI starts building a 1 gigawatt facility based on AMD's forthcoming MI450 series chips.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/amd-wins-massive-ai-chip-deal-from-openai-with-stock-sweetener/">Read full article</a></p>
