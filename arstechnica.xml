                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>It's been a month now since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/switch-2-leaks-point-to-controllers-that-work-like-computer-mice/">we first heard rumors</a> that the Switch 2's new Joy-Cons could be slid across a flat surface to function like a computer mouse. Now, a newly published patent filed by Nintendo seems to confirm that use case and describe in some detail how it will work.</p>
<p>The international patent was filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization back in in January of 2023, but <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803">only published on WIPO's web site Thursday</a>. The Japanese-language patent—whose illustrations match what we've seen of Switch 2 Joy-Con precisely—features an English abstract describing "a sensor for mouse operation" which can "detect reflected light from a detected surface, the light changing by moving over the detected surface..." much like any number of optical computer mice. Schematic drawings in the patent show how the light source and light sensor are squeezed inside the Joy-Con, with a built-in lens for directing the light to and from each.</p>
<p>A machine translation of the full text of the patent describes the controller as "a novel input device that can be used as a mouse and other than a mouse." In mouse mode, as described in the patent, the user cradles the outer edge of the controller with their palm and places the inner edge "on, for example, a desk or the like."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2075022">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Sometime during the next several weeks, the directors of federal agencies will receive a draft version of President Trump's budget request for the coming fiscal year, which begins on October 1. This "passback review" is a standard part of the federal budgeting process which ends in Congress writing a budget and the president signing it into law.</p>
<p>The budget request will be the first of President Trump's second term, and it will offer a clear window into the priorities of his new administration. Although widespread cuts are expected for much of the government's discretionary spending, the outlook for the National Science Foundation appears to be especially grim.</p>
<p>During an emotional all-hands meeting on Tuesday, the agency's assistant director for engineering, Susan Margulies, told agency employees to expect between a quarter and a half of its staff to be laid off within the coming months, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/science-funding-agency-threatened-with-mass-layoffs/">E&amp;E News reported</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/white-house-budget-proposal-could-shatter-the-national-science-foundation/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>A little over two weeks ago, a largely unknown China-based company named DeepSeek <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">stunned the AI world</a> with the release of an open source AI chatbot that had simulated reasoning capabilities that were largely on par with those from market leader OpenAI. Within days, the DeepSeek AI assistant app climbed to the top of the iPhone App Store's "Free Apps" category, overtaking ChatGPT.</p>
<p>On Thursday, mobile security company <a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2025/02/06/nowsecure-uncovers-multiple-security-and-privacy-flaws-in-deepseek-ios-mobile-app/">NowSecure reported</a> that the app sends sensitive data over unencrypted channels, making the data readable to anyone who can monitor the traffic. More sophisticated attackers could also tamper with the data while it's in transit. Apple strongly encourages iPhone and iPad developers to enforce encryption of data sent over the wire using ATS (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preventing-insecure-network-connections">App Transport Security</a>). For unknown reasons, that protection is globally disabled in the app, NowSecure said.</p>
<h2>Basic security protections MIA</h2>
<p>What’s more, the data is sent to servers that are controlled by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok. While some of that data is properly encrypted using transport layer security, once it's decrypted on the ByteDance-controlled servers, it can be cross-referenced with user data collected elsewhere to identify specific users and potentially track queries and other usage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/deepseek-ios-app-sends-data-unencrypted-to-bytedance-controlled-servers/">Read full article</a></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Meta admitted to torrenting a controversial large dataset known as LibGen, which includes tens of millions of pirated books. But details around the torrenting were murky until yesterday, when Meta's unredacted emails were made public for the first time. The new evidence showed that Meta torrented "at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries through the site Anna’s Archive, including at least 35.7 terabytes of data from Z-Library and LibGen," the <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-Plaintiffs-Motion-for-Relief-2-5-25.pdf">authors' court filing</a> said. And "Meta also previously torrented 80.6 terabytes of data from LibGen."</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">"The magnitude of Meta’s unlawful torrenting scheme is astonishing," the authors' filing alleged, insisting that "vastly smaller acts of data piracy—just .008 percent of the amount of copyrighted works Meta pirated—have resulted in Judges referring the conduct to the US Attorneys’ office for criminal investigation."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-the-csu-system/">announced</a> plans to introduce <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> to California State University's 460,000 students and 63,000 faculty members across 23 campuses, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-targets-higher-education-us-with-chatgpt-rollout-california-state-2025-02-04/">reports Reuters</a>. The education-focused version of the AI assistant will aim to provide students with personalized tutoring and study guides, while faculty will be able to use it for administrative work.</p>
<p>"It is critical that the entire education ecosystem—institutions, systems, technologists, educators, and governments—work together to ensure that all students have access to AI and gain the skills to use it responsibly," said Leah Belsky, VP and general manager of education at OpenAI, in a statement.</p>
<p>OpenAI began integrating ChatGPT into educational settings in 2023, despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/bots-in-the-classroom-what-chatgpt-means-to-educators/">early concerns</a> from some schools about plagiarism and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/student-was-punished-for-using-ai-then-his-parents-sued-teacher-and-administrators/">potential cheating</a>, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/nyc-schools-block-chatgpt-fearing-negative-impact-on-learning/">early bans</a> in some US school districts and universities.

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>With the closure of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/for-the-first-time-since-1882-uk-will-have-no-coal-fired-power-plants/">last coal-fired power plant</a>, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, on September 30, 2024, the United Kingdom has taken a significant step toward its net-zero goals. It’s no small feat to end the 142-year era of coal-powered electricity in the country that pioneered the Industrial Revolution. Yet the UK's journey away from coal has been remarkably swift, with coal generation plummeting from 40 percent of the electricity mix in 2012 to just two percent in 2019, and finally to zero in 2024.</p>
<p>As of 2023, approximately half of UK electricity generation comes from zero-carbon sources, with natural gas serving as a transitional fuel. The UK aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent to 48 percent by 2027 and achieve net-zero by 2050. The government set a firm target to generate all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2040, emphasizing offshore wind and solar energy as the keys.</p>
<p>What will things look like in the intervening years, which will lead us from today to net-zero? Everyone’s scenario, even when based in serious science, boils down to a guessing game.

              <![CDATA[<p>With the rise of omicron came the fall of long-lasting protection from reinfection with the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08511-9">a study published in Nature</a>.</p>
<p>Using population-wide data from Qatar, researchers found that a COVID-19 infection from a pre-omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (such as alpha or delta) yielded around 80 percent protection from reinfection with another pre-omicron variant—and that level of protection lasted over the course of at least a year. But, things changed in late 2021 with the emergence of omicron, which still reigns supreme today. According to the data, an infection with omicron provided an initial protection of nearly 80 percent between the first three to six months after infection, but that protection rapidly declined. Between nine months and a year, protection fell to around 27.5 percent, then dropped to a negligible 5 percent after a year.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>There have been many studies on the capability of non-human animals to mimic transitive actions—actions that have a purpose. Hardly any studies have shown that animals are also capable of intransitive actions. Even though intransitive actions have no particular purpose, imitating these non-conscious movements is still thought to help with socialization and strengthen bonds for both animals and humans.</p>
<p>Zoologist Esha Haldar and colleagues from the Comparative Cognition Research group worked with blue-throated macaws, which are critically endangered, at the Loro Parque Fundación in Tenerife. They trained the macaws to perform two intransitive actions, then set up a conflict: Two neighboring macaws were asked to do different actions.</p>
<p>What Haldar and her team found was that individual birds were more likely to perform the same intransitive action as a bird next to them, no matter what they’d been asked to do. This could mean that macaws possess mirror neurons, the same neurons that, in humans, fire when we are watching intransitive movements and cause us to imitate them (at least <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2773693/#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20empirical%20basis%20for,rely%20on%20the%20mirror%20system.">if these neurons function</a> the way some think they do).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/parrots-can-imitate-meaningless-behavior-almost-as-well-as-humans/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are <a href="https://gottheimer.house.gov/posts/release-gottheimer-lahood-introduce-new-bipartisan-legislation-to-protect-americans-from-deepseek">now pushing</a> to immediately ban the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek on government devices, citing national security concerns that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may have built a backdoor into DeepSeek to access Americans' sensitive private data. If passed, DeepSeek could be banned within 60 days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DeepSeek shocked the world when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">debuted last month</a>. Rumored to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/">rival OpenAI's o1 reasoning model</a> despite costing significantly less to develop, DeepSeek's open source model is free to download. That propelled its popularity, making DeepSeek the most-downloaded app in the US.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As DeepSeek was rapidly installed on an increasing number of US phones, research emerged yesterday suggesting that DeepSeek is linked to a Chinese telecom company, China Mobile. In an analysis shared <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/information-and-resources-china-telecom-americas-can-no-longer-provide-mobile">with AP News</a>, Ivan Tsarynny, the CEO of Feroot, revealed that DeepSeek apparently hid code that sends user login information to China Mobile.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/us-lawmakers-push-to-quickly-ban-deepseek-on-government-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The detection on December 27 came from one of a network of telescopes managed by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a NASA-funded project to provide warning of asteroids on a collision course with Earth.</p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Genesis Electrified GV70 continues to intrigue me. Together with the internal combustion engine version, it's the closest thing we'll get to a baby Bentley shooting brake, at least without <a href="https://spyscape.com/article/the-sultan-of-bruneis-unbelievable-car-collection">being part of the Brunei royal family</a>. It's a handsome five-door that looks almost station wagon-ish, without actually succumbing to the retail poison that body style has sadly become.</p>
<p>A station wagon G70, called the Shooting Brake, does exist—in Europe, anyway. But neither it nor the four-door sedan G70 are available with a battery electric powertrain. SUVs being popular helped in that regard. The vehicle starts at around the midpoint for a luxury electric SUV at $66,950; the Prestige trim we tried bumps that starting price to $73,750.</p>
<p>Some people reflexively take offense on seeing those three letters, but this Electrified GV70 has been kept away from the growth hormones. It's identical in length to a Ford Mustang Mach-E, but here, we see one downside to the Electrified GV70's use of a common platform—the Genesis loses out to the Ford by four inches when we compare wheelbases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/review-2025-genesis-electrified-gv70-is-charming-but-it-needs-updates/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Bringing the two astronauts back to Earth next month will require some shuffling of spacecraft here on the ground and a delay of the privately operated Axiom-4 mission to the International Space Station to later in the spring.</p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams flew to the station on Boeing's Starliner in June 2024. The plight of "Butch and Suni," as they are often referred to, was a major story in the space community last summer after their Starliner spacecraft experienced significant propulsion issues before docking. NASA ultimately decided the safest course would be for the pair to return home on a SpaceX Dragon vehicle, and launched the Crew-9 mission last September with two empty seats. Thus, Butch and Suni's ride home has been docked to the station since last fall.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-moves-up-target-to-return-butch-and-suni-but-not-for-political-reasons/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For much of the past year, the trail of destruction and mayhem left behind by <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> hackers was on full display. Digital extortion gangs <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/change-healthcare-22-million-payment-ransomware-spike/">paralyzed hundreds of US pharmacies and clinics</a> through their attack on Change Healthcare, exploited security vulnerabilities in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/snowflake-breach-advanced-auto-parts-lendingtree/">customer accounts of cloud provider Snowflake</a> to breach a string of high-profile targets, and extracted a record $75 million from a single victim.</p>
<p>Yet beneath those headlines, the numbers tell a surprising story: Ransomware payments actually fell overall in 2024—and in the second half of the year dropped more precipitously than in any six-month period on record.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis today released a portion of its annual crime report focused on tracking the ransomware industry, which found that ransomware victims’ extortion payments totaled $814 million in 2024, a drop of 35 percent compared to the record $1.25 billion that hackers extracted from ransomware victims the previous year. Breaking down the payments over the course of 2024 shows an even more positive trend: Hackers collected just $321 million from July through December compared to $492 million the previous half year, the biggest falloff in payments between two six-month periods that Chainalysis has ever seen.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/ransomware-payments-declined-in-2024-despite-well-known-massive-hacks/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Cows in Nevada have been infected with a strain of H5N1 bird flu different from the strain detected in all other herds to this point in the ongoing dairy outbreak. It's the same strain that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/as-us-marks-first-h5n1-bird-flu-death-who-and-cdc-say-risk-remains-low/">killed a Louisiana resident</a> in early January and sent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/11/teen-in-critical-condition-with-canadas-first-human-case-of-h5-bird-flu/">a Canadian teenager</a> to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890">intensive care</a> in early November.</p>
<p>The new Nevada dairy infections were first detected through milk testing conducted on January 31, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/aphis-confirms-d11-genotype-dairy-cattle-nevada-0">according to an update Wednesday by the US Department of Agriculture</a>. Whole genome sequencing confirmed the finding of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.1. To this point, all other dairy herds affected by the outbreak have been infected with H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13.</p>
<p>To date, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock">957 herds across 16 states</a> have been infected with H5N1 since the outbreak began last March.

            <![CDATA[As far as DOJ knows, Elon Musk doesn’t have access to Treasury Dept. data.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Late Wednesday, a joint motion was filed with a proposed <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DOGE-Proposed-Order-2-5-25.pdf">order</a>, where the DOJ and plaintiffs suing agreed that the Treasury Department "will not provide access to any payment record or payment system of records maintained by or within the Bureau of the Fiscal Service" to anyone connected with DOGE, except "special government employees" in the Treasury Department, Tom Krause and Marko Elez. Both will only be permitted to have "read only" access as needed to perform DOGE duties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly approved the order Thursday, which was expected. She recommended this compromise in the lawsuit <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DOGE-Treasury-Lawsuit-Motion-for-Temporary-Restraining-Order-2-5-25.pdf">seeking a temporary restraining order</a> to stop Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/musks-doge-clashes-with-treasury-over-access-to-payment-system-report-says/">accessing Americans' sensitive Treasury Department data</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The order allows the two "special government employees" hired by the Treasury to continue accessing payments data to further DOGE's mission of eliminating government waste. But until the lawsuit is settled, DOGE and anyone outside the Treasury Department would be prohibited from reviewing that data directly, ensuring that nobody's government financial data is shared with any third parties without consent or proper notice.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/judge-suggests-temporary-order-blocking-doge-from-treasury-records/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>AMD announced its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, and the numbers were <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial">mostly rosy</a>: $7.7 billion in revenue and a 51 percent profit margin, compared to $6.2 billion and 47 percent <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1180/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial">a year ago</a>. The biggest winner was the data center division, which made $3.9 billion thanks to Epyc server processors and Instinct AI accelerators, and Ryzen CPUs are also selling well, helping the company's client segment earn $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>But if you were looking for a dark spot, you'd find it in the company's gaming division, which earned a relatively small $563 million, down 59 percent from a year ago. AMD's Lisa Su blamed this on both dedicated graphics card sales and sales from the company's "semi-custom" chips (that is, the ones created specifically for game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation).</p>
<p>Other data sources suggest that the response from GPU buyers to AMD's Radeon RX 7000 series, launched between late 2022 and early 2024, has been lackluster. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>, a noisy but broadly useful barometer for GPU market share, shows no RX 7000-series models in the top 50; only two of the GPUs (the 7900 XTX and 7700 XT) are used in enough gaming PCs to be mentioned on the list at all, with the others all getting lumped into the "other" category. Jon Peddie Research <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/discrete-gpu-sales-increase-as-intels-share-drops-to-0">recently estimated</a> that AMD was selling roughly one dedicated GPU for every seven or eight sold by Nvidia.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amd-promises-mainstream-4k-gaming-with-next-gen-gpus-as-current-gen-gpu-sales-tank/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When Google launched its AI Overviews features last year, we noted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">plenty of examples of false, misleading, and even dangerous information</a> that can be contained in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/googles-ai-overviews-misunderstand-why-people-use-google/">the official-looking answers</a> generated by Google's Gemini model. Now, Google has quietly scrubbed one such falsehood from a demo of <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-ai-help-me-write/">its AI writing assistant</a> that featured prominently in an ad planned for Sunday's Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The ad in question is part of <a href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/50-states-50-stories-small-business-ads/">Google's "50 stories from 50 states" promotion</a>, which <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/google-workspace-super-bowl-59-small-businesses-use-ai/">will run Gemini ads tailored for different local markets</a> during the Super Bowl on Sunday. The Wisconsin-focused ad, as it was posted on YouTube last week, featured the owner of Wisconsin Cheese Mart asking Google's writing assistant for "a description of Smoked Gouda that would appeal to cheese lovers."</p>
<p>The AI-authored response <a href="https://x.com/natejhake/status/1885137074673549460">that was shown in that video</a>—and <a href="https://www.wisconsincheesemart.com/products/gouda-cheese-smoked">still appears verbatim on the Wisconsin Cheese Mart website</a>—notes that Gouda is "one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption." That is almost surely an exaggeration; a <a href="https://www.cheesemarketnews.com/guestcolumn/2007/13apr07_2.html">2007 Cheese Market News editorial</a>, for instance, mentions Gouda as only the third-most-popular cheese in the world, after cheddar and mozzarella. A <a href="https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/cheese-market/">Global Cheese Market analyst report</a> also only includes Gouda in the "Other Cheese" category, while mozzarella, Parmesan, and cheddar each get their own categories.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/not-gouda-nough-google-removes-ai-generated-cheese-error-from-super-bowl-ad/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers said they recently discovered a zero-day vulnerability in the 7-Zip archiving utility that was actively exploited as part of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The vulnerability allowed a Russian cybercrime group to override a Windows protection designed to limit the execution of files downloaded from the Internet. The defense is commonly known as MotW, short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Web">Mark of the Web</a>. It works by placing a “Zone.Identifier” tag on all files downloaded from the Internet or from a networked share. This tag, a type of NTFS Alternate Data Stream and in the form of a ZoneID=3, subjects the file to additional scrutiny from Windows Defender SmartScreen and restrictions on how or when it can be executed.</p>
<h2>There’s an archive in my archive</h2>
<p>The 7-Zip vulnerability allowed the Russian cybercrime group to bypass those protections. Exploits worked by embedding an executable file within an archive and then embedding the archive into another archive. While the outer archive carried the MotW tag, the inner one did not. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-0411, was fixed with the release of version 24.09 in late November.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/7-zip-0-day-was-exploited-in-russias-ongoing-invasion-of-ukraine/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Hugging Face researchers <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/open-deep-research">released</a> an open source AI research agent called "Open Deep Research," created by an in-house team as a challenge 24 hours after the launch of OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">Deep Research</a> feature, which can autonomously browse the web and create research reports. The project seeks to match Deep Research's performance while making the technology freely available to developers.</p>
<p>"While powerful LLMs are now freely available in open-source, OpenAI didn’t disclose much about the agentic framework underlying Deep Research," writes Hugging Face on its announcement page. "So we decided to embark on a 24-hour mission to reproduce their results and open-source the needed framework along the way!"</p>
<p>Similar to both OpenAI's Deep Research and Google's implementation of its own "Deep Research" using Gemini (first <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">introduced in December</a>—before OpenAI), Hugging Face's solution adds an "agent" framework to an existing AI model to allow it to perform multi-step tasks, such as collecting information and building the report as it goes along that it presents to the user at the end.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/after-24-hour-hackathon-hugging-faces-ai-research-agent-nearly-matches-openais-solution/">Read full article</a></p>
