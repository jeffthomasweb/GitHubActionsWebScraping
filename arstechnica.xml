              <![CDATA[<p>Raspberry Pi owners have always been prone to coming up with elaborate, technically interesting but practically questionable projects, and Pi enthusiast Jeff Geerling has<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/use-external-gpu-on-raspberry-pi-5-4k-gaming"> an exciting new submission to that canon</a>: connecting an old AMD Radeon RX 460 GPU to the Raspberry Pi 5's PCI Express bus and managing to play demanding titles like <em>Doom 3</em> (2004) and <em>Tux Racer </em>at a crisp 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Geerling's maze of adapters, software tweaks, and workarounds is a testament both to his ingenuity and the flexibility of the Raspberry Pi and its ecosystem. By default, the Pi 5 provides a single PCI Express 2.0 lane for use with external accessories (most commonly M.2 SSDs for storage). Geerling uses an M.2 slot on the Pi and then connects it to an external GPU dock using an M.2-to-Oculink adapter. This gets the GPU connected to the Pi's PCIe bus.</p>
<p>But there were other problems that had to be solved as well. The Pi's PCIe slot can only provide 5 W of power for external accessories, far short of the 75 W that a desktop graphics card would be able to get from a typical PCIe slot in a motherboard. Geerling needed to provide external power to both the GPU and to the slot itself to make sure that the RX 460 could draw all the power it needed to.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/maze-of-adapters-software-patches-gets-a-dedicated-gpu-working-on-a-raspberry-pi/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Helene crossed the Gulf of Mexico at a time when sea surface temperatures were at record highs and then barreled into a region where heavy rains had left the ground saturated. The result was historic, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/were-only-beginning-to-understand-the-historic-nature-of-helenes-flooding/">catastrophic flooding</a>.</p>
<p>One key question is how soon we might expect history to repeat itself. Our rapidly warming planet has tilted the odds in favor of some extreme weather events in a way that means we can expect some events that had been extremely rare to start occurring with some regularity. Our first stab at understanding climate change's influence on Helene was <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-key-driver-of-catastrophic-impacts-of-hurricane-helene-that-devastated-both-coastal-and-inland-communities/">released on Wednesday</a>, and it suggests that rainfall of the sort experienced by the Carolinas may now be a once-in-70-year event, which could have implications for how we rebuild some of the communities shattered by the rain.</p>
<h2>Rapid attribution</h2>
<p>The quick analysis was done by the World Weather Attribution project, which has developed peer-reviewed methods of looking for the fingerprints of climate change in major weather events. In general, this involves identifying the key weather patterns that produced the event and then exploring their frequency using climate models run with and without the carbon dioxide we've added to the atmosphere.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/helenes-carolina-rainfall-made-70-percent-more-likely-by-climate-change/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>If 2022 was the year AI image generators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/please-slow-down-the-7-biggest-ai-stories-of-2022/">went mainstream</a>, 2024 has arguably been the year that AI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/video-synthesis/">video synthesis models</a> exploded in capability. These models, while not yet perfect, can generate new videos from text descriptions called prompts, still images, or existing videos. After OpenAI made waves with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/">Sora</a> in February, two major AI models emerged from China: Kuaishou Technology's <a href="https://kling.kuaishou.com/">Kling</a> and Minimax's video-01.</p>
<p>Both Chinese models have already powered numerous viral AI-generated video projects, accelerating meme culture in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/">weird new ways</a>, including a recent shot-for-shot translation of the <a href="https://x.com/PJaccetturo/status/1843737222031519910"><em>Princess Mononoke</em> trailer</a> using Kling that inspired death threats and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GordonRamsay/comments/1fxazzs/gordon_ramsay_ai/">series of videos</a> created with Minimax's platform. The videos show a synthesized version of TV chef Gordon Ramsay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXh-tLmf7_M">doing ridiculous things</a>.</p>
<div class="twitter-tweet"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After 22 million views and thousands of death threats, I felt like I needed to take this post down for my own mental health. <br>This trailer was an EXPERIMENT to show my 300 friends on X how far we've coming in 16 months.<br>I'm putting it back up to keep the conversation going. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="ð§µ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"> <a href="https://t.co/tFpRPm9BMv">pic.twitter.com/tFpRPm9BMv</a></p>— PJ Ace (@PJaccetturo) <a href="https://twitter.com/PJaccetturo/status/1843737222031519910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>Kling first emerged in June, and it can generate two minutes of 1080p HD video at 30 frames per second with a level of detail and coherency that some think surpasses Sora. It's currently only available to people with a Chinese telephone number, and we have not yet used it ourselves.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Compounding pharmacies are suing the Food and Drug Administration so they can keep making imitation versions of popular—and lucrative—tirzepatide drugs, namely knockoffs of Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss.</p>
<p>Generally, compounding pharmacies make customized formulations of drugs for patients with specific needs, like when a patient has an allergy to a filler ingredient or if a child needs a liquid version of a drug that normally comes as a capsule. But larger compounding operations are also legally allowed to make imitations of branded drugs if those drugs are in short supply, acting as a stopgap for patients.</p>
<p>Tirzepatide has certainly been in short supply in recent years. Given the high prevalence of diabetes and obesity in America and the drug's effectiveness, demand for tirzepatide and other drugs in the new GLP-1 class have skyrocketed, and many patients have struggled to fill prescriptions. The FDA placed tirzepatide on its <a href="https://dps.fda.gov/drugshortages">drug shortage list</a> in December of 2022—and that's where it remained until last week.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/drug-makers-sue-fda-so-they-can-keep-making-knockoff-weight-loss-drugs/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Honda is <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V744-4093.PDF">recalling</a> almost 1.7 million vehicles due to a steering defect. An improperly made part can cause certain cars' steering to become "sticky"—never an attribute one wants in a moving vehicle.</p>
<p>The problem affects a range of newer Hondas and an Acura; the earliest the defective parts were used on any vehicle was February 2021. But it applies to the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>2022–2025 Honda Civic four-door</li>
<li>2025 Honda Civic four-door hybrid</li>
<li>2022–2025 Honda Civic five-door</li>
<li>2025 Honda Civic five-door Hybrid</li>
<li>2023–2025 Honda Civic Type-R</li>
<li>2023–2025 Honda CR-V</li>
<li>2023–2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid</li>
<li>2025 Honda CR-V Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle</li>
<li>2023–2025 Honda HR-V</li>
<li>2023–2025 Acura Integra</li>
<li>2024–2025 Acura Integra Type S</li>
</ul>
<p>Honda says that a combination of environmental heat, moisture, and "an insufficient annealing process and high load single unit break-in during production of the worm wheel" means there's too much pressure and not enough grease between the worm wheel and worm gear. On top of that, the worm gear spring isn't quite right, "resulting in higher friction and increased torque fluctuation when steering.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/sticky-steering-sparks-huge-recall-for-honda-1-7m-cars-affected/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Justice finally <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/US-v-Google-DOJs-Proposed-Remedies-Framework-10-8-24.pdf">proposed</a> sweeping remedies to destroy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">Google's search monopoly </a>late yesterday, and, predictably, Google is not loving any of it.</p>
<p>On top of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/all-the-possible-ways-to-destroy-googles-monopoly-in-search/">predictable asks</a>—like potentially requiring Google to share search data with rivals, restricting distribution agreements with browsers like Firefox and device makers like Apple, and breaking off Chrome or Android—the DOJ proposed remedies to keep Google from blocking competition in "the evolving search industry." And those extra steps threaten Google's stake in the nascent AI search world.</p>
<p>This is only the first step in the remedies stage of litigation, but Google is already showing resistance to both expected and unexpected remedies that the DOJ proposed. In a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-framework/">blog</a> from Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company accused the DOJ of "overreach," suggesting that proposed remedies are "radical" and "go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/googles-ai-deals-could-hurt-its-search-monopoly-appeal-expert-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, Virginia Tech scientists have been looking to the octopus for inspiration to design technologies that can better grip a wide variety of objects in underwater environments. Their latest breakthrough is a special switchable adhesive modeled after the shape of the animal's suckers, according to a new paper published in the journal Advanced Science.</p>
<p>“I am fascinated with how an octopus in one moment can hold something strongly, then release it instantly. It does this underwater, on objects that are rough, curved, and irregular—that is quite a feat,”<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1060480?"> said co-author and research group leader Michael Bartlett</a>. "We’re now closer than ever to replicating the incredible ability of an octopus to grip and manipulate objects with precision, opening up new possibilities for exploration and manipulation of wet or underwater environments.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/octopus-inspired-octaglove-makes-it-easier-to-grip-objects-under-water/">previously reported</a>, there are several examples in nature of efficient ways to latch onto objects in underwater environments, per the authors. Mussels, for instance, secrete adhesive proteins to attach themselves to wet surfaces, while frogs have uniquely structured toe pads that create capillary and hydrodynamic forces for adhesion. But cephalopods like the octopus have an added advantage: The adhesion supplied by their grippers can be quickly and easily reversed, so the creatures can adapt to changing conditions, attaching to wet and dry surfaces.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/octopus-suckers-inspire-new-tech-for-gripping-objects-underwater/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Benchmark may help us understand how quantum computers can operate with low error.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Back in 2019, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/paper-leaks-showing-a-quantum-computer-doing-something-a-supercomputer-cant/">made waves</a> by claiming it had achieved what has been called "quantum supremacy"—the ability of a quantum computer to perform operations that would take a wildly impractical amount of time to simulate on standard computing hardware. That claim proved to be controversial, in that the operations were little more than a benchmark that involved getting the quantum computer to behave like a quantum computer; separately, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/math-may-have-caught-up-with-googles-quantum-supremacy-claims/">improved ideas</a> about how to perform the simulation on a supercomputer cut the time required down significantly.</p>
<p>But Google is back with a new exploration of the benchmark, described in a paper published in Nature on Wednesday. It uses the benchmark to identify what it calls a phase transition in the performance of its quantum processor and uses it to identify conditions where the processor can operate with low noise. Taking advantage of that, they again show that, even giving classical hardware every potential advantage, it would take a supercomputer a dozen years to simulate things.</p>
<h2>Cross entropy benchmarking</h2>
<p>The benchmark in question involves the performance of what are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_random_circuits">quantum random circuits</a>, which involves performing a set of operations on qubits and letting the state of the system evolve over time, so that the output depends heavily on the stochastic nature of measurement outcomes in quantum mechanics. Each qubit will have a probability of producing one of two results, but unless that probability is one, there's no way of knowing which of the results you'll actually get. As a result, the output of the operations will be a string of truly random bits.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Thunderbird's Android app, which is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/email-client-k-9-mail-will-become-thunderbird-for-android/">actually the K-9 Mail project reborn</a>, is almost out. You can check it out a bit early in a beta that will feel pretty robust to most users.</p>
<p>Thunderbird, maintained by the Mozilla Foundation subsidiary MZLA, acquired the source code and naming rights to K-9 Mail, as <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/revealed-thunderbird-on-android-plans-k9/">announced in June 2022</a>. The group also brought K-9 maintainer Christian Ketterer (or "cketti") onto the project. Their initial goals, before a full rebrand into Thunderbird, involved importing Thunderbird's automatic account setup, message filters, and mobile/desktop Thunderbird syncing.</p>
<p>At the tail end of 2023, however, Ketterer wrote on K-9's blog that the punchlist of items before official Thunderbird-dom was <a href="https://k9mail.app/2023/12/28/When-will-Thunderbird-for-Android-be-released">taking longer than expected</a>. But when it's fully released, Thunderbird for Android will have those features. As such, beta testers are asked to <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/09/help-us-test-the-thunderbird-for-android-beta/">check out a specific list of things</a> to see if they work, including automatic setup, folder management, and K-9-to-Thunderbird transfer. The beta will not be "addressing longstanding issues," Thunderbird's blog post notes.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/thunderbird-android-client-is-k-9-mail-reborn-and-its-in-solid-beta/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Brazil's Supreme Court is allowing Elon Musk's X to resume operations, apparently ending a months-long battle after the social network paid over $5 million in fines and reluctantly agreed to suspend accounts accused of spreading disinformation.</p>
<p>The court yesterday issued a <a href="https://noticias.stf.jus.br/postsnoticias/stf-autoriza-o-retorno-imediato-do-x-e-determina-que-anatel-adote-providencias-para-a-retomada-do-servico/">press release</a> announcing the reinstatement, saying that X has complied with all the orders it previously defied. Brazil Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes ordered that the suspension be ended and that telecom agency Anatel take steps to allow the platform's return.</p>
<p>The dispute began in April, when X refused to suspend certain accounts belonging to supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro. X, formerly Twitter, was banned in Brazil for over a month. Internet providers, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/starlink-reluctantly-blocks-x-in-brazil-vows-to-keep-fighting-asset-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Musk's Starlink service,</a> were ordered to block the social network.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/x-reinstated-in-brazil-after-musk-pays-fines-agrees-to-follow-local-laws/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>General Motors is shaking up its electric vehicle strategy once again. Despite bumper EV sales in 2024, the US automaker told investors yesterday that it will stop <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/general-motors-announces-new-battery-platform-claims-100kwh-soon/">branding its batteries under the Ultium name</a>. Perhaps more consequentially, it's also abandoning its one-cell-type-fits-all strategy and will embrace a wider range of cell chemistries and physical formats in forthcoming EVs.</p>
<p>GM debuted the Ultium brand in March 2020 as part of a much-hyped EV plan that was supposed to see 22 new electric models on sale in the US by 2023. The company formed a $2.3 billion joint venture with LG Chem, called Ultium Cells LLC, and decided on a family of common batteries across its brands, using a nickel manganese cobalt aluminum chemistry in a pouch cell format that could be combined in modules for packs as small as 50 kWh or larger than 200 kWh, as found in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/the-hummer-ev-is-an-electric-truck-for-people-who-think-evs-are-stupid/">Hummer</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/chevrolet-shows-off-the-2024-silverado-ev-its-first-electric-pickup/">Silverado</a> EVs.</p>
<p>Most importantly, GM chair and CEO Mary Barra said that Ultium cells would drop below the important $100/kWh barrier "early in the platform's life."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/general-motors-is-ditching-ultium-branding-for-its-ev-batteries/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday evening during a measurement flight, the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center <a href="https://x.com/MichaelRLowry/status/1843840572743921841">dropped</a> the ashes of Peter Dodge, a longtime radar scientist and hurricane hunter, in the eye of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/hurricane-milton-becomes-second-fastest-storm-to-reach-category-5-status/">Hurricane Milton</a>. The drop honored Dodge's 44-year career and his contributions to radar meteorology and tropical cyclone research.</p>
<p>As the powerful and dangerous storm bears down on Florida, the release of Dodge's ashes was an unusually peaceful moment during a type of flight that is <a href="https://x.com/noaa_hurrhunter/status/1843706785401843941?s=43">typically quite turbulent</a>. Michael Lowry, a Hurricane Specialist and Storm Surge Expert at WPLG-TV in Florida, <a href="https://x.com/MichaelRLowry/status/1843840572743921841">celebrated</a> the moment on X, calling it a "beautiful tribute."</p>
<p>Lowry's post included a screenshot of a <a href="https://learningweather.psu.edu/node/66">Vortex Data Message</a>, which is a log of in-flight observations made by hurricane reconnaissance aircraft, detailing the storm's center location, pressure, wind speed, temperature, and other key meteorological data used to assess the intensity and structure of the cyclone. At the end, a tribute line reads, "PETER DODGE HX SCI (1950–2023) 387TH PENNY."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/scientists-ashes-dropped-into-hurricane-miltons-eye-as-final-tribute/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, the Nobel Committee announced that it had awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry to researchers who pioneered major breakthroughs in computational chemistry. These include two researchers at Google's DeepMind in acknowledgment of their role in developing AI software that could take a raw protein sequence and use it to predict the three-dimensional structure the protein would adopt in cells. Separately, the University of Washington's David Baker was honored for developing software that could design entirely new proteins with specific structures.</p>
<p>The award makes for a bit of a theme for this year, as yesterday's Physics prize <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/in-stunning-nobel-win-ai-researchers-hopfield-and-hinton-take-2024-physics-prize/">honored AI developments</a>. In that case, the connection to physics seemed a bit tenuous, but here, there should be little question that the developments solved major problems in biochemistry.</p>
<h2>Understanding protein structure</h2>
<p>DeepMind, represented by Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, had developed AIs that managed to master games as diverse as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/deepmind-ai-needs-mere-4-hours-of-self-training-to-become-a-chess-overlord/">chess</a> and <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/leveling-up-deepminds-alphastar-achieves-grandmaster-level-in-starcraft-ii/">StarCraft</a></em>. But it was always working on more significant problems in parallel, and in 2020, it surprised many people by announcing that it had tackled one of the biggest computational challenges in existence: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/deepmind-ai-handles-protein-folding-which-humbled-previous-software/">the prediction of protein structures</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/protein-structure-and-design-software-gets-the-chemistry-nobel/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Starting a new car company isn't easy—just ask Henrik Fisker, whose <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/fisker-debuts-an-entire-range-of-new-evs-including-one-sub-30000/">second bite</a> at that particular cherry ended the same way as his first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/ev-firm-fisker-files-for-bankruptcy-months-after-it-stopped-making-the-ocean/">when it filed for bankruptcy</a> this July. At the time, Fisker said it wanted to try to "preserve certain customer programs," but Ars wondered what this actually meant, particularly now that electric vehicles are so dependent on software support and cloud connectivity. Now, thanks to <a href="https://www.veritaglobal.net/fisker/document/2411390241007000000000012">a recent court filing</a> spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/08/fisker-bankruptcy-hits-major-speed-bump-as-fleet-sale-is-now-in-question/">TechCrunch</a>, we know the answer: nothing good.</p>
<p>Car publications <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/do-not-buy-a-new-fisker-ocean.html">were already warning consumers</a> to steer clear of the Ocean as early as this March, despite massive price cuts that saw these electric SUVs being offered for less than $25,000. A New York-based company called American Lease was less deterred by this warning and in June agreed to purchase the remaining Fisker inventory—approximately 3,300 cars for a total of $46.3 million dollars. By October, American Lease had paid Fisker $42.5 million and had taken delivery of about 1,100 Oceans.</p>
<p>That was the plan until the end of last week, at least. Last Friday evening, Fisker informed American Lease that the Oceans "cannot, as a technical matter, be 'ported' from the Fisker server to which the vehicles are currently linked to a distinct server owned and/or controlled by" American Lease.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/connected-car-failure-puts-kibosh-on-sale-of-3300-fisker-oceans/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>At the Indiana University <a href="https://osome.iu.edu/">Observatory on Social Media</a>, my colleagues <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=f_kGJwkAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">and I</a> study influence campaigns and design technical solutions—algorithms—<a href="http://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0111-y">to detect</a> and counter them. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v15i1.18075">State-of-the-art methods</a> developed in our center use several indicators of this type of online activity, which researchers call inauthentic coordinated behavior. We identify clusters of social media accounts that post in a synchronized fashion, amplify the same groups of users, share identical sets of links, images or hashtags, or perform <a href="http://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00410-9">suspiciously similar sequences of actions</a>.</p>
<p>We have uncovered many examples of coordinated inauthentic behavior. For example, we found accounts that flood the network with tens or hundreds of thousands of posts in a single day. The same campaign can post a message with one account and then have other accounts that its organizers also control “like” and “unlike” it hundreds of times in a short time span. Once the campaign achieves its objective, all these messages can be <a href="http://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v16i1.19355">deleted to evade detection</a>. Using these tricks, foreign governments and their agents can manipulate social media algorithms that determine what is trending and what is engaging to decide what users see in their feeds.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/how-foreign-influence-campaigns-manipulate-your-social-media-feeds/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have unearthed two sophisticated toolsets that a nation-state hacking group—possibly from Russia—used to steal sensitive data stored on air-gapped devices, meaning those that are deliberately isolated from the Internet or other networks to safeguard them from malware.</p>
<p>One of the custom tool collections was used starting in 2019 against a South Asian embassy in Belarus. A largely different toolset created by the same threat group infected a European Union government organization three years later. Researchers from ESET, the security firm that <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/mind-air-gap-goldenjackal-gooses-government-guardrails/">discovered the toolkits</a>, said some of the components in both were identical to those fellow security firm Kaspersky described in research published <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/">last year</a> and attributed to an unknown group, tracked as GoldenJackal, working for a nation-state. Based on the overlap, ESET has concluded that the same group is behind all the attacks observed by both firms.</p>
<h2>Quite unusual</h2>
<p>The practice of air gapping is typically reserved for the most sensitive networks or devices connected to them, such as those used in systems for voting, industrial control, manufacturing, and power generation. A host of malware used in espionage hacking over the past 15 years (for instance, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/">here</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/researchers-crack-open-unusually-advanced-malware-that-hid-for-5-years/">here</a>) demonstrate that air gapping isn’t a foolproof protection. It nonetheless forces threat groups to expend significant resources that are likely obtainable only by nation-states with superior technical acumen and unlimited budgets. ESET’s discovery puts GoldenJackal in a highly exclusive collection of threat groups.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/two-never-before-seen-tools-from-same-group-infect-air-gapped-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I really hate to be the bearer of such bad news, but you and I will not live forever, dear reader.</p>
<p>We may hope to draw breath for a few decades yet, perhaps. But that's not long enough to descry any worlds circling other stars in a meaningful way. Those mysterious orbs are too distant, both in space and time; the vastness of this galaxy is too great, the beat of a human life too short against the slow rhythm of cosmic time. We space enjoyers must therefore be content with what lies in our backyard.</p>
<p>If you are of a certain age, say half a century old or less, you may feel as though you missed the golden age of space exploration, when humanity first walked into that backyard. The Baby Boomers, who were born in time to not only see what the lunar surface looked like but to watch humans walk upon it in real time, were truly lucky.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/were-finally-going-to-the-solar-systems-most-intriguing-but-unexplored-frontier/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>X (formerly Twitter) claims that non-consensual nudity is not tolerated on its platform. But a recent <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12138">study</a> shows that X is more likely to quickly remove this harmful content—sometimes known as revenge porn or non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)—if victims flag content through a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown rather than using X's mechanism for reporting NCII.</p>
<p>In the pre-print study, which 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/twitter-acts-fast-on-nonconsensual-nudity-if-it-thinks-its-a-copyright-violation/">noted</a> has not been peer-reviewed, University of Michigan researchers explained that they put X's non-consensual nudity policy to the test to show how challenging it is for victims to remove NCII online.</p>
<p>To conduct the experiment, the researchers created two sets of X accounts to post and report AI-generated NCII "depicting white women appearing to be in their mid-20s to mid-30s" as "nude from the waist up, including her face." (White women were selected to "minimize potential confounds from biased treatment," and future research was recommended on other genders and ethnicities.) Out of 50 fake AI nude images that researchers posted on X, half were reported as violating X's non-consensual nudity policy, and the other half used X's DMCA takedown mechanism.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/study-fastest-way-to-get-revenge-porn-off-x-is-a-dmca-takedown/">Read full article</a></p>
