<p>NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov lifted off Saturday from Florida's Space Coast aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, heading for a five-month expedition on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The two-man crew launched on top of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket at 1:17 pm EDT (17:17 UTC), taking advantage of a break in stormy weather to begin their climb to space. Nine kerosene-fueled Merlin engines powered the first stage of the flight on a trajectory northeast from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, then the booster detached and returned to landing at Cape Canaveral as the Falcon 9's upper stage accelerated SpaceX's Crew Dragon <em>Freedom </em>spacecraft into orbit.</p>
<p>"It was a sweet ride," Hague said after arriving in space. With a seemingly flawless launch, Hague and Gorbunov are on track to arrive at the space station around 5:30 pm EDT (2130 UTC) Sunday.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053288#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053288&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an earlier <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/is-it-time-for-gdpr-2-0/">article</a>, I discussed a few of the flaws in Europe’s flagship data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Building on that critique, I would now like to go further, proposing specifications for developing a robust privacy protection regime in the US.</p>
<p>Writers must overcome several hurdles to have a chance at persuading readers about possible flaws in the GDPR. First, some readers are skeptical of any piece criticizing the GDPR because they believe the law is still too young to evaluate. Second, some are suspicious of any piece criticizing the GDPR because they suspect that the authors might be covert supporters of Big Tech’s anti-GDPR agenda. (I can assure readers that I am not, nor have I ever, worked to support any agenda of Big Tech companies.)</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053275#p3">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053275&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Four years after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors and researchers are still seeking ways to help patients with long COVID, the persistent and often debilitating symptoms that can continue long after a <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a> infection.</p>
<p>In adults, the most common long COVID symptoms include fatigue and brain fog, but for children the condition can look different. A study published last month <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-funded-study-finds-long-covid-affects-adolescents-differently-younger-children">suggests</a> preteens are more likely to experience symptoms such as headaches, stomach pain, trouble sleeping, and attention difficulties. Even among children, effects seem to vary by age. “There seems to be some differences between age groups, with less signs of organ damage in younger children and more adultlike disease in adolescents,” says Petter Brodin, professor of pediatric immunology at Imperial College London.</p>
<p>While vast sums have been devoted to long COVID research—the US National Institutes of Health have spent <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/04/20/long-covid-nih-billion/">more than a billion dollars</a> on research projects and clinical trials—research into children with the condition has been <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00394-8/fulltext">predominantly limited</a> to online surveys, calls with parents, and studies of electronic health records. This is in spite of <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/153/3/e2023062570/196606/Postacute-Sequelae-of-SARS-CoV-2-in-Children?autologincheck=redirected">a recent study</a> suggesting that between 10 and 20 percent of children may have developed long COVID following an acute infection, and another report finding that while many have recovered, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00394-8/fulltext">some still remain ill</a> three years later.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053121#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053121&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>For the past few years, Apple has been making big-budget movies meant to compete with the best traditional Hollywood studios have to offer, and it has been releasing them in theaters to drive ticket sales and awards buzz.</p>
<p>Much of that is about to change, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-27/apple-movies-won-t-be-coming-to-theaters-anytime-soon">report</a> from Bloomberg. The article claims that Apple is "rethinking its movie strategy" after several box office misfires, like <em>Argylle</em> and <em>Napoleon</em>.</p>
<p>It has already canceled the wide theatrical release of one of its tent pole movies, the George Clooney and Brad Pitt-led <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJUPjiRbAM">Wolfs</a></em>. Most other upcoming big-budget movies from Apple will be released in just a few theaters, suggesting the plan is simple to ensure continued awards eligibility but not to put butts in seats.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053273#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053273&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>iFixit has published teardown views for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, along with their larger cousins, the Plus and Pro Max.</p>
<p>The videos are really marketing for iFixit's various repair kits and other tools and products that you can buy—and sometimes these videos now have lengthy plugs for some new product or another—but nonetheless, the videos almost always include interesting insights about devices' components.</p>
<p>Tearing down the iPhone 16, iFixit confirmed one thing we already suspected: One of the mmWave antennas was removed and replaced in that same spot by the Camera Control button. It also found that the camera systems in the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max are almost interchangeable, but sadly aren't because of the placement of a single screw and the length of a single cable. Too bad.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053264#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053264&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>It's been a wildly busy week in AI news thanks to OpenAI, including a controversial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/ai-superintelligence-looms-in-sam-altmans-new-essay-on-the-intelligence-age/">blog post</a> from CEO Sam Altman, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">wide rollout</a> of Advanced Voice Mode, 5GW <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/">data center rumors</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-murati-shocks-with-sudden-departure-announcement/">major staff</a> shake-ups, and dramatic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openai-plans-tectonic-shift-from-nonprofit-to-for-profit-giving-altman-equity/">restructuring plans</a>.</p>
<p>But the rest of the AI world doesn't march to the same beat, doing its own thing and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/ai-hosting-platform-surpasses-1-million-models-for-the-first-time/">churning out</a> new AI models and research by the minute. Here's a roundup of some other notable AI news from the past week.</p>
<h2>Google Gemini updates</h2>

<p>On Tuesday, Google <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/updated-gemini-models-reduced-15-pro-pricing-increased-rate-limits-and-more/">announced</a> updates to its Gemini model lineup, including the release of two new production-ready models that iterate on past releases: Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 and Gemini-1.5-Flash-002. The company reported improvements in overall quality, with notable gains in math, long context handling, and vision tasks. Google claims a 7 percent increase in performance on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01574">MMLU-Pro</a> benchmark and a 20 percent improvement in math-related tasks. But as you know, if you've been reading Ars Technica for a while, AI typically benchmarks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/the-ai-wars-heat-up-with-claude-3-claimed-to-have-near-human-abilities/">aren't as useful</a> as we would like them to be.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052711#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052711&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The intense electromagnetic environment near a black hole can accelerate particles to a large fraction of the speed of light and sends the speeding particles along jets that extend from each of the object's poles. In the case of the supermassive black holes found in the center of galaxies, these jets are truly colossal, blasting material not just out of the galaxy, but possibly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/researchers-spot-largest-black-hole-jets-ever-discovered/">out of the galaxy's entire neighborhood</a>.</p>
<p>But this week, scientists have described how the jets may be doing some strange things inside of a galaxy, as well. A study of the galaxy M87 showed that nova explosions appear to be occurring at an unusual high frequency in the neighborhood of one of the jets from the galaxy's central black hole. But there's absolutely no mechanism to explain why this might happen, and there's no sign that it's happening at the jet that's traveling in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Whether this effect is real, and whether we can come up with an explanation for it, may take some further observations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053245#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053245&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More than a month after a person in Missouri mysteriously fell ill with H5-type bird flu, investigators in the state are still identifying people who became ill after contact with the patient, raising questions about the diligence of the ongoing health investigation.</p>
<p>On September 6, Missouri's health department reported the state's first human case of H5-type bird flu, one that appears closely related to the H5N1 bird flu currently causing a nationwide outbreak among dairy cows. But the infected person had no known contact with infected animals—unlike all of the other 13 human cases identified amid the dairy outbreak this year. Those previous cases have all occurred in dairy- or poultry-farm workers. In fact, Missouri has not reported bird flu in its dairy herds nor recent poultry outbreaks.</p>
<p>Given the unexplained source of infection, health investigators in the state have been working to track the virus both backward in time—to try to identify the source—and forward—to identify any potential onward spread. The bird flu patient was initially hospitalized on August 22 but recovered and had been released by the time the state publicly reported the case.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053207#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053207&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Valve Corporation, tired of paying arbitration fees, has removed a mandatory arbitration clause from Steam's subscriber agreement. Valve told gamers in yesterday's update that they must sue the company in order to resolve disputes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement">subscriber agreement</a> includes "changes to how disputes and claims between you and Valve are resolved," Steam wrote in an email to users. "The updated dispute resolution provisions are in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#10">Section 10</a> and require all claims and disputes to proceed in court and not in arbitration. We've also removed the class action waiver and cost and fee-shifting provisions."</p>
<p>The Steam agreement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240807021027/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/#10">previously said</a> that "you and Valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration." Now, it says that any claims "shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053196#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053196&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google wound down its defense in the US Department of Justice's ad tech monopoly trial this week, following a week of testimony from witnesses that experts said seemed to lack credibility.</p>
<p>The tech giant started its defense by showing a widely mocked chart that Google executive Scott Sheffer called a "spaghetti football," supposedly showing a fluid industry thriving thanks to Google's ad tech platform but mostly just "confusing" everyone and possibly even helping to debunk its case, Open Markets Institute policy analyst Karina Montoya <a href="https://www.journalismliberty.org/publications/google-defense-spaghetti-football">reported</a>.</p>

<p>"The effect of this image might have backfired as it also made it evident that Google is ubiquitous in digital advertising," Montoya reported. "During DOJ’s cross-examination, the spaghetti football was untangled to show only the ad tech products used specifically by publishers and advertisers on the open web."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053142#p3">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053142&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our feline overlords aren't particularly known for obeying commands from mere humans, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/yes-some-cats-like-to-play-fetch-its-science/">can make</a> it difficult <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/yes-some-cats-like-to-play-fetch-its-science/">to study</a> their behaviors in controlled laboratory settings. So a certain degree of ingenuity is required to get usable results—like crocheting adorable little hats for kitties taking part in <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/electroencephalogram-eeg">electroencephalogram</a> (EEG) experiments. That's what researchers at the University of Montreal in Quebec, Canada, did to learn more about assessing chronic pain in cats—and they succeeded. According to their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027024001997?via%3Dihub">recent paper</a> published in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods, it's the first time scientists have recorded the electrical activity in the brains of conscious cats.</p>
<p>According to the authors, one-quarter of adult cats suffer from osteoarthritis and chronic pain that worsens with age. There are currently limited treatment options, namely, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can have significant side effects for the cats. An injectable monoclonal antibody tailored for cats has recently been developed to neutralize excessive nerve growth factor, but other alternative treatment options like supplements and regenerative medicine have yet to be tested. Nor has the effectiveness of certain smells or lighting in altering pain perception in felines been tested.</p>
<p>That was the Montreal team's primary objective for their experiments. Initially, they tried to place electrodes on the heads of 11 awake adult cats with osteoarthritis, but the cats kept shaking off the electrodes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052375#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052375&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Officials in Ireland have fined Meta $101 million for storing hundreds of millions of user passwords in plaintext and making them broadly available to company employees.</p>
<p>Meta <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/facebook-developers-wrote-apps-that-stored-users-passwords-in-plaintext/">disclosed the lapse</a> in early 2019. The company said that apps for connecting to various Meta-owned social networks had logged user passwords in plaintext and stored them in a database that had been searched by roughly 2,000 company engineers, who collectively queried the stash more than 9 million times.</p>
<h2>Meta investigated for five years</h2>
<p>Meta officials said at the time that the error was found during a routine security review of the company’s internal network data storage practices. They went on to say that they uncovered no evidence that anyone internally improperly accessed the passcodes or that the passcodes were ever accessible to people outside the company.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053118#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053118&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Most members of Dell’s sales team will no longer have the option to work remotely, starting on Monday, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/dell-asks-global-sales-team-work-five-days-week-office-memo-says-2024-09-26/">Reuters</a> reported this week, citing an internal memo. The policy applies to salespeople worldwide and is aimed at helping “grow skills,” per the note.</p>
<p>Like the rest of Dell's workforce, Dell's salespeople have previously been allowed to work remotely two days per week. A memo, which a Reddit user claims to have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1fq5nu4/dell_is_now_100_rto_at_least_sales_and_sales/">posted online</a> (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/26/dell_sales_staff_full_rto/">The Register</a> reported that the post “mirrors” one that it viewed separately), says that field sellers aren’t required to go into an office but “should prioritize time spent in person with customers and partners.” The policy doesn’t apply to “remote sales team members,” but Dell said to expect additional unspecified communications regarding remote workers “in the coming weeks.” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-26/dell-dell-orders-salespeople-back-to-offices-5-days-a-week">Bloomberg</a> reported that top sales executives Bill Scannell, Dell’s president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, president of sales and global regions at Dell Tech Select, signed the memo, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>… our data showed that sales teams are more productive when onsite.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dell is viewing mandatory on-site work as a way to maintain its sales team’s culture and drive growth, according to the memo, which mentions things like “real-time feedback” and “dynamic" office energy. Moving forward, remote work will be permitted as an exception, Dell said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053090#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053090&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Anyone who has been surfing the web for a while is probably used to clicking through a CAPTCHA grid of street images, identifying everyday objects to prove that they're a human and not an automated bot. Now, though, new research claims that locally run bots using specially trained image-recognition models can match human-level performance in this style of CAPTCHA, achieving a 100 percent success rate despite being decidedly not human.</p>
<p>ETH Zurich PhD student Andreas Plesner and his colleagues' new research, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08831">available as a pre-print paper</a>, focuses on Google's ReCAPTCHA v2, which challenges users to identify which street images in a grid contain items like bicycles, crosswalks, mountains, stairs, or traffic lights. Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/googles-recaptcha-announces-invisible-background-captchas/">began phasing that system out years ago</a> in favor of an "invisible" reCAPTCHA v3 that analyzes user interactions rather than offering an explicit challenge.</p>
<p>Despite this, the older reCAPTCHA v2 is <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/reCAPTCHA-v2">still used by millions of websites</a>. And even sites that use the updated reCAPTCHA v3 will sometimes <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54215482/combining-recaptcha-v2-and-v3/63344009#63344009">use reCAPTCHA v2 as a fallback</a> when the updated system gives a user a low "human" confidence rating.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053063#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053063&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

On Thursday, a software architect named AJ Smith <a href="https://x.com/aj_dev_smith/status/1839472954289131947">tweeted a video</a> of himself playing a duet of The Beatles' 1966 song "Eleanor Rigby" with AVM. In the video, Smith plays the guitar and sings, with the AI voice interjecting and singing along sporadically, praising his rendition.</p>

<p>"Honestly, it was mind-blowing. The first time I did it, I wasn’t recording and literally got chills," Smith told Ars Technica via text message. "I wasn’t even asking it to sing along."</p>
<p>Smith is no stranger to AI topics. In his day job, he works as associate director of AI Engineering at S&amp;P Global. "I use [AI] all the time and lead a team that uses AI day to day," he told us.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052995#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052995&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft is having another whack at its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-new-recall-feature-will-record-everything-you-do-on-your-pc/">controversial Recall feature</a> for Copilot+ Windows PCs, after the original version crashed and burned amid scrutiny from security researchers and testers over the summer. The former version of Recall recorded screenshots and OCR text of all user activity, and stored it unencrypted on disk where it could easily be accessed by another user on the PC or an attacker with remote access.</p>

<p>The feature was announced in late May, without having gone through any of the public Windows Insider testing that most new Windows features get, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/microsoft-makes-recall-feature-off-by-default-after-security-and-privacy-backlash/">was scheduled</a> to ship on new PCs by June 18; by June 13, the company had delayed it indefinitely to rearchitect it and said that it would be tested through the normal channels before it was rolled out to the public.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft shared more extensive details on exactly how the security of Recall has been re-architected in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=179096">a post</a> by Microsoft VP of Enterprise and OS Security David Weston.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052960#p3">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052960&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Tesla's German car factory on the outskirts of Berlin allegedly operates under a "culture of fear," and its workers take sick leave at more than three times the industry average. The plant, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/teslas-berlin-factory-shuts-down-after-suspected-transformer-arson/">which was targeted by arsonists</a> earlier this year, is now experiencing a degree of discord between workers and management, according to reports in <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-gruenheide-chefs-kontrollieren-krank-gemeldete-mitarbeiter/100072340.html">Handelsblatt</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/27/tesla-home-checks-on-workers-on-sick-leave-defended-by-boss-in-germany">Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>"We will not tolerate some people bending their backs for others who just don’t feel like coming to work. There is no room in this factory for people who don't get out of bed in the morning," said André Thierig, manufacturing director of Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg.</p>
<p>It seems the company has been taking that directive seriously. Frustrated by a rate of sick leave that reached as high as 17 percent this summer—compared to a German auto industry average of 5.2 percent—Tesla started checking up on some employees at home, sending managers to visit 30 employees while they were on sick leave.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053047#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053047&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>New York City mayor Eric Adams was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-mayor-eric-adams-fbi-investigation-0349a188b77baf822748fedf18b7ea4f">stopped on the street by the FBI</a> after an event in November 2023. Agents had a warrant for his electronic devices, which they seized. At the time, Adams made clear that he had nothing to hide, saying in a statement, "As a former member of law enforcement, I expect all members of my staff to follow the law and fully cooperate with any sort of investigation—and I will continue to do exactly that."</p>
<p>Thanks to this week's <a href="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2024/09/eric-adams-indictment-unsealed.pdf">federal indictment</a> (PDF) of Adams—the first for a sitting NYC mayor, and one that alleges bribery from Turkish sources—we now have the same story from the government's perspective. It sounds quite a bit different.</p>
<p>According to the feds, agents seized not one but two cell phones from Adams on November 6, 2023—but neither of these was Adams' "personal" phone, which he was not carrying. It was the personal phone that Adams allegedly used "to communicate about the conduct described in this indictment."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053030#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053030&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As we described earlier this year, operating a quantum computer will require a significant investment in classical computing resources, given the amount of measurements and control operations that need to be executed and interpreted. That means that operating a quantum computer will also require a software stack to control and interpret the flow of information from the quantum side.</p>
<p>But software also gets involved well before anything gets executed. While it's possible to execute algorithms on quantum hardware by defining the full set of commands sent to the hardware, most users are going to want to focus on algorithm development, rather than the details of controlling any single piece of quantum hardware. "If everyone's got to get down and know what the noise is, [use] performance management tools, they've got to know how to compile a quantum circuit through hardware, you've got to become an expert in too much to be able to do the algorithm discovery," said IBM's Jay Gambetta. So, part of the software stack that companies are developing to control their quantum hardware includes software that converts abstract representations of quantum algorithms into the series of commands needed to execute them.</p>
<p>IBM's version of this software <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit">is called Qiskit</a> (although it was made open source and has since been adopted by other companies). Recently, IBM made a couple of announcements regarding Qiskit, both benchmarking it in comparison to other software stacks and opening it up to third-party modules. We'll take a look at what software stacks do before getting into the details of what's new.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053018#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053018&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
