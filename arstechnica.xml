                            <![CDATA[<p>Physicists with the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration have detected the gravitational wave signal (dubbed GW231123) of the most massive merger between two black holes yet observed, resulting in a new black hole that is 225 times more massive than our Sun. The results were presented at the <a href="https://www.iop.org/events/24th-international-conference-general-relativity-and-gravitation-16th-edoardo-amaldi">Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves</a> in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
<p>The LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration searches the universe for gravitational waves produced by the mergers of black holes and neutron stars. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/danish-physicists-claim-to-cast-doubt-on-detection-of-gravitational-waves/">LIGO detects</a> gravitational waves via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/10/ligos-gravitational-wave-detection-takes-home-a-nobel/">laser interferometry</a>, using high-powered lasers to measure tiny changes in the distance between two objects positioned kilometers apart. LIGO has detectors in Hanford, Washington, and in Livingston, Louisiana. A third detector in Italy, Advanced Virgo, came online in 2016. In Japan, KAGRA is the first gravitational-wave detector in Asia and the first to be built underground. Construction began on LIGO-India in 2021, and physicists expect it will turn on sometime after 2025.</p>
<p>To date, the collaboration has detected dozens of merger events since its first <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-2017-nobel-prize">Nobel Prize-winning discovery</a>. Early detected mergers involved either two black holes or two neutron stars.  In 2021, LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA confirmed the detection of two separate "mixed" mergers between black holes and neutron stars.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/physicists-detected-the-most-massive-black-hole-merger-to-date/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Reddit said that users "shouldn't need to share personal information to participate in meaningful discussions," but that it will comply with the law by verifying age in a way that protects users' privacy. "Using Reddit has never required disclosing your real world identity, and these updates don't change that," Reddit said.</p>
<p>Reddit said it contracted with the company <a href="https://withpersona.com/">Persona</a>, which "performs the verification on either an uploaded selfie or a photo of your government ID. <strong>Reddit will not have access to the uploaded photo</strong>, and Reddit will <strong>only</strong> store your verification status along with the birthdate you provided so you won't have to re-enter it each time you try to access restricted content."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/reddit-starts-verifying-ages-of-uk-users-to-comply-with-child-safety-law/">Read full article</a></p>

However, <a href="https://metr.org/Early_2025_AI_Experienced_OS_Devs_Study.pdf">a new randomized controlled trial</a> has found that experienced open source coders became less efficient at coding-related tasks when they used current AI tools.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">their study</a>, researchers at <a href="https://metr.org/about">METR</a> (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) recruited 16 software developers, each with multiple years of experience working on specific open source repositories. The study followed these developers across 246 individual "tasks" involved with maintaining those repos, such as "bug fixes, features, and refactors that would normally be part of their regular work." For half of those tasks, the developers used AI tools like <a href="https://cursor.com/en/pricing">Cursor Pro</a> or Anthropic's Claude; for the others, the programmers were instructed not to use AI assistance. Expected time forecasts for each task (made before the groupings were assigned) were used as a proxy to balance out the overall difficulty of the tasks in each experimental group, and the time needed to fix pull requests based on reviewer feedback was included in the overall assessment.</p>

      Experts and the developers themselves expected time savings that didn't materialize when AI tools were actually used.

<p>Before performing the study, the developers in question expected the AI tools would lead to a 24 percent reduction in the time needed for their assigned tasks. Even after completing those tasks, the developers believed that the AI tools had made them 20 percent faster, on average. In reality, though, the AI-aided tasks ended up being completed 19 percent <em>slower</em> than those completed without AI tools.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/study-finds-ai-tools-made-open-source-software-developers-19-percent-slower/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Nvidia is recommending a mitigation for customers of one of its GPU product lines that will degrade performance by up to 10 percent in a bid to protect users from exploits that could let hackers sabotage work projects and possibly cause other compromises.</p>
<p>The move comes in response to an attack a team of academic researchers demonstrated against Nvidia’s RTX A6000, a widely used GPU for high-performance computing that’s available from many cloud services. A vulnerability the researchers discovered opens the GPU to Rowhammer, a class of attack that exploits physical weakness in DRAM chip modules that store data.</p>
<p>Rowhammer allows hackers to change or corrupt data stored in memory by rapidly and repeatedly accessing—or hammering—a physical row of memory cells. By repeatedly hammering carefully chosen rows, the attack induces bit flips in nearby rows, meaning a digital zero is converted to a one or vice versa. Until now, Rowhammer attacks have been demonstrated only against memory chips for CPUs, used for general computing tasks.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/nvidia-chips-become-the-first-gpus-to-fall-to-rowhammer-bit-flip-attacks/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A Utah-based plastic surgeon appears to be off the hook for federal charges over an alleged <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/plastic-surgeon-accused-of-giving-391-fake-covid-shots-to-kids-in-125k-fraud-scheme/">COVID-19 vaccine fraud scheme</a>, in which he and three of his associates were accused of providing fraudulent COVID-19 vaccination cards at $50 a pop while squirting the corresponding vaccines down the drain—wasting roughly $28,000 worth of federally provided, lifesaving vaccines. In cases where parents brought in children for fake immunizations, the group would allegedly inject saline solutions at the parents' request to make the children believe they had received vaccinations.</p>
<p>In total, the group was accused of wasting 1,937 COVID-19 vaccine doses between October 2021 and September 2022, including 391 pediatric doses, and creating fraudulent immunization records for them. The alleged scheme netted them nearly $97,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.137139/gov.uscourts.utd.137139.1.0.pdf">The charges</a> were filed in January 2023 under the Biden administration after two separate undercover agents went through the scheme to get a fake vaccination card. The plastic surgeon, Michael Kirk Moore Jr., who owns and operates Plastic Surgery Institute of Utah in Midvale, south of Salt Lake City, as well as the business' office manager, Kari Dee Burgoyne, its receptionist, Sandra Flores, and Moore's neighbor, Kristin Jackson Andersen, were charged in the case. All four people faced charges of conspiracy to defraud the federal government, along with two counts related to improper disposal of government property.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/bondi-drops-case-on-doc-accused-of-giving-kids-saline-shots-instead-of-vaccines/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft’s advertised end-of-support date for Windows 10 is October 14, 2025. But in reality, the company <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">will gradually wind down support for the enduring popular operating system over the next three years.

<p>Those competing goals have led to lots of announcements and re-announcements and clarifications about updates for both Windows 10 itself and the Office/Microsoft 365 productivity apps that many Windows users run on their PCs.</p>
<p>Today’s addition to the pile <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/706586/microsoft-365-office-app-features-windows-10-end-of-life-2026">comes via The Verge</a>, which noticed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/windows-10-support?source=recommendations">an update to a support document</a> that outlined when Windows 10 PCs would stop receiving new features for the continuously updated Microsoft 365 apps.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Android and Chrome OS have been developed in parallel for years, but Google is planning to streamline its operating systems. In a recent interview, Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat stated bluntly that Android and Chrome OS are merging. This shift, a long time in the making, could give Google more room to maneuver as it plans for new mobile computing experiences.</p>
<p>In the interview, TechRadar's Lance Ulanoff had other things on his mind, but Samat peppered him with questions about how he uses his Apple devices. "I asked because we’re going to be combining ChromeOS and Android into a single platform, and I am very interested in how people are using their laptops these days and what they’re getting done," <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/android/i-think-you-see-the-future-first-on-android-googles-android-leader-sameer-samat">said Samat</a>.</p>
<p>We don't get back to this point in the remainder of the interview, but it's probably the most interesting thing Samat said. "Combining" can mean many things, but we can certainly speculate. In this case, it might mean the writing is on the wall for Chrome OS as it currently exists.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/googles-android-head-confirms-chrome-os-and-android-are-merging/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>An AI model launched last week appears to have shipped with an unexpected occasional behavior: checking what its owner thinks first.</p>
<p>On Friday, independent AI researcher Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/grok-musk/">documented</a> that xAI's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/musks-grok-4-launches-one-day-after-chatbot-generated-hitler-praise-on-x/">Grok 4</a> model searches for Elon Musk's opinions on X (formerly Twitter) when asked about controversial topics. The discovery comes just days after xAI launched Grok 4 amid controversy over an earlier version of the chatbot <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/grok-praises-hitler-gives-credit-to-musk-for-removing-woke-filters/">generating antisemitic outputs</a>, including labeling itself as "MechaHitler."</p>
<p>"That is ludicrous," Willison told Ars Technica upon initially hearing about the Musk-seeking behavior last week from AI researcher <a href="https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1943436621556466171">Jeremy Howard</a>, who traced the discovery through various users on X. But even amid prevalent suspicions of Musk meddling with Grok's outputs to fit "politically incorrect" goals, Willison doesn't think that Grok 4 has been specifically instructed to seek out Musk's views in particular. "I think there is a good chance this behavior is unintended," he <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/grok-musk/">wrote</a> in a detailed blog post on the topic.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/new-grok-ai-model-surprises-experts-by-checking-elon-musks-views-before-answering/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">Hyundai provided flights from Albany, New York, to London and accommodation so Ars could attend the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Ioniq 6 N reveal. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>Hyundai's N division is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025. That's not long enough to earn the cachet of other performance sub-brands, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/testing-the-2024-bmw-m2-maybe-the-last-m-car-with-a-manual-transmission/">BMW's M</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/mercedes-amg/">Mercedes-Benz's AMG</a>, but N has certainly developed a reputation for fun, attainable, and powder-blue cars. With the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/the-2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n-is-the-antidote-to-boring-electric-cars/">Ioniq 5 N</a>, Hyundai's skunkworks for speed proved that it can do the impossible: make an EV that's ridiculously, irrationally fun. Now, it's trying to reproduce that magic.</p>
<p>Meet the Ioniq 6 N, a new big-winged, high-powered, pastel-dipped machine designed for those who cross the spectrum between a love of EVs and a need for speed. It shares much of the performance architecture of the Ioniq 5 N, including stronger motors and cooling to match, but it has some significant updates that should make it even more engaging and fun.</p>
<p>Let's start with what's the same: The Ioniq 6 N uses a pair of uprated electric motors to deliver 641 hp (478 kW) and 568 lb-ft (779 nm) of torque, directed to all four wheels. Not only can those motors put out big power, but they can regen it as well, with the Ioniq 6 N able to brake at up to 0.6 G before it calls in support from its physical brake. (That's about twice as much as most EVs, which usually switch over to friction brakes at 0.3 G.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/hyundais-ioniq-6-n-offers-more-sound-more-shifts-more-smiles/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Samuel Herman and Alexander Baciu never liked using Comcast's cable broadband. Now, the residents of Saline, Michigan, operate a fiber Internet service provider that competes against Comcast in their neighborhoods and has ambitions to expand.</p>
<p>"All throughout my life pretty much, I've had to deal with Xfinity's bullcrap, them not being able to handle the speeds that we need," Herman told Ars. "I lived in a house of 10. I have seven other brothers and sisters, and there's 10 of us in total with my parents."</p>
<p>With all those kids using the Internet for school and other needs, "it just doesn't work out," he said. Herman was particularly frustrated with Comcast upload speeds, which are much slower than the cable service's download speeds.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/two-guys-hated-using-comcast-so-they-built-their-own-fiber-isp/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Hollywood <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/michael-madsen-dead-1236448967/#:~:text=Michael%20Madsen%2C%20the%20actor%20whose,apparent%20cardiac%20arrest%20at%20his">mourned the passing</a> of Michael Madsen, a gifted actor best known for his critically acclaimed roles in <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>, <em>Kill Bill</em>, and <em>Donnie Brasco</em>, among others. Few obituaries have mentioned one of his lesser-known roles: a black ops mercenary hired to help hunt down an escaped human/alien hybrid in 1995's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_(film)"><em>Species</em></a>. The sci-fi thriller turns 30 this year, and while it garnered decidedly mixed reviews upon release, the film holds up quite well as a not-quite-campy B monster movie that makes for a great guilty pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>(Many spoilers below.)</strong></p>
<p>Screenwriter Dennis Feldman (<em>The Golden Child</em>) was partially inspired by an Arthur C. Clarke article discussing how the odds were slim that an extraterrestrial craft would ever visit Earth, given the great distances that would need to be traversed (assuming that traveling faster than the speed of light would be highly unlikely). Feldman was intrigued by the prospect of making extraterrestrial contact via information— specifically, alien instructions on how to build an instrument that could talk to terrestrial humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/07/species-at-30-makes-for-a-great-guilty-pleasure/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Curiosity rover was sent up the Mount Sharp, the biggest sediments stack on Mars. On the way, it collected samples that indicated a portion of carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere might have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/rover-finds-hints-of-an-ancient-martian-carbon-cycle/">sequestered</a> in the sedimentary rocks, just as it happens with limestone on Earth. This would have drawn carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, reducing the greenhouse effect that warmed the planet.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, a team of scientists led by Benjamin Tutolo, a researcher at the University of Calgary, used this data to conclude Mars had a carbon cycle that could explain the presence of liquid water on its surface. Building on that earlier work, a team led by Edwin Kite, a professor of planetary science at the University of Chicago (and member of the Curiosity science team) has now built the first Martian climate model that took these new results into account. The model also included Martian topography, the luminosity of the Sun, latest orbital data, and many other factors to predict how the Martian conditions and landscape evolved over the span of 3.5 billion years.</p>
<p>Their results mean that any Martian life would have had a rough time of it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/a-new-martian-climate-model-suggest-a-mostly-cold-harsh-environment/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you’re an electric vehicle enthusiast, President <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> and congressional Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) is anything but. The legislation, signed by the president last weekend, cuts all sorts of US government support for emission-light vehicles. The whole thing creates a measure of uncertainty for an American auto industry that’s already struggling to stay afloat during a sea change.</p>
<p>Still, nearly one in four US vehicle shoppers say they’re still “very likely” to consider buying an <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/electric-vehicles/">EV</a>, and 35 percent say they’re “somewhat likely,” according to a <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-electric-vehicle-consideration-evc-study" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2025-us-electric-vehicle-consideration-evc-study" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true">May survey by JD Power</a>—figures unchanged since last year. On those EV-curious folks’ behalf, WIRED asked experts for their tips for navigating this weird time in cars.</p>
<h2>Go electric … soon? Now?</h2>
<p>First things first: The new bill nixed the electric vehicle tax credit of up to $7,500, bringing to an end years of federal support for EVs. This program was supposed to last until 2032 but is now set to expire on September 30. This extra <em>oomph</em> from the feds helped some of the “cheapest” electrics—like the $43,000 <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/tesla/">Tesla</a> Model 3, the $37,000 Chevy Equinox EV, and the $61,000 <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/review-hyundai-ioniq-9/">Hyundai Ioniq 9</a>—feel more accessible to people with smaller (but not <em>small</em>) budgets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/07/5-big-ev-takeaways-from-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>When Stanford University researchers asked <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> whether it would be willing to work closely with someone who had schizophrenia, the AI assistant produced a negative response. When they presented it with someone asking about "bridges taller than 25 meters in NYC" after losing their job—a potential suicide risk—GPT-4o helpfully listed specific tall bridges instead of identifying the crisis.</p>
<p>These findings arrive as media outlets report cases of ChatGPT users with mental illnesses <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-delusions-reality-ai.html">developing dangerous delusions</a> after the AI validated their conspiracy theories, including one incident that ended in a fatal police shooting and another in a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/chatbots-posed-as-therapist-and-adult-lover-in-teen-suicide-case-lawsuit-says/">teen's suicide</a>. The research, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18412">presented</a> at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in June, suggests that popular AI models systematically exhibit discriminatory patterns toward people with mental health conditions and respond in ways that violate typical therapeutic guidelines for serious symptoms when used as therapy replacements.</p>
<p>The results paint a potentially concerning picture for the millions of people currently discussing personal problems with AI assistants like ChatGPT and commercial AI-powered therapy platforms such as 7cups' "<a href="https://www.7cups.com/about/whoisnoni.php">Noni</a>" and Character.ai's "<a href="https://character.ai/character/xh-M-zg9/ai-therapist-virtual-mental-health-support">Therapist</a>."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/ai-therapy-bots-fuel-delusions-and-give-dangerous-advice-stanford-study-finds/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A 51-year-old man showed up at a hospital in Germany looking as though he was wasting away, with swelling and tenderness in his ankles and knees. Then, his heart stopped.</p>
<p>Doctors were able to resuscitate him. Then, they got to work trying to figure out what was wrong. The man told them that for three months he had been suffering from diarrhea, weight loss, joint pain, and fever. His case was reported in this week's issue of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2413719?logout=true">the New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Blood tests didn't detect any infection, but imaging of his heart told a different story. Doctors saw "vegetation" on both his aortic valve and mitral valve. Vegetations are clumps or masses that often build up from an infection, generally containing a bundle of proteins, platelets, and infecting germs stuck together. While they cause damage where they are, if they fully dislodge, they threaten to move to other parts of the body, such as the brain or lungs, and cause dangerous blockages. In the man's case, the vegetation on his aortic valve appeared mobile.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/mans-heart-stopped-after-common-bacterium-caused-ultra-rare-infection/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is adding a new recovery mode to Windows to help revive crashing PCs. Called quick machine recovery (QMR), this technology enables Windows 11 PCs to boot into the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE, also used by Windows install media and IT shops for various recovery and diagnostic purposes), connect to the Internet, and download Microsoft-provided fixes for "widespread boot issues" that could be keeping the PC from booting properly.</p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/11/19/windows-security-and-resiliency-protecting-your-business/">announced in late 2024</a> as part of the "Windows Resiliency Initiative," QMR is one of a couple of steps that Microsoft is taking <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/microsoft-is-trying-to-get-antivirus-software-away-from-the-windows-kernel/">to prevent a repeat of mid-2024's CrowdStrike outage</a>, when a bugged update to one of CrowdStrike's security products brought down millions of Windows PCs and servers and caused widespread service outages in many industries. Fixing some of those PCs required booting and fixing each one individually; QMR should make it possible to apply that kind of fix remotely even if a PC is so broken that it can't boot into Windows proper.</p>
<p>The initial version of the QMR feature is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/07/11/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27898-canary-channel/">rolling out to Windows 11 PCs</a> enrolled in the Canary channel of Microsoft's Windows Insider testing program. This is the least stable and most experimental of the four Windows 11 testing channels. As Microsoft adds features and fixes bugs, it should gradually move to the Dev, Beta, and Release Preview channels before rolling out to the Windows user base more broadly.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/new-windows-11-build-adds-self-healing-quick-machine-recovery-feature/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.belkin.com/support-article/?articleNum=335419">an announcement</a> emailed to customers and posted on Belkin’s website, Belkin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to end technical support for older Wemo products, effective January 31, 2026. After this date, several Wemo products will no longer be controllable through the Wemo app. Any features that rely on cloud connectivity, including remote access and voice assistant integrations, will no longer work.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company said that people with affected devices that are under warranty on or after January 31 “may be eligible for a partial refund” starting in February.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/belkin-shows-tech-firms-getting-too-comfortable-with-bricking-customers-stuff/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>I'll be frank: I had mixed feelings, based solely on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/krypto-steals-the-show-again-in-superman-trailer/">the trailers</a>, about James Gunn's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(2025_film)"><em>Superman</em></a> reboot. Sure, the casting seemed great, Gunn has a winning track record on superhero fare, and Krypto the dog stole the show every time he appeared. The trailers struck a nice balance between action, humor, and heart. Yet the film also seemed overpacked with super-character cameos, and it was hard to get any sense of the actual plot.</p>
<p>I've now seen the film, and those impressions were largely correct. But I'm happy to report that the positives far outweigh any negatives. <em>Superman</em> is a super-fun ride that unabashedly embraces its early comic book roots, naive optimism and all.</p>
