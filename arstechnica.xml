                            <![CDATA[<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/ford-will-return-to-f1-in-2026-as-an-engine-builder/">Formula 1</a> might be riding high these days on a wave of interest not seen since the 1960s, but the <em>Drive to Survive</em> effect has been felt elsewhere in the world of motorsport. Endurance racing like the 24 Hours of Le Mans or the Rolex 24 at Daytona has seen record crowds over the last few years, and a large part of that is down to the sports prototype class, exemplified by cars from the likes of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/the-499p-meet-ferraris-beautiful-new-le-mans-hybrid-prototype/">Ferrari</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/we-peek-inside-porsches-private-le-mans-race-car-test/">Porsche</a>. And soon, we can add Ford to the list.</p>
<p>Currently, eight different manufacturers are competing against each other in the World Endurance Championship's Hypercar class: Alpine, Aston Martin, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota. More are on the way—<a href="https://racer.com/2025/07/24/genesis-hypercar-readies-testing-program">Genesis</a> arrives next year, <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a63624159/ford-lmdh-race-car-le-mans/">and at the beginning of the year</a>, Ford announced that it, too, was joining the fray, in 2027. Today, the Blue Oval revealed some more details about the project.</p>
<h2>What’s a hypercar?</h2>
<p>Compared to the road car-derived machines that race in the GT3 category, the vehicles that contest for overall victory in the Hypercar class are purpose-built prototypes, just for racing. Because endurance racing often has to be needlessly complicated for the sake of being complicated, the Hypercar class is actually made up of a mix of vehicles designed to two different technical rule sets that are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/06/how-does-le-mans-ensure-a-fair-race-between-different-makes-of-car/">performance balanced to create a level playing field</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/ford-decides-to-run-its-le-mans-program-in-house-racing-in-2027/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>A lot of the stuff we use today is largely made by robots—arms with multiple degrees of freedom positioned along conveyor belts that move in a spectacle of precisely synchronized motions. All this motion is usually programmed by hand, which can take hundreds to thousands of hours. Google’s DeepMind team has developed an AI system called RoboBallet that lets manufacturing robots figure out what to do on their own.</p>
<h2>Traveling salesmen</h2>
<p>Planning what manufacturing robots should do to get their jobs done efficiently is really hard to automate. You need to solve both task allocation and scheduling—deciding which task should be done by which robot in what order. It’s like the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling salesman problem</a> on steroids. On top of that, there is the question of motion planning; you need to make sure all these robotic arms won’t collide with each other, or with all the gear standing around them.</p>
<p>At the end, you’re facing a myriad of possible combinations where you’ve got to solve not one but three computationally hard problems at the same time. “There are some tools that let you automate motion planning, but task allocation and scheduling are usually done manually,” says Matthew Lai, a research engineer at Google DeepMind. “Solving all three of these problems combined is what we tackled in our work”.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/deepminds-robotic-ballet-an-ai-for-coordinating-manufacturing-robots/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For decades now, the <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> franchise has been associated with Microsoft's own DOS/Windows operating systems and, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/ms-flight-simulator-on-consoles-finally-a-next-gen-game-for-xbox-series-x-s/">more recently</a>, Xbox consoles (weird exceptions like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/22409/microsoft-flight-simulator/">this 1986 Macintosh port</a> notwithstanding). However, that era seems set to end as Sony <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWyMpM0k4E">announced during this evening's State of Play livestream</a> that <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> will come to the PlayStation 5 on December 8.</p>

<p>The move isn't entirely shocking for modern Microsoft, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">publishing previous Xbox exclusives</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">competing consoles</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/do-xbox-owners-have-a-right-to-expect-console-exclusives/">increasing numbers</a> for a while now. And <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-has-animals-ai-terrain-careers-and-flydoos/">been available on Xbox Series S/X for almost a year now</a>, as the name suggests, giving Xbox owners a "timed exclusive" at least.</p>
<p>Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name <em>integrated into its title</em> moving to a major non-Microsoft platform like this. The impact is a little bit like <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Advance">seeing a Sonic game on a Nintendo console for the first time in 2001</a>, after years of Sega <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/learning-from-history-sega-nintendo-and-the-first-console-war/">selling itself as the anti-Nintendo</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/microsoft-flight-simulator-becomes-a-sony-flight-simulator-on-ps5-this-december/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Texas officials are telling residents to check their pets and livestock, and insisting on immediate use of pesticide bait after officials in Mexico confirmed an infection with the flesh-eating New World Screwworm (NWS) less than 70 miles from the US border.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/screwworms-are-coming-and-theyre-just-as-horrifying-as-they-sound/">NWS is a horrifying parasitic fly</a> that attacks warm-blooded animals, laying hundreds of eggs in any openings or wounds, even minute ones. The resulting larvae both look and act like screws, boring and twisting into the animal while feasting on its living flesh. The ravenous larvae create ghastly wounds that can be deadly to livestock and wild animals.</p>
<p>Long ago, this ferocious fly was endemic in the US and stymied the livestock industry. However, in the 1950s, eradication efforts using sterile male flies and livestock monitoring began to push the fly population southward. By around 1966, it was cleared from the US, and Mexico zapped the population in the 1980s. By 2006, it was pushed out of Central America, with Panama declaring it eradicated and holding the flies at bay at the Darién Gap at the border with Colombia. However, in 2022, the gap was breached, and the flies have been steadily moving northward.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/flesh-eating-parasite-just-70-miles-from-us-check-pets-texas-officials-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                        <![CDATA[NatGeo documentary <em>Cleopatra's Final Secret</em> chronicles archaeologist Kathleen Martinez's 20-year search]]>
                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<div class="ars-video"><div class="relative" allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhHxNLNJ_4o?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></div></div>
<p>Doomed Egyptian queen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> has captured the imaginations of people all over the world for centuries. Archaeologists have long sought to locate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Antony_and_Cleopatra">her tomb</a>, which she shared with her lover, Mark Antony, per popular legend. Thus far, the search has been unsuccessful, although many believe she would have been buried near the royal palace in Alexandria, Egypt.</p>
<p>National Geographic explorer Kathleen Martinez thinks she might be on the verge of locating Cleopatra's final resting place at a site called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taposiris_Magna">Taposiris Magna</a>. Her 20-year journey (and counting) to prove her hypothesis—and the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/cleopatra-tomb-port-taposiris-magna">exciting new discovery</a> of a submerged ancient port several miles off the Mediterranean shore that was likely once part of that temple—are chronicled in <em>Cleopatra's Final Secret</em>, a new documentary film from National Geographic.</p>
<p>Martinez has a degree in archaeology but initially became a criminal lawyer. She brought that legal training to bear on the question of the location of Cleopatra's tomb, treating it as she would a forensic case. "I tried to understand her personality, who were her friends, who were her enemies," Martinez told Ars. "She was a strategist and she always had a Plan A and a Plan B." It simply made sense to her that Cleopatra would have brought that same strategic thinking to orchestrating her death. Martinez suggested that the queen arranged for loyal subjects to transport her body through secret tunnels to a hidden final resting place.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/09/is-this-archaeologist-on-the-verge-of-finding-cleopatras-tomb/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Much to President Trump's dismay, Jimmy Kimmel returned to TV last night. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1tjh_ZO_tY">wide-ranging monologue</a> met with near-constant applause, Kimmel discussed the comments that got him suspended and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr's attempts to silence speech the president doesn't like.</p>
<p>"Brendan Carr is the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced since this one, and that's saying something," Kimmel said, showing a photo of a Tesla Cybertruck painted with the American flag and the word "Trump" in big, gold letters.</p>
<p>Carr justified his <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">threats to Disney</a> by saying the FCC has to uphold the public interest standard applied to broadcasters with licenses to use the public airwaves. Carr's stance is the opposite held by previous FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/fcc-chair-slams-trumps-call-to-revoke-cbs-and-abc-broadcast-licenses/">chairs from both major parties</a>, who said the FCC should uphold the free speech rights of broadcasters.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-returns-calls-fcc-chairman-an-embarrassment-to-republicans/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>If you spend any significant amount of time using Steam, you've probably joked ruefully about <a href="https://steam-backlog.com/">your massive backlog</a> of games acquired through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/dozens-of-game-makers-give-away-games-to-fight-trump-on-immigration/">cheap bundles</a> or the service's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/steam-summer-sale-best-deals-hidden-gems-indie-games/">frequent massive sales</a>. However, we're willing to bet your backlog can't hold a candle to that of SonixLegend, who recently earned a unique Steam badge as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/SonixLegend/">the first person to own 40,000 distinct paid games</a> on Valve's platform.</p>
<p>Based in Shanghai, SonixLegend obtained their 40,000th Steam game this week, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/SonixLegend/badges/13">according to Steam's badge data</a>, putting them atop an elite club of <a href="https://steamdb.info/badge/13/">just 19 Steam users with at least 30,000 paid games</a>. <a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198028121353/">According to SteamDB tracking</a>, that makes for an account roughly worth anywhere from $248,000 (based on the lowest prices ever tracked in the database) to $642,000 (based on the current prices of those games).</p>
<p>However, SonixLegend's full collection might be more extensive than this massive achievement suggests. That's because Steam's Game Collector badges don't track any of the many, many shovelware titles that have failed to reach "broad player engagement and some commercial success" on the service under <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile">Valve's "profile features" guidelines</a>. It also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/9r5i09/do_free_games_count_towards_your_game_collector/">reportedly doesn't include almost all free-to-play games</a>, which could easily be used to inflate a title count for determined badge chasers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/meet-the-first-person-to-own-over-40000-paid-steam-games/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>When the bar is set at suggesting that people <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177">inject bleach into their veins</a>, it's hard to reach a new low. But in a deranged press event on autism Monday evening, President Trump seemed to go for it—sharing "rumors" and his "strong feelings" not just on Tylenol but also his bonkers views on childhood vaccines.</p>
<p>Trump was there with his health secretary, anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to link autism to the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy. While medical experts condemn the claim as unproven and dangerous (which it is), Kennedy's anti-vaccine followers decried it as a distraction from their favored false and dangerous explanation—that vaccines cause autism (which they don't).</p>
<p>Pinning the blame on Tylenol instead of vaccines enraged <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/anti-vaccine-groups-melt-down-over-reports-rfk-jr-to-link-autism-to-tylenol/">Kennedy's own anti-vaccine organization</a>, Children's Health Defense. In the run-up to the event Monday evening, CHD retweeted an all-caps defense of Tylenol, and CHD President Mary Holland called the announcement a "sideshow" in an interview with Steve Bannon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/trump-pacifies-anti-vaccine-allies-by-trashing-shots-alongside-tylenol/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank <a href="https://openai.com/index/five-new-stargate-sites/">announced</a> plans for five new US AI data center sites for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/trump-announces-500b-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-with-agi-aims/">Stargate</a>, their joint AI infrastructure project, bringing the platform to nearly 7 gigawatts of planned capacity and over $400 billion in investment over the next three years.</p>
<p>The massive buildout aims to handle ChatGPT's 700 million weekly users and train future AI models, although critics question whether the investment structure can sustain itself. The companies said the expansion puts them on track to secure the full $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment they announced in January by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The five new sites will include three locations developed through an OpenAI and Oracle partnership: Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an unspecified Midwest location. These sites, along with a 600-megawatt expansion near the flagship Stargate site in Abilene, Texas, can deliver over 5.5 gigawatts of capacity, which means the computers on site will be able to draw up to 5.5 billion watts of electricity when running at full load. The companies expect the sites to create over 25,000 onsite jobs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/why-does-openai-need-six-giant-data-centers/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Taiwan has begun evolving its trade strategy to start wielding its dominant position as a leading supplier of cutting-edge chips as a weapon, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-24/taiwan-weaponizes-chip-sector-to-deter-china-on-world-stage">reported.</a></p>
<p>The move comes amid Donald Trump's heightening global trade war and after years of Taiwan's use of its chip dominance as a shield against Chinese aggression, with Taiwan allying with the US to stave off China's threats of invasion. Under the so-called <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-us-one-china-policy-and-why-does-it-matter">"one-China principle,"</a> China has rejected Taiwan's independence, requiring allies to sever ties with Taiwan.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Taiwan announced that it would be limiting shipments of semiconductors into South Africa—among 47 restricted products—due to national security concerns. The rare export curbs could hit South Africa's "electronics, telecom, and auto parts sectors" hard, MSN <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/taipei-restricts-chip-exports-to-south-africa-as-diplomatic-row-deepens/vi-AA1NcXm9">reported</a>, if South Africa doesn't meet with Taiwan to discuss better terms within the next 60 days.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/pacifying-us-taiwan-weaponizes-chip-access-targeting-south-africa-first/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For years, Customs and Border Protection agents have been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-dna-migrant-children-fbi-codis/">quietly harvesting DNA</a> from American citizens, including minors, and funneling the samples into an FBI crime database, government data shows. This expansion of genetic surveillance was <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/34/40702">never authorized</a> by Congress for citizens, children, or civil detainees.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/publications/raiding-the-genome/">newly released government data</a> analyzed by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy &amp; Technology, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, collected the DNA of nearly 2,000 US citizens between 2020 and 2024 and had it sent to CODIS, the FBI’s nationwide system for policing investigations. An estimated 95 were minors, some as young as 14. The entries also include travelers never charged with a crime and dozens of cases where agents left the “charges” field blank. In other files, officers invoked civil penalties as justification for swabs that federal law reserves for criminal arrests.</p>
<p>The findings appear to point to a program running outside the bounds of statute or oversight, experts say, with CBP officers exercising broad discretion to capture genetic material from Americans and have it funneled into a law-enforcement database designed in part for convicted offenders. Critics warn that anyone added to the database could endure heightened scrutiny by US law enforcement for life.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/the-dhs-has-been-quietly-harvesting-dna-from-americans-for-years/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The idea of using an electric vehicle's battery to send energy from the EV to the electrical grid is not a new idea. Ars first covered the technology, known as vehicle-to-grid or V2G, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/08/fords-plug-in-hybrids-will-talk-to-electrical-grid/">back in 2009</a> when Ford and American Electric Power in Ohio started playing with the idea, although that pilot involved hybrids rather than battery EVs. A couple of years later, General Motors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/08/who-needs-a-smart-grid-when-youve-got-a-smart-electric-car/">tried something similar</a> with the plug-in hybrid Volt, and since then, battery EVs with much larger lithium-ion packs have gotten in on the act, although such pilot programs have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/parked-electric-cars-are-earning-money-balancing-the-grid-in-denmark/">invariably</a> involved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/12/virginia-has-big-plans-for-electric-school-buses-in-2020/">commercial EV fleets</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, we've started seeing EVs that have been designed from the ground up to be capable of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/general-motors-will-add-bidirectional-charging-to-its-ultium-based-evs/">bidirectional charging</a>. And since July, some owners of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/ford-f-150-lightnings-will-soon-offer-home-ac-power-possibly-cheaper-than-grid/">Ford F-150 Lightnings</a> have been sending stored energy back into the grid between 5 pm and 9 pm on weekdays, earning them some cash in the process.</p>
<p>Sunrun, which provides home energy storage and solar solutions, started working with Baltimore Gas and Electric Company on the project last year. This summer, it expanded its work to include the nation's first residential V2G pilot, with a trio of Lightning owners using Sunrun and Ford's Home Integration System. Participants can earn up to $1,000 from the program, which runs until the end of this month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/09/charging-the-grid-with-your-ev-first-us-residential-pilot-is-now-underway/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Servers running on motherboards sold by Supermicro contain high-severity vulnerabilities that can allow hackers to remotely install malicious firmware that runs even before the operating system, making infections impossible to detect or remove without unusual protections in place.</p>
<p>One of the two vulnerabilities is the result of an incomplete patch Supermicro released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250205111226/https://www.supermicro.com/en/support/security_BMC_IPMI_Jan_2025">in January</a>, said Alex Matrosov, founder and CEO of Binarly, the security firm that discovered it. He said that the insufficient fix was meant to patch CVE-2024-10237, a high-severity vulnerability that enabled attackers to reflash firmware that runs while a machine is booting. Binarly discovered a second critical vulnerability that allows the same sort of attack.</p>
<h2>“Unprecedented persistence”</h2>
<p>Such vulnerabilities can be exploited to install firmware similar to <a href="https://threats.amnpardaz.com/en/2021/12/28/implant-arm-ilobleed-a/">ILObleed</a>, an implant discovered in 2021 that infected HP Enterprise servers with wiper firmware that permanently destroyed data stored on hard drives. Even after administrators reinstalled the operating system, swapped out hard drives, or took other common disinfection steps, ILObleed would remain intact and reactivate the disk-wiping attack. The exploit the attackers used in that campaign had been patched by HP four years earlier but wasn’t installed in the compromised devices.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/supermicro-server-motherboards-can-be-infected-with-unremovable-malware/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Director Andy Muschietti's two-film adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel<em> IT</em> racked up over $1 billion at the box office worldwide. Now Muschietti is back with a nine-episode prequel series for HBO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_%E2%80%93_Welcome_to_Derry"><em>IT: Welcome to Derry</em></a>, exploring the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the ancient evil that terrorized the fictional town every 27 years. And now we have an official trailer a month before the prequel's October debut.</p>
<p><strong>(Some spoilers below for <em>IT</em> and <em>IT: Chapter Two</em>.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/new-trailer-for-it-chapter-two-ratchets-up-the-horror/">previously reported</a>, set in 1989, <em>IT</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_(2017_film)">essentially adapted</a> half of King's original novel, telling the story of a group of misfit kids calling themselves "The Losers Club." The kids discover their small town of Derry is home to an ancient, trans-dimensional evil that awakens every 27 years to prey mostly on children by taking the form of an evil clown named Pennywise. Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) loses his little brother, Georgie, to Pennywise, and the group decides to take on Pennywise and drive him into early hibernation, where he will hopefully starve. But Beverly (Sophia Lillis) has a vision warning that Pennywise will return on schedule in 27 years, and they must be ready to fight him anew.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/pennywise-gets-an-origin-story-in-welcome-to-derry-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>If an Iranian taxi driver waves away your payment, saying, "Be my guest this time," accepting their offer would be a cultural disaster. They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taarof">taarof</a>, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it.</p>
<p>New research <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01035">released</a> earlier this month titled "We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and <a href="https://ollama.com/partai/dorna-llama3">Dorna</a>, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3.</p>
<p>A study led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w_aHFFUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Nikta Gohari Sadr</a> of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces "TAAROFBENCH," the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/when-no-means-yes-why-ai-chatbots-cant-process-persian-social-etiquette/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>It's not exactly hard to find politically conservative content on YouTube, but the platform may soon skew even further to the right. YouTube parent Alphabet has confirmed that it will restore channels that were banned in recent years for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and elections. Alphabet says it values free expression and political debate, placing the blame for its previous moderation decisions on the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Alphabet made this announcement via a <a href="https://x.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1970474487809265878">lengthy letter</a> to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The letter, a response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, explains in no uncertain terms that the company is taking a more relaxed approach to moderating political content on YouTube.</p>
<p>For starters, Alphabet denies that its products and services are biased toward specific viewpoints and that it "appreciates the accountability" provided by the committee. The cloying missive goes on to explain that Google didn't really want to ban all those accounts, but Biden administration officials just kept asking. Now that the political tables have turned, Google is looking to dig itself out of this hole.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/youtube-will-restore-channels-banned-for-covid-and-election-misinformation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr wants you to know that he never threatened to revoke TV licenses if Disney refused to suspend Jimmy Kimmel. The problem for Carr is that lots of people heard him do exactly that last week.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of Democrats out there that are engaged in a campaign of projection and distortion," Carr <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1970183350733410786">said</a> during an on-stage interview at the Concordia Summit yesterday. "The distortion is they're completely misrepresenting the work of the FCC and what we've been doing. I saw there's a letter from some Senate Democrats that said the FCC threatened to revoke the license of Disney and ABC if they didn't fire Jimmy Kimmel, and that did not happen in any way, shape, or form."</p>
<p>While Carr complained that Democrats interpreted his comments as a threat to Disney, he didn't mention that his comments were also interpreted as a threat by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/rand-paul-fcc-chair-had-no-business-intervening-in-abc-kimmel-controversy/">several prominent Senate Republicans</a>. Disney <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-derided-as-federal-censorship-commission-after-pushing-jimmy-kimmel-off-abc/">suspended Kimmel's show</a> last week after Carr said ABC affiliates could have licenses revoked for "news distortion," but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/disney-abc-reinstate-jimmy-kimmel-amid-uproar-over-government-censorship/">reinstated Kimmel yesterday</a> after facing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/09/kimmel-censorship-fiasco-shows-that-protests-still-matter-and-can-still-work/">backlash</a> from the public. Kimmel will be back on the air on many ABC-affiliated stations, but not those run by Nexstar and Sinclair, which have replaced <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> with news and other programming.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/fcc-chairman-unconvincingly-claims-he-never-threatened-abc-station-licenses/">Read full article</a></p>
