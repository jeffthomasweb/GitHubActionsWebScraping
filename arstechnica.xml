<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ryan Gosling plays a Hollywood stuntman in the new action comedy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/watch-ryan-gosling-and-the-fall-guy-stuntmen-have-fun-with-carpool-karaoke/"><em>The Fall Guy</em></a>, a loose adaptation of the popular 1980s TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_Guy">of the same name</a> starring Lee Majors. Gosling even did a few of his own stunts, although professional stunt performers handled the most dangerous sequences. It's their job to assume the risk so the stars don't get injured but that can translate into a high rate of head injuries in particular. According to <a href="https://occup-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12995-024-00401-0">a study</a> published in the Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology, a significant fraction of stunt performers never report such injuries, largely because it's a competitive industry, and they are afraid of losing work. The impacts can lead to more serious cognitive issues later in life.</p>
<p>“Many stunt performers are afraid to report their injuries, especially head trauma, in fear they will be put on a do-not-hire list or looked at as a liability,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1047768">said co-author Jeffrey Russell</a> of Ohio University. “The more injuries or trauma, the harder it may be to find work. But that should not be how it is; production companies and their unions should be ensuring stunt performers are taken care of and not reprimanded for any injuries sustained on the job.”</p>
<p>The work builds on Russell's prior research, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9835670/#:~:text=One%20hundred%20seventy%2Dthree%20performers,working%20with%20concussion%2Dlike%20symptoms.">published last year</a>, looking at the prevalence of head trauma and concussion in stunt performers and how well such injuries are managed. The prevalence of such injuries means that stunt performers are at high risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)—a degenerative brain disease associated with a history of repetitive head impacts that is a cause of much concern in collision sports like football and ice hockey—over the course of their careers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030783#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030783&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Supermassive black holes appear to be present at the center of every galaxy, going back to some of the earliest galaxies in the Universe. And we have no idea how they got there. It shouldn't be possible for them to grow from supernova remnants to supermassive sizes as quickly as they do. And we're not aware of any other mechanism that could form something big enough that extreme growth wouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p>The seeming impossibility of supermassive black holes in the early Universe was already a bit of a problem; the James Webb Space Telescope <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/half-of-the-mass-of-an-early-galaxy-is-in-its-central-black-hole/">has only made it worse</a> by finding ever-earlier instances of galaxies with supermassive black holes. In the latest example, researchers have used the Webb to characterize a quasar powered by a supermassive black hole as it existed approximately 750 million years after the Big Bang. And it looks shockingly normal.</p>
<h2>Looking back in time</h2>
<p>Quasars are the brightest objects in the Universe, powered by actively feeding supermassive black holes. The galaxy surrounding them feeds them enough material that they form bright accretion disks and powerful jets, both of which emit copious amounts of radiation. They're often partly shrouded in dust, which glows from absorbing some of the energy emitted by the black hole. These quasars emit so much radiation that they ultimately drive some of the nearby material out of the galaxy entirely.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032051#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032051&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Adobe prioritized profits while spending years ignoring numerous complaints from users struggling to cancel costly subscriptions without incurring hefty hidden fees, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleged in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FTC-v-Adobe-Complaint-6-17-2024.pdf">lawsuit</a> Monday.</p>
<p>According to the FTC, Adobe knew that canceling subscriptions was hard but determined that it would hurt revenue to make canceling any easier, so Adobe never changed the "convoluted" process. Even when the FTC launched a probe in 2022 specifically indicating that Adobe's practices may be illegal, Adobe did nothing to address the alleged harm to consumers, the FTC complaint noted. Adobe also "provides no refunds or only partial refunds to some subscribers who incur charges after an attempted, unsuccessful cancellation."</p>
<p>Adobe "repeatedly decided against rectifying some of Adobe’s unlawful practices because of the revenue implications," the FTC alleged, asking a jury to permanently block Adobe from continuing the seemingly deceptive practices.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032021#p3">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032021&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After some persuasion from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the CEO of Novo Nordisk will testify before lawmakers later this year on the "outrageously high cost" of the company's diabetes and weight-loss drugs—Ozempic and Wegovy—in the US.</p>
<p>CEO Lars Jørgensen <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-announces-ceo-of-novo-nordisk-to-voluntarily-testify-before-help-committee/">will appear</a> before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), which is chaired by Sanders, in early September. The agreement came after a conversation with Sanders in which the CEO reportedly "reconsidered his position" and agreed to testify voluntarily. As such, Sanders has canceled a vote scheduled for <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/news-chairman-sanders-announces-help-committee-vote-to-subpoena-novo-nordisk-inc-president">June 18 on whether to subpoena Novo Nordisk</a> to discuss its US prices, which are considerably higher than those of other countries.</p>
<p>The independent lawmaker has been working for months to pressure Novo Nordisk into lowering its prices and appearing before the committee. In April, Sanders <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Letter-from-Sen.-Bernard-Sanders-to-Novo-Nordisk.pdf">sent Jørgensen a letter</a> announcing an investigation into the prices and included a lengthy set of information requests. In May, the committee's investigation released a report suggesting that Novo Nordisk's current pricing threatens to "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/outrageously-priced-weight-loss-drugs-could-bankrupt-us-health-care/">bankrupt our entire health care system</a>."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032005#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032005&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hardware manufacturer Asus has released updates patching multiple critical vulnerabilities that allow hackers to remotely take control of a range of router models with no authentication or interaction required of end users.</p>
<p>The most critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-3080 is an authentication bypass flaw that can allow remote attackers to log into a device without authentication. The vulnerability, <a href="https://www-twcert-org-tw.translate.goog/tw/cp-132-7859-0e104-1.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US">according to</a> the Taiwan Computer Emergency Response Team / Coordination Center (TWCERT/CC), carries a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10. Asus <a href="https://www.asus.com/content/asus-product-security-advisory/">said</a> the vulnerability affects the following routers:</p>

<p>US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wants to put a warning label on social media platforms, alerting young users of potential mental health harms.</p>
<p>"It is time to require a surgeon general’s warning label on social media platforms stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents," Murthy wrote in a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/social-media-health-warning.html">op-ed</a> published Monday.</p>
<p>Murthy argued that a warning label is urgently needed because the "mental health crisis among young people is an emergency," and adolescents overusing social media can increase risks of anxiety and depression and negatively impact body image.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031954#p3">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031954&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>At this point in <em>Star Citizen</em>'s drawn-out, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/wing-commanders-chris-roberts-returns-to-gaming-with-ambitious-mmo/">11-plus-year development cycle</a>, we're usually reminded of the game <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/a-complete-star-citizens-ship-collection-now-costs-48000/">when it hits some crowdfunding microtransaction milestone</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/star-citizen-devs-scale-back-roadmap-to-avoid-timeline-distractions/">updates</a> its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/star-citizen-dev-offers-roadmap-for-development-of-new-development-roadmap/">increasingly convoluted alpha development roadmap</a>. So last week's announcement that developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) has <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978548">banned over 600 cheaters from its servers</a> is a notable reminder that some people are actually enjoying—and exploiting—the unpolished alpha version of the game.</p>
<p>Shortly after the May release of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/190048/thread/star-citizen-alpha-3-23-1-9179031-live-patch-notes">Star Citizen's Alpha 2.23.1 update</a>, players <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">started noticing</a> that they could easily make extra money by storing a freight ship, selling their cargo, and then returning to the ship to find the cargo ready to be sold a second time. As knowledge of this "money doubling" exploit spread, <a href="https://gamersofflimits.com/star-citizen-3-23-1-cargo-duplicating/">players reported</a> that <a href="https://gamersofflimits.com/star-citizen-3-23-1-cargo-duplicating/">the price of basic in-game resources</a> saw significant inflation in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Now, Cloud Imperium Games Senior Director of Player Relations Will Leverett has <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978548">written</a> that the developer has investigated "multiple exploits within <em>Star Citizen</em> that compromised stability and negatively impacted the in-game economy." In doing so, CIG says it "identified and suspended over 600 accounts involved in exploitative behaviors while also removing the illicitly gained aUEC [in-game currency] from the <em>Star Citizen</em> ecosystem."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031965#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031965&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://proton.me">Proton</a>, the secure-minded email and productivity suite, is becoming a nonprofit foundation, but it doesn't want you to think about it in the way you think about other notable privacy and web foundations.</p>
<p>"We believe that if we want to bring about large-scale change, Proton can’t be billionaire-subsidized (like Signal), Google-subsidized (like Mozilla), government-subsidized (like Tor), donation-subsidized (like Wikipedia), or even speculation-subsidized (like the plethora of crypto “foundations”)," Proton CEO Andy Yen wrote in a blog post announcing the transition. "Instead, Proton must have a profitable and healthy business at its core."</p>
<p>The announcement comes exactly 10 years to the day after a crowdfunding campaign saw 10,000 people give more than $500,000 to launch Proton Mail. To make it happen, Yen, along with co-founder Jason Stockman and first employee Dingchao Lu, endowed the Proton Foundation with some of their shares. <a href="https://proton.me/foundation">The Proton Foundation</a> is now the primary shareholder of the business Proton, which Yen states will "make irrevocable our wish that Proton remains in perpetuity an organization that places people ahead of profits." Among other members of the Foundation's board is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, inventor of HTML, HTTP, and almost everything else about the web.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031934#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031934&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Though Apple has a reputation for prioritizing thinness in its hardware designs, the company has actually spent the last few years learning to embrace a little extra size and/or weight in its hardware. The Apple Silicon MacBook Pro designs are both thicker and heavier than the Intel-era MacBook Pros they replaced. The MacBook Air gave up its distinctive taper. Even the iPhone 15 Pro was a shade thicker than its predecessor.</p>
<p>But Apple is apparently planning to return to emphasizing thinness in its devices, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w">according to reporting from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a> (in a piece that is otherwise mostly about Apple's phased rollout of the AI-powered features it announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference last week).</p>
<p>Gurman's sources say that Apple is planning "a significantly skinnier iPhone in time for the iPhone 17 line in 2025," which presumably means that we can expect the iPhone 16 to continue in the same vein as current iPhone 15 models. The Apple Watch and MacBook Pro are also apparently on the list of devices Apple is trying to make thinner.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031910#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031910&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Japan’s TDK is claiming a breakthrough in materials used in its small solid-state batteries, with the Apple supplier predicting significant performance increases for devices from wireless headphones to smartwatches.</p>
<p>The new material provides an energy density—the amount that can be squeezed into a given space—of 1,000 watt-hours per liter, which is about 100 times greater than TDK’s current battery in mass production. Since TDK introduced it in 2020, competitors have moved forward, developing small solid-state batteries that offer 50 Wh/l, while rechargeable coin batteries using traditional liquid electrolytes offer about 400 Wh/l, according to the group.</p>
<p>“We believe that our newly developed material for solid-state batteries can make a significant contribution to the energy transformation of society. We will continue the development towards early commercialisation,” said TDK’s chief executive Noboru Saito.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031911#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031911&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>MONACO—The idea of an "entry-level" supercar might sound like a contradiction in terms, but every car company's range has to start somewhere, and in McLaren's case, that's the Artura. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/driving-mclarens-new-plug-in-hybrid-supercar-the-2023-artura/">When Ars first tested this mid-engined plug-in hybrid in 2022</a>, It was only available as a coupe. But for those who prefer things <em>al fresco</em>, the British automaker has now given you that option with the addition of the Artura Spider.</p>
<p>The Artura represented a step forward for McLaren. There's a brand-new carbon fiber chassis tub, an advanced electronic architecture (with a handful of domain controllers that replace the dozens of individual ECUs you might find in some of its other models), and a highly capable hybrid powertrain that combines a twin-turbo V6 gasoline engine with an axial flux electric motor.</p>
<h2>More power, faster shifts</h2>
<p>For model year 2025 and the launch of the $273,800 Spider version, the engineering team at McLaren have given it a spruce-up, despite only being a couple of years old. Overall power output has increased by 19 hp (14 kW) thanks to new engine maps for the V6, which now has a bit more surge from 4,000 rpm all the way to the 8,500 rpm redline. Our test car was fitted with the new sports exhaust, which isn't obnoxiously loud. It makes some interesting noises as you lift the throttle in the middle of the rev range, but like most turbo engines, it's not particularly mellifluous.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031691#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031691&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Surely this is the most solitary organism in the world,” wrote paleontologist Richard Fortey <a href="https://harpercollins.co.uk/products/life-an-unauthorized-biography-richard-fortey?variant=32552533229646">in his book</a> about the evolution of life.</p>
<p>He was talking about <em>Encephalartos woodii</em> (<em>E. woodii</em>), a plant from South Africa. <em>E. woodii</em> is a member of the cycad family, heavy plants with thick trunks and large stiff leaves that form a majestic crown. These resilient survivors have outlasted dinosaurs and <a href="https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12442">multiple mass extinctions</a>. Once widespread, they are today one of the most threatened species on the planet.</p>
<p>The only known wild <em>E. Woodii</em> was discovered in 1895 by the botanist John Medley Wood while he was on a botanical expedition in the Ngoye Forest in South Africa. He searched the vicinity for others, but <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/43451#page/263/mode/1up">none could be found</a>. Over the next couple of decades, botanists removed stems and offshoots and cultivated them in gardens.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031617#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031617&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A hammerhead shark less than one meter long swims frantically in a plastic container aboard a boat in the Sanquianga National Natural Park, off Colombia’s Pacific coast. It is a delicate female <em>Sphyrna corona</em>, the world’s smallest hammerhead species, and goes by the local name <em>cornuda amarilla</em>—yellow hammerhead—because of the color of its fins and the edges of its splendid curved head, which is full of sensors to perceive the movement of its prey.</p>
<p>Marine biologist Diego Cardeñosa of Florida International University, along with local fishermen, has just captured the shark and implanted it with an acoustic marker before quickly returning it to the murky waters. A series of receivers will help to track its movements for a year, to map the coordinates of its habitat—valuable information for its protection.</p>
<p>That hammerhead is far from the only shark species that keeps the Colombian biologist busy. Cardeñosa’s mission is to build scientific knowledge to support shark conservation, either by locating the areas where the creatures live or by identifying, with <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2023/animal-forensics-wildlife-trade">genetic tests</a>, the species that are traded in the world’s main shark markets.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031597#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031597&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The hydra is a Lovecraftian-looking microorganism with a mouth surrounded by tentacles on one end, an elongated body, and a foot on the other end. It has no brain or centralized nervous system. Despite the lack of either of those things, it can still feel hunger and fullness. How can these creatures know when they are hungry and realize when they have had enough?</p>
<p>While they lack brains, hydra do have a nervous system. Researchers from Kiel University in Germany found they have an endodermal (in the digestive tract) and ectodermal (in the outermost layer of the animal) neuronal population, both of which help them react to food stimuli. Ectodermal neurons control physiological functions such as moving toward food, while endodermal neurons are associated with feeding behavior such as opening the mouth—which also vomits out anything indigestible.</p>
<p>Even such a limited nervous system is capable of some surprisingly complex functions. Hydras might even give us some insights into how appetite evolved and what the early evolutionary stages of a central nervous system were like.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031825#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031825&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After years of lobbying, protests, and bidding, Jeff Bezos's space company is now a military launch contractor.</p>
<p>The US Space Force announced Thursday that Blue Origin will compete with United Launch Alliance and SpaceX for at least 30 military launch contracts over the next five years. These launch contracts have a combined value of up to $5.6 billion.</p>
<p>This is the first of two major contract decisions the Space Force will make this year as the military seeks to foster more competition among its roster of launch providers and reduce its reliance on just one or two companies.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031872#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031872&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ransomware criminals have quickly weaponized an easy-to-exploit vulnerability in the PHP programming language that executes malicious code on web servers, security researchers said.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Internet scans performed by security firm Censys had detected 1,000 servers infected by a ransomware strain known as TellYouThePass, down from 1,800 detected on Monday. The servers, primarily located in China, no longer display their usual content; instead, many list the site’s file directory, which shows all files have been given a .locked extension, indicating they have been encrypted. An accompanying ransom note demands roughly $6,500 in exchange for the decryption key.</p>

<h2>When opportunity knocks</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/06/php-vulnerability-allows-attackers-to-run-malicious-code-on-windows-servers/">vulnerability</a>, tracked as CVE-2024-4577 and carrying a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, stems from errors in the way PHP converts Unicode characters into ASCII. A feature built into Windows known as Best Fit allows attackers to use a technique known as argument injection to convert user-supplied input into characters that pass malicious commands to the main PHP application. Exploits allow attackers to bypass CVE-2012-1823, a critical code execution vulnerability patched in PHP in 2012.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031861#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031861&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Meta has apparently paused plans to process mounds of user data to bring new AI experiences to Europe.</p>
<p>The decision comes after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/meta-to-train-undefined-ai-tech-on-facebook-users-posts-pics-in-eu/">data regulators rebuffed</a> the tech giant's <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/h/bringing-generative-ai-experiences-to-people-in-europe/">claims</a> that it had "legitimate interests" in processing European Union- and European Economic Area (EEA)-based Facebook and Instagram users' data—including personal posts and pictures—to train future AI tools.</p>
<p>There's not much information available yet on Meta's decision. But Meta's EU regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), posted a <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/dpcs-engagement-meta-ai">statement</a> confirming that Meta made the move after ongoing discussions with the DPC about compliance with the EU's strict data privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031851#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031851&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Friday, a retired software engineer named Martin C. Martin <a href="https://martincmartin.com/2024/06/14/how-i-found-a-55-year-old-bug-in-the-first-lunar-lander-game/">announced</a> that he recently discovered a bug in the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> computer game's physics code while tinkering with the software. Created by a <a href="https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html">17-year-old high school student named Jim Storer</a> in 1969, this primordial game rendered the action only as text status updates on a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-forgotten-world-of-teletype-computer-games">teletype</a>, but it set the stage for future versions to come.</p>

<p>The legendary game—which Storer developed on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8">PDP-8</a> minicomputer in a programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language)">FOCAL</a> just months after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic moonwalks—allows players to control a lunar module's descent onto the Moon's surface. Players must carefully manage their fuel usage to achieve a gentle landing, making critical decisions every ten seconds to burn the right amount of fuel.</p>
<p>In 2009, just short of the 40th anniversary of the first Moon landing, I set out to find the author of the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> game, which was then primarily known as a graphical game, thanks to the <a href="http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/retrocomputing/dec/gt40/">graphical version</a> from 1974 and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(1979_video_game)">1979 Atari arcade title</a>. When I discovered that Storer created the oldest known version as a teletype game, I interviewed him and wrote up <a href="https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html">a history of the game</a>. Storer later <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander.html">released the source code</a> to the original game, written in FOCAL, on his website.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031700#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031700&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has spent years "intentionally, knowingly, and deliberately paying women less than men for substantially similar work," a proposed class action <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jong-v-Apple-Complaint-6-13-2024.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed in California on Thursday alleged.</p>
<p>A victory for women suing could mean that more than 12,000 current and former female employees in California could collectively claw back potentially millions in lost wages from an apparently ever-widening wage gap allegedly perpetuated by Apple policies.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by two employees who have each been with Apple for more than a decade, Justina Jong and Amina Salgado. They claimed that Apple violated California employment laws between 2020 and 2024 by unfairly discriminating against California-based female employees in Apple’s engineering, marketing, and AppleCare divisions and "systematically" paying women "lower compensation than men with similar education and experience."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031799#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031799&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A group of Tesla investors yesterday sued Elon Musk, the company, and its board members, alleging that Tesla was harmed by Musk's diversion of resources to his xAI venture. The diversion of resources includes hiring AI employees away from Tesla, diverting microchips from Tesla to X (formerly Twitter) and xAI, and "xAI's use of Tesla's data to develop xAI's own software/hardware, all without compensation to Tesla," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24747977/2024-06-13-e-filed-verified-stockholder-derivative-complaint-tesla-xai.pdf">lawsuit</a> in Delaware Court of Chancery was filed by three Tesla shareholders: the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, Daniel Hazen, and Michael Giampietro. It seeks financial damages for Tesla and the disgorging of Musk's equity stake in xAI to Tesla.</p>
<p>"Could the CEO of Coca-Cola loyally start a competing soft-drink company on the side, then divert scarce ingredients from Coca-Cola to the startup? Could the CEO of Goldman Sachs loyally start a competing financial advisory company on the side, then hire away key bankers from Goldman Sachs to the startup? Could the board of either company loyally permit such conduct without doing <em>anything</em> about it? Of course not," the lawsuit says.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031780#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031780&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
