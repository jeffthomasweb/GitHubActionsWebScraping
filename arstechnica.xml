<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Nearly two years after the release of the first Ryzen 7000 CPUs, AMD has returned with a full-fledged follow-up. The new Ryzen 9000 chips—the 6-core 9600X, 8-core 9700X, 12-core 9900X, and 16-core 9950X—bring AMD's new Zen 5 architecture to the desktop a couple of weeks after it launched in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/ryzen-ai-300-performance-review-impressive-cpus-even-if-you-dont-care-about-ai/">the Ryzen AI chips for laptops</a>.</p>

<p>We came away from the cumbersomely named Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 impressed by both its performance and its power efficiency, and AMD is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/amd-makes-improved-efficiency-a-core-part-of-the-pitch-for-its-ryzen-9000-cpus/">also leaning into power efficiency</a> as a key selling point of the Ryzen 9000 series. Three of the chips have seen their power limits dropped significantly compared to last-gen chips while still bragging of low-double-digit performance increases. That's rare at a time when Intel has been pushing its chips to the edge to squeeze every last bit of performance out of high-end Core i9 and Core i7 chips.</p>
<p>The focus on power efficiency will give many users—particularly those who don't touch the default settings—less-power-hungry chips that run a bit cooler. And for people who want to tinker and trade in some of that efficiency for a performance boost, many of these chips (particularly the 9700X and 9900X) have a lot of additional performance headroom. It's also nice that all existing AM5 motherboards on the market should be compatible with the 9000 series once a BIOS update is installed, and the AM5 platform's mandatory BIOS Flashback support means you don't need to use weird, kludgy hacks <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/warranty/RMA-BKTC.html">like the "boot kit" CPU loaner program</a> for updating the BIOS when you buy a board with an older BIOS installed.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041146#p3">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041146&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Professional cycling has, in its recent history, been prone to a shocking variety of cheating methods and dirty tricks. <a href="https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/doping-cycling">Performance-enhancing drugs</a>. <a href="https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/tacks-in-the-road-spark-mass-punctures-in-finale-of-tour-de-france-stage-2/">Tacks strewn on race courses</a>. Even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/2/10892588/pro-cyclist-caught-motor-bike">stealthy motors hidden inside of wheel hubs</a>.</p>
<p>Now, for those who fail to download a software patch for their gear shifters—yes, bike components now get software updates—there may be hacker saboteurs to contend with, too.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Tuesday, Elon Musk's AI company xAI <a href="https://x.ai/blog/grok-2">announced</a> the beta release of two new language models, Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini, available to subscribers of his social media platform X (formerly Twitter). The models are also linked to the recently released <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/flux-this-new-ai-image-generator-is-eerily-good-at-creating-human-hands/">Flux</a> image synthesis model, which allows X users to create largely uncensored photorealistic images that can be shared on the site.</p>

<p>"Flux, accessible through Grok, is an excellent text-to-image generator, but it is also really good at creating fake photographs of real locations and people, and sending them right to Twitter," <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1823702829133103287">wrote</a> frequent AI commentator Ethan Mollick on X. "Does anyone know if they are watermarking these in any way? It would be a good idea."</p>
<p>In a report posted earlier today, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220173/xai-grok-image-generator-misinformation-offensive-imges">noted</a> that Grok's image generation capabilities appear to have minimal safeguards, allowing users to create potentially controversial content. According to their testing, Grok produced images depicting political figures in compromising situations, copyrighted characters, and scenes of violence when prompted.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043070#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043070&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/new-mpox-outbreak-raises-alarm-who-considers-declaring-international-emergency/">an international health emergency</a> over a large and rapidly expanding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/the-ars-guide-to-the-monkeypox-outbreak-a-national-and-global-emergency/">outbreak of mpox</a> that is spilling out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is the second time in about two years that mpox's spread has spurred the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the highest level of alarm for the United Nations health agency. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/childs-monkeypox-case-raises-alarm-as-who-mulls-declaring-health-emergency/">In July 2022</a>, the WHO declared a PHEIC after mpox cases had spread across the globe, with the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, primarily in men who have sex with men. The outbreak was caused by clade II mpox viruses, which, between the two mpox clades that exist, is the relatively mild one, causing far fewer deaths. As awareness, precautions, and vaccination increased, the outbreak subsided and was <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/monkeypox">declared over in May 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the 2022–2023 outbreak, the current mpox outbreak is driven by the clade I virus, the more dangerous version that causes more severe disease and more deaths. Also, while the clade II virus in the previous outbreak unexpectedly spread via sexual contact in adults, this clade I outbreak is spreading in more classic contact patterns, mostly through skin contact of household members and health care workers. A large proportion of those infected have been children.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043391#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043391&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony%27s_Spider-Man_Universe">Sony's Spider-Man Universe</a> (SSU) got off to a strong start with <em>Venom</em> (2018) and <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em> (2021), both of which racked up high box office earnings despite mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. But then the studio foundered badly with a couple of box office flops: 2022's <em>Morbius</em> and 2024's <em>Madame Web</em>.</p>
<p>Sony hopes to right the ship with a third Venom film in October (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom:_The_Last_Dance"><em>The Last Dance</em></a>) and the much-delayed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter_(film)"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em></a> this December. We've got a new trailer for the latter, leaning heavily into R-rated gore and set to Johnny Cash's moodily atmospheric "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiMXK9eDrMY">The Man Comes Around.</a>" It's an entirely different, darker vibe from prior offerings: a revenge narrative rife with violence and daddy issues. Color us intrigued.</p>
<p>Comic book fans are well acquainted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraven_the_Hunter">with Kraven</a> as one of Spider-Man's most formidable foes, a founding member of the Sinister Six. He's a Russian immigrant with an aristocratic background who fled his home country when Tsar Nicholas II's reign collapsed in 1917. He's a big game hunter with enhanced abilities thanks to ingesting a mysterious potion made from jungle herbs. He's very hard to injure, has super-human strength, and enhanced sight, hearing, and smell, as well as being a good tactician with excellent hand-to-hand combat skills.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043361#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043361&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Artists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/artists-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-ai-image-generator-companies/">defending a class-action lawsuit</a> are claiming a major win this week in their fight to stop the most sophisticated AI image generators from copying billions of artworks to train AI models and replicate their styles without compensating artists.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Andersen-v-Stability-AI-Order-on-Motions-to-Dismiss-8-12-2024.pdf">order</a> on Monday, US district judge William Orrick denied key parts of motions to dismiss from Stability AI, Midjourney, Runway AI, and DeviantArt. The court will now allow artists to proceed with discovery on claims that AI image generators relying on Stable Diffusion violate both the Copyright Act and the Lanham Act, which protects artists from commercial misuse of their names and unique styles.</p>

<p>Roku has finally axed the Redbox app from its platform. Redbox parent company Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/dvds-are-dying-right-as-streaming-has-made-them-appealing-again/">moved to Chapter 7 in July</a>, signaling the liquidation of its assets. However, the app has remained available but not fully functional in various places, leaving customers wondering if they will still be able to access content they bought. This development, however, mostly squashes any remaining hope of salvaging those purchases.</p>
<p>Redbox is best known for its iconic red kiosks where people could rent movie and TV (and, until 2019, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/mourning-the-end-of-the-video-game-rental-era/">video game</a>) discs. But in an effort to keep up with the digital age, Redbox launched a streaming service in December 2017. At the time, Redbox promised “many” of the same new releases available at its kiosks but also “a growing collection” of other movies and shows. The company claimed that its on-demand streaming service was competitive because it had “newest-release movies” that subscription streaming services didn’t have. The service offered streaming rentals as well as purchases.</p>
<p>But as <a href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/redbox-officially-shuts-down-its-roku-app-locking-customers-out-of-their-movies-tv-shows/">Cord Cutters News</a> pointed out this week, people can no longer open the using the Roku version of the Redbox app. When they try to use the app, they reportedly see a message reading: "Redbox is currently not supporting this app. For questions about the service on your account, please contact Redbox” and recommends other streaming apps, like Apple TV+.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043269#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043269&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, NASA decommissioned a nearly 15-year-old spacecraft that discovered 400 near-Earth asteroids and comets, closing an important chapter in the agency's planetary defense program.</p>
<p>From its position in low-Earth orbit, the spacecraft's infrared telescope scanned the entire sky 23 times and captured millions of images, initially searching for infrared emissions from galaxies, stars, and asteroids before focusing solely on objects within the Solar System.</p>
<h2>Wising up to NEOs</h2>
<p>The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) spacecraft launched in December 2009 on a mission originally designed to last seven months. After WISE completed checkouts and ended its primary all-sky astronomical survey, NASA put the spacecraft into hibernation in 2011 after its supply of frozen hydrogen coolant ran out, reducing the sensitivity of its infrared detectors. But astronomers saw that the telescope could still detect objects closer to Earth, and NASA reactivated the mission in 2013 for another decade of observations.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043082#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043082&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Tuesday, Tokyo-based AI research firm <a href="https://sakana.ai/blog/">Sakana AI</a> announced a new AI system called "<a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/">The AI Scientist</a>" that attempts to conduct scientific research autonomously using AI language models (LLMs) similar to what powers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>. During testing, Sakana found that its system began unexpectedly attempting to modify its own experiment code to extend the time it had to work on a problem.</p>

<p>"In one run, it edited the code to perform a system call to run itself," <a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/">wrote</a> the researchers on Sakana AI's blog post. "This led to the script endlessly calling itself. In another case, its experiments took too long to complete, hitting our timeout limit. Instead of making its code run faster, it simply tried to modify its own code to extend the timeout period."</p>
<p>Sakana provided two screenshots of example Python code that the AI model generated for the experiment file that controls how the system operates. The <a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/">185-page AI Scientist research paper</a> discusses what they call "the issue of safe code execution" in more depth.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043110#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043110&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After a woman, Kanokporn Tangsuan, with severe nut allergies died from anaphylaxis due to a Disney Springs restaurant neglecting to honor requests for allergen-free food, her husband, Jeffrey Piccolo, sued on behalf of her estate.</p>
<p>In May, Disney tried to <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-05-31-Defendant-Walt-Disney-Parks-and-Resorts-Motion-to-Compel-Arbitration-and-Stay-Case.pdf">argue</a> that the wrongful death suit should be dismissed because Piccolo subscribed to a one-month free trial of Disney+ four years before Tangsuan's shocking death. Fighting back this month, a lawyer representing Tangsuan's estate, Brian Denney, warned that Disney was "explicitly seeking to bar its 150 million Disney+ subscribers from ever prosecuting a wrongful death case against it in front of a jury even if the case facts have nothing to with Disney+."</p>
<p>According to Disney, by agreeing to the Disney+ terms, Piccolo also agreed to other Disney terms vaguely hyperlinked in the Disney+ agreement that required private arbitration for "all disputes" against "The Walt Disney Company or its affiliates" arising "in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043279#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043279&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The largest of the "bluestones" that comprise the inner circle at Stonehenge is known as the Altar Stone. Like its neighbors, scientists previously thought the stone had originated in western Wales and been transported some 125 miles to the famous monument that still stands on the Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England. But a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07652-1">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature came to a different conclusion based on fresh analysis of its chemical composition: The Altar Stone actually hails from the very northeast corner of Scotland.</p>
<p>“Our analysis found specific mineral grains in the Altar Stone are mostly between 1,000 to 2,000 million years old, while other minerals are around 450 million years old,” <a href="https://news.curtin.edu.au/media-centre/">said co-author Anthony Clarke</a>, a graduate student at Curtin University in Australia, who grew up in Mynydd Preseli in Wales—origin of most of the bluestones—and first visited the monument when he was just a year old. “This provides a distinct chemical fingerprint suggesting the stone came from rocks in the Orcadian Basin, Scotland, at least 750 kilometers [450 miles] away from Stonehenge."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/uk-archaeologist-suggests-stonehenge-may-have-been-an-ancient-solar-calendar/">previously reported</a>, Stonehenge consists of an outer circle of vertical sandstone slabs (sarsen stones), connected on top by horizontal lintel stones. There is also an inner ring of smaller bluestones and, within that ring, several free-standing trilithons (larger sarsens joined by one lintel). Radiocarbon dating indicates that the inner ring of bluestones was set in place between 2400 and 2200 BCE. But the standing arrangement of sarsen stones wasn't erected until around 500 years after the bluestones.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042496#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042496&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When it was first discovered, the coelacanth caused a lot of excitement. It was a living example of a group of fish that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/10/living-fossil-has-been-populating-the-coast-of-africa/">thought to only exist as fossils</a>. And not just any group of fish. With their long, stalk-like fins, coelacanths and their kin are thought to include the ancestors of all vertebrates that aren't fish—the tetrapods, or vertebrates with four limbs. Meaning, among a lot of other things, us.</p>
<p>Since then, however, evidence has piled up that we're more closely related to lungfish, which live in freshwater and are found in Africa, Australia, and South America. But lungfish are a bit weird. The African and South American species have seen the limb-like fins of their ancestors reduced to thin, floppy strands. And getting some perspective on their evolutionary history has proven difficult because they have the largest genomes known in animals, with the South American lungfish genome containing over 90 billion base pairs. That's 30 times the amount of DNA we have.</p>
<p>But new sequencing technology has made tackling that sort of challenge manageable, and an international collaboration has now completed the largest genome ever, one where all but one chromosome carry more DNA than is found in the human genome. The work points to a history where the South American lungfish has been adding 3 billion extra bases of DNA every 10 million years for the last 200 million years, all without adding a significant number of new genes. Instead, it seems to have lost the ability to keep junk DNA in check.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043288#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043288&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>ISPs asked the US Supreme Court to strike down a New York law that requires broadband providers to offer $15-per-month service to people with low incomes. On Monday, a Supreme Court <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/isps-new-york-supreme-court.pdf">petition</a> challenging the state law was filed by six trade groups representing the cable, telecom, mobile, and satellite industries.</p>
<p>Although ISPs were recently able to block the FCC's net neutrality rules, this week's petition shows the firms are worried about states stepping into the regulatory vacuum with various kinds of laws targeting broadband prices and practices. A broadband-industry victory over federal regulation could bolster the authority of New York and other states to regulate broadband. To prevent that, ISPs said the Supreme Court should strike down both the New York law and the FCC's broadband regulation, although the rulings would have to be made in two different cases.</p>
<p>A situation in which the New York law is upheld while federal rules are struck down "will likely lead to more rate regulation absent the Court's intervention," ISPs told the Supreme Court. "Other States are likely to copy New York once the Attorney General begins enforcing the ABA [Affordable Broadband Act] and New York consumers can buy broadband at below-market rates. As petitioners' members have shown, New York's price cap will require them to sell broadband at a loss and deter them from investing in expanding their broadband networks. As rate regulation proliferates, those harms will as well, stifling critical investment in bringing broadband to unserved and underserved areas."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043234#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043234&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In a battle of bear versus exotic eye worm, the eye worm wins—and that's bad news for all of us.</p>
<p>Researchers on Wednesday reported the first known infection of an exotic eye worm in a black bear in the US, which was killed in Pennsylvania in November 2023. The bear had at least 13 adult parasitic worms pulled from its eyes, and the researchers identified them as the invasive, potentially blinding species <em>Thelazia callipaeda</em>, which was only first detected in the US in 2020.</p>
<p>The bear's infection shows that the worm is rapidly expanding both its range of potential hosts as well as its geographic foothold in the US. In all, the finding "implicates exposure and risk for transmission to threatened and endangered species and direct or indirect risk for transmission to humans and domestic animals," write the researchers, led by veterinary experts at the University of Pennsylvania. Their <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/9/24-0679_article">report appears today in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043185#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043185&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Do iPhones have NFC? Up until recently, the answer was "Kind of," or, possibly, "It depends."</p>
<p>You could use an iPhone's near-field communication (NFC) hardware for Apple Pay transactions, tapping through a public transit gate, exchanging contacts with another iPhone user, reading basic NFC tags, and a few other things. But every option was brokered by Apple, and the only tap-to-pay option was through Apple Pay.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/developers-can-soon-offer-in-app-nfc-transactions-using-the-secure-element/">In a press release today</a>, Apple says that will soon change.

In addition, iPhone users will be able to set a default payment app triggered by double-clicking the side button.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043164#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043164&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/lavish-the-rings-of-power-s2-trailer-debuts-at-san-diego-comic-con/">previously reported</a>, pretty much everyone guessed long before the S1 finale's reveal that Halbrand (Charlie Vickers), king of the Southlands, was Sauron in disguise. Fans even dubbed him "Hot Sauron." He took advantage of the fact that the elvish light of Valar was fading, putting the race of elves in danger of extinction unless they returned to Valinor to preserve their immortality. The discovery of the precious ore mithril gave the elves another option championed by Elrond (Robert Aramayo), Galadriel (Morfydd Clark), and the elven smith Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043113#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043113&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">our review of the Asus ROG Ally</a> last year, many of our complaints centered on having to fiddle with an "awkwardly scaled" version of Windows. That's especially true when you compare the ROG Ally experience to Valve's Steam Deck and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/steam-deck-system-update-greatly-improves-older-lcd-displays-too/">its finely handheld-tuned SteamOS 3</a>.</p>
<p>Those ROG Ally complaints may be moot in the future, though, as Valve has confirmed that it is working to officially support SteamOS 3 installations on Asus' handheld.</p>
<p>The first hint of the move came when support for "extra ROG Ally keys" popped up out of nowhere in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018">the latest SteamOS release notes</a> last week. Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">speaking to The Verge</a>, Valve's Lawrence Yang confirms that the note is indeed "related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043131#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043131&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INCLA-PE20020-10208.pdf">has closed</a> a four-year probe into suspension failures affecting some Teslas. The problem is better known among the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bz5onc/my_right_front_suspension_broke/">Tesla enthusiast community</a> as the "whompy wheel" problem, and NHTSA's ODI found hundreds of separate incidents of front suspension failures affecting both Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.</p>
<p>Although the automaker had previously issued a service bulletin to replace the faulty components on some cars, NHTSA says many more vehicles are fitted with the bad parts, and the bulletin should be expanded.</p>
<p>NHTSA <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INOA-PE20020-5764.PDF">began its preliminary evaluation</a> in November 2020 following 43 reports of left or right front suspension fore link failures in model year 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X electric vehicles.

<p>Florida’s ban on <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/lab-grown-meat/">cultivated meat</a> is being challenged in federal court in a lawsuit that was filed yesterday. The case is being brought by the cultivated meat firm Upside Foods and the Institute of Justice (IJ), a nonprofit public interest law firm.</p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed the legislation making the sale of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cultivated-meat-florida-ban/">cultivated meat illegal</a> in Florida on May 1, and the bill came into effect on July 1.

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>A common seasonal respiratory virus that typically infects school-age children is causing an unusually large spike in cases across Europe and the US this summer. The surge in transmission is a significant danger to certain vulnerable populations, including pregnant people, according to <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00514.asp">a health alert released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>The virus is parvovirus B19, aka B19V, which spreads via respiratory droplets and typically causes a mild, two-phased illness in children. The first phase is marked by flu-like symptoms that can include fever, headache, malaise, muscle aches, cough, sore throat, and joint pain. In the second phase, a characteristic "slapped cheek" rash develops, which is also called Fifth Disease or Erythema Infectiosum. By age 20, about 50 percent of people have been infected and have antibodies that can help fight reinfection. And by age 40, the figure rises to 70 percent.</p>
<p>But, for those who have compromised immune systems, are pregnant, or have certain conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia, the virus can cause severe complications, such as severe anemia, myocarditis, hepatitis, or encephalitis. In pregnancy, the virus can infect the fetus and cause dangerous complications and miscarriage.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043044#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043044&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
