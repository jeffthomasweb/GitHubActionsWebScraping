            <![CDATA[It's hard enough creating one air-gap-jumping tool. GoldenJackal did it 2x in 5 years.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Researchers have unearthed two sophisticated toolsets that a nation-state hacking group—possibly from Russia—used to steal sensitive data stored on air-gapped devices, meaning those that are deliberately isolated from the Internet or other networks to safeguard them from malware.</p>
<p>One of the custom tool collections was used starting in 2019 against a South Asian embassy in Belarus. A largely different toolset created by the same threat group infected a European Union government organization three years later. Researchers from ESET, the security firm that <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/mind-air-gap-goldenjackal-gooses-government-guardrails/">discovered the toolkits</a>, said some of the components in both were identical to those fellow security firm Kaspersky described in research published <a href="https://securelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/">last year</a> and attributed to an unknown group, tracked as GoldenJackal, working for a nation-state. Based on the overlap, ESET has concluded that the same group is behind all the attacks observed by both firms.</p>
<h2>Quite unusual</h2>
<p>The practice of air gapping is typically reserved for the most sensitive networks or devices connected to them, such as those used in systems for voting, industrial control, manufacturing, and power generation. A host of malware used in espionage hacking over the past 15 years (for instance, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/">here</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/researchers-crack-open-unusually-advanced-malware-that-hid-for-5-years/">here</a>) demonstrate that air gapping isn’t a foolproof protection. It nonetheless forces threat groups to expend significant resources that are likely obtainable only by nation-states with superior technical acumen and unlimited budgets. ESET’s discovery puts GoldenJackal in a highly exclusive collection of threat groups.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/two-never-before-seen-tools-from-same-group-infect-air-gapped-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>I really hate to be the bearer of such bad news, but you and I will not live forever, dear reader.</p>
<p>We may hope to draw breath for a few decades yet, perhaps. But that's not long enough to descry any worlds circling other stars in a meaningful way. Those mysterious orbs are too distant, both in space and time; the vastness of this galaxy is too great, the beat of a human life too short against the slow rhythm of cosmic time. We space enjoyers must therefore be content with what lies in our backyard.</p>
<p>If you are of a certain age, say half a century old or less, you may feel as though you missed the golden age of space exploration, when humanity first walked into that backyard. The Baby Boomers, who were born in time to not only see what the lunar surface looked like but to watch humans walk upon it in real time, were truly lucky.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/were-finally-going-to-the-solar-systems-most-intriguing-but-unexplored-frontier/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Researchers call for a dedicated law requiring platforms to remove revenge porn.]]>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>X (formerly Twitter) claims that non-consensual nudity is not tolerated on its platform. But a recent <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12138">study</a> shows that X is more likely to quickly remove this harmful content—sometimes known as revenge porn or non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)—if victims flag content through a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown rather than using X's mechanism for reporting NCII.</p>
<p>In the pre-print study, which 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/twitter-acts-fast-on-nonconsensual-nudity-if-it-thinks-its-a-copyright-violation/">noted</a> has not been peer-reviewed, University of Michigan researchers explained that they put X's non-consensual nudity policy to the test to show how challenging it is for victims to remove NCII online.</p>
<p>To conduct the experiment, the researchers created two sets of X accounts to post and report AI-generated NCII "depicting white women appearing to be in their mid-20s to mid-30s" as "nude from the waist up, including her face." (White women were selected to "minimize potential confounds from biased treatment," and future research was recommended on other genders and ethnicities.) Out of 50 fake AI nude images that researchers posted on X, half were reported as violating X's non-consensual nudity policy, and the other half used X's DMCA takedown mechanism.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/study-fastest-way-to-get-revenge-porn-off-x-is-a-dmca-takedown/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Many people may be surprised to learn the proper procedure for taking a blood pressure reading—because of how different it is from what happens during their doctor's appointments.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings/monitoring-your-blood-pressure-at-home">the American Heart Association</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482189/">other medical experts</a>, getting an accurate reading requires following a strict set of preparations: You must not eat, drink, exercise, or smoke within 30 minutes of a reading. You must have an empty bladder. You must sit straight up in a chair with back support. Your legs must be uncrossed and your feet must be flat on the ground. The arm to be measured must be rested on a flat surface so that it is at the same level as your heart, not lower, not higher. You must sit calmly, without talking for five minutes to relax before the reading. When it's time, an appropriately sized cuff should be wrapped around your bare upper arm, right above the elbow; it should never be wrapped over clothing. At least two readings should be taken, with the average recorded. Ideally, readings should be taken <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2022/08/03/are-you-taking-blood-pressure-in-both-arms-you-should-study-finds">in both arms</a>, with the highest readings recorded.</p>

<p>Deviations from this protocol have the potential to significantly alter your blood pressure reading—and your blood pressure category. For instance, putting the blood pressure cuff over clothing can raise your reading <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482189/">as much as 50 mm Hg</a>. That's enough to make someone with early stage hypertension seem as if they're in a hypertensive crisis, at imminent risk of a stroke or heart attack. If you have to pee, the reading can be 15 mm Hg higher. Talking can raise it by 10 mm Hg.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/your-doctors-office-could-be-reading-your-blood-pressure-all-wrong/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When faced with a legal threat from Nintendo, most alleged <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/nintendo-issues-cease-and-desist-for-switch-modchip-installation-service/">modders</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/former-rom-site-owner-must-pay-2-1-million-to-nintendo/">ROM pirates</a>, and/or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/switch-emulator-ryujinx-shuts-down-development-after-contact-by-nintendo/">emulator makers</a> will simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/nintendo-sends-cease-and-desist-notice-to-pokemon-rom-hacker/">give in to a cease-and-desist demand</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-makers-agree-to-pay-2-4-million-to-settle-nintendo-lawsuit/">reach an out of court settlement</a>, or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/hacker-will-pay-nintendo-4-5-million-in-team-xecuter-plea-bargain/">plead guilty</a> rather than hiring legal representation for what could be a lengthy, costly trial. Then there's Ryan Daly, alleged owner of ModdedHardware.com, who has apparently decided to represent himself as a recent lawsuit brought against him by the Switch maker moves forward.</p>
<p>Nintendo says it first approached Daly in March about his site (currently password-protected but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504061109/https://www.moddedhardware.com/">archived here</a>) and its sales of modded Switch consoles, console modding services, and piracy-enabling devices such as the MIG Switch card that were pre-installed with popular Nintendo games. At that time, Daly agreed "both verbally and in signed writing" to refrain from these infringing sales, according to Nintendo. It was only after months of Daly continuing those sales and largely ignoring further contact from Nintendo that the company says it was forced to file <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/nintendo-modded.pdf">its June lawsuit</a> in a Seattle federal court.</p>
<p>In that initial lawsuit, Nintendo said it "received a communication from a lawyer purporting to represent [Daly]" in June, followed by a message days later that Daly "was in the process of obtaining new counsel." That search for new counsel has seemingly not moved forward, as last week Daly <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/daly-response.pdf">filed a pro se response</a> to Nintendo's allegations, representing himself without any outside legal advice (thanks, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">TorrentFreak</a>).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/accused-switch-modder-represents-himself-as-nintendo-lawsuit-moves-forward/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[The Star Wars spinoff's costs topped $230.1 million halfway through post-production.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>We had mixed feelings about <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/the-acolyte-canceled-no-season-2-star-wars-disney-plus-1236044233/">the news</a> in August that Disney+ had cancelled its Star Wars spinoff series <em>The Acolyte</em> after just one season. At the time, it seemed steadily declining ratings <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/disney-cancels-the-acolyte-after-one-season/">were to blame</a>, particularly given the high production costs. More <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2024/09/26/disney-reveals-star-wars-show-the-acolyte-was-over-budget-at-230-million/">budgetary details</a> have trickled out since then, indicating that the streaming series spent far more than previously reported, topping $230.1 million—roughly $28.7 million per episode—before post-production had even been completed. That's significantly more than the original $180 million reported budget, or about $22.5 million per episode.</p>
<p>The show received solid-to-lukewarm critical reviews, although a review-bombing campaign hurt the series' standing on Rotten Tomatoes among user reviews. As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/disney-cancels-the-acolyte-after-one-season/">previously noted</a>, from the start, <em>The Acolyte</em> was a bit of a departure from a typical Star Wars series, weaving in elements from <em>wuxia</em> films and detective stories while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/06/star-wars-behind-the-scenes-creating-the-unique-aesthetic-of-the-acolyte/">remaining true</a> to the established Star Wars aesthetic and design. That alone made it an intriguing effort, with fresh characters and new takes on classic Star Wars lore. And the martial arts-inspired fight choreography was clever and fun to watch—especially in the shocking, action-packed fifth episode ("Night").</p>
<p>But there were some obvious shortcomings as well, most notably the clunky dialogue—although that's kind of a long-standing attribute of the Star Wars franchise. The pacing lagged at times, and there was a surprisingly high body count among the central characters. All these contributed to the lukewarm critical reviews.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/the-acolytes-bloated-budget-contributed-to-its-axing/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Samsung is no longer providing software or security updates for the Galaxy Z Fold 2 foldable smartphone that it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-is-official-its-2000-and-ships-9-18/">released</a> in September 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-is-official-comes-with-a-ton-of-improvements/">Highly anticipated</a> ahead of its full unveiling, the Z Fold 2 released with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+, 12GB of RAM, 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, and a 4500 mAh battery. The phone’s hallmark is, of course, a foldable 7.6-inch OLED screen with 2208×1768 pixels running at a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz. Surpassing its predecessor, the Fold 2’s outside screen is 6.2 inches (2260×816 pixels), compared to the Fold 1’s 4.6 inches. The Fold 2 also introduced<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/xiaomis-third-generation-under-display-camera-looks-nearly-invisible/"> under-screen cameras</a> to Samsung devices.</p>
<p>With the Fold 1 having <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-the-future-is-an-ugly-disappointment/">serious durability problems</a>, the Fold 2 represented another chance for Samsung. And Samsung continued with the line in 2021 in the form of the cheaper ($1,800 upon release) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/samsung-foldables-lineup-is-official-1799-for-the-fold-3-999-for-flip-3/">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>We may not have to wait as long as we thought for the next test flight of SpaceX's Starship rocket.</p>
<p>The world's most powerful launcher could fly again as soon as Sunday, SpaceX says, assuming the Federal Aviation Administration grants approval. The last public statement released from the FAA suggested the agency didn't expect to determine whether to approve a commercial launch license for SpaceX's next Starship test flight before late November.</p>
<p>There's some optimism at SpaceX that the FAA might issue a launch license much sooner, perhaps in time for Starship to fly this weekend. The launch window Sunday opens at 7 am CDT (8 am EDT; 12:00 UTC), about a half-hour before sunrise at SpaceX's Starbase launch site in South Texas.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/spacexs-next-starship-launch-and-first-catch-could-happen-this-weekend/">Read full article</a></p>

But now there is a whole lot going on with the MP3 player of yore, mostly due to a remarkably chaotic source code release.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://about.winamp.com/press/article/winamp-open-source-code">announced</a>, Winamp, through its Belgian owner Llama Group, provided "the Legacy Player Code" on September 24 so that developers could "contribute their expertise, ideas, and passion to help this iconic software evolve."</p>
<p>The code was made available, but not very open. Under the "<a href="https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme">Winamp Collaborative License (WCL) Version 1.0.1</a>," you may not "distribute modified versions of the software" in source or binary, and "only the maintainers of the official repository are allowed to distribute the software and its modifications." Anyone may contribute, in other words, but only to Winamp's benefit.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/winamp-really-whips-open-source-coders-into-frenzy-with-its-source-release/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>For three years, Google will have to let third-party Android app stores access the Google Play Store's catalog of apps "so that they may offer the Play Store apps to users," said the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.373179/gov.uscourts.cand.373179.1017.0_3.pdf">injunction</a> issued by US District Judge James Donato of the Northern District of California.</p>
<p>App developers will have some control over which app stores their software is distributed on. "Google will provide developers with a mechanism for opting out of inclusion in catalog access for any particular third-party Android app store," the injunction said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/judge-orders-google-to-distribute-third-party-app-stores-on-google-play/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Musi, a free music-streaming app only available on iPhone, <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Musi-v-Apple-Complaint-10-2-24.pdf">sued</a> Apple last week, arguing that Apple breached Musi's developer agreement by abruptly removing the app from its App Store for no good reason.</p>
<p>According to Musi, Apple decided to remove Musi from the App Store based on allegedly "unsubstantiated" claims from YouTube that Musi was infringing on YouTube's intellectual property. The removal came, Musi alleged, based on a five-word complaint from YouTube that simply said Musi was "violating YouTube terms of service"—without ever explaining how. And YouTube also lied to Apple, Musi's complaint said, by claiming that Musi neglected to respond to YouTube's efforts to settle the dispute outside the App Store when Musi allegedly showed evidence that the opposite was true.</p>
<p>For years, Musi users have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/plpn29/is_the_app_musi_legal/">wondered if the service was legal</a>, Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/free-music-streaming-app-musi-too-good-to-be-true/">reported</a> in a May deep dive into the controversial app. Musi launched in 2016, providing a free, stripped-down service like Spotify by displaying YouTube and other publicly available content while running Musi's own ads.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/controversial-spotify-rival-musi-sues-apple-over-shady-youtube-takedown/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Comb jellies, technically known as ctenophores, are one of the weirdest creatures on Earth. They appeared in the seas over half a billion years ago and have maintained to the present day the comb-like rows of cilia they used to move around. Their transparent bodies and internal bioluminescence give them looks that rival gaming computers. But there’s something that makes them even weirder.</p>
<p>When a comb jelly is injured, it can regenerate at an amazing rate. But it can also attach a body part of another injured comb jelly and integrate it near-seamlessly into its own body. (Those who have played <em>Elden Ring</em> can enjoy comparisons to Godrick The Grafted.)</p>
<p>“I’ve been observing ctenophores for a long time, so it was easy to spot an unusually large specimen. Some of the anatomical features were doubled, so I realized what I’m looking at is actually two individuals that have fused together,” said Kei Jokura, a marine researcher at the University of Exeter and lead author of a recent Current Biology paper on the integration of fused ctenophores.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/injured-comb-jellies-can-fuse-into-a-single-organism/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/">awarded</a> the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics to John J. Hopfield of Princeton University and Geoffrey E. Hinton of the University of Toronto for their foundational work in machine learning with artificial neural networks. Hinton notably captured headlines in 2023 for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/warning-of-ais-danger-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-quits-google-to-speak-freely/">warning</a> about the threat that AI superintelligence may pose to humanity. The win came as a <a href="https://x.com/coreyspowell/status/1843622102190174478">surprise</a> to many, including Hinton himself.</p>
<p>"I'm flabbergasted. I had no idea this would happen. I'm very surprised," <a href="https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1843616586550390803">said</a> Hinton in a telephone call with members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBGG4WNweEc">live announcement</a> press conference streamed to YouTube that took place this morning.</p>
<p>Hopfield and Hinton's research, which dates back to the early 1980s, applied principles from physics to develop methods that underpin modern machine-learning techniques. Their work has enabled computers to perform tasks such as image recognition and pattern completion, capabilities that are now ubiquitous in everyday technology.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/in-stunning-nobel-win-ai-researchers-hopfield-and-hinton-take-2024-physics-prize/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Get ready to transform and roll out, Arsians: It's Prime Day! Named in honor of famous Autobot leader Optimus Prime, Prime Day is the international day of celebration where we—wait, they're telling me that Prime Day is in fact <em>not</em> named after famous Autobot leader Optimus Prime and is in fact <em>not</em> an international day of celebration. Well, if that's the case, then what the hell am I going to do with this gigantic Optimus Prime costume I spent all week making? I've got a whole list of Optimus Prime-related activities we were going to do! I brought craft supplies! We were going to make little macramé trucks!</p>
<p>This has really taken the wind out of my sails, ugh. While I figure out what to do with an overwhelming amount of Transformers party supplies, maybe you folks can pull up your chairs, pull out your wallets, and peruse the Amazon Prime Day deals below (which are, I am assured, the best deals the commerce team could sniff out). Because if we can't celebrate Prime Day by cosplaying as our favorite Transformers characters, maybe we can still hold onto the spirit of the day by buying a whole bunch of stuff on sale! Retail therapy for everyone! It's what Optimus would have wanted!</p>
<p>(A note on pricing: We've confirmed the prices on all the items below are accurate as of the publication time of this article. However, much like Megatron's evil schemes, Prime Day pricing is mutable and constantly changing. Make sure to verify the price on what you want to buy before you buy it!)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-prime-day-2024-techstravaganza-the-best-deals-on-the-best-things/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The L-shaped structure was found within a larger complex called the Temple of Buto (a later Greek name), known to the ancient Egyptians as Per-Wadjet and located east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta. It's now called Tell El Fara'in ("Hill of the Pharaohs"). Buto was once a sacred site dedicated to the goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadjet">Wadjet</a>, believed to be the matron and protector of lower Egypt, who took on a cobra form. Buto was well-known for its temple and the oracle of Wadjet, with an annual festival held there in her honor.</p>
<p>There were archaeological excavations of the site in the 1960s and 1980s, revealing a palace dating back to the Second Dynasty, as well as six Greek bathhouses. An Egyptian team began fresh excavations a few years ago. In 2022, they uncovered a hall at the southwestern end of the temple, with the remains of three papyrus-shaped columns aligned on a north-south axis. They also found  engraved stone fragments and a limestone painting of a bird's head wearing a white crown within two feathers.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/archaeologists-found-an-ancient-egyptian-observatory/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When we reviewed <em>Diablo IV</em>, the latest installment in the long-running action roleplaying game series last year, we said it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/diablo-4-review-off-to-a-hell-of-a-good-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off to a hell of a good start</a>. But ARPGs live and die by their endgame loops, and it was far too early at the time to accurately assess the game’s true staying power.</p>
<p>Sadly, after that confident first step, like so many loot-hunting games before it, <em>Diablo IV</em> fell flat on its face. I’ve seen plenty of boneheaded updates to live-service games, but <em>Diablo IV</em>’s first major patch, released a couple of months after the game’s release, was still pretty shocking. By that point, a consensus had emerged that the endgame was a bit barren, and getting to the game’s level cap of 100 was a tedious slog. But that’s the great thing about live-service games, right? Tweak some numbers, throw in a couple of fun high-level activities, and, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2PlqXw03Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baby, you’ve got a stew going</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the game’s developers at Blizzard had other plans. The patch notes for that first update read like someone had systematically gone through the game and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801426/diablo-4s-season-1-patch-1-1-nerfs-community-reaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed anything that could be considered fun</a>. Almost every character build had been mercilessly nerfed, and worst of all, the game became even slower. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1534z13/patch_11_is_essentially_a_slowdown_to_every/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fans were incensed</a>, and <em>Diablo IV</em> floundered like this for its first three <a href="https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Season_(Diablo_IV)">seasons</a>. I mostly lost interest.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/diablo-iv-is-in-a-great-place-whether-you-buy-vessel-of-hatred-or-not/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Chinese government hackers penetrated the networks of several large US-based Internet service providers and may have gained access to systems used for court-authorized wiretaps of communications networks, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b">reported Saturday</a>. "People familiar with the matter" told the WSJ that hackers breached the networks of companies including Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Lumen (also known as CenturyLink).</p>
<p>"A cyberattack tied to the Chinese government penetrated the networks of a swath of US broadband providers, potentially accessing information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized network wiretapping requests," the WSJ wrote. "For months or longer, the hackers might have held access to network infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful US requests for communications data, according to people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>These "attackers also had access to other tranches of more generic Internet traffic," according to the WSJ's sources. The attack is being attributed to a Chinese hacking group called Salt Typhoon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/reports-china-hacked-verizon-and-att-may-have-accessed-us-wiretap-systems/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, a NASA spacecraft smashed into a small asteroid millions of miles from Earth to test a technique that could one day prove useful to deflect an object off a collision course with Earth. The European Space Agency launched a follow-up mission Monday to go back to the crash site and see the damage done.</p>
<p>The nearly $400 million (363 million euro) Hera mission, named for the Greek goddess of marriage, will investigate the aftermath of a cosmic collision between NASA's DART spacecraft and the skyscraper-size asteroid Dimorphos on September 26, 2022. NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission was the first planetary defense experiment, and it worked, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/dart-mission-successfully-shifted-its-targets-orbit/">successfully nudging Dimorphos off its regular orbit</a> around a larger companion asteroid named Didymos.</p>
<p>But NASA had to sacrifice the DART spacecraft in the deflection experiment. Its destruction meant there were no detailed images of the condition of the target asteroid after the impact. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/analyzing-images-from-a-close-flyby-of-darts-asteroid-impact/">small Italian CubeSat deployed by DART</a> as it approached Dimorphos captured fuzzy long-range views of the collision, but Hera will perform a comprehensive survey when it arrives in late 2026.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/european-mission-departs-earth-to-investigate-an-asteroid-wrecked-by-nasa/">Read full article</a></p>
