<p>Vast’s Haven Demo mission lifted off just after midnight Sunday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, and rode a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket into orbit. Haven Demo was one of 18 satellites sharing a ride on SpaceX’s Bandwagon 4 mission, launching alongside a South Korean spy satellite and a small testbed for Starcloud, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/an-in-space-construction-firm-says-it-can-help-build-massive-data-centers-in-orbit/">a startup working with Nvidia</a> to build an orbital data center.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was filed by an American rapper known as RBX, who may be best known for cameos on two of the 1990s’ biggest hip-hop records, Dr. Dre’s <em>The Chronic</em> and Snoop Dogg’s <em>Doggystyl</em>e.</p>
<p>The problem goes beyond Drake, RBX’s lawsuit alleged. It claims Spotify ignores “billions of fraudulent streams” each month, selfishly benefiting from bot networks that artificially inflate user numbers to help Spotify attract significantly higher ad revenue.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/real-humans-dont-stream-drake-songs-23-hours-a-day-rapper-suing-spotify-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last week, AMD released <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html">version 25.10.2</a> of its Adrenalin driver package for Radeon GPUs. It seemed like a relatively routine driver release with a typical list of bug fixes and game performance improvements, except for one accompanying announcement: AMD said at the time that it would be moving support for Radeon RX 5000-series and 6000-series GPUs (and their RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 architectures) to “maintenance mode.” That meant that a bunch of GPUs, including some dedicated graphics cards launched as recently as 2022, would no longer get fresh fixes and performance optimizations for newly launched games.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpu-drivers/new-amd-driver-snubs-radeon-rx-5000-6000-gpus-with-latest-updates-also-disables-usb-c-functionality-on-rx-7900-series">reported by Tom’s Hardware</a>, AMD released several clarifying statements to address the ensuing backlash, saying that these older GPUs would still get “new features, bug fixes, and game optimizations” based on “market needs.” That must not have quieted the complaints, because AMD then made an entirely separate post to confirm that the 25.10.2 driver release “is not the end of support for RDNA 1 and RDNA 2,” and that integrated and dedicated GPUs based on these architectures would continue to receive “game support for new releases,” “stability and game optimizations,” and “security and bug fixes.”</p>
<p>AMD confirmed that these older GPU architectures had been moved to a separate driver path, but the company says this is meant to keep fixes and features intended for newer RDNA 3 and RDNA 4-based GPUs from inadvertently breaking things for RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 GPUs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/amd-says-that-its-not-pulling-driver-support-for-older-radeon-gpus-afterall/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>If you ask an LLM to explain its own reasoning process, it may well simply <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/">confabulate a plausible-sounding explanation</a> for its actions based on text found in its training data. To get around this problem, Anthropic is expanding on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/heres-whats-really-going-on-inside-an-llms-neural-network/">its previous research</a> into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-astonished-by-tools-apparent-success-at-revealing-ais-hidden-motives/">AI interpretability</a> with <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection">a new study that aims to measure LLMs’ actual so-called “introspective awareness” of their own inference processes.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/introspection/index.html">full paper on “Emergent Introspective Awareness in Large Language Models”</a> uses some interesting methods to separate out the metaphorical “thought process” represented by an LLM’s artificial neurons from simple text output that purports to represent that process. In the end, though, the research finds that current AI models are “highly unreliable” at describing their own inner workings and that “failures of introspection remain the norm.”</p>
<h2>Inception, but for AI</h2>
<p>Anthropic’s new research is centered on a process it calls “concept injection.” The method starts by comparing the model’s internal activation states following both a control prompt and an experimental prompt (e.g. an “ALL CAPS” prompt versus the same prompt in lower case). Calculating the differences between those activations across billions of internal neurons creates what Anthropic calls a “vector” that in some sense represents how that concept is modeled in the LLM’s internal state.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/llms-show-a-highly-unreliable-capacity-to-describe-their-own-internal-processes/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>President Trump says he still doesn’t know who Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao is, despite having pardoned Zhao last month.</p>
<p>CBS correspondent Norah O’Donnell asked Trump about the pardon in a <em>60 Minutes</em> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/read-full-transcript-norah-odonnell-60-minutes-interview-with-president-trump/">interview</a> that aired yesterday, noting that Zhao pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws. “The government at the time said that C.Z. had caused ‘significant harm to US national security,’ essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around.

                            <![CDATA[<p>You may be disappointed if you go looking for Google’s open Gemma AI model in AI Studio today. Google announced late on Friday that it was pulling Gemma from the platform, but it was vague about the reasoning. The abrupt change appears to be tied to a <a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2025/10/technology/blackburn-demands-answers-from-google-after-gemma-manufactured-fake-criminal-allegations-against-her">letter from Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.)</a>, who claims the Gemma model generated false accusations of sexual misconduct against her.</p>
<p>Blackburn published her letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Friday, just hours before the company announced the change to Gemma availability. She demanded Google explain how the model could fail in this way, tying the situation to ongoing hearings that accuse Google and others of creating bots that defame conservatives.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Google’s Markham Erickson explained that AI hallucinations are a widespread and known issue in generative AI, and Google does the best it can to mitigate the impact of such mistakes. Although no AI firm has managed to eliminate hallucinations, Google’s Gemini for Home has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/10/unexpectedly-a-deer-briefly-entered-the-family-room-living-with-gemini-home/">particularly hallucination-happy</a> in our testing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-removes-gemma-models-from-ai-studio-after-gop-senators-complaint/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>

                            <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/aws-and-openai-partnership/">announced</a> it has signed a seven-year, $38 billion deal to buy cloud services from Amazon Web Services to power products like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/openais-sora-2-lets-users-insert-themselves-into-ai-videos-with-sound/">Sora</a>. It’s the company’s first big computing deal after a fundamental restructuring last week that gave OpenAI more operational and financial freedom from Microsoft.</p>
<p>The agreement gives OpenAI access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processors to train and run its AI models. “Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.”</p>
<p>OpenAI will reportedly use Amazon Web Services immediately, with all planned capacity set to come online by the end of 2026 and room to expand further in 2027 and beyond. Amazon plans to roll out hundreds of thousands of chips, including Nvidia’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">GB200</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-dgx-desktop-personal-ai-supercomputers/">GB300</a> AI accelerators, in data clusters built to power ChatGPT’s responses, generate AI videos, and train OpenAI’s next wave of models.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/openai-signs-massive-ai-compute-deal-with-amazon/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks, copies of an intriguing policy document have started to spread among space lobbyists on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. The document bears the title “Athena,” and it purports to summarize the actions that private astronaut Jared Isaacman would have taken, were his nomination to become NASA administrator confirmed.</p>
<p>The 62-page plan is notable both for the ideas to remake NASA that it espouses as well as the manner in which it has been leaked to the space community.</p>
<p>After receiving a copy of this plan from an industry official, I spoke with multiple sources over the weekend to understand what is happening. Based upon this reporting there are clearly multiple layers to the story, which I want to unpack.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/capitol-hill-is-abuzz-with-talk-of-the-athena-plan-for-nasa/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Last month, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine archived its trillionth webpage, and the nonprofit invited its more than 1,200 library partners and 800,000 daily users to join a celebration of the moment. To honor “three decades of safeguarding the world’s online heritage,” the city of San Francisco declared October 22 to be “Internet Archive Day.” The Archive was also <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/07/24/internet-archive-designated-as-a-federal-depository-library/">recently designated</a> a federal depository library by Sen.

<p>The Internet Archive might sound like a thriving organization, but it only recently emerged from years of bruising copyright battles that threatened to bankrupt the beloved library project.

                            <![CDATA[<p>It’s a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we’ve featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we’re experimenting with a monthly collection. October’s list includes the microstructural differences between regular and gluten-free spaghetti, capturing striking snakes in action, the mystery behind the formation of Martian gullies, and—for all you word game enthusiasts—an intriguing computational proof of the highest possible scoring <em>Boggle</em> board.</p>
<h2>Highest-scoring <em>Boggle</em> board</h2>

<p>Sometimes we get handy story tips from readers about quirkily interesting research projects. Sometimes those projects involve classic games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle"><em>Boggle</em></a>, in which players find as many words as they can from a 4×4 grid of 16 lettered cubic dice, within a given time limit. Software engineer Dan Vanderkam alerted us to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02117">a preprint</a> he posted to the physics arXiv, detailing his quest to find the Boggle board configuration that yields the highest possible score. It’s pictured above, with a total score of 3,625 points, according to Vanderkam’s first-ever computational proof. There are more than 1,000 possible words, with “replastering” being the longest.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/research-roundup-6-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed-3/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Cassandra Clerkin, a mother in upstate New York, first got in touch with Frontline Health Advocates near the start of the 2024–2025 school year, after hearing they had doctors who would write exemptions from school immunization requirements. One of Clerkin’s children, she said, had suffered seizures after receiving a vaccine. The family didn’t want more shots. But New York has some of the country’s strictest school immunization policies.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This week, tech content creators began to suspect that AI was making it harder to share some of the most highly sought-after tech tutorials on YouTube, but now YouTube is denying that odd removals were due to automation.</p>
<p>Creators grew alarmed when educational videos that YouTube had allowed for years were suddenly being bizarrely flagged as “dangerous” or “harmful,” with no clear way to trigger human review to overturn removals. AI seemed to be running the show, with creators’ appeals allegedly getting denied faster than a human could possibly review them.</p>
<p>Late Friday, a YouTube spokesperson confirmed that videos flagged by Ars have been reinstated, promising that YouTube will take steps to ensure that similar content isn’t removed in the future. But, to creators, it remains unclear why the videos got taken down, as YouTube claimed that both initial enforcement decisions and decisions on appeals were not the result of an automation issue.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/youtube-denies-ai-was-involved-with-odd-removals-of-tech-tutorials/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>You’ll often hear plastic pollution referred to as a problem. But the reality is that it’s multiple problems. Depending on the properties we need, we form plastics out of different polymers, each of which is held together by a distinct type of chemical bond. So the method we use to break down one type of polymer may be incompatible with the chemistry of another.</p>
<p>That problem is why, even though we’ve had success finding enzymes that break down common plastics like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/">polyesters</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/researchers-engineer-enzyme-to-break-down-plastic-bottles/">PET</a>, they’re only partial solutions to plastic waste. However, researchers aren’t sitting back and basking in the triumph of partial solutions, and they now have very sophisticated protein design tools to help them out.</p>
<p>That’s the story behind a completely new enzyme that researchers developed to break down polyurethane, the polymer commonly used to make foam cushioning, among other things. The new enzyme is compatible with an industrial-style recycling process that breaks the polymer down into its basic building blocks, which can be used to form fresh polyurethane.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/polyurethane-is-the-latest-polymer-broken-down-by-designer-enzymes/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The company’s flagship product is an IDE modeled after Visual Studio Code in many respects, but with a strong emphasis on vibe coding and heavier direct integration of <span id="_ESYFaejIBrXI0PEPtPSzuA4_99" class="wtBS9">large language model</span>-based tools in the interface and workflow. Since its introduction, Cursor has supported models developed by other companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.

                            <![CDATA[<p>Two Windows vulnerabilities—one a zero-day that has been known to attackers since 2017 and the other a critical flaw that Microsoft initially tried and failed to patch recently—are under active exploitation in widespread attacks targeting a swath of the Internet, researchers say.</p>
<p>The zero-day went undiscovered until <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html">March</a>, when security firm Trend Micro said it had been under active exploitation since 2017, by as many as 11 separate advanced persistent threats (APTs). These APT groups, often with ties to nation-states, relentlessly attack specific individuals or groups of interest. Trend Micro went on to say that the groups were exploiting the vulnerability, then tracked as ZDI-CAN-25373, to install various known post-exploitation payloads on infrastructure located in nearly 60 countries, with the US, Canada, Russia, and Korea being the most common.</p>
<h2>A large-scale, coordinated operation</h2>
<p>Seven months later, Microsoft still hasn’t patched the vulnerability, which stems from a bug in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-shllink/16cb4ca1-9339-4d0c-a68d-bf1d6cc0f943">Windows Shortcut</a> binary format. The Windows component makes opening apps or accessing files easier and faster by allowing a single binary file to invoke them without having to navigate to their locations. In recent months, the ZDI-CAN-25373 tracking designation has been changed to CVE-2025-9491.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/two-windows-vulnerabilities-one-a-0-day-are-under-active-exploitation/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission will vote in November to repeal a ruling that requires telecom providers to secure their networks, acting on a request from the biggest lobby groups representing Internet providers.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2025/10/29/halloween-treats">said</a> the ruling, adopted in January just before Republicans gained majority control of the commission, “exceeded the agency’s authority and did not present an effective or agile response to the relevant cybersecurity threats.” Carr said the vote scheduled for November 20 comes after “extensive FCC engagement with carriers” who have taken “substantial steps… to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses.”</p>
<p>The FCC’s January 2025 <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-25-9A1_Rcd.pdf">declaratory ruling</a> came in response to attacks by China, including the Salt Typhoon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/us-recommends-encrypted-messaging-as-chinese-hackers-linger-in-telecom-networks/">infiltration of major telecom providers</a> such as Verizon and AT&amp;T. The Biden-era FCC found that the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a 1994 law, “affirmatively requires telecommunications carriers to secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/fcc-dumps-plan-for-telecom-security-rules-that-internet-providers-dont-like/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>A measles investigation amid a large, ongoing outbreak at the Arizona-Utah border has hit a roadblock as the first probable case identified in the Salt Lake City area refuses to work with health officials, the local health department reported this week.</p>
<p>There have been over 150 cases collectively across the two states, mostly in northwestern Mohave County, <a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php">Arizona</a>, and the southwest health district of <a href="https://avrpublic.dhhs.utah.gov/uwss/">Utah</a>, in the past two months. Both areas have abysmally low vaccination rates: In Mohave County, only <a href="https://apps.azdhs.gov/IDRREportStats">78.4 percent of kindergartners</a> in the 2024–2025 school year were vaccinated against measles, according to state records. In the southwest district of Utah, <a href="https://immunize-training.at.utah.gov/captivate/UtahSchoolsData_Kinder_UpdatedApr2025.html">only 80.7 percent</a> of kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year had records of measles vaccination. Public health experts say vaccination coverage of 95 percent is necessary to keep the disease from spreading in a community.</p>
<p>While the outbreak has largely exploded along the border, cases are also creeping to the north, toward Salt Lake County, which encompasses the city. Utah County, which sits just south of Salt Lake County, has identified eight cases, including <a href="https://health.utahcounty.gov/2025/10/31/new-measles-case-in-utah-county/">a new case reported today</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/measles-outbreak-investigation-in-utah-blocked-by-patient-who-refuses-to-talk/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The road to the second flight of Blue Origin’s heavy-lifting New Glenn rocket got a lot clearer Thursday night with a success test-firing of the launcher’s seven main engines on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.</p>
<p>Standing on a seaside launch pad, the New Glenn rocket ignited its seven BE-4 main engines at 9:59 pm EDT Thursday (01:59 UTC Friday). The engines burned for 38 seconds while the rocket remained firmly on the ground, according to a <a href="https://x.com/blueorigin/status/1984096485961613559">social media post</a> by Blue Origin.</p>
<p>The hold-down firing of the first stage engines was the final major test of the New Glenn rocket before launch day. Blue Origin previously test-fired the rocket’s second-stage engines. Officials have not announced a target launch date, but sources tell Ars the rocket could be ready for liftoff as soon as November 9.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/blue-origin-test-fires-second-new-glenn-rocket-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>2017 feels like another era these days, but if you cast your mind back that far, you might remember Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s vaporware Roadster 2.0. Full of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/not-just-a-semi-announcement-tesla-promises-a-new-roadster/">nonsensical-sounding features</a> that impressed people who know a little bit about rockets but nothing about cars, the $200,000 electric car promised to have a suction fan and “cold gas thrusters,” plus 620 miles (1,000 km) of range and a whole load of other stuff that’s never happening.</p>
<p>Plenty of other electric automakers have introduced electric hypercars in the eight years since Musk declared the second Roadster a thing, with no sign of it being any closer to reality, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/tesla-roadster-early-development/">if the latest job postings are accurate</a>. And it seems that over time, a lot of the people who gave the company a hefty deposit—some say interest-free loan—have become tired of waiting and want their money back.</p>
<p>And that’s not quite so easy, it turns out. Musk’s current Silicon Valley rival is the latest to discover this. According to Sam Altman’s social media account, he placed an order for a Roadster on July 11, 2018, with a deposit of $45,000 ($58,206 in today’s money). But after emailing Tesla for a refund, he discovered the email address associated with preorders had been deleted.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/sam-altman-wants-a-refund-for-his-50000-tesla-roadster-deposit/">Read full article</a></p>
