              <![CDATA[<p>For a quarter-century, dating back to my time as a budding space enthusiast, I've watched with a keen eye each time people have ventured into space.</p>
<p>That's 162 human spaceflight missions since the beginning of 2000, ranging from Space Shuttle flights to Russian Soyuz missions, Chinese astronauts' first forays into orbit, and commercial expeditions on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Yes, I'm also counting privately funded suborbital hops launched by Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic.</p>
<p>Last week, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin captured headlines—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/so-is-katy-perry-now-an-astronaut-or-what/">though not purely positive</a>—with the launch of six women, including pop star Katy Perry, to an altitude of 66 miles (106 kilometers). The capsule returned to the ground 10 minutes and 21 seconds later. It was the first all-female flight to space since Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's solo mission in 1963.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/a-chinese-born-crypto-tycoon-of-all-people-changed-the-way-i-think-of-space/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A controversial doctor providing unproven measles treatments to unvaccinated children in West Texas recently contracted the highly infectious virus himself amid the mushrooming outbreak—and he continued treating patients while visibly ill with the virus.</p>
<p>The doctor's infection was revealed in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nicole.zahra.5/videos/1196780422448813/"> a video posted online</a> by Children's Health Defense (CHD), the rabid anti-vaccine advocacy organization founded and previously run by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time anti-vaccine advocate who is now the US secretary of health. Kennedy headed CHD until January, when he stepped down in anticipation of his Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>In the video, the doctor, Ben Edwards, can be seen with mild spots on his face. Someone asks him if he caught measles himself, and he responds, "Yeah," saying he was "pretty achy yesterday." He went on to say that he had developed the rash the day before but woke up that day feeling "pretty good." The video was posted by CHD on March 31, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-ben-edwards-2dd7c79d47c64ad2e6d4a4ac3c87ec1f">the Associated Press</a> was the first to report it.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/controversial-doc-gets-measles-while-treating-unvaccinated-kids-keeps-working/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Is there anything more human than gathering in groups to share food and partake in a fermented beverage or two (or three, or....)? Researchers have caught wild chimpanzees on camera engaging in what appears to be similar activity: sharing fermented African breadfruit with measurable alcoholic content. According to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)00281-7">new paper</a> published in the journal Current Biology, the observational data is the first evidence of the sharing of alcoholic foods among nonhuman great apes in the wild.</p>
<p>The fruit in question is seasonal and comes from <em>Treculia africana</em> trees common across the home environment of the wild chimps in Cantanhez National Park in Guinea-Bissau. Once mature, the fruits drop from the tree to the ground and slowly ripen from a hard, deep green exterior to a yellow, spongier texture. Because the chimps are unhabituated, the authors deployed camera traps at three separate locations to record their feeding and sharing behavior.</p>
<p>They recorded 10 instances of selective fruit sharing among 17 chimps, with the animals exhibiting a marked preference for riper fruit. Between April and July 2022, the authors measured the alcohol content of the fruit with a handy portable breathalyzer and found almost all of the fallen fruit (90 percent) contained some ethanol, with the ripest containing the highest levels—the equivalent of 0.61 percent ABV (alcohol by volume).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/are-these-chimps-having-a-fruity-booze-up-in-the-wild/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's possible that the White House may be looking to replace Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after critics warned that a pair of controversial Signal chats risked compromising US national security.</p>
<p>In March, it was revealed that Hegseth <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-secret-bombing-plans-to-a-reporter/">accidentally texted secret bombing plans in a Signal chat</a> that included a reporter, raising alarms about his handling of sensitive military information. And then this weekend, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html">revealed</a> that he similarly shared the attack plans, just minutes after learning of them, in a personal Signal chat that included his wife and brother.</p>
<p>That second revelation sparked a "full-blown meltdown" at the Pentagon, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/21/hegseth-second-signal-chat-pentagon">reported</a>, apparently prompting the Trump administration to begin "the process of looking for a new secretary of defense," a US official granted anonymity <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/21/nx-s1-5371312/trump-white-house-pete-hegseth-defense-department">told NPR</a> Monday.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/white-house-plagued-by-signal-controversy-as-pentagon-in-full-blown-meltdown/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>As the global artificial intelligence (AI) race presses on amid a US-China trade war, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)—a $514 billion titan that manufactures most of the world's AI chips—is warning that it may not be possible to keep its customers' most advanced technology out of China's hands.</p>
<p>US export controls require chipmakers to monitor shipments and know their customers to restrict China's access to AI chips. But in a recently published 2024 <a href="https://investor.tsmc.com/sites/ir/annual-report/2024/2024%20Annual%20Report_E.pdf">report</a>, TSMC confirmed that its "role in the semiconductor supply chain inherently limits its visibility and information available to it regarding the downstream use or user of final products that incorporate semiconductors manufactured by it."</p>
<p>Essentially, TSMC expects that it plays too big a role in the semiconductor industry to stop all the possible unintended end-uses of the semiconductors it manufactures. Similarly, it appears impossible to track all the third parties determined to skirt sanctions. And if TSMC's hands are truly tied, that ultimately means that the US can't effectively stop the latest AI tech from trickling into China.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-cant-keep-china-from-getting-ai-chips-tsmc-suggests/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/microsoft-is-putting-privacy-endangering-recall-back-into-windows-11/">preparing to reintroduce Recall to Windows 11</a>. A feature limited to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">Copilot+ PCs</a>—a label that just a fraction of a fraction of Windows 11 systems even qualify for—Recall has been controversial in part because it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-new-recall-feature-will-record-everything-you-do-on-your-pc/">builds an extensive database of text and screenshots</a> that records almost everything you do on your PC.</p>
<p>But the main problem with the initial version of Recall—the one that was delayed at the last minute after a large-scale outcry from security researchers, reporters, and users—was not <em>just</em> that it recorded everything you did on your PC but that it was a rushed, enabled-by-default feature with gaping security holes that made it trivial for anyone with any kind of access to your PC to see your entire Recall database.</p>
<p>It made no efforts to automatically exclude sensitive data like bank information or credit card numbers, offering just a few mechanisms to users to manually exclude specific apps or websites. It had been built quickly, outside of the normal extensive Windows Insider preview and testing process. And all of this was happening at the same time that the company was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/microsoft-in-damage-control-mode-says-it-will-prioritize-security-over-ai/">pledging to prioritize security over all other considerations</a>, following several <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/microsoft-cloud-security-blasted-for-its-culture-of-toxic-obfuscation/">serious and highly public breaches</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/in-depth-with-windows-11-recall-and-what-microsoft-has-and-hasnt-fixed/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The remedy phase of Google's search antitrust trial is getting underway, and the government is seeking to force major changes. The next few weeks could reshape Google as a company and significantly alter the balance of power on the Internet, and both sides have a plan to get their way.</p>
<p>With opening arguments beginning today, the US Justice Department will seek to convince the court that Google should be forced to divest Chrome, unbundle Android, and make other foundational changes. But Google will attempt to paint the government's position as too extreme and rooted in past grievances. No matter what happens at this trial, Google hasn't given up hope it can turn back time.</p>
<h2>Advantage for Justice Dept.</h2>
<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has a major advantage here: Google is guilty. It <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">lost the liability phase</a> of this trial resoundingly, with the court finding Google violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by "willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power." As far as the court is concerned, Google has an illegal monopoly in search services and general search advertising. The purpose of this trial is to determine what to do about it, and the DOJ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/welcome-to-googles-nightmare-us-reveals-plan-to-destroy-search-monopoly/">has some ideas</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Ask ChatGPT anything lately—how to poach an egg, whether you should hug a cactus—and you may be greeted with a burst of purple praise: “Good question! You’re very astute to ask that.” To some extent, ChatGPT has been a sycophant <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sycophancy-generative-ai-chatbots/">for years</a>, but since late March, a growing cohort of Redditors, X users, and Ars readers say that GPT-4o's relentless pep has crossed the line from friendly to unbearable.</p>
<p>"ChatGPT is suddenly the biggest suckup I've ever met," <a href="https://x.com/craigzLiszt/status/1913101106206703711">wrote</a> software engineer Craig Weiss in a widely shared tweet on Friday. "It literally will validate everything I say."</p>
<p>"EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1k3anyd/exactly_what_ive_been_saying/">replied</a> a Reddit user who references Weiss' tweet, sparking yet another thread about ChatGPT being a sycophant. Recently, other Reddit users have described feeling "buttered up" and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1k1c309/is_it_just_me_or_has_chatgpt_been_buttering_way/">unable</a> to take the "phony act" anymore, while some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1jx3od0/my_chatgpt_has_become_too_enthusiastic_and_its/">complain</a> that ChatGPT "wants to pretend all questions are exciting and it's freaking annoying."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/annoyed-chatgpt-users-complain-about-bots-relentlessly-positive-tone/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here every Monday morning</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I'd like to personally welcome Andrew and everyone else who didn't play <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/the-last-of-us-part-2-isnt-a-fully-satisfying-return-to-the-apocalypse/">the summer of 2020</a>, when the gaming world was rocked by the most shocking video game character permadeath <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/i-tried-to-jump-back-into-jrpgs-with-ffvii-rebirth-and-that-was-a-big-mistake/">this side of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>.</p>
<p>Before we get into how they changed Joel's pivotal death scene for the TV show, and why I think it doesn't work quite as well here, I'd love to hear more about what was going through your head both as it was happening and after.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: This should, if nothing else, reinforce my bona fides as someone who has not the faintest idea what is coming.</p>
<p>My <em>main</em> reaction is "Boy, Kyle just let me say a whole bunch of things <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/hbos-the-last-of-us-is-back-for-season-2-and-so-are-we/">last week</a> even though clearly he knew this was what was going to happen!" I thought we were watching the opening to a second season of a TV show in the first episode, the establishment of a new status quo that we would then explore over the course of the next few episodes. But we were, instead, playing the tutorial level of a second video game, right before everything blows up.</p>
<p>I was pretty astonished by what the show did to Joel. Not just because I didn't see it coming! But because it leaves the show without one of the two nuanced and well-developed characters we spent all of last season building up. I don't, uh, love it, as a storytelling decision.</p>

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I will say it was hard not even alluding to what was coming last week, but it was also kind of fun just letting you have your last "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2z6xw7/why_do_people_here_say_oh_sweet_summer_child_when/">Sweet Summer Child</a>" moments in the sun. I also felt that Joel's sudden absence hurt the remainder of the game, though based on the storytelling beats we've seen and/or missed so far, I wouldn't be shocked if we have some flashbacks...</p>
<p>Back in 2020, I actually had the shocking moment spoiled by some pretty major leaks that I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/be-warned-massive-the-last-of-us-part-2-spoilers-have-been-leaked/">ended up covering as a journalist</a> weeks before I was able to review the game myself.</p>
<p>Aside from that, though, the show kind of dampens the impact of "The Moment" by making Abby's motivations crystal clear for 1.5 episodes leading up to it. In the game, you actually play as a mostly blank-slate Abby for a few brief scenes before being rescued by Joel. After that, the shocking turnaround plays out as a quick gut punch during a cutscene that has a lot less Abby-monologuing than the show did.</p>
<p>The game doesn't fill in the details about the "why" of it all for the audience until much later, which makes the whole thing that much more impactful. But maybe the showrunners figured that since the game already exists, it would be hard to keep the audience off balance like that for weeks when they could just look up what was going on...</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: The monologuing was off-putting, honestly, and gets to the heart of what I'm concerned about. I'll refrain from speculating a ton about a game whose plot it would take me about 30 seconds to look up and read, but I'm not particularly excited to watch Ellie chase down this generically angst-ridden fresh-faced former Firefly? Does the show now need to be carried by a bunch of the Jackson Hole characters we just met? None of these possibilities are as interesting to me as watching Joel and an adult Ellie deal with their issues.</div>

      Ellie will probably be just fine after all this, right?

<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, I don't think it's spoiling much to say that Joel and Ellie's relationship carried the first game, and now it's obvious that Ellie's hunt for revenge is going to attempt to carry the second. It's a rough shift that I don't think did the second game any favors, personally.</p>
<p>The game goes to a lot of trouble to literally put you in Abby's shoes and eventually tries to try to make her own revenge saga feel a little more earned. Here, I feel like the show is being a bit more blunt about selling you her backstory at the front end and attempting to "justify" her brutal turn toward Joel somewhat in advance.</p>
<p>I wondered if you found yourself sympathizing at all with her character at this point.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Obviously what Joel did to the Fireflies is awful, maybe unforgiveable. Beyond the lie to Ellie, there's a strong possibility that he deprived humanity of a cure for the disease causing the very-much-ongoing apocalypse.</p>
<p>But, like, no! I don't sympathize with Abby! Not only is she driven solely by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I73sP93-0xA">this bland Inigo Montoya thing</a>, but she sadistically tortures someone who just saved her stupid life, brutalizing Joel so much that it drives her also-supposedly-revenge-driven Firefly friends to tears. If I'm supposed to sympathize with her, the show did pretty much everything possible to make sure I don't.</p>
<p>On paper, what Joel did is probably way worse, but we've also been primed by a whole season of TV (and by the charm of Pedro Pascal) to try and understand why he did what he did. None of this is really happening with Abby.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle">
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, "supposed to sympathize with her" is a bit too strong, perhaps, especially at this point in the narrative. But I do think the show is trying to make her actions at least feel partially justified or understandable? It will be interesting to see how the show handles turning her into a more fleshed out character, because at this point, her revenge quest feels a bit mustache-twirling to me.</p>
<p>Backing up a bit, this episode also featured a huge set-piece zombie horde battle that ruins the brief calm we enjoyed in Jackson Hole. The scene played out so much like a video game mission that I had to go back and make sure I hadn't forgotten about some major Jackson Hole firefight in the game. But no, this is a pure creation of the show.</p>
<p>I think the whole thing worked pretty well both as a reminder of the precarity of the vestiges of human civilization and an excuse for some flashy special effects. I also thought for a second that they were actually going to kill off Tommy so the show had its own totally unexpected death, even for people who had played the game. That couple of minutes with the flamethrower was actually tense for me!</p>

<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Maybe Abby will become more fleshed-out, and maybe she won't. But she's started by making the exact same mistake as Joel: leaving witnesses.</p>
<p>I did enjoy the zombie battle a lot. The liquid churn of the snow as a million guys burst out from under it: creepy! Good on the show and HBO for figuring out a way to do a snowy zombie horde fight without making it feel too reminiscent of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>
<p>I will, again, refrain from speculating overmuch about where the Jackson Hole storyline goes since I'm not even sure at this point how much time will be spent on the aftermath and rebuilding (if there is rebuilding rather than further societal collapse). I did find myself wondering during the flamethrower scene whether roasted mushroom guy smelled appetizing or whether people in this world can even bring themselves to enjoy mushrooms on a pizza or in an omelette.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: I bet eating a normal mushroom in <em>The Last of Us</em> universe is akin to eating a hallucinogenic mushroom in the real world. A little bit of a dangerous taboo for iconoclastic rulebreakers to show they're open-minded.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c">
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: We've established that I have no idea what is going to happen next, but we do have dangling threads here to deal with next week. How do the residents of Jackson Hole deal with the fungus in their pipes? How many people try to talk Ellie out of her revenge tour before she goes off and does it anyway? How are the Smart Zombies we met last week going to come back and cause problems? How many more Abby flashbacks will I need to sit through?</p>
<p>But above all, I'm really curious to know what the show is going to do to keep game-players like yourself on your toes.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Last season we got <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/hbos-the-last-of-us-tries-a-little-tenderness-in-a-surprising-episode-3/">the surprising "Nick Offerman's life of love among the zombies" story</a> as the third episode, and I wouldn't mind a similar out of nowhere left turn to wash out Joel's death this time around. I'm not saying that <em>has</em> to take the form of what would be a stunning, unexpected, and completely illogical return of Offerman's Bill character. But if that is what the show decides to do, I would not complain.</div>

              <![CDATA[<p>The Formula 1 race in Saudi Arabia last night was the fifth race in six weeks. The latest venue is a temporary street circuit of a breed with Las Vegas. It's a nighttime race set against a backdrop of bright-colored lights and sponsor-clad concrete walls lining the track. Except in Jeddah, many of the corners are blind, and most are very fast. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/f1-in-japan-reminds-us-a-great-track-might-not-make-for-a-great-race/">As at Suzuka</a>, qualifying was very important here, with just a few milliseconds making the difference.</p>
<p>Although it's far from the only autocratic petrostate on the F1 calendar, some people remain uncomfortable with F1 racing in Saudi Arabia, given that country's record of human rights abuses. I've not been, nor do I have any plans to attend a race there, but <a href="https://hsouthwellfe.medium.com/what-its-actually-like-to-visit-riyadh-alone-for-formula-e-ce88cfc0f4cd">I had my eyes opened</a> to a broader perspective by a <a href="https://www.racefans.net/2020/11/07/ive-been-to-races-in-saudi-arabia-heres-why-i-dont-oppose-its-grand-prix/">couple of very thoughtful pieces</a> written by motorsport journalist and sometime Ars contributor Hazel Southwell, who has attended several races in the kingdom, including as an independent journalist.

<h2>Red Bull really doesn’t want next year’s engine rules</h2>
<p>Despite a meeting last week that was meant to put the matter to bed, the ongoing saga of changes to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/lighter-nimbler-more-hybrid-power-he-f1-car-of-2026/">next year's powertrain rules</a> just won't go away. From 2026 until 2030, the new powertrains will use a V6 that provides 55 percent of the car's power and an electric hybrid motor that provides the other 45 percent. So that means an F1 car will only be able to make its full 1,000 hp (750 kW) if there's charge in the battery. If the pack is depleted or derates, the car will have just 536 hp (400 kW) from its V6 engine.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/f1-in-saudi-arabia-blind-corners-and-walls-at-over-200-mph/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Like giant bones planted in the earth, clusters of tree trunks, stripped clean of bark, are appearing along the Chesapeake Bay on the United States’ mid-Atlantic coast. They are ghost forests: the haunting remains of what were once stands of cedar and pine. Since the late 19th century, an ever-widening swath of these trees have died along the shore. And they won’t be growing back.</p>
<p>These arboreal graveyards are showing up in places where the land slopes gently into the ocean and where salty water increasingly encroaches. Along the United States’ East Coast, in pockets of the West Coast, and elsewhere, saltier soils have killed hundreds of thousands of acres of trees, leaving behind woody skeletons typically surrounded by marsh.</p>
<p>What happens next? That depends. As these dead forests transition, some will become marshes that maintain vital ecosystem services, such as buffering against storms and storing carbon. Others may become home to invasive plants or support no plant life at all—and the ecosystem services will be lost. Researchers are working to understand how this growing shift toward marshes and ghost forests will, on balance, affect coastal ecosystems.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/ghost-forests-are-growing-as-sea-levels-rise/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Whether anything ever lived on Mars is unknown. And the present environment, with harsh temperatures, intense radiation, and a sparse atmosphere, isn’t exactly propitious for life. Despite the red planet’s brutality, lichens that inhabit some of the harshest environments on Earth could possibly survive there.</p>
<p>Lichens are symbionts, or two organisms that are in a cooperative relationship. There is a fungal component (most are about 90 percent fungus) and a photosynthetic component (algae or cyanobacteria). To see if some species of lichen had what it takes to survive on Mars, a team of researchers led by botanist Kaja Skubała used the Space Research Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences to expose the lichen species <i>Diploschistes muscorum </i>and <i>Cetrarea aculeata</i> to simulate Mars conditions.</p>
<p>“Our study is the first to demonstrate that the metabolism of the fungal partner in lichen symbiosis was active while being in a Mars-like environment,” the researchers said in a <a href="https://imafungus.pensoft.net/article/145477/">study</a> recently published in IMA Fungus. “X-rays associated with solar flares and SEPs reaching Mars should not affect the potential habitability of lichens on this planet.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/lichens-can-survive-almost-anything-and-some-might-survive-mars/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Google's history with music services is almost as convoluted and frustrating as its history with messaging. However, things have gotten calmer (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/youtube-music-continues-glacial-development-pace-adds-background-playback/">and slower</a>) ever since Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/youtube-music-will-replace-google-play-music-but-wont-kill-user-uploads/">ceded music to the YouTube division</a>. The YouTube Music app has its share of annoyances, to be sure, but it's getting a long-overdue feature that users have been requesting for ages: consistent volume.</p>
<p>Listening to a single album from beginning to end is increasingly unusual in this age of unlimited access to music. As your playlist wheels from one genre or era to the next, the inevitable vibe shifts can be grating. Different tracks can have wildly different volumes, which can be shocking and potentially damaging to your ears if you've got your volume up for a ballad only to be hit with a heavy guitar riff after the break.</p>
<p>The gist of consistent volume is simple—it normalizes volume across tracks, making the volume roughly the same. Consistent volume builds on a feature from the YouTube app called "stable volume." When Google released stable volume for YouTube, it noted that the feature would <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14106294?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">continuously adjust volume</a> throughout the video. Because of that, it was disabled for music content on the platform.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/youtube-music-gets-consistent-volume-option-to-save-your-ears/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>This week's flight of the New Shepard spacecraft, NS-31, and its all-female crew has stirred up a mess of coverage, from tabloids to high-brow journalism outlets. And why not? Six women, led by superstar Katy Perry, were flying into space!</p>
<p>By contrast, Ars Technica has been largely silent. Why? Because yet another suborbital flight on New Shepard matters little in the long arc of spaceflight history. Beyond that, I did not want to be too negative about someone else's happiness, especially since it was privately funded. Live and let live, and all of that.</p>
<p>However, if I'm being frank, this flight and its breathless promotion made me uncomfortable. Let me explain. Perhaps the most important change in spaceflight over the last two decades has been the rise of commercial spaceflight, which is bringing down the cost of access to space and marks an essential step to humanity becoming a spacefaring species. This rising tide has been spurred in large part by billionaires, particularly Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and, to a lesser extent, Richard Branson.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/so-is-katy-perry-now-an-astronaut-or-what/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>When it comes to actually storing the numerical weights that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/">power a large language model's underlying neural network</a>, most modern AI models rely on the precision of 16- or 32-bit <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/11/21/floating-point-precision/">floating point numbers</a>. But that level of precision can come at the cost of large memory footprints (in the hundreds of gigabytes for the largest models) and significant processing resources needed for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/matrix-multiplication-breakthrough-could-lead-to-faster-more-efficient-ai-models/">the complex matrix multiplication</a> used when responding to prompts.</p>
<p>Now, researchers at Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/general-artificial-intelligence/">General Artificial Intelligence group</a> have <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T">released a new neural network model</a> that works with just three distinct weight values: -1, 0, or 1. Building on top of previous work Microsoft Research <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453">published in 2023</a>, the new model's "ternary" architecture reduces overall complexity and "substantial advantages in computational efficiency," the researchers write, allowing it to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet">run effectively on a simple desktop CPU</a>. And despite the massive reduction in weight precision, the researchers claim that the model "can achieve performance comparable to leading open-weight, full-precision models of similar size across a wide range of tasks."</p>
<h2>Watching your weights</h2>
<p>The idea of simplifying model weights isn't a completely new one in AI research. For years, researchers have been experimenting with <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/concept_guides/quantization">quantization techniques</a> that squeeze their neural network weights into smaller memory envelopes. In recent years, the most extreme quantization efforts have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453">focused on so-called "BitNets"</a> that represent each weight in a single bit (representing +1 or -1).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/microsoft-researchers-create-super%e2%80%91efficient-ai-that-uses-up-to-96-less-energy/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Popular NAS-maker Synology has confirmed and slightly clarified <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/synology-could-bring-certified-drive-requirements-to-more-nas-devices/">a policy that appeared on its German website</a> earlier this week: Its <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products?product_line=ds_plus">"Plus" tier of devices</a>, starting with the 2025 series, will require Synology-branded hard drives for full compatibility, at least at first.</p>
<p>"Synology-branded drives will be needed for use in the newly announced Plus series, with plans to update the Product Compatibility List as additional drives can be thoroughly vetted in Synology systems," a Synology representative told Ars by email. "Extensive internal testing has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and ongoing compatibility issues."</p>
<p>Without a Synology-branded or approved drive in a device that requires it, NAS devices could fail to create storage pools and lose volume-wide deduplication and lifespan analysis, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-eu/company/news/article/DACH_VL_plus/Synology%20is%20increasingly%20relying%20on%20its%20own%20ecosystem%20for%20upcoming%20Plus%20models">Synology's German press release stated</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>For those of us whose memory of high school biology hasn't faded entirely, planarians will probably sound very familiar. They're generally used as an example of one of the extreme ends of regenerative capacity. While some animals like mammals have a limited ability to regenerate lost tissues, planarians can be cut roughly in half and regenerate either an entire head or entire tail, depending on which part of the body you choose to keep track of.</p>
<p>In doing so, they have to re-establish something that is typically only needed early in an animal's development: a signaling system that helps tell cells where the animal's head and tail are. Now, a US-based team asked a question that I'd never have thought of: What happens if you cut the animal in half early in development, while the developmental head-to-tail signaling system is still active? The answer turned out to be surprisingly complex.</p>
<h2>Heads or tails?</h2>
<p>Planarians are small flatworms that would probably be living quiet lives somewhere if biologists hadn't discovered their ability to regenerate lots of adult tissues when damaged. The process has been well-studied by this point and involves the formation of a cluster of stem cells, called a blastema, at the site of damage. From there, many of the signals that control the formation of specialized tissues in the embryo get re-activated, directing the stem cells down the developmental pathways needed to reproduce any lost organs.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/to-regenerate-a-head-you-first-have-to-know-where-your-tail-is/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a <em>Black Mirror</em>-esque turn, some cash-strapped actors who didn't fully understand the consequences are regretting selling their likenesses to be used in AI videos that they consider embarrassing, damaging, or harmful, AFP <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/04/17/tech/ai-sale-regret/">reported</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Among them is a 29-year-old New York-based actor, Adam Coy, who licensed rights to his face and voice to a company called MCM for one year for $1,000 without thinking, "am I crossing a line by doing this?" His partner's mother later found videos where he appeared as a doomsayer predicting disasters, he told the AFP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">South Korean actor Simon Lee's AI likeness was similarly used to spook naïve Internet users but in a potentially more harmful way. He told the AFP that he was "stunned" to find his AI avatar promoting "questionable health cures on TikTok and Instagram," feeling ashamed to have his face linked to obvious scams.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/regrets-actors-who-sold-ai-avatars-stuck-in-black-mirror-esque-dystopia/">Read full article</a></p>
