<p>During a news conference on Wednesday, NASA officials for the first time publicly discussed divisions within the agency about whether the Starliner spacecraft is really reliable enough to return two veteran astronauts—Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams—back to Earth from the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The space agency also confirmed key elements exclusively reported by Ars over the last week, chiefly that NASA has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/yes-nasa-really-could-bring-starliners-astronauts-back-on-crew-dragon/">quietly been working for weeks</a> with SpaceX on a potential rescue mission for Wilmore and Williams, that the Crew-9 mission launch has been delayed to September 24 to account for this possibility, and that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/nasa-likely-to-significantly-delay-the-launch-of-crew-9-due-to-starliner-issues/">Starliner is unable to undock autonomously</a> with the current software configuration on the vehicle.</p>
<p>The chief of space human spaceflight operations for NASA, former astronaut Ken Bowersox, said no final decisions have been made on how Wilmore and Williams return to Earth. He said there were reasonable disagreements among engineers at NASA, which is the customer for the spaceflight, and Boeing, which developed and operates Starliner, about the viability of the 28 reaction control system thrusters that are used for delicate maneuvering and pointing of the vehicle.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041586#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041586&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>At 1:18 pm ET on July 21, 2023, President Joe Biden stepped to the podium in the White House's Roosevelt Room and announced, "I'm the AI." The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/07/21/remarks-by-president-biden-on-artificial-intelligence/">official transcript</a> of the event says that this remark was followed by "laughter," but it's no joke to the increasing number of conspiracy theorists who claim that the real Joe Biden has been somehow replaced by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>For instance, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/technology/biden-conspiracy-theories-misinformation.html">new story published today</a>, The New York Times looked at conspiracy theorists who questioned whether (or even claimed that) Biden had died. Of course, if he was dead, the cabal of elites running the Biden administration, in true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_at_Bernie%27s"><em>Weekend at Bernie's</em></a> fashion, certainly couldn't <em>admit</em> that he was dead. Fortunately, they could use AI to make it look like Biden was still alive!</p>
<p>That sort of thinking led to one influencer's "just asking questions" post on July 24, 2024, which was viewed 78,000 times: “What If [sic] during this supposed live broadcast to the nation the holographic AI glitches and Joe Biden dissappears [sic] for a few seconds now that we know the software they have been using in Azure has been compromised?”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041714#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041714&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A deadly outbreak of <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox">mpox</a> (previously called monkeypox) is spilling out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, raising alarm among global health experts.</p>
<p>The DRC has reported more than 22,000 suspected cases since the start of 2023, including 1,200 suspected deaths, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/outbreak/2023-drc.html">according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. A high proportion of the cases are in children younger than 15 years old.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp">the CDC released a health advisory</a> noting that although mpox is endemic to the DRC, the current outbreak is larger and more widespread than any outbreak the country has previously seen. The virus has also spilled over to several neighboring countries in recent months, including the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. The World Health Organization reported that cases have also been detected in Kenya.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041729#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041729&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yesterday, The Walt Disney company announced it will soon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/so-tired-disney-hulu-espn-prices-increase-by-up-to-25-percent-in-october/">raise prices for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+</a>. Today<strong>,</strong> it revealed that its streaming business has become profitable for the first time.</p>
<p>So if Disney is starting to make money, why has it decided to jack up prices ...<em>again</em>?</p>
<h2>Disney says it has “earned” higher prices</h2>
<p>On October 17, pricing for ad and ad-free subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ will increase by as much as 25 percent, depending on the plan (you can see a breakdown of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/so-tired-disney-hulu-espn-prices-increase-by-up-to-25-percent-in-october/">pricing changes here</a>).

<p>Over the past week, OpenAI experienced a significant leadership shake-up as three key figures announced major changes. Greg Brockman, the company's president and co-founder, is taking an extended sabbatical until the end of the year, while another co-founder, John Schulman, permanently <a href="https://x.com/johnschulman2/status/1820610863499509855">departed</a> for rival Anthropic. Peter Deng, VP of Consumer Product, has <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/trio-of-leaders-leave-openai">also left</a> the ChatGPT maker.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Brockman <a href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1820644694264791459">wrote</a>, "I'm taking a sabbatical through end of year. First time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago. The mission is far from complete; we still have a safe AGI to build."</p>
<p>The moves have led some to <a href="https://x.com/slow_developer/status/1820821208700420109">wonder</a> just how close OpenAI is to a long-rumored breakthrough of some kind of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/openai-reportedly-nears-breakthrough-with-reasoning-ai-reveals-progress-framework/">reasoning artificial intelligence</a> if high-profile employees are jumping ship (or taking long breaks, in the case of Brockman) so easily. As AI developer Benjamin De Kraker <a href="https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/1820633405244969250">put it</a> on X, "If OpenAI is right on the verge of AGI, why do prominent people keep leaving?"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041450#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041450&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After US District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">Google has a monopoly in two markets</a>—general search services and general text advertising—everybody is wondering how Google might be forced to change its search business.</p>
<p>Specifically, the judge ruled that Google's exclusive deals with browser and device developers secured Google's monopoly. These so-called default agreements funneled the majority of online searches to Google search engine result pages (SERPs), where results could be found among text ads that have long generated the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/#:~:text=Advertising%20accounts%20for%20the%20majority,revenue%20comes%20from%20search%20advertising.">bulk of Google's revenue</a>.</p>
<p>At trial, Mehta's ruling noted, it was estimated that if Google lost its most important default deal with Apple, Google "would lose around 65 percent of its revenue, even assuming that it could retain some users without the Safari default."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041575#p3">Read 62 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041575&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has always been easier to run third-party software on a Mac than on an iPhone or iPad. Despite the introduction of the Mac App Store a couple of years after the iPhone's App Store opened, it has always been possible to download and run third-party scripts and software on your Mac from anywhere. It's one reason why the iPhone <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/05/apple-must-open-ipados-to-sideloading-within-6-months-eu-says/">and iPad</a> are subject to new European Union regulations about software sideloading and third-party app stores, while the Mac isn't.</p>

<p>That's not changing in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-announces-macos-15-sequoia/">macOS 15 Sequoia</a>, the new version of macOS that's due to be released to the public this fall. But it <em>is</em> about to get more annoying for some apps, according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=saqachfa">a note</a> added to Apple's developer site yesterday.</p>
<p>"In macOS Sequoia, users will no longer be able to Control-click to override Gatekeeper when opening software that isn’t signed correctly or notarized," the brief note reads. "They’ll need to visit System Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security to review security information for software before allowing it to run."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041568#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041568&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reddit executives discussed plans on Tuesday for making more money from the platform, including showing ads in more places and possibly putting some content behind a paywall.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Reddit shared its Q2 2024 earnings report (<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Reddit-Announces-Second-Quarter-2024-Results-2024.pdf">PDF</a>). The company lost $10.1 million during the period, down from Q2 2023’s $41.1 million loss. Reddit has never been profitable, and during its earnings call yesterday, company heads discussed potential and slated plans for monetization.</p>
<p>As expected, selling ads continues to be a priority. Part of the reason Reddit was OK with most <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/exploring-reddits-third-party-app-environment-7-months-after-the-apicalypse/">third-party Reddit apps</a> closing was that the change was expected to drive people to Reddit’s native website and apps, where the company sells ads. In Q2, Reddit’s ad revenue grew 41 percent year over year (YoY) to $253.1 million, or 90 percent of total revenue ($281.2 million).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041507#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041507&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple has always been eager to dump technologies when the company feels they have outlived their usefulness. The original iMac came without a floppy drive. The iPhone 7 came without a headphone jack. Mid-2010s MacBooks and MacBook Pros came with USB-A ports. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/02/macbook-air-review/">the original 2008 MacBook Air</a> came without a built-in optical drive for CDs and DVDs. By the time 2012 and 2013 Macs rolled around, products from the iMac to the MacBook Pro followed suit.</p>
<p>These exclusions have often made Apple's devices thinner, lighter, sleeker, or some combination of all three. But they've also meant that people who still <em>needed</em> those technologies also needed to deal with dongles, adapters, or clunky external accessories hanging off their devices. For the MacBook Air and other modern Macs that needed to read or burn optical discs, that clunky accessory was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/06/macbook-air-superdrive-modified-for-use-with-any-machine/">Apple's SuperDrive</a>, an external DVD burner that connected via USB.</p>
<p>After 16 years of availability, it looks like the SuperDrive's run could be coming to an end. As noticed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-superdrive-could-be-discontinued/">MacRumors</a>, the drive's status has shifted to "<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive">sold out</a>" in Apple's online store, a more definitive and permanent-sounding label than the "currently unavailable" status assigned to some other out-of-stock products.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041391#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041391&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Public sentiment on the importance of safe, lifesaving childhood vaccines has significantly declined in the US since the pandemic—which appears to be solely due to a nosedive in support from people who are Republican or those who lean Republican, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx">according to new polling data from Gallup.</a></p>
<p>In 2019, 52 percent of Republican-aligned Americans said it was "extremely important" for parents to get their children vaccinated. Now, that figure is 26 percent, falling by half in just five years. In comparison, 63 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners said it was "extremely important" this year, down slightly from 67 percent in 2019.</p>
<p>Overall, only 40 percent of Americans now say it is extremely important for parents to vaccinate their children, down from 58 percent in 2019 and 64 percent in 2001.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041522#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041522&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft says that Delta Air Lines' ancient IT infrastructure is to blame for the airline's inability to quickly recover from last month's CrowdStrike debacle.</p>
<p>With Delta threatening to sue Microsoft and CrowdStrike, both companies issued responses saying that Delta refused repeated calls for help. A <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-06-msft-letter-to-delta.pdf">Microsoft letter to Delta</a> yesterday said the Windows maker is starting to figure out why Delta took longer than other airlines to recover.</p>
<p>"Microsoft continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding the CrowdStrike incident to understand why other airlines were able to fully restore business operations so much faster than Delta, including American Airlines and United Airlines," the letter from Microsoft attorney Mark Cheffo said. "Our preliminary review suggests that Delta, unlike its competitors, apparently has not modernized its IT infrastructure, either for the benefit of its customers or for its pilots and flight attendants."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041521#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041521&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Particle physics is poised to hit the bright lights of Broadway with the adaptation into a musical of the 2013 documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_Fever"><em>Particle Fever</em></a>, which charts the journey to detect the Higgs boson at the world's largest particle accelerator. <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/particle-fever-broadway-1236032476/">According to Deadline Hollywood</a>, the creators described their musical as being filled with “heart, humor, and hope,” calling it an “exploration of the very nature of exploration itself... <em>Particle Fever</em> proves that even the very best theories are often no match for reality.”</p>
<p><strong>(Spoiler: Physicists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/07/cern-celebrates-as-higgs-signal-reaches-significance/">discovered</a> the Higgs boson in 2012.)</strong></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins University's David Kaplan was a film student turned theoretical physicist when he came up with the idea for a documentary on the search for the Higgs boson—at the time, the last remaining piece of the Standard Model of Particle Physics yet to be detected. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was designed for that purpose, although the physics community hoped (in vain thus far) to also discover exciting new physics.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041370#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041370&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The landmark antitrust ruling against Google on Monday is shaking up one of the longest-standing partnerships in tech.</p>
<p>At the heart of the case are billions of dollars’ worth of exclusive agreements Google has inked over the years to become the default search engine on browsers and devices across the world. No company benefited more than fellow Big Tech giant Apple—which US District Judge Amit Mehta called a “crucial partner” to Google.</p>
<p>During a weekslong trial, Apple executives showed up to explain and defend the partnership. Under a deal that first took shape in 2002, Google paid a cut of search advertising revenue to Apple to direct its users to Google Search as default, with payments reaching $20 billion for 2022, according to the court’s findings. In exchange, Google got access to Apple’s valuable user base—more than half of all search queries in the US currently flow through Apple devices.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041480#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041480&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chinese officials have long signaled their interest in deploying a satellite network, or maybe several, to beam broadband Internet signals across China and other nations within its sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Two serious efforts are underway in China to develop a rival to SpaceX's Starlink network, which the Chinese government has banned in its territory. The first batch of 18 satellites for one of those Chinese networks launched into low-Earth orbit Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Long March 6A rocket delivered the 18 spacecraft into a polar orbit following liftoff at 2:42 am EDT (06:42 UTC) from the Taiyuan launch base in northern China's Shanxi province. The Long March 6A is one of China's newest rockets—and the country's first to employ strap-on solid rocket boosters—with the ability to deploy a payload of up to 4.5 metric tons (9,900 pounds) into a 700-kilometer (435-mile) Sun-synchronous orbit.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041402#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041402&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            This is Google's new streaming box, the Google TV Streamer. It's meant to sit on your media console instead of hanging from your TV's USB port like the Chromecast.                          [credit:

<p>Google is discontinuing the Chromecast brand and pulling its Chromecast hardware off the market after 11 years, but it's not leaving the streaming-device business.</p>
<p>Rather, it's launching a new product called the Google TV Streamer that competes with high-end streaming boxes like the Apple TV or the Roku Ultra.</p>
<p>The new device is not a direct replacement for the Chromecast dongles, though, as it has a different design and is substantially more expensive. Google is replacing 2020's $50 4K Chromecast with Google TV USB dongle with an HDMI set-top box that costs $100.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041337#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041337&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASA on Tuesday <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/08/06/nasa-adjusts-crew-9-launch-date-for-operational-flexibility/">confirmed</a> that it is delaying the launch of its next astronaut mission to the International Space Station, Crew 9, until at least September 24. This is a significant slip from the previous date of August 18.</p>
<p>The space agency said the delay was necessary for "operational flexibility" as it continues to deliberate on the viability of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. In the release, NASA stated, "This adjustment allows more time for mission managers to finalize return planning for the agency’s Boeing Crew Flight Test currently docked to the orbiting laboratory."</p>
<p>NASA also cited other reasons for the delay, including a deconfliction of traffic at the space station, such as a Soyuz launch scheduled for mid-September.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041400#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041400&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Students in Singapore are scrambling after a security breach wiped notes and all other data from school-issued iPads and Chromebooks running the mobile device management app Mobile Guardian.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mobile-guardian-application-remove-cybersecurity-incident-moe-4526676">news reports</a>, the mass wiping came as a shock to multiple students in Singapore, where the Mobile Guardian app has been the country’s official mobile device management provider for public schools <a href="https://www.mobileguardian.com/mobile-guardian-appointed-official-singapore-moe-vendor/">since 2020</a>. Singapore’s Ministry of Education <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20240805-mobile-guardian-device-management-application-to-be-removed-from-personal-learning-devices">said Monday</a> that roughly 13,000 students from 26 secondary schools had their devices wiped remotely in the incident. The agency said it will remove the Mobile Guardian from all iPads and Chromebooks it issues.</p>
<h2>Second breach in 4 months</h2>
<p>Also on Monday, Mobile Guardian revealed its platform had been breached in a “security incident that affected users globally, including on the North America, European, and Singapore instances. This resulted in a small percentage of devices to be unenrolled from Mobile Guardian and their devices wiped remotely. There is no evidence to suggest that the perpetrator had access to users’ data.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041407#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041407&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Colorado judge has ordered a couple to pay more than $950 million for allegedly giving grieving families urns full of fake ashes and running a bug-infested funeral home facility where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/horrifying-funeral-home-ordered-to-pay-950m-over-fake-ashes-rotting-bodies/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1">190 improperly stored bodies</a> were found in various states of decay.</p>
<p>The judgment was issued in a civil class-action lawsuit against Jon and Carie Hallford, who owned the Return to Nature Funeral Home in Penrose, Colorado. It is the first high-profile case against the couple to return a ruling.</p>
<p>The bodies and the extent of the couple's alleged fraud were discovered late last year after area residents reported a<a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/10/stench-leads-officials-to-189-rotting-corpses-at-taxidermists-funeral-home/"> putrid stench emanating from the Penrose facility</a>. The discovery sparked a massive investigation that came to include local, state, and federal investigators and responders. The FBI deployed a team of agents trained to respond to mass casualty events, such as airline crashes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041392#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041392&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elon Musk's X Corp. today sued the World Federation of Advertisers and several large corporations, claiming they "conspired, along with dozens of non-defendant co-conspirators, to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue" from the social network formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>"We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war," Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1820849880283107725">wrote</a> today, a little over eight months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/elon-musk-on-x-antisemitism-controversy-dont-advertise-go-f-yourself/">telling boycotting advertisers</a> to "go fuck yourself."</p>

The other defendants are Unilever PLC; Unilever United States; Mars, Incorporated; CVS Health Corporation; and Ørsted A/S. Those companies are all members of GARM. X itself is still <a href="https://wfanet.org/leadership/garm/members-governance">listed</a> as one of the group's members.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041383#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041383&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the parent of a younger child, I can tell you that getting a kid to respond the way you want can require careful expectation-setting. Especially when we’re trying something new for the first time, I find that the more detail I can provide, the better he is able to anticipate events and roll with the punches.</p>
<p>I bring this up because testers of the new Apple Intelligence AI features in the recently released macOS Sequoia beta have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/1ehivcp/comment/lfzi379/">discovered plaintext JSON files</a> that list a whole bunch of conditions meant to keep the generative AI tech from being unhelpful or inaccurate. I don’t mean to humanize generative AI algorithms, because they don’t deserve to be, but the carefully phrased lists of instructions remind me of what it’s like to try to give basic instructions to (or explain morality to) an entity that isn’t quite prepared to understand it.</p>
<p>The files in question are stored in the <code>/System/Library/AssetsV2/com_apple_MobileAsset_UAF_FM_GenerativeModels/purpose_auto</code> folder on Macs running the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta that have also opted into the Apple Intelligence beta. That folder contains 29 <code>metadata.json</code> files, several of which include a few sentences of what appear to be plain-English <a href="https://promptengineering.org/system-prompts-in-large-language-models/">system prompts</a> to set behavior for an AI chatbot powered by a large-language model (LLM).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041307#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041307&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
