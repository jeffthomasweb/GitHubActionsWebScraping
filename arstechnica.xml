              <![CDATA[<p>Many animals, including humans, have developed a taste for alcohol in some form, but excessive consumption often leads to adverse health effects. One exception is the Oriental wasp. According to a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2410874121">new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, these wasps can guzzle seemingly unlimited amounts of ethanol regularly and at very high concentrations with no ill effects—not even intoxication. They pretty much drank honeybees used in the same experiments under the table.</p>
<p>“To the best of our knowledge, Oriental hornets are the only animal in nature adapted to consuming alcohol as a metabolic fuel," <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1062781">said co-author Eran Levin</a> of Tel Aviv University. "They show no signs of intoxication or illness, even after chronically consuming huge amounts of alcohol, and they eliminate it from their bodies very quickly."</p>
<p>Per Levin et al., there's a <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/drunken-monkey-hypothesis-was-booze-an-advantage-for-our-ancestors">"drunken monkey" theory</a> that predicts that certain animals well-adapted to low concentrations of ethanol in their diets nonetheless have adverse reactions at higher concentrations. Studies have shown that tree shrews, for example, can handle concentrations of up to 3.8 percent, but in laboratory conditions, when they consumed ethanol in concentrations of 10 percent or higher, they were prone to liver damage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/these-hornets-break-down-alcohol-so-fast-that-they-cant-get-drunk/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The large language model-based coding assistant GitHub Copilot will switch from using exclusively OpenAI's GPT models to a multi-model approach over the coming weeks, GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke announced in a <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/bringing-developer-choice-to-copilot/">post on GitHub's blog</a>.</p>
<p>First, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet will roll out to Copilot Chat's web and VS Code interfaces over the next few weeks. Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro will come a bit later.</p>
<p>Additionally, GitHub will soon add support for a wider range of OpenAI models, including GPT o1-preview and o1-mini, which are intended to be stronger at advanced reasoning than GPT-4, which Copilot has used until now. Developers will be able to switch between the models (even mid-conversation) to tailor the model to fit their needs—and organizations will be able to choose which models will be usable by team members.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/github-copilot-moves-beyond-openai-models-to-support-claude-3-5-gemini/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Readers of those <em>other sites</em> may not care much about font size and column widths. "40-character line lengths? In 18-point Comic Sans? I love it!" they say. But not you, because you are an Ars reader. And Ars readers are discerning. They have <em>feelings</em> about concepts like "information density." And we want those feelings to be soft and cuddly ones.</p>
<p>That's why we're today rolling out version 9.0.2 of the Ars Technica site redesign, based on your continued feedback, with a special emphasis on text control. (You can read about the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/ars-9-0-1-redesign-is-now-live-with-density-tweaks-and-visited-link-colors/">changes in 9.0.1</a> here.) That's right—we're talking about <em>options</em>! Font size selection, colored hyperlink text, even a wide column layout for subscribers who plonk down a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/store/product/subscriptions/">mere $25/year</a> (possible because we don't need to accommodate ads for subs).</p>
<p>Here's a quick visual look at some of the main changes:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/10/the-ars-redesign-9-0-2-brings-the-text-options-youve-requested/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Recently, construction company ICON announced that it is close to completing the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/worlds-largest-3d-printed-neighborhood-nears-completion-texas-2024-08-08/">world’s largest 3D-printed neighborhood</a> in Georgetown, Texas. This isn’t the only 3D-printed housing project. Hundreds of 3D-printed homes are under construction in the US and Europe, and more such housing projects are in the pipeline.</p>
<p>There are many factors fueling the growth of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/texas-to-get-100-3d-printed-homes-as-builders-seek-to-solve-worker-shortages/">3D printing</a> in the construction industry. It reduces the construction time; a home that could take months to build can be constructed within days or weeks with a 3D printer. Compared to traditional methods, 3D printing also reduces the amount of material that ends up as waste during construction. These advantages lead to reduced labor and material costs, making 3D printing <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/3d-printing-can-solution-nations-affordable-housing-crisis-rcna10725">an attractive choice</a> for construction companies.</p>
<p>A team of researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, however, claims to have developed a robotic construction method that is even better than 3D printing. They call it <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2024/09/shooting-not-printing-new-robotic-building-method.html">impact printing</a>, and instead of typical construction materials, it uses Earth-based materials such as sand, silt, clay, and gravel to make homes. According to the researchers, impact printing is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/the-road-to-low-carbon-concrete/">less carbon-intensive</a> and much more sustainable and affordable than 3D printing.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/impact-printing-is-a-cement-free-alternative-to-3d-printed-structures/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Each refuses to be blamed for Delta's substantial losses following a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">global IT outage</a> caused by CrowdStrike suddenly pushing a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/crowdstrike-blames-testing-bugs-for-security-update-that-took-down-8-5m-windows-pcs/">flawed security update</a> despite Delta and many other customers turning off auto-updates.</p>
<p>CrowdStrike has since given customers more control over updates and made other commitments to ensure an outage of that scale will never happen again, but Delta isn't satisfied. The airline has accused CrowdStrike of willfully causing losses by knowingly deceiving customers by failing to disclose an unauthorized door into their operating systems that enabled the outage.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/crowdstrike-accuses-delta-of-blaming-its-own-it-failures-on-global-outage/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The rise of powerful generative AI models in the last few years has led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/report-google-ads-restructure-could-replace-some-sales-jobs-with-ai/">plenty</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/ibm-pauses-hiring-around-7800-roles-that-could-be-replaced-by-ai/">stories</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-took-my-job-literally-gizmodo-fires-spanish-staff-amid-switch-to-ai-translator/">corporations</a> trying to use AI to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/generative-ai-set-to-affect-300-million-jobs-across-major-economies/">replace human jobs</a>. But a recent New York Times story highlights the other side of that coin, where AI models simply become a powerful tool aiding in work that still requires humanity's unique skillset.</p>
<p>The NYT piece in question isn't directly about AI at all. As the headline <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/28/us/politics/inside-the-movement-behind-trumps-election-lies.html">"Inside the Movement Behind Trump’s Election Lies"</a> suggests, the article actually reports in detail on how the ostensibly non-partisan Election Integrity Network "has closely coordinated with the Trump-controlled Republican National Committee." The piece cites and shares recordings of group members complaining of "the left" rigging elections, talking of efforts to "put Democrats on the defensive," and urging listeners to help with Republican turnout operations.</p>
<p>To report the piece, the Times says it sifted through "over 400 hours of conversations" from weekly meetings by the Election Integrity Network over the last three years, as well as "additional documents and training materials." Going through a trove of information that large is a daunting prospect, even for the team of four bylined reporters credited on the piece. That's why the Times says in a note accompanying the piece that it "used artificial intelligence to help identify particularly salient moments" from the videos to report on.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/the-new-york-times-shows-how-ai-can-aid-reporters-without-replacing-them/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Today, Polestar electric vehicles gained access to the Tesla Supercharger network. That means US Polestar drivers have access to 17,800 more DC fast chargers than they did yesterday—once they get a NACS adapter, which can also be ordered today from their local Polestar service point. But right now, Polestar has bigger worries than expanding its charging options. Should <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/us-to-ban-chinese-connected-car-software-and-hardware-citing-security-risks/">proposed new rules banning Chinese connected-car software and hardware</a> go into effect, they would effectively ban the automaker from the US market, the company says, including the EVs it builds in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The rule would ban Chinese connected-car software from US roads from model-year 2027 (midway through 2026) and Chinese connected car hardware from model-year 2030.</p>
<p>The ban on Chinese connected-car technology is the latest in a series of protectionist moves from the federal government and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/ban-chinese-electric-vehicles-now-demands-us-senator/">Congress</a>. The revamped <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml">clean vehicle tax credit</a> no longer applies to EVs made in China or with Chinese components in their battery packs, and the US Commerce Department <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/chinese-ev-makers-wont-get-subsidies-from-mexico-after-us-pressure/">has been pressuring</a> Mexico to not offer generous incentives to Chinese automakers looking to set up shop nearby. Chinese-made EVs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/biden-set-to-levy-100-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-this-week/">have also been subject to a 100 percent tariff</a> since May.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/ban-on-chinese-tech-so-broad-us-made-cars-would-be-blocked-polestar-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apple-teases-week-of-announcements-about-the-mac-starting-on-monday/">week of Mac announcements continues today</a>, and as expected, we're getting a substantial new update to the Mac mini. Apple's least-expensive Mac, the mini, is being updated with new M4 processors, plus a smaller design that looks like a cross between an Apple TV box and a Mac Studio—this is the mini's first major design change since <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/112588">the original aluminum version</a> was released in 2010. The mini is also Apple's first device to ship with the M4 Pro processor, a beefed-up version of the M4 with more CPU and GPU cores, and it's also the Mac mini's first update since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/m2-pro-mac-mini-review-apples-goldilocks-desktop-for-semi-professionals/">the M2 models came out in early 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The cheapest Mac mini will still run you $599, which includes 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; as with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apples-1299-m4-imac-at-long-last-bumps-the-base-model-to-16gb-of-ram/">yesterday's iMac update</a>, this is the first time since 2012 that Apple has boosted the amount of RAM in an entry-level Mac. It's a welcome upgrade for every new Mac in the lineup that's getting it, but the $200 that Apple previously charged for the 16GB upgrade makes an even bigger difference to someone shopping for a $599 system than it does for someone who can afford a $999 or $1,299 computer.</p>
<p>The M4 Pro Mac mini starts at $1,399, a $100 increase from the M2 Pro version. Both models <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini">go up for preorder today</a> and will begin arriving on November 8.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apples-first-mac-mini-redesign-in-14-years-looks-like-a-big-aluminum-apple-tv/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Zettabytes—that’s 10<sup>21</sup> bytes—of data are currently generated every year. All of those cat videos have to be stored somewhere, and DNA is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/04/microsoft-experiments-with-dna-storage-1000000000-tb-in-a-gram/">great storage medium</a>; it has amazing data density and is stable over millennia.</p>
<p>To date, people have encoded information into DNA the same way nature has, by linking the four nucleotide bases comprising DNA—A, T,  C, and G—into a particular genetic sequence. Making these sequences is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/researchers-build-a-metadata-based-image-database-using-dna-storage/">time-consuming and expensive</a>, though, and the longer your sequence, the higher chance there is that errors will creep in.</p>
<p>But DNA has an added layer of information encoded on top of the nucleotide sequence, known as epigenetics. These are chemical modifications to the nucleotides, specifically altering a C when it comes before a G. In cells, these modifications function kind of like stage directions; they can tell the cell when to use a particular DNA sequence without altering the “text” of the sequence itself. A new paper in Nature describes using epigenetics to store information in DNA without needing to synthesize new DNA sequences every time.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-can-you-write-data-to-dna-without-changing-the-base-sequence/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>News and talk of GLP-1 drugs are everywhere these days—from their smash success in treating Type 2 diabetes and obesity to their astronomical pricing, drug shortages, compounding disputes, and what sometimes seems like an ever-growing list of other conditions the drugs could potentially treat. There are new headlines every day.</p>
<p>Although the drugs have abruptly stolen the spotlight in recent years, researchers have been toiling away at developing and understanding them for decades, stretching back to the 1970s. Despite all the time and effort, the drugs still hold mysteries and unknowns. For instance, researchers thought for years that they worked directly in the gut to decrease blood sugar levels and make people feel full. After all, the drugs mimic an incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1, that does exactly that. But, instead, studies have since found that they work in the brain.</p>
<p>In fact, the molecular receptors for GLP-1 are sprinkled in many places around the body. They're found in the central nervous system, the heart, blood vessels, liver, and kidney. Their presence in the brain even plays a role in inflammation. As such, research on GLP-1 continues to flourish as scientists work to understand the role it could play in treating a range of other chronic conditions.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/ars-live-join-us-tuesday-as-we-discuss-glp-1-drugs-insights-and-unknowns/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>For those who follow NASA's human spaceflight program, when the Orion spacecraft's heat shield cracked and chipped away during atmospheric reentry on the unpiloted Artemis I test flight in late 2022, what caused it became a burning question.</p>
<p>Multiple NASA officials said Monday they now know the answer, but they're not telling. Instead, agency officials want to wait until more reviews are done to determine what this means for Artemis II, the Orion spacecraft's first crew mission around the Moon, officially scheduled for launch in September 2025.</p>
<p>"We have gotten to a root cause," said Lakiesha Hawkins, assistant deputy associate administrator for NASA's Moon to Mars program office, in response to a question from Ars on Monday at the Wernher von Braun Space Exploration Symposium in Huntsville, Alabama.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/for-some-reason-nasa-is-treating-orions-heat-shield-problems-as-a-secret/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>The history of the Silk Road, a vast network of ancient and medieval trade routes connecting Beijing and Hangzhou with Constantinople and Cairo, has mostly been focused on its endpoints: China and the West. Less was known about the people and cultures the traders encountered along the way. Given the length of the route, there must have been a lot of encounters. Traders passed through large cities like Tehran or Baghdad, which we know very well because they still stand today. They also crossed the Tien Shan, the largest east-west mountain range on the planet.</p>
<p>“People thought these mountains were just places the caravans had to cross and get through but not really a major contributor to commerce themselves,” says Michael Frachetti, an anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis, who led a team that used drone-based lidar to map two mountainous cities at the western end of Tien Shan in the modern-day Uzbekistan. Both were built over 2,000 meters above sea level like Machu Picchu or Lhasa, Tibet. One of them, the Tugunbulak, was larger than Siena, one of the most influential city-states in medieval Italy.</p>
<h2>Into the mountains</h2>
<p>“The Silk Road was a complicated complex representing in some cases actual pathways the caravans could traverse, but also general exchange between East Asia and Europe. If you ask me, as an archeologist, the foundations of Silk Road can be traced back to the Bronze Age. But the peak of this exchange we date to the medieval period, between the 6th century and the 11th century,” says Frachetti.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/lidar-mapping-reveals-mountainous-medieval-cities-along-the-silk-road/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Apple will adapt the classic educational game <em>The Oregon Trail</em> into a big-budget movie, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oregon-trail-movie-apple-1236045454/">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a> (THR).</p>
<p>The film is in early development, having just been pitched to Apple and approved. Will Speck and Josh Gordon (<em>Blades of Glory</em>, <em>Office Christmas Party</em>) will direct and produce. Given that pedigree (zany comedies), it's clear this film won't be a serious historical drama about the struggles of those who traveled the American West.</p>
<p>In fact, the report not only notes that it will be a comedy—it says it will be a musical, too. "The movie will feature a couple of original musical numbers in the vein of <em>Barbie</em>," according to THR's sources. EGOT winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul will be responsible for the original music in the film.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/apple-is-turning-the-oregon-trail-into-a-movie/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, Microsoft came out guns blazing, posting a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/10/28/googles-shadow-campaigns/">blog</a> accusing Google of "dishonestly" funding groups conducting allegedly biased studies to discredit Microsoft and mislead antitrust enforcers and the public.</p>
<p>In the blog, Microsoft lawyer Rima Alaily alleged that an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturf group</a> called the Open Cloud Coalition will launch this week and will appear to be led by "a handful of European cloud providers." In actuality, however, those smaller companies were secretly recruited by Google, which allegedly pays them "to serve as the public face" and "obfuscate" Google's involvement, Microsoft's blog said. In return, Google likely offered the cloud providers cash or discounts to join, Alaily alleged.</p>
<p>The Open Cloud Coalition is just one part of a "pattern of shadowy campaigns" that Google has funded, both "directly and indirectly," to muddy the antitrust waters, Alaily alleged. The only other named example that Alaily gives while documenting this supposed pattern is the US-based Coalition for Fair Software Licensing (CFSL), which Alaily said has attacked Microsoft's cloud computing business in the US, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/google-accused-of-shadow-campaigns-redirecting-antitrust-scrutiny-to-microsoft/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Dozens of people in Wisconsin have been sickened and at least five needed emergency medical services after inadvertently eating pizza tainted with Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive compound in cannabis, <a href="https://publichealthmdc.com/news/2024-10-24/public-cautioned-to-throw-out-thc-contaminated-pizza-from-famous-yetis-pizza-in">officials of Public Health Madison &amp; Dane County reported late Friday</a>.</p>
<p>The contamination, which health officials called "unintentional," occurred at Famous Yeti’s Pizza in Stoughton between October 22 and October 24. In a news release, the local health department advised customers to throw away any pizza they had from the restaurant during that time period.</p>
<p>"We want to be sure anyone who has this pizza on hand throws it away so they don't get sick," Bonnie Armstrong, director of Environmental Health at Public Health Madison &amp; Dane County, said in the release. "If you ate the pizza and are experiencing THC-related symptoms, please contact your health care provider or call 911 if your symptoms worsen."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/thc-tainted-pizza-sickens-dozens-in-wisc-owner-blames-oil-bottle-mix-up/">Read full article</a></p>

"These accessories now come with USB-C ports, so users can charge all of their favorite devices with just a single cable," Apple writes in announcing its new M4-powered iMac, in the way that only Apple can, suggesting that something already known to so many is, when brought into Apple's loop, notable and new.</p>
<p>Apple's shift from its own Lightning connector, in use since 2012, to USB-C was sparked by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/iphones-to-require-usb-c-charging-by-2024-under-eu-agreement/">European Union policies enacted in 2022</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>In recent years, materials scientists experimenting with ceramics have started adding an oxidized form of graphene to the mix to produce ceramics that are tougher, more durable, and more resistant to fracture, among other desirable properties. Researchers at the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed a new method that uses ultrasound to more evenly distribute graphene oxide (GO) in ceramics, according to a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.4c05798">new paper</a> published in the journal ACS Omega. And as a bonus, they collaborated with an artist who used the resulting ceramic tiles to create a unique art exhibit at the NUS Museum—a striking merger of science and art.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/graphene-veils-may-hold-the-secret-to-conserving-priceless-works-of-art/">reported previously</a>, graphene is the thinnest material yet known, composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. That structure gives it many unusual properties that hold great promise for real-world applications: batteries, super capacitors, antennas, water filters, transistors, solar cells, and touchscreens, just to name a few.</p>
<p>In 2021, scientists found that this wonder material might also provide a solution to the fading of colors of many artistic masterpieces. For instance, several of Georgia O'Keeffe's oil paintings housed in the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico, have developed tiny <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/for-journalists/press-kits/2019-aaas-conference/georgia-okeeffe/">pin-sized blisters</a>, almost like acne, for decades. Conservators have found similar deterioration in oil-based masterpieces across all time periods, including works by Rembrandt.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/graphene-enhanced-ceramic-tiles-make-striking-art/">Read full article</a></p>

The iPhone, iPad, and Mac updates are focused on bringing the first AI features the company has marketed as "Apple Intelligence" to users.</p>
<p>Once they update, users with supported devices in supported regions can enter a waitlist to begin using the first wave of Apple Intelligence features, including writing tools, notification summaries, and the "reduce interruptions" focus mode.</p>
<p>In terms of features baked into specific apps, Photos has natural language search, the ability to generate memories (those short gallery sequences set to video) from a text prompt, and a tool to remove certain objects from the background in photos. Mail and Messages get summaries and smart reply (auto-generating contextual responses).</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/apple-releases-ios-18-1-macos-15-1-with-apple-intelligence/">Read full article</a></p>
