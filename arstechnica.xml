<p>Amazon Prime Video subscribers will see new types of advertisements this <a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/broadcast-year#:~:text=More%20Definitions%20of%20Broadcast%20Year,September%20of%20the%20following%20year.">broadcast year</a>. Amazon announced today that it's adding new ad formats to its video streaming service, hoping to encourage people to interact with the ads and shop on Amazon.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-jacks-up-price-of-ad-free-prime-video-by-2-99-starting-in-2024/">Prime Video streams included commercials</a> unless subscribers paid $3 extra per month. That has meant that watching stuff on Prime Video ad-free costs $12 per month or, if you're also a Prime subscriber, $18 per month.</p>
<h2>New types of Prime Video ads</h2>
<p>Amazon has heightened focus on streaming ads this year. Those who opted for Prime Video with commercials will soon see shoppable carousel ads, interactive pause ads, and interactive brand trivia ads, as Amazon calls them. Amazon said that advertisers could buy these new displays to be shown "across the vast majority of content on Prime Video, wherever it’s streamed." All the new ad formats allow a viewer to place advertised products in their Amazon cart.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022688#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022688&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the US moves toward criminalizing deepfakes—deceptive AI-generated audio, images, and videos that are increasingly hard to discern from authentic content online—tech companies have rushed to roll out tools to help everyone better detect AI content.</p>
<p>But efforts so far have been imperfect, and experts fear that social media platforms may not be ready to handle the ensuing AI chaos during major global elections in 2024—despite <a href="https://www.aielectionsaccord.com/uploads/2024/02/Press-Release-AI-Elections-Accord-16-Feb-2024.pdf">tech giants committing</a> to making tools specifically to combat AI-fueled election disinformation. The best AI detection remains observant humans, who, by paying close attention to deepfakes, can pick up on flaws like AI-generated people with extra fingers or AI voices that speak without pausing for a breath.</p>
<p>Among the splashiest tools announced this week, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online">shared</a> details today about a new AI image detection classifier that it claims can detect about 98 percent of AI outputs from its own <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/">sophisticated image generator, DALL-E 3</a>. It also "currently flags approximately 5 to 10 percent of images generated by other AI models," OpenAI's blog said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022700#p3">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022700&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One Raspberry Pi often leads to another. Soon enough, you're running out of spots in your free RealVNC account for your tiny boards and "real" computers. Even if you go the hardened route of SSH or an X connection, you have to keep track of where they all are. All of this is not the easiest thing to tackle if you're new to single-board computers or just eager to get started.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/">Raspberry Pi Connect</a>, a new built-in way to access a Rasbperry Pi from nearly anywhere you can open a browser, whether to control yourself or provide remote assistance. On a Raspberry Pi 4, 5, or Pi 400 kit, you install Pi connect with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html">a single terminal line</a>, reboot the Pi, and then click a new tray icon to connect the Pi to <a href="https://id.raspberrypi.com/sign-up">a Raspberry Pi ID</a> (and then enable two-factor authentication, of course).</p>
<p>From then on, visiting <a href="http://connect.raspberrypi.com">connect.raspberrypi.com</a> gives you an encrypted connection to your desktop. It's a direct connection if possible, and if not, it runs through relay servers in London, encrypting it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security">DTLS</a> and keeping only the metadata needed for the service to work. The Pi will show a notification in its tray that somebody has connected, and you can manage screen sharing from there. The Pi's docs site has <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html">a lot more on the particulars</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022695#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022695&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Panera Bread will stop selling its highly caffeinated "Charged" drinks, which have been the subject of at least three lawsuits and linked to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/12/man-dies-on-way-home-from-panera-after-having-three-charged-lemonades/">at least two deaths</a>.</p>
<p>It is unclear when exactly the company will pull the plug on the potent potables, but in a statement to Ars Tuesday, Panera said it was undergoing a "menu transformation" that includes an "enhanced beverage portfolio." The company plans to roll out various new drinks, including a lemonade and tea, but a spokesperson confirmed that the new flavors would not contain added caffeine as the "charged" drinks did.</p>
<p>The fast-casual cafe-style chain <a href="https://www.today.com/food/restaurants/panera-charged-lemonade-caffeine-viral-tiktok-rcna62126">drew national attention in 2022</a> for the unexpectedly high caffeine levels in the drinks, which were initially offered as self-serve with free refills.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022740#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022740&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Apple has a new lineup of iPad Pro and Air models for the first time in well over a year. Most people would probably be hard-pressed to tell the new ones from the old ones just by looking at them, but after hands-on sessions with both sizes of both tablets, the small details (especially for the Pros) all add up to a noticeably refined iPad experience.</p>
<h2>iPad Airs: Bigger is better</h2>
<p>But let's begin with the new Airs since there's a bit less to talk about. The 11-inch iPad Air (technically the sixth-generation model) is mostly the same as the previous-generation A14 and M1 models, design-wise, with identical physical dimensions and weight. It's still the same slim-bezel design Apple introduced with the 2018 iPad Pro, just with a 60 Hz LCD display panel and Touch ID on the power button rather than Face ID.</p>

<p>So when Apple says the device has been "redesigned," the company is mainly referring to the fact that the webcam is now mounted on the long edge of the tablet rather than the short edge. This makes its positioning more laptop-y when it's docked to the Magic Keyboard or some other keyboard.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022530#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022530&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Since at least 2019, a shadowy figure hiding behind several pseudonyms has publicly gloated for extorting millions of dollars from thousands of victims he and his associates had hacked. Now, for the first time, “LockBitSupp” has been unmasked by an international law enforcement team, and a $10 million bounty has been placed for his arrest.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350921/dl">indictment</a> unsealed Tuesday, US federal prosecutors unmasked the flamboyant persona as Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, a 31-year-old Russian national. Prosecutors said that during his five years at the helm of LockBit—one of the most prolific ransomware groups—Khoroshev and his subordinates have extorted $500 million from some 2,500 victims, roughly 1,800 of which were located in the US. His cut of the revenue was allegedly about $100 million.</p>
<h2>Damage in the billions of dollars</h2>
<p>“Beyond ransom payments and demands, LockBit attacks also severely disrupted their victims' operations, causing lost revenue and expenses associated with incident response and recovery,” federal prosecutors wrote. “With these losses included, LockBit caused damage around the world totaling billions of US dollars. Moreover, the data Khoroshev and his LockBit affiliate co-conspirators stole—containing highly sensitive organizational and personal information—remained unsecure and compromised in perpetuity, notwithstanding Khoroshev’s and his co-conspirators' false promises to the contrary.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022656#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022656&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has introduced a GPT-4-based generative AI model designed specifically for US intelligence agencies that operates disconnected from the Internet, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/microsoft-creates-top-secret-generative-ai-service-for-us-spies">Bloomberg report</a>. This reportedly marks the first time Microsoft has deployed a major language model in a secure setting, designed to allow spy agencies to analyze top-secret information without connectivity risks—and to allow secure conversations with a chatbot similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/bing-chat-is-now-microsoft-copilot-in-potentially-confusing-rebranding-move/">Microsoft Copilot</a>. But it may also mislead officials if not used properly due to inherent design limitations of AI language models.</p>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">GPT-4</a> is a large language model (LLM) created by OpenAI that attempts to predict the most likely tokens (fragments of encoded data) in a sequence. It can be used to craft computer code and analyze information. When configured as a chatbot (like ChatGPT), GPT-4 can power AI assistants that converse in a human-like manner. Microsoft has a license to use the technology as part of a deal in exchange for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/openai-and-microsoft-reaffirm-shared-quest-for-powerful-ai-with-new-investment/">large investments</a> it has made in OpenAI.</p>
<p>According to the report, the new AI service (which does not yet publicly have a name) addresses a growing interest among intelligence agencies to use generative AI for processing classified data, while mitigating risks of data breaches or hacking attempts. ChatGPT normally  runs on cloud servers provided by Microsoft, which can introduce data leak and interception risks. Along those lines, the CIA <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-26/cia-builds-its-own-artificial-intelligence-tool-in-rivalry-with-china">announced</a> its plan to create a ChatGPT-like service last year, but this Microsoft effort is reportedly a separate project.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022611#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022611&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TikTok and its owner ByteDance today sued the federal government to block the "Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications" law that would prohibit TikTok in the US if the company isn't sold to a non-Chinese firm. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861.1208620273.1.pdf">complaint</a> in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit alleges that the law is unconstitutional and asks for a court order prohibiting enforcement.</p>
<p>TikTok and ByteDance say the law "would allow the government to decide that a company may no longer own and publish the innovative and unique speech platform it created. If Congress can do this, it can circumvent the First Amendment by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down."</p>
<p>The law will "silenc[e] the 170 million Americans who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere," TikTok and ByteDance alleged.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022633#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022633&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The field of dentistry is lagging on adopting evidence-based care and, as such, is rife with overdiagnoses and overtreatments that may align more with the economic pressures of keeping a dental practice afloat than what care patients actually need. At least, that's according to a trio of health and dental researchers from Brazil and the United Kingdom, led by epidemiologist and dentist Paulo Nadanovsky, of the University of the State of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2818193">viewpoint published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>, the researchers point out that many common—nearly unquestioned—practices in dentistry aren't backed up by solid data. That includes the typical recommendation that everyone should get a dental check-up every six months. The researchers note that two large clinical trials failed to find a benefit of six-month check-ups compared with longer intervals that were up to two years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8256238/">A 2020 Cochrane review</a> that assessed the two clinical trials concluded that "whether adults see their dentist for a check‐up every six months or at personalized intervals based on their dentist's assessment of their risk of dental disease does not affect tooth decay, gum disease, or quality of life. Longer intervals (up to 24 months) between check‐ups may not negatively affect these outcomes." The Cochrane reviewers reported that they were "confident" of little to no difference between six-month and risk-based check-ups and were "moderately confident" that going up to 24-month checkups would make little to no difference either.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022607#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022607&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating whether Boeing failed to complete required inspections on 787 Dreamliner planes and whether Boeing employees falsified aircraft records, the agency said this week. The investigation was launched after an employee reported the problem to Boeing management, and Boeing informed the FAA.</p>
<p>"The FAA has opened an investigation into Boeing after the company voluntarily informed us in April that it may not have completed required inspections to confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliner airplanes," the FAA said in a statement provided to Ars today.</p>
<p>The FAA said it "is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records. At the same time, Boeing is reinspecting all 787 airplanes still within the production system and must also create a plan to address the in-service fleet." The agency added that it "will take any necessary action—as always—to ensure the safety of the flying public."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022583#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022583&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2020, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/you-can-help-medical-science-just-by-playing-a-new-borderlands-mini-game/">a new minigame appeared</a> in the video game <em>Borderlands 3</em>, located in the resident scientist’s laboratory on the spaceship <em>Sanctuary III</em>.  Although the arcade game may seem like just another way to pass in-game time, the tile-matching puzzle game—<a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/news/borderlands-science/"><i>Borderlands Science</i></a>—has allowed millions of players to help map the human gut microbiome.</p>
<p><em>Borderlands Science</em> is one of the first examples of a citizen science game being embedded in a mainstream video game; it translates players’ tile matching into sequence alignment of microbial DNA strands that encode ribosomal RNA. Ultimately, this can help deduce the genetic relationships between different gut microbes—crucial information for demystifying the complex web of interactions among diet, disease, and microbiome.</p>
<p>Since launch, over 4 million gamers have played <em>Borderlands Science</em>, collectively solving over 100 million puzzles, making this one of the largest citizen science projects ever. Not only has the game generated huge player engagement, but the results have outperformed state-of-the-art computational methods, according to an analysis of the project published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02175-6%23">Nature Biotechnology</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022489#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022489&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An anti-vaccine doctor best known for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/08/ohio-doc-who-said-vaccines-magnetized-people-loses-medical-license/">losing her medical license</a> after falsely claiming that COVID-19 vaccines cause people to become magnetic and "interface" with 5G towers, has had her medical license restored, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Sherri Tenpenny, an osteopathic doctor in the Cleveland area, beamed into the national spotlight in June 2021 while giving repelling testimony before state lawmakers about COVID-19 vaccine recipients. "I'm sure you've seen the pictures all over the Internet of people who have had these shots and now they're magnetized," Tenpenny said in her viral testimony. "You can put a key on their forehead—it sticks. You can put spoons and forks all over and they can stick because now we think there is a metal piece to that."</p>
<p>Her testimony was in support of a bill that would largely ban vaccine mandates in Ohio. The bill never made it out of committee. But the state's medical board opened an investigation the next month. The board intended to ask Tenpenny a variety of questions, including about her statements "regarding COVID-19 vaccines causing people to become magnetized or creating an interface with 5G towers… and regarding some major metropolitan areas liquefying dead bodies and pouring them into the water supply," according to <a href="https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/med.ohio.gov/formala/34003789.pdf">a board report.</a></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022563#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022563&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The federal government has given Tesla quite the homework assignment.

<p>Today is a big event day for Apple, but that doesn't mean Google is going to fade into the background: It's announcing the Pixel 8a today. The big news is that the Pixel a series is still $499 despite some upgrades.</p>
<p>What are those upgrades? How about a 120 Hz display on Google's mid-ranger for the first time? The 6.1-inch, 120 Hz, 2400×1080 display is closer to a flagship than ever, even if it is a smaller phone. You also get flagship-class support with Google's industry-leading seven years of OS updates, so the phone should be good until 2031, if you can hold out that long. Together, these two upgrades make the Pixel 8a an incredible value.</p>
<p>Major news with last year's launch of the Pixel 7a was the older Pixel 6a, which got a big price drop down to $349 when the 7a came out. When asked about a potential Pixel 7a price drop, Google says it "will continue to sell the Pixel 7a" but also that it has "<span class=" "><span class="">no</span> <span class="active">news</span> to announce today on a pricing change."</span> It did feel like the Pixel 6a's price drop <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/pixel-7a-review-more-of-googles-winning-formula/">stole some</a> of the 7a's thunder last year, so maybe Google is giving that announcement some breathing room. <span class=" ">For now, you'll have to think long and hard at checkout and decide between a</span> $499 Pixel 8a and a $499 Pixel 7a. The base model Pixel 8, at $699 with nearly the same specs, is also a tough sell in the face of the Pixel 8a.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022244#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022244&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you don’t follow the ins and outs of pinball, you might be surprised to find out there are more active companies making games in 2024 than ever before.</p>
<p>Stern Pinball is the 800-pound gorilla of the industry. It has been around the longest, has the largest factory, sells the most games, and releases more titles per year than anyone else. For years, it was the sole remaining pinball company in the world.</p>
<p>Now—despite the decline of arcades—pinball is seeing a second life. A passionate collector base dedicates entire game rooms in their homes to machines. Pinball and bars go together so well Stern has a whole video series on “<a href="https://sternpinball.com/brewcadehopping/">brewcade hopping</a>”. There are games in <a href="https://www.revengeof.com">comics shop</a>s. One of my more amazing local spots is in the <a href="https://ontiltpinball.com">back of a Korean BBQ</a>. All this interest has created a thriving pinball ecosystem of boutique makers, where success is often measured in sales of 1,000 machines or fewer. Other pinball companies might not compete with Stern directly by volume, but they do provide a level of competition for ideas that keeps the hobby strong.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022246#p3">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022246&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft is shutting down four studios within its Bethesda Softworks subsidiary, according to a staff email <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">obtained by IGN</a>. The closures include <em>Redfall</em> developer Arkane Austin and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> studio Tango Gameworks. While some team members will be reassigned to other parts of the company, head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said in a letter to staffers "that some of our colleagues will be leaving us."</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks confirmed in <a href="https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189">a short social media message</a> that "<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, along with Tango's previous titles [like <em>The Evil Within</em>], will remain available and playable everywhere they are today." But the closure of Arkane Austin means that "development will not continue on <em>Redfall</em>," the company wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkaneStudios/status/1787837804287860886">in its own social media update</a>. "Arkane Lyon will continue their focus on immersive experiences where they are hard at work on their upcoming project [<a href="https://www.marvel.com/games/marvels-blade">Marvel's <em>Blade</em></a>]."</p>
<p>In his note to staff, Booty said that [<em>Redfall</em>] “will remain online for players to enjoy and we will provide make-good offers to players who purchased the Hero DLC.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022510#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022510&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With new iPads come new keyboards and pencils, and the big news today is the "Apple Pencil Pro," a souped-up version of Apple's iPad stylus. The Pencil Pro is $129 and works with the new iPad Pro and iPad Air.</p>
<p>How much can you improve a stylus? How about rotation detection via a new gyroscope embedded in the pencil? Apple calls this a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ImLlEO90Do">barrel roll</a>," which provides rotation input in your iPad apps. If you're drawing and are using a brush that isn't symmetrical, a barrel roll will change the rotation of the brush. If you have a 3D item out in Procreate, a pencil rotation will rotate the 3D item. Devs can cook up whatever app interactions they can think of with this new feature.</p>
<p>The Pencil is also squeezable now, which can bring up a context menu. It also has haptics embedded in it, so you'll get feedback whenever you squeeze or rotate an item. The Pencil magnetically clips on the side of the iPad for charging, but if you happen to lose it, it will also show up in the Find My app next to all your other Apple things.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022371#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022371&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple is lowering the price of its 10th-generation iPad from $399 to $349, the company announced at its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/what-to-expect-from-apples-may-7-let-loose-event/">Let Loose</a> event today.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/2022-ipad-review-a-half-step-forward-for-apples-basic-tablet/">10th-generation iPad</a> did away with the top and bottom bezels that previous iPads carried. The 10.9-inch tablet also doesn't have a home button, showing Apple, under <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/the-clock-is-rapidly-ticking-on-apples-lightning-charger/">pressure from European Union</a> regulations, moving from a Lightning port to USB-C. It debuted with a $449 starting price in 2022 with an A14 chip.</p>
<p>However, Apple is also doing away with the $329 9th-generation iPad, effectively increasing the price of entry for an iPad.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022463#p3">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022463&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While the past few months have included <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/controller-maker-says-switch-2-will-be-backward-compatible-with-all-switch-games/">plenty</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/report-switch-2-joy-cons-will-attach-via-magnets/">informed speculation</a> about the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/analyst-switch-2-will-have-a-massive-8-inch-lcd-screen/">so-called</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo hasn't given even a bare hint that the system is in the works. That changed at least somewhat last night, as Nintendo President Shinto Furukawa <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197">shared on social media</a> that "we will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year," which ends on March 31, 2025.</p>
<p>In his pre-announcement announcement, Furukawa warned that an upcoming Nintendo Direct presentation planned for June would include "no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor," suggesting more information may be coming closer to the end of the fiscal year than the beginning.</p>
<p>Furukawa notes that the eventual announcement will come over nine years after Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/nintendo-partners-with-dena-to-develop-mobile-phone-games/">first alluded to the Switch's existence</a> with the March 2015 announcement of a console then called "Project NX." Nintendo didn't show that hardware publicly until 19 months later, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/nintendos-next-console-switch-is-a-consoletablet-hybrid/">a three-minute preview trailer that dropped in October 2016</a>. Hands-on press previews for the Switch came <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/hands-on-with-nintendo-switch-jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some/">three months after that</a>, and we then had to wait almost two more months for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/">the console to finally hit store shelves</a> in March of 2017.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022407#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022407&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In a major shake-up of its chip roadmap, Apple has announced a new M4 processor for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/new-ipad-pros-are-the-thinnest-apple-device-ever-feature-dual-oled-screens/">today’s iPad Pro refresh</a>, barely six months after releasing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/review-apples-16-inch-m3-max-macbook-pro-crams-ultra-level-speed-into-a-laptop/">the first MacBook Pros with the M3</a> and not even two months after updating the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/review-apples-efficient-m3-macbook-airs-are-just-about-as-good-as-laptops-get/">MacBook Air with the M3</a>.</p>
<p>Apple says the M4 includes "up to" four high-performance CPU cores, six high-efficiency cores, and a 10-core GPU. Apple's high-level performance estimates say that the M4 has 50 percent faster CPU performance and four times as much graphics performance. Like the GPU in the M3, the M4 also supports hardware-accelerated ray-tracing to enable more advanced lighting effects in games and other apps. Due partly to its "second-generation" 3 nm manufacturing process, Apple says the M4 can match the performance of the M2 while using just half the power.</p>

<p>As with so much else in the tech industry right now, the M4 also has an AI focus; Apple says it's beefing up the 16-core Neural Engine (Apple’s equivalent of the Neural Processing Unit that companies like Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, and Microsoft have been pushing lately). Apple says the M4 runs up to 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS), considerably ahead of Intel's Meteor Lake platform, though a bit short of the 45 TOPS that Qualcomm is promising with the Snapdragon X Elite and Plus series. The M3's Neural Engine is only capable of 18 TOPS, so that's a major step up for Apple's hardware.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022375#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022375&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
