<p>Engineers have determined why NASA's Voyager 1 probe has been transmitting gibberish for nearly five months, raising hopes of recovering humanity's most distant spacecraft.</p>
<p>Voyager 1, traveling outbound some 15 billion miles (24 billion km) from Earth, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/humanitys-most-distant-space-probe-jeopardized-by-computer-glitch/">started beaming unreadable data</a> down to ground controllers on November 14. For nearly four months, NASA knew Voyager 1 was still alive—it continued to broadcast a steady signal—but could not decipher anything it was saying.</p>
<p>Confirming their hypothesis, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California confirmed a small portion of corrupted memory caused the problem. The faulty memory bank is located in Voyager 1's Flight Data System (FDS), one of three computers on the spacecraft. The FDS operates alongside a command-and-control central computer and another device overseeing attitude control and pointing.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015200#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015200&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amylyx, the maker of a new drug to treat ALS, is pulling that drug from the market and laying off 70 percent of its workers after a large clinical trial found that the drug did not help patients, <a href="https://www.amylyx.com/news/amylyx-pharmaceuticals-announces-formal-intention-to-remove-relyvrior/albriozatm-from-the-market-provides-updates-on-access-to-therapy-pipeline-corporate-restructuring-and-strategy">according to an announcement from the company Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>The drug, Relyvrio, won approval from the Food and Drug Administration in September 2022 to slow the progression of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease). However, the data behind the controversial decision was shaky at best; it was based on a study of just 137 patients that had <a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-als-drug">several weaknesses and questionable statistical significance</a>, and FDA advisors initially voted against approval. Still, given the severity of the neurogenerative disease and lack of effective treatments, the FDA ultimately granted approval under the condition that the company was working on a Phase III clinical trial to solidify its claimed benefits.</p>
<p>Relyvrio—a combination of two existing, generic drugs—went on the market with a list price of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/health/relyvrio-price-als-amylyx.html">$158,000</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015321#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015321&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Apple posted its latest update to the App Store's app review and submission policies for developers, it included language that appears to explicitly allow a new kind of app for emulating retro console games.</p>
<p>Apple has long forbidden apps that run code from an external source, but today's announced changes now allow "software that is not embedded in the binary" in certain cases, with "retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games" specifically listed as one of those cases.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Roku TV sets come with ads. Generally, these are restricted to Roku's home and menu screens, its screensavers, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/rokus-new-ad-supported-channel-lets-you-watch-a-bunch-of-movies-for-free/">its first-party video channels</a>, and once you start playing video, the only ads you'll see are the ones from the service you're streaming from. That said, Roku TVs have shown ads <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/some-roku-smart-tvs-are-now-showing-banner-ads-over-live-tv/">atop live TV before</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the company is apparently experimenting with ways to show ads over top of even more of the things you plug into your TV. A <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230388589A1/en">patent</a> from <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/roku-hdmi-ad-insertion-patent">spotted by Lowpass</a> describes a system for displaying ads over any device connected over HDMI, a list that could include cable boxes, game consoles, DVD or Blu-ray players, PCs, or even other video streaming devices. Roku filed for the patent in August 2023 and it was published in November 2023, though it hasn't yet been granted.</p>
<p>The technology described would detect whether content was paused in multiple ways—if the video being displayed is static, if there's no audio being played, if a pause symbol is shown anywhere on screen, or if (on a TV with HDMI-CEC enabled) a pause signal has been received from some passthrough remote control. The system would analyze the paused image and use metadata "to identify one or more objects" in the video frame, transmit that identification information to a network, and receive and display a "relevant ad" over top of whatever the paused content is.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015217#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015217&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_Part_Two"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a> is still raking in the moolah at the box office, and deservedly so. But judging by my various feeds, fans are already swooning over the prospect of director Denis Villeneuve extending his vision into a trilogy by adapting Frank Herbert's 1969 sequel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Messiah"><em>Dune Messiah</em></a>, for the next installment. Will there be a <em>Dune: Part Three</em>? Most signs currently point to yes, with a couple of caveats. Exactly how soon we'll be seeing a return to Arrakis depends a lot on Villeneuve.</p>
<p>Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/dune-3-denis-villeneuve-legendary-nuclear-war-1235960990/">confirmed</a> that Legendary Pictures is working with the director on developing <em>Dune: Part Three</em>, although it remains unclear from the wording of the plethora of news items whether the project has officially been greenlit. ("Development" can mean a lot of things.) Naturally, the studio is eager, as are we: the film is the biggest hit of 2024 thus far, with global earnings of $630 million (although the hotly anticipated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/02/wade-wilson-joins-the-mcu-in-deadpool-and-wolverine-super-bowl-teaser/"><em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em></a> this summer might give it a run for its money).</p>
<p>That confirmation sent fresh <em>frissons</em> of excitement across the Internet, although Villeneuve had been talking about the prospect as far back as <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dune-director-denis-villeneuve-teases-165120139.html">September 2021</a>. Those plans always depended on the success of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/love-blooms-in-the-midst-of-war-in-latest-trailer-for-dune-part-two/"><em>Part Two</em></a>, and that hurdle has obviously been cleared. By August 2023, the director was <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/denis-villeneuve-teases-dune-part-three-dune-messiah-exclusive/">on record saying</a> there were "words on paper" for a third film. And we learned just <a href="https://variety.com/2024/artisans/news/dune-2-hans-zimmer-paul-chani-love-theme-gurneys-song-1235924690/">last month</a> that composer Hans Zimmer was already working on the score for <em>Dune: Part Three</em>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015206#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015206&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla has abandoned plans to develop an affordable electric Model 2, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-scraps-low-cost-car-plans-amid-fierce-chinese-ev-competition-2024-04-05/">a report in Reuters</a>. The news organization says it has reviewed company messages that say the affordable Model Y, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed would sell for $25,000 or less, has been axed.</p>
<p>Musk has been talking about an affordable Tesla Model 2 for some time now. An affordable mass-market EV was supposedly always key to the company's long-term "master plans," and in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2023/12/05/elon-musk-gives-update-on-25k-tesla-model-2---will-blow-peoples-minds/?sh=31ceda1f6513">December 2023</a>, he said the company was working on a "low-cost electric vehicle that will be made at very high volume." Then, <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2024/03/elon-musk-says-tesla-model-2-will-be-built-in-germany-semi-could-be-too/">this March</a>, Musk told Tesla workers that the Model 2 would go into production at the company's factory in Berlin.</p>
<p>In light of this news, that statement certainly raises eyebrows—Reuters reports that one of its three unnamed sources told it that the decision to scrap the Model 2 was made in late February. Instead, Musk is allegedly "all in on robotaxi," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/elon-musk-doubles-down-on-tesla-robotaxis-in-tv-interview/">Tesla's plan to create an autonomous driving system</a> that could allow its cars to compete with Uber or Lyft without a driver in the equation.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015231#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015231&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Schleswig-Holstein, one of Germany’s 16 states, on Wednesday confirmed plans to move tens of thousands of systems from Microsoft Windows to Linux. The announcement follows previously established plans to migrate the state government off Microsoft Office in favor of open source LibreOffice.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2024/04/04/german-state-moving-30000-pcs-to-libreoffice/">The Document Foundation</a>, the government has apparently finished its pilot run of LibreOffice and is now announcing plans to expand to more open source offerings.</p>
<p>In 2021, the state government announced plans to move 25,000 computers to LibreOffice by 2026. At the time, Schleswig-Holstein <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Schleswig-Holsteins-Digitalminister-Albrecht-ueber-den-Wechsel-zu-Open-Source-6221361.html">said</a> it had already been testing LibreOffice for two years.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015137#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015137&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Will Google ever launch its "Find My" network? The Android ecosystem was supposed to have its own version of Apple's AirTags by now. Google has had a crowd-sourced device-tracking network sitting dormant on 3 billion Android phones since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/google-plans-airtag-clone-will-track-devices-with-3-billion-android-phones/">December 2022</a>. Partners have been ready to go with Bluetooth tag hardware since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/bluetooth-tags-for-androids-3-billion-strong-tracking-network-are-here/">May 2023</a>! This was all supposed to launch a year ago, but Google has been in a holding pattern. The good news is we're finally seeing some progress after a year of silence.</p>
<p>The reason for Google's lengthy delay is actually Apple. A week before Google's partners announced their Android network Bluetooth tags, Google and Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/apple-and-google-submit-joint-proposal-to-fight-malicious-use-of-tracking-devices/">jointly announced</a> a standard to detect "unknown" Bluetooth trackers and show users alerts if their phone thinks they're being stalked. Since you can constantly see an AirTag's location, they can be used for stalking by just covertly slipping one into a bag or car; nobody wants that, so everyone's favorite mobile duopoly is teaming up.</p>
<p>Google did its half of this partnership and rolled out AirTag detection in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/android-phones-can-now-tell-you-if-theres-an-airtag-following-you/">July 2023</a>. At the same time, Google also announced: "We’ve made the decision to hold the rollout of the Find My Device network until Apple has implemented protections for iOS." Surely Apple would be burning the midnight oil to launch iOS Android tag detection as soon as possible so that Google could start competing with AirTags.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015125#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015125&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>In some ways, the origin of life is looking much less mystifying than it was a few decades ago. Researchers have figured out how some of the fundamental molecules needed for life can form via reactions that start with extremely simple chemicals that were likely to have been present on the early Earth. (We've covered at least <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/simple-reaction-makes-the-building-blocks-of-a-nucleic-acid/">one of many examples of this</a> sort of work.)</p>
<p>But that research has led to somewhat subtler but no less challenging questions. While these reactions will form key components of DNA and protein, those are often just one part of a complicated mix of reaction products. And often, to get something truly biologically relevant, they'll have to react with some other molecules, each of which is part of its own complicated mix of reaction products. By the time these are all brought together, the key molecules may only represent a tiny fraction of the total list of chemicals present.</p>
<p>So, forming a more life-like chemistry still seems like a challenge. But a group of German chemists is now suggesting that the Earth itself provides a solution. Warm fluids moving through tiny fissures in rocks can potentially separate out mixes of chemicals, enriching some individual chemicals by three orders of magnitude.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015201#p3">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015201&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>California can keep enforcing its state net neutrality law after the Federal Communications Commission implements its own rules. The FCC could preempt future state laws if they go far beyond the national standard but said that states can "experiment" with different regulations for interconnection payments and zero-rating.</p>
<p>The FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/fcc-democrats-schedule-net-neutrality-vote-making-cable-lobbyists-sad-again/">scheduled an April 25 vote</a> on Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's proposal to restore net neutrality rules similar to the ones introduced during the Obama era and repealed under former President Trump. The FCC yesterday released the <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401676A1.pdf">text of the pending order</a>, which could still be changed but isn't likely to get any major overhaul.</p>
<p>State-level enforcement of net neutrality rules can benefit consumers, the FCC said. The order said that "state enforcement generally supports our regulatory efforts by dedicating additional resources to monitoring and enforcement, especially at the local level, and thereby ensuring greater compliance with our requirements."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015171#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015171&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ivanti, the remote-access company whose remote-access products have been battered by severe exploits in recent months, <a href="https://www.ivanti.com/blog/our-commitment-to-security-an-open-letter-from-ivanti-ceo-jeff-abbott">has pledged a "new era</a>," one that "fundamentally transforms the Ivanti security operating model" backed by "a significant investment" and full board support.</p>
<p>CEO Jeff Abbott's open letter promises to revamp "core engineering, security, and vulnerability management," make all products "secure by design," formalize cyber-defense agency partnerships, and "sharing information and learning with our customers." Among the details is the company's promise to improve search abilities in Ivanti's security resources and documentation portal, "powered by AI," and an "Interactive Voice Response system" for routing calls and alerting customers about security issues, also "AI-powered."</p>

<p>On Friday, Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/metas-approach-to-labeling-ai-generated-content-and-manipulated-media/">announced</a> policy updates to stop censoring harmless AI-generated content and instead begin "labeling a wider range of video, audio, and image content as 'Made with AI.'"</p>
<p>Meta's policy updates came after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/facebook-rules-allowing-fake-biden-pedophile-video-deemed-incoherent/">deciding not to remove a controversial post edited to show President Joe Biden</a> seemingly inappropriately touching his granddaughter's chest, with a caption calling Biden a "pedophile." The Oversight Board had agreed with Meta's decision to leave the post online while noting that Meta's current manipulated media policy was too "narrow," "incoherent," and "confusing to users."</p>
<p>Previously, Meta would only remove "videos that are created or altered by AI to make a person appear to say something they didn’t say." The Oversight Board warned that this policy failed to address other manipulated media, including "cheap fakes," manipulated audio, or content showing people doing things they'd never done.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015131#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015131&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When we catch a whiff of perfume or indulge in a scented candle, we are smelling much more than Floral Fantasy or Lavender Vanilla. We are actually detecting odor molecules that enter our nose and interact with cells that send signals to be processed by our brain. While certain smells feel like they’re unchanging, the complexity of this system means that large odorant molecules are perceived as the sum of their parts—and we are capable of perceiving the exact same molecule as a different smell.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/users-complain-that-the-samsung-galaxy-s24-stylus-smells-bad/">Smell</a> is more complex than we might think. It doesn’t consist of simply detecting specific molecules. Researcher Wen Zhou and his team from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have now found that parts of our brains analyze smaller parts of the odor molecules that make things smell.</p>
<h2>Smells like…</h2>
<p>So how do we smell? Odor molecules that enter our noses <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-nose-decodes-complex-odors#:~:text=When%20you%20smell%20an%20odor,these%20cells%20inside%20your%20nose">stimulate olfactory sensory neurons</a>. They do this by binding to odorant receptors on these neurons (each of which makes only one of approximately 500 different odor receptors). Smelling something activates different neurons depending on what the molecules in that smell are and which receptors they interact with. The sensory neurons in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8782565/#:~:text=Odor%20information%20is%20encoded%20in%20the%20distributed%20activity%20of%20piriform,is%20transformed%20by%20intracortical%20circuitry">piriform cortex</a> of the brain then use the information from the sensory neurons and interpret it as a message that makes us smell vanilla. Or a bouquet of flowers. Or whatever else.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015027#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015027&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Ford has caught a case of electric vehicle pessimism and is scaling back or delaying some of its plans for new EV models. A new electric pickup, scheduled to go into production next year, has been pushed back to 2026. And a three-row electric SUV has been given a two-year delay and will now not be available until 2027 at the earliest. The kicker? The automaker has published its sales for the first quarter of the year, and its EV sales are up a whopping 86 percent year over year.</p>
<p>Instead, the Blue Oval wants to focus on making more hybrids instead and says it will have hybrid options for all its internal combustion engine-powered vehicles by 2030. Ford's current range of hybrids is not extensive, but it grew 42 percent in Q1 compared to the first three months of 2023.</p>
<p>Many of those—19,660 to be exact—were the Maverick Hybrid, despite the fact that for model year 2024, Ford <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1140142_2024-ford-maverick-no-longer-starts-with-37-mpg-hybrid-version">removed the hybrid powertrain as the base model</a> and effectively gave the electrified pickup a $1,500 price hike. In total, Ford sold 38,421 hybrids in Q1 2024, which it says makes this the best-ever quarter for hybrid sales. But they represent a rather small slice of its overall pie—just 7.6 percent of the 508,083 vehicles that Ford sold for the first three months of the year.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015127#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015127&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the past few months, Morten Blichfeldt Andersen has spent many hours scouring OpenAI’s GPT Store. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openais-app-store-chatgpt-everything-app/">Since it launched in January</a>, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-launch-custom-chatbot-openai-gpt-store/">marketplace</a> for bespoke bots has filled up with a deep bench of useful and sometimes quirky AI tools. Cartoon generators spin up <i>New Yorker</i>–style illustrations and vivid anime stills. Programming and writing assistants offer shortcuts for crafting code and prose. There’s also a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-35kDoPvW7-personal-color-analysis">color analysis bot</a>, a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-4X9KEo64K-spider-identifier">spider identifier</a>, and a dating coach called <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-CsdwU23wt-rizz-gpt">RizzGPT</a>. Yet Blichfeldt Andersen is hunting only for one very specific type of bot: Those built on his employer’s copyright-protected textbooks without permission.</p>
<p>Blichfeldt Andersen is publishing director at Praxis, a Danish textbook purveyor. The company has been embracing AI and created its own <a href="https://www.applai.io/blog/praxis-empowers-digital-learning-with-applai-chat">custom chatbots</a>. But it is currently engaged in a game of whack-a-mole in the GPT Store, and Blichfeldt Andersen is the man holding the mallet.</p>
<p>“I’ve been personally searching for infringements and reporting them,” Blichfeldt Andersen says. “They just keep coming up.” He suspects the culprits are primarily young people uploading material from textbooks to create custom bots to share with classmates—and that he has uncovered only a tiny fraction of the infringing bots in the GPT Store. “Tip of the iceberg,” Blichfeldt Andersen says.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015113#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015113&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The best opportunity to view a total Solar eclipse in the United States for the next two decades is nearly at hand. Aside from making sure you're in the <a href="https://nso.edu/for-public/eclipse-map-2024/">path of totality</a>, the biggest question for most eclipse viewers has been, will it be cloudy?</p>
<p>This has posed a challenge to the meteorological community. That's because clouds are notoriously difficult to forecast for a number of reasons. The first is that they are localized features, sometimes on the order of a few miles or km across, which is smaller than the resolution of global models that provide forecasts five, seven, or more days out.</p>
<p>Weather models also struggle with predicting clouds because they can form anywhere from a few thousand feet (2,000 meters) above the ground to 50,000 feet (15,000 meters), and therefore they require good information about conditions in the atmosphere near the surface all the way into the stratosphere. The problem is that the combination of ground-based observations, weather balloons, data from aircraft, and satellites do not provide the kind of comprehensive atmospheric profile needed at locations around the world for completely accurate cloud forecasting.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015092#p3">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015092&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first thing I should say in this bike review is that I am not a bike enthusiast.</p>
<p>My preferred form of exercise is running, where no mechanical components are necessary. But I'm acting as reviewer here because what I lack in longstanding opinions on brand-name bike gearing and motor hubs, I make up for by being the exact target audience for the bike under review: <a href="https://integralelectrics.com/products/the-maven-cargo-e-bike?">the Maven Cargo E-bike by Integral Electrics</a>. This is a cargo bike designed not for hardcore cyclists but for smaller riders, women specifically, who would happily swap out their family's second car for a simpler e-bike—as long as it can handle the needs of family life: toting children, running errands, and making short commutes.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Integral CEO and co-founder Laura Belmar and her family were looking for amid the pandemic, she told me in an interview. But while her husband picked out e-bikes that were comfortably designed for him, who is taller than her, she consistently found herself top-heavy and struggling as soon as her two kids were loaded onto the bikes. "They were scared to ride with me," she said of her kids. "One time, we were literally going down in the park and a jogger came by and grabbed the rack and pulled us back up."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014802#p3">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014802&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.38 of the Rocket Report! Ed Dwight was close to joining NASA's astronaut corps more than 60 years ago. With an aeronautical engineering degree and experience as an Air Force test pilot, Dwight met the qualifications to become an astronaut. He was one of 26 test pilots the Air Force recommended to NASA for the third class of astronauts in 1963, but he wasn't selected. Now, the man who would have become the first Black astronaut will finally get a chance to fly to space.</p>
<p>As always, we <a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>

<p><b>Ed Dwight named to Blue Origin's next human flight. </b>Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company, <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-shepard-ns-25-mission-announcement">announced Thursday that 90-year-old Ed Dwight</a>, who almost became the first Black astronaut in 1963, will be one of six people to fly to suborbital space on the company's next New Shepard flight. Dwight, a retired Air Force captain, piloted military fighter jets and graduated test pilot school, following a familiar career track as many of the early astronauts. He was on a short list of astronaut candidates the Air Force provided NASA, but the space agency didn't include him. It took 20 more years for the first Black American to fly to space. Dwight's ticket with Blue Origin is sponsored by Space for Humanity, a nonprofit that seeks to expand access to space for all people. Five paying passengers will join Dwight for the roughly 10-minute up-and-down flight to the edge of space over West Texas. Kudos to Space for Humanity and Blue Origin for making this happen.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015028#p3">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015028&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A 37-year-old man is fighting for his life in an intensive care unit in Hong Kong after being wounded by monkeys during a recent park visit and contracting a rare and deadly virus spread by primates.</p>
<p>The man, who was previously in good health, was wounded by wild macaque monkeys during a visit to Kam Shan Country Park in late February, <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/03/P2024040400151.htm">according to local health officials</a>. The park is well-known for its conservation of wild macaques and features an area that locals call "<a href="https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cou/cou_vis_cou_ks/cou_vis_cou_ks.html">Monkey Hill</a>" and describe as a macaque kingdom.</p>
<p>On March 21, he was admitted to the hospital with a fever and "decreased conscious level," health officials reported. As of Wednesday, April 3, he was in the ICU listed in critical condition. Officials reported the man's case Wednesday after testing of his cerebrospinal fluid revealed the presence of B virus.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015081#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015081&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Atlantic hurricane season does not begin for another eight weeks, but we are deep in the heart of hurricane season prediction season.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the most influential of these forecasts was issued by Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane scientist at Colorado State University. To put a fine point on it, Klotzbach and his team foresee an exceptionally busy season in the Atlantic basin, which encompasses the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>"We anticipate that the 2024 Atlantic basin hurricane season will be extremely active," Klotzbach wrote <a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/Forecast/2024-04.pdf">in his forecast discussion</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015040#p3">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015040&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
