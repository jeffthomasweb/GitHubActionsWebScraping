              <![CDATA[<p>No matter how bad things might seem, at least you haven't accidentally eaten fox poop and developed an insidious tapeworm infection that masquerades as a cancerous liver tumor while it slowly destroys your organs and eventually kills you—or, you <em>probably</em> haven't done that.</p>
<p>What's more, according to <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/5/24-1608_article#suggestedcitation">a newly published study in Emerging Infectious Diseases</a>, even if you have somehow feasted on fox feces and acquired this nightmare parasite, it's looking less likely that doctors will need to hack out chunks of your organs to try to stop it.</p>
<p>That's the good news from the new study. The bad news is that, while this infection is fairly rare, it appears to be increasing. And, if you do get it, you might have a shorter lifespan than the uninfected and may be sicker in general.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/tapeworm-in-fox-poop-that-will-slowly-destroy-your-organs-is-on-the-rise/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>It's not every day you get a trailer for a new, live-action Predator movie, but today is one of those days. 20th Century Studios just released the first teaser for <em>Predator: Badlands</em>, a feature film that unconventionally makes the classic movie monster a protagonist.</p>
<p>The film follows Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), a young member of the predator species and society who has been banished. He'll work closely with a Weyland-Yutani Android named Thia (Elle Fanning) to take down "the ultimate adversary," which the trailer dubs a creature that "can't be killed." The adversary looks like a very large monster we haven't seen before, judging from a few shots in the trailer.</p>
<p>Some or all of the film is rumored to take place on the Predator home world, and the movie intends to greatly expand on the mythology around the Predators' culture, language, and customs. It's intended as a standalone movie in the Predator/Alien universe.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/elle-fanning-teams-up-with-a-predator-in-first-predator-badlands-trailer/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A few decades ago, it wasn't realistic to attribute individual events—even heat waves—to the general warming trend driven by human-caused climate change. Now, there are peer-reviewed methods of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/how-do-we-know-when-climate-change-makes-weather-disasters-worse/">rapidly detecting humanity's fingerprints</a> in the wake of weather disasters <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/climate-change-boosted-miltons-landfall-strength-from-category-2-to-3/">like hurricanes</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/climate-change-set-the-table-for-los-angeles-wildfires/">climate-driven wildfires</a>.</p>
<p>In today's issue of Nature, Dartmouth's Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin argue that we've reached a similar level of sophistication regarding another key question: What are the economic damages caused by individual climate events? They argue that we can now assign monetary values to the damage caused by emissions that can be traced back to individual companies. They found that "The global economy would be $28 trillion richer ... were it not for the extreme heat caused by the emissions from the 111 carbon majors."</p>
<p>They argue that this method might provide legal ammunition for those interested in seeking climate damages in court: "By revealing the human fingerprint on events previously thought to be ‘acts of God,’ attribution science has helped make climate change legally legible."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/can-the-legal-system-catch-up-with-climate-science/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>A Democratic member of the Federal Communications Commission plans what she calls a First Amendment tour to fight the Trump administration's "ongoing campaign of censorship and control."</p>
<p>"Since the founding of our country, the First Amendment has protected our fundamental right to speak freely and hold power to account. Today, the greatest threat to that freedom is coming from our own government," Commissioner Anna Gomez <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-410999A1.pdf">said yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Gomez plans to focus on FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's actions against news broadcasters and tech firms. Under Carr, "the FCC is being weaponized to attack freedom of speech in the media and telecommunications sector instead of focusing on its core mission—connecting the public, protecting consumers, and supporting competition," Gomez's announcement said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/fcc-democrat-slams-chairman-for-aiding-trumps-campaign-of-censorship/">Read full article</a></p>

                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Bethesda <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672">isn't officially supporting mods</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/">the newly released <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a>. But that hasn't stopped some players from discovering that many mods created for the 2006 original seem to work just fine in the new game with a bare minimum of installation headaches.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivionmods/comments/1k5c77z/from_the_bethesda_discord/">noted on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364285658595852358">the Bethesda Game Studios Discord</a>, some .esp mod files designed years ago for the original <em>Oblivion</em> have the same effect when plugged into the new <em>Remastered</em> game. Ars confirmed this during some quick testing, using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/20947">a mod uploaded in 2008</a> to easily add high-end weapons and armor to the opening jail cell scene in the <em>Remastered</em> version.</p>
<p>While players of the original game could use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2097">the Oblivion Mod Manager</a> to easily install these mods, doing so in the <em>Remastered</em> version requires a bit more manual work. First, users have to download the applicable .esp mod files and put them in the "Content/Dev/ObvData/Data" folder (the same one that already houses DLC data files like "DLCHorseArmor.esp"). Then it's just a matter of opening "Plugins.txt" in the same folder and adding that full .esp file name to the plaintext list.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, the State Bar of California <a href="https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/CBE-Recommends-Scoring-Adjustments-for-February-Bar-Exam">revealed</a> that it used AI to develop a portion of multiple-choice questions on its February 2025 bar exam, causing outrage among law school faculty and test takers. The admission comes after weeks of complaints about technical problems and irregularities during the exam administration, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-23/state-bar-of-california-used-ai-for-exam-questions">reports</a> the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>The State Bar disclosed that its psychometrician (a person or organization skilled in administrating psychological tests), <a href="https://acsventures.com/">ACS Ventures</a>, created 23 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions with AI assistance. Another 48 questions came from a first-year law student exam, while Kaplan Exam Services developed the remaining 100 questions.</p>
<p>The State Bar defended its practices, telling the LA Times that all questions underwent review by content validation panels and subject matter experts before the exam. "The ACS questions were developed with the assistance of AI and subsequently reviewed by content validation panels and a subject matter expert in advance of the exam," wrote State Bar Executive Director Leah Wilson in a press release.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/ai-secretly-helped-write-california-bar-exam-sparking-uproar/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump has started signaling that he's ready to slash tariffs on Chinese imports, but economists have warned that the US softening its stance now likely cedes power to China, which perhaps benefits from dragging out trade talks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Trump confirmed that he is willing to reduce 145 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports. A senior White House official <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-considers-slashing-china-tariffs-to-de-escalate-trade-war-6f875d69">told The Wall Street Journal</a> that the tariffs may come "down to between roughly 50 percent and 65 percent." Or perhaps the US may use a tiered approach, charging a 35 percent tax on goods that don't threaten national security, while requiring 100 percent tariffs on imports "deemed as strategic to America’s interest," other insiders told the WSJ.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Trump is being vague, only confirming that tariffs "won't be that high" or "anywhere near" 145 percent. Attempting to maintain a tough veneer, Trump warned that China must act quickly to make a deal to end the trade war or else risk making concessions that China may not consider ideal.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-is-desperate-to-make-a-deal-china-isnt-analysts-say/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>It's been a long, long wait, but we're finally getting a second season of the Netflix supernatural horror comedy, <em>Wednesday</em>. The streaming giant dropped the first teaser and several first-look images to whet our appetites for what promises to be an excellent follow-up to the delightful first season.</p>
<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/first-official-teaser-for-wednesday-is-deliciously-burtonesque/">previously reported</a>, director Tim Burton famously turned down the opportunity to direct the 1991 feature film <em>The Addams Family</em>, inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family">characters created</a> by American cartoonist Charles Addams for The New Yorker in 1938. <em>Wednesday</em> showrunners Alfred Gough and Miles Millar—best known for <em>Smallville</em>—expected Burton to turn them down as well when they made their pitch. He signed up for the project instead.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/wednesday-s2-teaser-promises-more-spooky-delights/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[Google revealed in court that Gemini now sees 350 million monthly users.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>You may not use Gemini or other AI products, but many people do, and their ranks are growing. During day three of Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">antitrust remedies trial</a>, the company presented a slide showing that Gemini reached 350 million monthly active users as of March 2025. That's a massive increase from last year, showing that Google is beginning to gain traction among competing chatbots, but Google's estimation of ChatGPT's traffic shows it still has a long climb ahead of it.</p>
<p>The slide was presented <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/googles-gemini-user-numbers-revealed-court">during the testimony of Sissie Hsiao</a>, who until recently was leading Google's Gemini efforts. She was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-shakes-up-gemini-leadership-google-labs-head-taking-the-reins/">replaced earlier this month</a> by Josh Woodward, who also runs Google Labs. The slide listed Gemini's 350 million monthly users, along with daily traffic of 35 million users.</p>
<p>These numbers represent a huge increase for Gemini, which languished in the tens of millions of monthly users late last year. Gemini's daily user count at the time was a mere 9 million, according to Google. Since then, Google has released its Gemini 2.0 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/">2.5 models</a>, both of which have shown demonstrable improvements over the previous iterations. It has also begun adding Gemini features to more parts of the Google ecosystem, even though some of those integrations can be more frustrating than useful.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/gemini-usage-is-exploding-but-google-is-a-long-way-from-catching-chatgpt/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Wizards of the Coast has released the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd">System Reference Document</a>, the heart of the three core rule books that constitute <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>' 2024 gameplay, under a Creative Commons license. This means the company cannot alter the deal further, like it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/rpg-fans-irate-as-dd-tries-to-shut-its-open-game-license/">almost did in early 2023</a>, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/game-makers-stage-mass-exodus-from-dungeons-dragons-open-license/">considerable pushback</a> and, eventually, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/dd-maker-retreats-from-attempts-to-update-longstanding-open-license/">retreat</a>. It was a long quest, but the lawful good party has earned some long-term rewards, including a new, similarly licensed reference book.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> owner Wizards of the Coast (WotC) put the core <em>D&amp;D</em> rules into an <a href="https://opengamingfoundation.org/ogl.html">Open Gaming License</a> in the early 2000s, inspired by Richard Stallman's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/how-to-choose-an-open-source-license/">GNU General Public License</a>. The idea was that by making the core mechanics, classes, spells, races, and monsters available for anyone to build on, royalty-free, more versions of games would draw more people into the tabletop roleplaying sphere, and perhaps back to the core <em>D&amp;D</em> games and rule books. It also likely didn't do much harm to WotC's properties, as these basic aspects of the game, and bits taken from existing fantasy works, were going to be difficult to copyright.</p>
<p>WotC considered that the Open Gaming License (OGL) was open to revisions, however, and the company <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1410-ogls-srds-one-d-d">proposed</a> changes to the OGL that would require that anyone making certain amounts of money had to report it (over $50,000 per year) or start paying royalties (over $750,000). A <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dnd-wizards-of-the-coast-ogl-1-1-open-gaming-license-1849950634">leaked version of that license</a> put the higher-level royalties at 25 percent, and only covered printed materials and static PDFs, leaving virtual tabletop and software makers questioning where they might fit in.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/everything-but-the-beholders-dd-updates-core-rules-sticks-with-cc-license/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The European Commission issued a €500 million fine to Apple and a €200 million fine to Meta yesterday, saying that both companies violated the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The companies are required to bring their platforms into compliance within 60 days or face "periodic penalty payments," the EC said.</p>
<p>These are the first two non-compliance decisions adopted by the commission under the DMA. The EC <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085">said</a> it determined that Apple breached its anti-steering obligation and that "Meta breached the DMA obligation to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data."</p>
<p>"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms," said European Commissioner for Competition Teresa Ribera.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/apple-and-meta-furious-at-eu-over-fines-totaling-e700-million/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>At the Meta monopoly trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom accused Mark Zuckerberg of draining Instagram resources to stifle growth out of sheer jealousy.</p>
<p>According to Systrom, Zuckerberg may have been directly involved in yanking resources after integrating Instagram and Facebook because "as the founder of Facebook, he felt a lot of emotion around which one was better—Instagram or Facebook," The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/338314e8-8127-4de3-8b92-a85223856f6f">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In 2025, Instagram is projected to <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">account for more than half of Meta's ad revenue, according to eMarketer's <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/press-releases/instagram-will-make-up-more-than-half-of-metas-us-ad-revenues-in-2025/#:~:text=Feed%20represents%2053.7%25%20of%20Instagram%27s,dropping%20to%20a%20combined%2073.8%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecast</a></span>. Since 2019, Instagram has generated more ad revenue per user than Facebook, eMarketer noted, and today makes Meta twice as much per user as the closest rival that Meta claims it fears most, TikTok.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/zuckerberg-stifled-instagram-because-he-loves-facebook-instagram-founder-says/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Bethesda fans are understandably excited about the opportunity to revisit the world of Cyrodiil with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/">yesterday's heavily telegraphed release of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a>. But that excitement may have been tinged with at least a little bit of trepidation for the team behind <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">Skyblivion</a>, a volunteer-run project that has <a href="https://skyblivion.com/update/creatures-of-skyblivion-1/">spent years</a> trying to "port and rebuild" 2007's <em>Oblivion</em> into the updated engine from 2016's remastered <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Skyblivion team, Bethesda has apparently decided there's room enough in this world for both official and unofficial remakes of <em>Oblivion</em>. The team <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914754195674333459">took to social media Tuesday</a> to thank Bethesda for "their continued support" and for "the generous gift of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> game keys for our entire modding team."</p>
<p>"To clear up any confusion Bethesda made it clear that they have no intention of shutting down our project," the team <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914754195674333459">added in a social media reply</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/bethesda-isnt-shutting-down-ambitious-fan-made-skyblivion-remaster-project/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>In the nearly two weeks since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/trump-white-house-budget-proposal-eviscerates-science-funding-at-nasa/">Ars reported</a> on the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts for NASA's science programs, <a href="https://www.planetary.org/press-releases/dark-age-for-space-science-press-release">scientists</a> and <a href="https://democrats-science.house.gov/news/press-releases/ranking-member-lofgren-condemns-trump-administrations-plan-to-slash-support-for-nasa">Democratic lawmakers</a> have both expressed deep concerns about the future of the space agency.</p>
<p>However, in a pattern consistent across a host of issues in which GOP lawmakers do not want to be seen to be publicly criticizing the Trump administration, the response to these sweeping cuts from Republican officials has been much more muted.</p>
<p>But this week, three prominent Republican space policy officials broke their silence. <a href="https://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2025/04/22/nasa_needs_rational_reforms_not_reckless_cuts_1105434.html">In an op-ed</a> published Tuesday on Real Clear Science, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former House Chair Robert Walker, and the head of the landing team for NASA for the Trump-Vance transition team, Charles Miller, said they were "deeply disturbed" by the proposed cuts. All three men have played an important role in setting Republican space policy over the last decade.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/republican-space-officials-criticize-mindless-nasa-science-cuts/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>My earliest memory of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/internet-cesspit-4chan-apparently-hacked-mostly-unreachable-since-monday-night/">4chan</a> was sitting up late at night, typing its URL into my browser, and scrolling through a thread of LOLcat memes, which were brand-new at the time.</p>
<p>Back then a photoshop of a cat saying "I can has cheezburger" or an image of an owl saying “ORLY?” was, without question, the funniest thing my 14-year-old brain had ever laid eyes on. So much so, I woke my dad up by laughing too hard and had to tell him that I was scrolling through pictures of cats at 2 in the morning. Later, I would become intimately familiar with the site’s much more nefarious tendencies.</p>
<p>It's strange to look back at 4chan, apparently wiped off the Internet entirely last week <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/2025-4chan-hack-admin-leak/">by hackers</a> from a rival message board, and think about how many different websites it was over its more than two decades online. What began as a hub for Internet culture and an anonymous way station for the Internet's anarchic true believers devolved over the years into a fan club for mass shooters, the central node <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamergates-aggrieved-men-still-haunt-the-internet/">of Gamergate</a>, and the beating heart of far-right fascism around the world—a virus that infected every facet of our lives, from the slang we use to the politicians we vote for. But the site itself had been frozen in amber since the George W. Bush administration.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/4chan-may-be-dead-but-its-toxic-legacy-lives-on/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Part of the joy of diving into a new hobby is researching and acquiring the necessary (and less-than-necessary) <i>stuff. </i>And cycling (or, for the casual or transportation-first rider, “riding bikes”) is no different—there are hundreds of ways to stock up on talismanic, Internet-cool parts and accessories that you may or may not need.</p>
<p>That’s not necessarily a bad thing! And you can even get creative—PC case LEDs serve the same function as <a href="https://global.bluelug.com/bluelug-triangle-reflector-silver.html">a very specific Japanese reflective triangle that hangs from your saddle</a>.

              <![CDATA[<p>Tesla managed to hold onto profitability in the first quarter of 2025—but only just. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/tesla-sales-and-production-slumped-heavily-in-q1-2025/">Earlier this month</a>, the automaker reported double-digit declines in both production and delivery numbers thanks to the impact of CEO Elon Musk's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-says-elon-musk-will-lead-doge-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency/">central role</a> in the Trump administration, a global trade war, and an increasingly outdated and tiny product lineup. Yesterday, we saw the true cost of those factors when <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/IR/TSLA-Q1-2025-Update.pdf">Tesla published</a> its profit and loss statement for Q1 2025.</p>
<p>Total revenues fell by 9 percent year over year to $19.3 billion in Q1. Selling cars accounts for 72 percent of Tesla's revenue, but these automotive revenues fell by 20 percent year over year. Strong growth (67 percent) in Tesla's storage battery and solar division helped the bottom line, as did a modest 15 percent increase in revenue from services, which includes its Supercharger stations, which are now opening to other car brands.</p>
<p>But Tesla's expenses grew slightly in Q1 2025, and more importantly, its profitability shrank. Income from operations fell by two-thirds to $399 million, and its operating margin—once as high as 20 percent—has fallen to just 2.1 percent. After the third <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/teslas-2024-financial-results-are-out-and-theyre-terrible/">successive fall in a row</a>, the company will start to lose money on every car it sells if this trend continues.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/teslas-death-is-not-close-says-musk-as-operating-margin-drops-to-2/">Read full article</a></p>

            <![CDATA[New statement is weak—but a start.]]>
          </description>
                                <content:encoded>
              <![CDATA[<p>Last Friday, in an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/resist-eggheads-universities-are-not-as-weak-as-they-have-chosen-to-be/">op-ed piece on the Trump administration's war on American universities</a>, we called for academia to 1) band together and 2) resist coercive control over hiring and teaching, though we noted that the 3) "temperamental caution of university administrators" means that they might "have trouble finding a clear voice to speak with when they come under thundering public attacks from a government they are more used to thinking of as a funding source."</p>
<p>It only took billions of dollars in vindictive cuts to make it happen, but higher education has finally 1) banded together to 2) resist coercive control over its core functions. More than 230 leaders, mostly college and university presidents, have so far <a href="https://www.aacu.org/newsroom/a-call-for-constructive-engagement">signed an American Association of Colleges and Universities statement</a> that makes a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">thundering call</span> gentle bleat for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">total resistance</span> "constructive engagement" with the people currently trying to cripple, shutter, and/or dominate them. Clearly, 3) temperamental caution remains the watchword. Still, progress! (Even Columbia University, which has already capitulated to Trump administration pressure, signed on.)</p>
<p>The statement largely consists of painful pablum about how universities "provide human resources to meet the fast-changing demands of our dynamic workforce," etc, etc. As a public service, I will save you some time (and nausea) by excerpting the bits that matter:</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/200-university-presidents-reject-the-coercive-use-of-public-research-funding/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>Climate tipping points pose grave risks to human health—and, unsurprisingly, approaching them while tipsy only makes the fallout more blistering, according to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2413012?af=R&amp;rss=currentIssue">a case study in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>In this week's issue, NEJM spotlights the effects of the climate crisis on clinical health with a series of case studies. One is the searing story of an inebriated gentleman who regrettably took a one-minute walk while barefoot during the <a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/2021-northwest-heat-dome-causes-impacts-and-future-outlook">unprecedented 2021 Northwest heat dome</a>. The man walked across asphalt during the extreme weather, in which air temperatures reached as high as 42° C (108° F). That's about 21° C (38° F) above historical averages for the area.</p>
<p>Asphalt can absorb <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095756421000404">95 percent of solar radiation</a> and easily reach 40° F to 60° F above air temperatures on hot days. It's unclear how hot the asphalt was when the man walked across it, but it was clearly hot enough to melt some flesh.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/drunk-man-walks-into-climate-change-burns-the-bottoms-of-his-feet-off/">Read full article</a></p>

              <![CDATA[<p>The remedy phase of Google's antitrust trial is underway, with the government angling to realign Google's business after the company was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">ruled a search monopolist</a>. The Department of Justice is seeking a plethora of penalties, but perhaps none as severe as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/">forcing Google to sell Chrome</a>. But who would buy it? An OpenAI executive says his employer would be interested.</p>
<p>Among the DOJ's witnesses on the second day of the trial was Nick Turley, head of product for ChatGPT at OpenAI. He wasn't there to talk about Chrome exclusively—the government's proposed remedies also include forcing Google to share its search index with competitors.</p>
<p>OpenAI is in bed with Microsoft, but Bing's search data wasn't cutting it, Turley suggested (without naming Microsoft). "We believe having multiple partners, and in particular Google's API, would enable us to provide a better product to users," OpenAI told Google in an email revealed at trial. However, Google turned OpenAI down because it believed the deal would harm its lead in search. The companies have no ongoing partnership today, but Turley noted that forcing Google to license its search data would restore competition.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-head-tells-court-openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome/">Read full article</a></p>
