                            <![CDATA[<p>When will Sierra Space's winged vehicle, Dream Chaser, finally take flight? Unfortunately, it's still not clear. Almost certainly, however, it won't be this year.</p>
<p>The Dream Chaser space plane has been under development for more than two decades, and it has a huge cult following because its winged shape mimics the iconic Space Shuttle. However, during a recent news briefing, a senior NASA official would only say this about a launch date: "We will be ready for them when they're ready to fly."</p>
<p>The comments came from Dana Weigel, who is the program manager for the International Space Station. Sierra Space <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-awards-international-space-station-cargo-transport-contracts/">has a contract</a> with NASA to deliver cargo to the space station, and its first flight is intended to visit the space station. Weigel was asked about Dream Chaser at a news briefing on Friday, following the successful launch of the Crew-11 mission.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/is-the-dream-chaser-space-plane-ever-going-to-launch-into-orbit/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>AI search engine Perplexity is using stealth bots and other tactics to evade websites’ no-crawl directives, an allegation that if true violates Internet norms that have been in place for more than three decades, network security and optimization service Cloudflare said Monday.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/">blog post</a>, Cloudflare researchers said the company received complaints from customers who had disallowed Perplexity scraping bots by implementing settings in their sites’ robots.txt files and through Web application firewalls that blocked the declared Perplexity crawlers. Despite those steps, Cloudflare said, Perplexity continued to access the sites’ content.</p>
<p>The researchers said they then set out to test it for themselves and found that when known Perplexity crawlers encountered blocks from robots.txt files or firewall rules, Perplexity then searched the sites using a stealth bot that followed a range of tactics to mask its activity.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/08/ai-site-perplexity-uses-stealth-tactics-to-flout-no-crawl-edicts-cloudflare-says/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Formula 1 teams can start their annual summer break today. Sometime this month, each of the 10 teams has to close its factory for 14 consecutive days. Laptops stay in the office, email goes unchecked. It all sounds very civilized for a sport where the difference between hero and zero can come down to milliseconds. As was the case at this past weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix, at least in qualifying.</p>
<p>When the Hungaroring was added to the calendar back in 1986, it was F1's first true foray behind the Iron Curtain. Just 2.7 miles (4.3 km) long, the layout features a lot of medium-speed corners one after another that make overtaking more than a little challenging—to the extent that people call it "Monaco without the walls," something you'll hear so often over the course of a Hungarian Grand Prix weekend you'll want to scream.</p>
<p>Besides, more interesting things happen at the Hungaroring.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/f1-in-hungary-strategy-and-fast-tire-changes-make-all-the-difference/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Wasps living around a Cold War-era nuclear facility in South Carolina have built at least four radioactive nests, raising questions about their source of hazardous material and the extent of environmental contamination, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/science/radioactive-wasps-nuclear-savannah-river.html">a report by The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/aikenstandard/news/local/srs-radioactive-wasp-nest/article_fdb8835c-ff6e-42d9-9b07-6f4eb62eac5a.html">news broke</a> that officials at the site—Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, South Carolina—had found one radioactive nest on July 3. The discovery was documented in <a href="https://orpspublic.doe.gov/orps/reports/displayReport2.asp?crypt=%87%C3%95%9Ba%8Evjtc%90">a July 22 report by the US Department of Energy</a>, which owns the site.</p>
<p>The report said that the nest was on a post near a tank used to store nuclear waste and that it "was probing 100,000 dpm/100 cm2 beta/gamma." This contamination level "is greater than 10 times the total contamination values" listed in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-10/chapter-III/part-835/appendix-Appendix%20D%20to%20Part%20835">federal regulations</a> for areas that require contamination posting and monitoring, the report said. Still, it concluded that the radioactivity of the nest was considered to be from "onsite legacy radioactive contamination not related to a loss of contamination control."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/radioactive-wasp-nests-spring-up-in-decadesold-nuclear-site-in-south-carolina/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Some 280,000 people live in the five northernmost counties of Idaho. One of the key public officials responsible for their health is Thomas Fletcher, a retired radiologist who lives on a 160-acre farm near Sandpoint.</p>
<p>Fletcher grew up in Texas and moved to Idaho in 2016, looking for a place where he could live a rural life alongside likeminded conservatives. In 2022, he joined the seven-member board of health of the Panhandle Health District, the regional public health authority, and he was appointed chairman last summer.</p>
<p>PHD handles everything from cancer screenings to restaurant hygiene inspections, and the business of the board is often mundane, almost invisible. Then, this February, Fletcher issued a short announcement online. Parents, he wrote, should be informed of the potential harms of common childhood vaccines. It was time for the board to discuss how best to communicate those risks, rather than “withholding information contra the CDC narrative.” Fletcher invited everyone who believes in “full disclosure and transparency when providing informed consent on childhood vaccines” to attend the next monthly meeting of the board, on a Thursday afternoon.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/idaho-has-become-the-wild-frontier-of-vaccination-policy-and-public-health/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<aside class="pullbox sidebar fullwidth">BMW provided flights from Los Angeles to Munich and Washington, plus accommodation, so Ars could be briefed on the iX3. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>
<p>MUNICH—BMW's next model launch is an important one. When the new iX3 goes on sale in Europe later this year, then here in North America in 2026, it will be the first of a new family of electric BMWs, built using an advanced new platform known <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/heres-bmws-electric-replacement-for-the-x3-production-starts-in-2025/">as the Neue Klasse,</a> as an homage to the original Neue Klasse of the 1960s that helped BMW define its image for decades. Some of what we know about the new iX3—including what it looks like—has to remain under wraps for another few weeks, but for now, we can say that this should be BMW's most sustainable production car to date. Here's why.</p>
<p>BMW has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/09/gallery-the-highlights-of-bmws-museum-in-munich/">always built interesting concept cars</a>, even if some of its ideas—like the fabric bodywork of the GINA Light Visionary Model—have never made it to production. One of my favorite BMW concepts of late was probably the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/bmw-explores-recycling-with-the-i-vision-circular-concept/">i Vision Circular</a>, which the automaker showed off in 2021—not so much for the car itself but for the construction techniques it previewed, some of which have shown up in the iX3.</p>
<p>That includes the heavy use of mono materials. Making the center console out of just one kind of plastic means it's far easier to recycle at the end of the car's life. BMW also significantly upped the use of secondary materials in the car: About 1,600 lbs-worth (740 kg) is recycled material, including half of all the lithium, cobalt, and nickel in the battery pack; 70 percent of the aluminum in the alloy wheels; and 80 percent of the aluminum in the wheel carriers. The frunk is made from plastic containing 30 percent recycled fishing nets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/how-bmw-slashed-the-carbon-footprint-of-its-next-ev-the-2026-ix3/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>For years, Philip Goulder has been obsessed with a particularly captivating idea: In the hunt for an HIV cure, could children hold the answers?</p>
<p>Starting in the mid-2010s, the University of Oxford pediatrician and immunologist began working with scientists in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, with the aim of tracking several hundred children who had acquired HIV from their mothers, either during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.</p>
<p>After putting the children on antiretroviral drugs early in their lives to control the virus, Goulder and his colleagues were keen to monitor their progress and adherence to standard antiretroviral treatment, which stops HIV from replicating. But over the following decade, something unusual happened. Five of the children stopped coming to the clinic to collect their drugs, and when the team eventually tracked them down many months later, they appeared to be in perfect health.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/five-children-see-hiv-viral-loads-vanish-after-taking-antiretroviral-drugs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Silicon Valley's AI talent war just reached a compensation milestone that makes even the most legendary scientific achievements of the past look financially modest. When Meta <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/ai-researchers-nba-stars.html">recently offered</a> AI researcher Matt Deitke $250 million over four years (an average of $62.5 million per year)—with potentially $100 million in the first year alone—it shattered every historical precedent for scientific and technical compensation we can find on record. That includes salaries during the development of major scientific milestones of the 20th century.</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/ai-pay-matt-deitke-meta.html">reported</a> that Deitke had cofounded a startup called <a href="https://vercept.com/">Vercept</a> and previously led the development of Molmo, a multimodal AI system, at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. His expertise in systems that juggle images, sounds, and text—exactly the kind of technology Meta wants to build—made him a prime target for recruitment. But he's not alone: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-researcher-declines-1-billion-offer-meta-mark-zuckerberg">reportedly</a> also offered an unnamed AI engineer $1 billion in compensation to be paid out over several years. What's going on?</p>
<p>These astronomical sums reflect what tech companies believe is at stake: a race to create <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/agi-may-be-impossible-to-define-and-thats-a-multibillion-dollar-problem/">artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI) or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/06/after-ai-setbacks-meta-bets-billions-on-undefined-superintelligence/">superintelligence</a>—machines capable of performing intellectual tasks at or beyond the human level. Meta, Google, OpenAI, and others are betting that whoever achieves this breakthrough first could dominate markets worth trillions. Whether this vision is realistic or merely Silicon Valley hype, it's driving compensation to unprecedented levels.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/at-250-million-top-ai-salaries-dwarf-those-of-the-manhattan-project-and-the-space-race/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>The vote rescinded $1.1 billion that Congress had allocated to CPB to fund public broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. In a press release, CPB explained that the cuts "excluded funding for CPB for the first time in more than five decades." CPB president and CEO Patricia Harrison said the corporation had no choice but to prepare to shut down.</p>
<p>"Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations," Harrison said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/corporation-for-public-broadcasting-will-shut-down-in-2026/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Vaccination rates among the country's kindergartners have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html">fallen once again</a>, with coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination dropping from 92.7 percent in the 2023–2024 school year to 92.5 percent in 2024–2025. The percentage changes are small across the board, but they represent thousands of children and an ongoing downward trend that makes the country more vulnerable to outbreaks.</p>
<p>In the latest school year, an estimated 286,000 young children were not fully protected against measles. At the same time, the country has seen numerous explosive measles outbreaks, with case counts in 2025 already higher than any other year since the highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in 2000. In fact, the case count is at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/measles-cases-reach-33-year-high-as-rfk-jr-pursues-anti-vaccine-agenda/">a 33-year high</a>.</p>
<p>The latest small decline is one in a series that is eroding the nation's ability to keep bygone infectious diseases at bay. In the 2019–2020 school year, 95 percent of kindergartners were protected against measles and other serious childhood diseases, such as polio. That 95 percent coverage is the target that health experts say prevents an infectious disease from spreading in a community. But amid the pandemic, vaccination rates fell, dropping to 93.9 percent MMR coverage in the 2020–2021 year, and have kept creeping downward.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/under-rfk-jr-cdc-skips-study-on-vaccination-rates-quietly-posts-data-on-drop/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Tesla was found partially liable in a wrongful death lawsuit in a federal court in Miami today. It's the first time that a jury has found against the car company in a wrongful death case involving its Autopilot driver assistance system—previous cases have been dismissed or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-settles-autopilot-wrongful-death-suit-avoiding-court-trial/">settled</a>.</p>
<p>In 2019, George McGee was operating his Tesla Model S using Autopilot when he ran past a stop sign and through an intersection at 62 mph then struck a pair of people stargazing by the side of the road. Naibel Benavides was killed and her partner Dillon Angulo was left with a severe head injury.</p>
<p>While Tesla said that McGee was solely responsible, as the driver of the car, McGee told the court that he thought Autopilot "would assist me should I have a failure or should I miss something, should I make a mistake," a perception that Tesla and its CEO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/musk-oversaw-staged-tesla-self-driving-video-emails-show/">Elon Musk</a> has done much to foster with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/in-2017-the-feds-said-tesla-autopilot-cut-crashes-40-that-was-bogus/">highly misleading statistics</a> that paint an impression of a brand that is much safer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/teslas-using-autopilot-crashed-273-times-in-less-than-a-year/">than in reality</a>.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/08/tesla-loses-autopilot-wrongful-death-case-in-329-million-verdict/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has placed unbelievable pressure on drone developers on both sides of the war, who have responded with astounding innovations that include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn47e5qyno">fiber-optic drones</a> (to prevent radio jamming)</li>
<li>kamikaze <a href="https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2025/07/under-wraps-no-more-ukraines-original-naval-drone-revealed/">sea drones</a>, eventually equipped with anti-air missiles</li>
<li>drones that fire shotguns</li>
<li>bomber drones that drop mines and grenades</li>
<li>drones that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/ukrainian-drones-now-spray-2500-c-thermite-streams-right-into-russian-trenches/">release flaming thermite</a> into trenches</li>
<li>long-range, <a href="https://www.uav.org/meet-liutyi-ukraines-homegrown-drone-behind-strikes-on-r/">aircraft-style drones</a> that can substitute for small cruise missiles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2025/07/15/ukraine-deploying-tens-of-thousands-of-interceptors-to-stop-shaheds/">interceptor drones</a> that hunt down other drones</li>
<li>first-person view (FPV) drones so maneuverable they can be piloted right through a broken window pane to hit indoor targets</li>
<li>ground drones for both combat and transport</li>
</ul>
<p>Many drone developers are now chasing the next big thing—AI built right into the drone, allowing it to make autonomous targeting decisions if its communication links are cut.</p>
<p>But sometimes you don't need high-tech software, agility, or stealth. Sometimes, you just need a <em>really, really big drone</em> that can carry an entire e-bike and deliver it to a soldier stranded several kilometers away.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/ukraine-rescues-soldier-via-drone-delivery-of-complete-e-bike/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Although NASA and its counterpart in Russia, Roscosmos, continue to work together on a daily basis, the leaders of the two organizations have not held face-to-face meetings since the middle of the first Trump administration, back in October 2018.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the nearly eight years since then, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the rocky departure of Roscosmos leader Dmitry Rogozin in 2022 who was subsequently dispatched to the front lines of the war, several changes in NASA leadership, and more.</p>
<p>This drought in high-level meetings was finally broken this week when the relatively new leader of Roscosmos, Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Bakanov, visited the United States to view the launch of the Crew-11 mission from Florida, which included cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. Bakanov has also met with some of NASA's human spaceflight leaders at Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/the-curious-case-of-russias-charm-offensive-with-nasa-this-week/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Faced with mounting backlash, OpenAI removed a controversial ChatGPT feature that caused some users to unintentionally allow their private—and highly personal—chats to appear in search results.</p>
<p>Fast Company exposed the privacy issue on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91376687/google-indexing-chatgpt-conversations">reporting</a> that thousands of ChatGPT conversations were found in Google search results and likely only represented a sample of chats "visible to millions." While the indexing did not include identifying information about the ChatGPT users, some of their chats did share personal details—like highly specific descriptions of interpersonal relationships with friends and family members—perhaps making it possible to identify them, Fast Company found.</p>
<p>OpenAI's chief information security officer, Dane Stuckey, explained <a href="https://x.com/cryps1s/status/1951041845938499669">on X</a> that all users whose chats were exposed opted in to indexing their chats by clicking a box after choosing to share a chat.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/chatgpt-users-shocked-to-learn-their-chats-were-in-google-search-results/">Read full article</a></p>

Amazon said in a press release on Thursday that it has given early access of the generative AI voice assistant to “millions” of people. The product isn’t publicly available yet, and some advertised features are still unavailable, but Amazon’s CEO is already considering loading the chatbot up with ads.</p>
<p>During an investors call yesterday, as reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/amazon-ceo-wants-to-put-ads-in-your-alexa-conversations/">TechCrunch</a>, Andy Jassy noted that Alexa+ started rolling out as early access to some customers in the US and that a broader rollout, including internationally, should happen later this year. An analyst on the call asked Amazon executives about Alexa+'s potential for “increasing engagement” long term.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-amazon-q2-2025-earnings-beat-expectations-93CH-4164802">transcript</a> of the call, Jassy responded by saying, in part, "I think over time, there will be opportunities, you know, as people are engaging in more multi-turn conversations to have advertising play a role to help people find discovery and also as a lever to drive revenue."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/amazon-is-considering-shoving-ads-into-alexa-conversations/">Read full article</a></p>

In the past, we've featured year-end roundups of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/ten-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">cool science stories</a> we (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. July's list includes the discovery of the tomb of the first Maya king of Caracol in Belize, the fluid dynamics of tacking a sailboat, how to determine how fast blood was traveling when it stained cotton fabric, and how the structure of elephant ears could lead to more efficient indoor temperature control in future building designs, among other fun stories.</p>

<p>Archaeologists Arlen and Diane Chase are the foremost experts on the ancient Maya city of Caracol in Belize and are helping to pioneer the use of airborne LiDAR to locate hidden structures in dense jungle, including a web of interconnected roadways and a cremation site in the center of the city's Northeast Acropolis plaza. They have been painstakingly excavating the site since the mid-1980s. Their <a href="https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2025/july/07102025-caracol-chase-discovery-maya-ruler.php">latest discovery</a> is the tomb of Te K'ab Chaak, Caracol's first ruler, who took the throne in 331 CE and founded a dynasty that lasted more than 460 years.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/research-roundup-7-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed/">Read full article</a></p>
