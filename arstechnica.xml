                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>Egg drop competitions are a staple of high school and college physics classes. The goal is for students to build a device using bubble wrap, straws, or various other materials designed to hold an egg and keep it intact after being dropped from a substantial height—say, ten meters (nearly 33 feet). There's even a "naked egg" version in which a raw egg is dropped into a container below.  The competition is intended to teach students about structural mechanics and impact physics, and it is not an easy feat; most of the dropped eggs break.</p>
<p>MIT engineering professor Tal Cohen decided to investigate why the failure rate was so high and reported her team's findings in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02087-0">a paper</a> published in the journal Communications Physics. "The universal convention is that the egg should be in a vertical orientation when it hits the ground," <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/100">Cohen told Physics Magazine</a>. But their results from controlled trials simulating the egg drop challenge in the lab calls this conventional wisdom into question.</p>
<p>It is not an unreasonable assumption to make. Another popular physics party trick is to walk on several cartons of eggs without breaking them. Typically it only takes about five and a half pounds of force to crack a single eggshell, much less than the average adult human. As I <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2012/09/whats-the-best-way-to-crack-an-egg-how-physics-can-help-you-when-youre-making-your-next-souffle.html">wrote for Slate</a> back in 2012, "The key is to align the eggs so that the narrow pole is pointing upward, and step in such a way to distribute your weight over the entire surface area, to avoid overloading any one eggshell." (Being barefoot also helps.)</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/the-key-to-a-successful-egg-drop-experiment-drop-it-on-its-side/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Eric Ingebretsen, chief commercial officer at <a href="https://www.sktes.com/">SK TES</a>, an IT asset disposition provider, tells me this early on during a tour of a 128,000-square-foot facility in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He will restate this a few times.</p>
<p>A big part of this site's pitch to its clients, including the "hyperscale" customers with gigantic data centers nearby, is that each device is labeled, tracked, and inventoried for its drives—both obvious and hidden—and is either securely wiped or destroyed. The process, commonly called ITAD, is used by larger businesses, especially when they upgrade fleets of servers or workers' devices. ITAD providers ensure all the old gear is wiped clean, then resold, repurposed, recycled, or destroyed.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/05/where-hyperscale-hardware-goes-to-retire-ars-visits-a-very-big-itad-site/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p class="article-subhead">James Gentz has seen birds aplenty on his East Texas rice-and-crawfish farm: snow geese and pintails, spoonbills and teal. The whooping crane couple, though, he found “magnificent.” These endangered, long-necked behemoths arrived in 2021 and set to building a nest amid his flooded fields. “I just loved to see them,” Gentz says.</p>
<div class="article-content">
<div class="article-text -drop-cap">
<p>Not every farmer is thrilled to host birds. Some worry about the spread of <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2025/scientific-facts-about-h5n1-bird-flu">avian flu</a>, others are concerned that the birds will eat too much of their valuable crops. But as an unstable climate delivers too little water, careening temperatures and chaotic storms, the fates of human food production and birds are ever more linked—with the same climate anomalies that harm birds hurting agriculture too.</p>
<p>In some places, farmer cooperation is critical to the continued existence of whooping cranes and other wetland-dependent waterbird species, close to <a href="https://www.stateofthebirds.org/2022/waterfowl-and-waterbirds/">one-third of which</a> are experiencing declines. Numbers of waterfowl (think ducks and geese) <a href="https://www.stateofthebirds.org/2025/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/state-of-the-birds-sotb-2025-spreads.pdf"> have crashed</a> by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-species-north-america-da8e0d41f4c9ad85c601d17c86bb5629">20 percent since 2014</a>, and long-legged wading shorebirds like sandpipers have suffered <a href="https://americanornithology.org/north-american-shorebirds-declining-faster-than-we-ever-imagined/">steep population losses</a>. Conservation-minded biologists, nonprofits, government agencies, and farmers themselves are amping up efforts to ensure that each species survives and thrives. With federal support in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, their work is more important (and threatened) than ever.</p>
<p>Their collaborations, be they domestic or international, are highly specific, because different regions support different kinds of agriculture—grasslands, or deep or shallow wetlands, for example, favored by different kinds of birds. Key to the efforts is making it financially worthwhile for farmers to keep—or tweak—practices to meet bird forage and habitat needs.</p>
<p>Traditional crawfish-and-rice farms <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/crawfish-and-water-birds">in Louisiana</a>, as well as in Gentz’s corner of Texas, mimic natural <a href="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/portals/our_offices/research_stations/rice/features/publications/rice-and-crawfish-production-provides-essential-wildlife-habitat">freshwater</a> <a href="https://btnep.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WadingBirdsinLa.pdf">wetlands</a> that are being lost to saltwater intrusion <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969725003353">from sea level rise</a>. Rice grows in fields that are flooded to keep weeds down; fields are drained for harvest by fall. They are then re-flooded to cover crawfish burrowed in the mud; these are harvested in early spring—and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p>That second flooding coincides with fall migration—<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-021122-092239">a genetic and learned behavior</a> that determines where birds fly and when—and it lures massive numbers of egrets, herons, bitterns, and storks that dine on the crustaceans as well as on<a href="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/portals/our_offices/research_stations/rice/features/publications/rice-and-crawfish-production-provides-essential-wildlife-habitat"> tadpoles</a>, fish, and insects in the water.</p>
<p>On a biodiverse crawfish-and-rice farm, “you can see 30, 40, 50 species of birds, amphibians, reptiles, everything,” says Elijah Wojohn, a shorebird conservation biologist at nonprofit Manomet Conservation Sciences in Massachusetts. In contrast, if farmers switch to less water-intensive corn and soybean production in response to climate pressures, “you’ll see raccoons, deer, crows, that’s about it.” Wojohn often relies on word-of-mouth to hook farmers on conservation; one learned to spot whimbrel, with their large, curved bills, got “fired up” about them and told all his farmer friends. Such farmer-to-farmer dialogue is how you change things among this sometimes change-averse group, Wojohn says.</p>
<p>In the Mississippi Delta and in California, where rice is generally grown without crustaceans, conservation organizations like Ducks Unlimited have long boosted farmers’ income and staying power by helping them get paid to flood fields in winter for hunters. This attracts overwintering ducks and geese—considered an extra “crop”—that gobble leftover rice and pond plants; the birds also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880902000221">help to decompose rice stalks</a> so farmers don’t have to remove them. Ducks Unlimited’s goal is simple, says director of conservation innovation Scott Manley: Keep rice farmers farming rice. This is especially important as a changing climate makes that harder. 2024 saw a huge push, with the organization conserving 1 million acres for waterfowl.</p>
<p>Some strategies can backfire. In Central New York, where dwindling winter ice has seen waterfowl lingering past their habitual migration times, wildlife managers and land trusts are buying less productive farmland to plant with native grasses; these give migratory fuel to ducks when not much else is growing. But there’s potential for this to produce too many birds for the land available back in their breeding areas, says Andrew Dixon, director of science and conservation at the Mohamed Bin Zayed Raptor Conservation Fund in Abu Dhabi, and coauthor of <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-021122-092239">an article about the genetics of bird migration</a> in the 2024 Annual Review of Animal Biosciences. This can damage ecosystems meant to serve them.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>Recently, conservation efforts spanning continents and thousands of miles have sprung up. One seeks to protect buff-breasted sandpipers. As they migrate 18,000 miles to and from the High Arctic where they <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Buff-breasted_Sandpiper/lifehistory">nest</a>, the birds experience extreme hunger—hyperphagia—that compels them to voraciously devour insects in short grasses where the bugs proliferate. But many stops along the birds’ round-trip route are threatened. There are water shortages affecting agriculture in Texas, where the birds forage at turf grass farms; grassland loss and degradation in Paraguay; and in Colombia, conversion of forage lands to exotic grasses and rice paddies these birds cannot use.</p>
<p>Conservationists say it’s critical to protect habitat for “buffies” all along their route, and to ensure that the winters these small shorebirds spend around Uruguay’s coastal lagoons are a food fiesta. To that end, Manomet conservation specialist Joaquín Aldabe, in partnership with Uruguay’s agriculture ministry, has so far taught 40 local ranchers how to improve their cattle grazing practices. Rotationally moving the animals from pasture to pasture means grasses stay the right length for insects to flourish.</p>
<p>There are no easy fixes in the North American northwest, where <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2023/shocking-number-birds-are-in-trouble">bird conservation is in crisis</a>. Extreme drought is causing breeding grounds, molting spots, and migration stopover sites to vanish. It is also <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2024/can-desalination-of-groundwater-grow-crops">endangering the livelihoods of farmers</a>, who feel the push to sell land to developers. From Southern Oregon to Central California, conservation allies have provided monetary incentives for water-strapped grain farmers to <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12012025/california-rice-fields-offer-threatened-migratory-waterbirds-lifeline/">leave behind harvest debris</a> to improve survivability for the <a href="https://www.sacramentoaudubon.org/pacific-flyway-conservation#:~:text=At%20least%20a%20billion%20birds,region%20called%20the%20Pacific%20Flyway.">1 billion birds</a> that pass through every year, and for <a href="https://iwjv.org/sonec-working-wet-meadows/">ranchers to flood-irrigate unused pastures</a>.</p>
<p>One treacherous leg of the northwest migration route is the parched Klamath Basin of Oregon and California. For three recent years, “we saw no migrating birds. I mean, the peak count was zero,” says John Vradenburg, supervisory biologist of the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex. He and <a href="https://www.kwua.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/October-2023-Newsletter.pdf">myriad private, public, and Indigenous partners</a> are working to conjure more water for the basin’s human and avian denizens, as perennial wetlands become seasonal wetlands, seasonal wetlands transition to temporary wetlands, and temporary wetlands turn to arid lands.</p>
<p>Taking down four power dams and one <a href="https://www.ducks.org/newsroom/work-advances-on-major-wetland-restoration-project-in-klamath-basin">levee</a> has stretched the Klamath River’s water across the landscape, creating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/salmon-klamath-river-dam.html">new streams</a> and connecting farm fields to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/salmon-klamath-river-dam.html">long-separated wetlands</a>. But making the most of this requires expansive thinking. Wetland restoration—now endangered by loss of funding from the current administration—would help drought-afflicted farmers by keeping water tables high. But what if farmers could also receive extra money for their businesses via eco-credits, akin to carbon credits, for the work those wetlands do to filter-clean farm runoff? And what if wetlands could function as aquaculture incubators for juvenile fish, before stocking rivers? Klamath tribes are invested in restoring endangered c’waam and koptu sucker fish, and this could help them achieve that goal.</p>
<p>As birds’ traditional resting and nesting spots become inhospitable, a more sobering question is whether improvements can happen rapidly enough. The blistering pace of climate change gives little chance for species to genetically adapt, although some are changing their behaviors. That means that the work of conservationists to find and secure adequate, supportive farmland and rangeland as the birds seek out new routes has become a sprint against time.</p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>This coming weekend is a special one for most motorsport fans. There are Formula 1 races in Monaco and NASCAR races in Charlotte. And arguably towering over them both is the Indianapolis 500, being held this year for the 109th time. America's oldest race is also one of its toughest: The track may have just four turns, but the cars negotiate them going three times faster than you drive on the highway, inches from the wall. For hours. At least at Le Mans, you have more than one driver per car.</p>
<p>This year's race promises to be an exciting one. The track is sold out for the first time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/the-greatest-spectacle-in-racing-turns-100-the-2016-indy-500/">since the centenary race in 2016</a>. A rookie driver and a team new to the series took pole position. Two very fast cars are <a href="https://racer.com/2025/05/19/newgarden-power-sent-to-the-back-of-indy-500-grid-after-component-violations">starting at the back</a> thanks to <a href="https://racer.com/2025/05/18/indycar-president-boles-explains-penske-qualifying-illegalities">another conflict-of-interest</a> scandal involving Team Penske, the second in two years for a team whose owner also owns the track and the series. And the cars are trickier to drive than they have been for many years, thanks to a new supercapacitor-based hybrid system that has added more than 100 lbs to the rear of the car, shifting the weight distribution further back.</p>
<p>Ahead of Sunday's race, I spoke with a couple of IndyCar drivers and some engineers to get a better sense of how they prepare and what to expect.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/05/how-to-try-to-win-the-indianapolis-500/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>New research shows that penguin guano in Antarctica is an important source of ammonia aerosol particles that help drive the formation and persistence of low clouds, which cool the climate by reflecting some incoming sunlight back to space.</p>
<p>The findings reinforce the growing awareness that Earth’s intricate web of life plays a significant role in shaping the planetary climate. Even at the small levels measured, the ammonia particles from the guano interact with sulfur-based aerosols from ocean algae to start a chemical chain reaction that forms billions of tiny particles that serve as nuclei for water vapor droplets.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/penguin-poop-may-help-preserve-antarctic-climate/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>The hacker ecosystem in Russia, more than perhaps anywhere else in the world, has <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/russian-hacker-spy-botnet/">long blurred the lines</a> between cybercrime, state-sponsored cyberwarfare, and espionage. Now an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401356/dl?inline">indictment</a> of a group of Russian nationals and the takedown of their sprawling botnet offers the clearest example in years of how a single malware operation allegedly enabled hacking operations as varied as ransomware, wartime cyberattacks in Ukraine, and spying against foreign governments.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice today announced criminal charges today against 16 individuals law enforcement authorities have linked to a malware operation known as DanaBot, which according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401356/dl?inline">complaint</a> infected at least 300,000 machines around the world. The DOJ’s announcement of the charges describes the group as “Russia-based,” and names two of the suspects, Aleksandr Stepanov and Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin, as living in Novosibirsk, Russia. Five other suspects are named in the indictment, while another nine are identified only by their pseudonyms. In addition to those charges, the Justice Department says the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS)—a criminal investigation arm of the Department of Defense—carried out seizures of DanaBot infrastructure around the world, including in the US.</p>
<p>Aside from alleging how DanaBot was used in for-profit criminal hacking, the indictment also makes a rarer claim—it describes how a second variant of the malware it says was used in espionage against military, government, and NGO targets. “Pervasive malware like DanaBot harms hundreds of thousands of victims around the world, including sensitive military, diplomatic, and government entities, and causes many millions of dollars in losses,” US attorney Bill Essayli wrote in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/feds-charge-16-russians-allegedly-tied-to-botnets-used-in-cyberattacks-and-spying/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Don't worry about the "mission-driven not-for-profit" College Board—it's drowning in cash. The US group, which administers the SAT and AP tests to college-bound students, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/131623965/202433139349302223/full">paid its CEO $2.38 million</a> in total compensation in 2023 (the most recent year data is available). The senior VP in charge of AP programs made $694,662 in total compensation, while the senior VP for Technology Strategy made $765,267 in total compensation.</p>
<p>Given such eye-popping numbers, one would have expected the College Board's transition to digital exams to go smoothly, but it continues to have issues.</p>
<p>Just last week, the group's AP Psychology exam was disrupted nationally when the required "Bluebook" testing app couldn't be accessed by many students. Because the College Board shifted to digital-only exams for 28 of its 36 AP courses beginning this year, no paper-based backup options were available. The only "solution" was to wait quietly in a freezing gymnasium, surrounded by a hundred other stressed-out students, to see if College Board could get its digital act together.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/college-board-keeps-apologizing-for-screwing-up-digital-sat-and-ap-tests/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Marketers promote AI-assisted developer tools as workhorses that are essential for today’s software engineer. Developer platform GitLab, for instance, claims its Duo chatbot can “instantly generate a to-do list” that eliminates the burden of “wading through weeks of commits.” What these companies don’t say is that these tools are, by temperament if not default, easily tricked by malicious actors into performing hostile actions against their users.</p>
<p>Researchers from security firm Legit on Thursday <a href="https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/remote-prompt-injection-in-gitlab-duo">demonstrated</a> an attack that induced Duo into inserting malicious code into a script it had been instructed to write. The attack could also leak private code and confidential issue data, such as zero-day vulnerability details. All that’s required is for the user to instruct the chatbot to interact with a merge request or similar content from an outside source.</p>
<h2>AI assistants’ double-edged blade</h2>
<p>The mechanism for triggering the attacks is, of course, prompt injections. Among the most common forms of chatbot exploits, prompt injections are embedded into content a chatbot is asked to work with, such as an email to be answered, a calendar to consult, or a webpage to summarize. Large language model-based assistants are so eager to follow instructions that they’ll take orders from just about anywhere, including sources that can be controlled by malicious actors.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/researchers-cause-gitlab-ai-developer-assistant-to-turn-safe-code-malicious/">Read full article</a></p>

Naturally, Google is doing that by ramping up Gemini integration. The company has announced new automation capabilities with generative AI, as well as better support for third-party devices via the Home API. Google AI will also plug into a new Android widget that can keep you updated on what the smart parts of your home are up to.</p>
<p>The Google Home app is where you interact with all of Google's smart home gadgets, like cameras, thermostats, and smoke detectors—some of which have been discontinued, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-discontinues-nest-protect-smoke-alarm-and-nest-x-yale-lock/">that's another story</a>. It also accommodates smart home devices from other companies, which can make managing a mixed setup feasible if not exactly intuitive. A dash of AI might actually help here.</p>
<p>Google began testing Gemini integrations in Home last year, and now it's opening that up to third-party devices via the Home API. Google has worked with a few partners on API integrations before general availability. The previously announced First Alert smoke/carbon monoxide detector and Yale smart lock that are replacing Google's Nest devices are among the first, along with Cync lighting, Motorola Tags, and iRobot vacuums.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-home-is-getting-deeper-gemini-integration-and-a-new-widget/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>NASA's Apollo missions brought back moon rock samples for scientists to study. We've learned a great deal over the ensuing decades, but one enduring mystery remains. Many of those lunar samples show signs of exposure to strong magnetic fields comparable to Earth's, yet the Moon doesn't have such a field today. So, how did the moon rocks get their magnetism?</p>
<p>There have been many attempts to explain this anomaly. The latest comes from MIT scientists, who argue in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr7401">a new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances that a large asteroid impact briefly boosted the Moon's early weak magnetic field—and that this spike is what is recorded in some lunar samples.</p>
<p>Evidence gleaned from orbiting spacecraft observations, as well as <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp3333">results announced</a> earlier this year from China's Chang'e 5 and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08870-x">Chang'e 6</a> missions, is largely consistent with the existence of at least a weak magnetic field on the early Moon. But where did this field come from? These usually form in planetary bodies as a result of a dynamo, in which molten metals in the core start to convect thanks to slowly dissipating heat. The problem is that the early Moon's small core had a mantle that wasn't much cooler than its core, so there would not have been significant convection to produce a sufficiently strong dynamo.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/have-we-finally-solved-mystery-of-magnetic-moon-rocks/">Read full article</a></p>

                    </description>
                                                                <content:encoded>
                            <![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/generative-media-models-io-2025/#veo-3">launched Veo 3</a>, a new AI video synthesis model that can do something no major AI video generator has been able to do before: create a synchronized audio track. While from 2022 to 2024, we saw early steps in AI video generation, each video was silent and usually very short in duration. Now you can hear voices, dialog, and sound effects in eight-second high-definition video clips.</p>
<p>Shortly after the new launch, people began asking the most obvious benchmarking question: How good is Veo 3 at faking Oscar-winning actor Will Smith at eating spaghetti?</p>
<p>First, a brief recap. The spaghetti benchmark in AI video traces its origins back to March 2023, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/yes-virginia-there-is-ai-joy-in-seeing-fake-will-smith-ravenously-eat-spaghetti/">we first covered</a> an early example of horrific AI-generated video using an open source video synthesis model called ModelScope. The spaghetti example later became well-known enough that Smith <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/will-smith-parodies-viral-ai-generated-video-by-actually-eating-spaghetti/">parodied it</a> almost a year later in February 2024.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/googles-will-smith-double-is-better-at-eating-ai-spaghetti-but-its-crunchy/">Read full article</a></p>

<p>Is it weird to have nostalgia for an operating system? I don't mean missing a particular feature that's been removed from modern versions or a specific productivity setting that's no longer supported. I mean a sense of longing for the vibes of the computer interface you grew up with, an ache for the aesthetics of user interfaces past.</p>
<p>I would have thought I was immune to this particular brand of nostalgia. Then I happened upon <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em>, a new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>-style "bullet heaven" autoshooter that leans hard into the aesthetics of the late '90s Windows machines I grew up with. And while that low-res, 256-color presentation is what drew me in, it was the intriguing mouse-controlled gameplay underneath that has kept me coming back for more retro-styled action all week.</p>
<h2>Start me up</h2>
<p>When it comes to capturing the feel of the '90s computer environment, <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em> gets everything just right. This is in large part due to rampant theft of familiar old-school icons; items like My Computer, Calculator, <em>Minesweeper</em>, Search, and more look like they were taken directly from a classic Microsoft tile set. The game's low-res desktop backgrounds and Windows also look like they came out of a years-old Microsoft style book.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/desktop-survivors-98-is-more-than-just-a-retro-windows-nostalgia-trip/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Amid the brutal cuts across the federal government under the Trump administration, perhaps one of the most gutting is the loss of experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who respond to lead poisoning in children.</p>
<p>On April 1, the staff of the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program was terminated as part of the agency's reduction in force, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5405551/lead-poisoning-cdc-hhs-rfk-jr-trump-baldwin-senate">according to NPR</a>. The staff included epidemiologists, statisticians, and advisors who specialized in lead exposures and responses.</p>
<p>The cuts were immediately consequential to health officials in Milwaukee, who are currently dealing with a lead exposure crisis in public schools. Six schools have had to close, displacing 1,800 students. In April, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/health/kennedy-lead-contamination-milwaukee">the city requested help from the CDC's lead experts</a>, but the request was denied—there was no one left to help.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/cdc-can-no-longer-help-prevent-lead-poisoning-in-children-state-officials-say/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In the US, many newly constructed generating facilities are brought online at the end of the year to qualify for tax incentives. Since much of the US's new generating capacity is solar power, that has led to a boom in solar production to start the year in recent years. With the first three months of data in for 2025, it's clear this year is no exception: Solar power is up a staggering 44 percent compared to the prior year.</p>
<p>That's the good news. The bad news is that, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/analysis-shows-that-chinas-emissions-are-dropping-due-to-renewables/">in contrast to China</a>, solar's growth hasn't been enough to offset rising demand. Instead, the US also saw significant growth in coal use, which rose by 23 percent compared to the year prior, after years of steady decline.</p>
<p>Short-term fluctuations in demand are normal, generally driven by weather-induced demand for heating or cooling. Despite those changes, demand for electricity in the US has been largely flat for over a decade, largely thanks to gains in efficiency. But 2024 saw demand go up by nearly 3 percent, and the first quarter of 2025 saw another rise, this time of nearly 5 percent. It's a bit too early to say that we're seeing a shift to a period of rising demand, but one has been predicted for some time due to rising data center use and the increased electrification of transportation and appliances.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/us-solar-keeps-surging-generating-more-power-than-hydro-in-2025/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Valve is releasing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/820329049655084700">version 3.7 of SteamOS to the general public</a>, and among the routine updates and changes is a big one: This is the SteamOS release that finally adds official support for some kinds of PC hardware other than Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Valve mentions certain specific handhelds as having either "official" or "improved support," including the Asus ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, and the Lenovo Legion Go S. It also includes directions for configuring the original Legion Go and ROG Ally for SteamOS installation. But Valve says that only the Steam Deck and Legion Go S have fully baked SteamOS support.</p>
<p>The release claims to run on "other AMD powered handhelds" more broadly, implying that most third-party handheld PCs with Ryzen Z1 or Z2-series processors ought to support at least some basic functionality. Other all-AMD desktops and laptops have a decent shot at being supported, too.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Expert advisors for the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-may-22-2025-meeting-announcement">met Thursday</a> to discuss which virus strain this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines should target. The advisors have been meeting around this time each year for such a strain selection, a routine decision in the process of updating the lifesaving vaccines.</p>
<p>But this year's meeting was awkward and even a little tense. Earlier this week, new FDA leaders under health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/under-anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-fda-to-limit-access-to-covid-19-shots/">a sweeping new framework that would restrict access to the shots</a>, making them available only to people 65 and older and those with medical conditions that put them at risk of severe illness. For updated COVID-19 vaccines to be approved for healthy children and adults, vaccine makers would need to repeat large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, which are expensive, ethically debatable at this point, and could easily take too much time to complete before the shots would need to be ready for fall vaccinations. The advisors weren't consulted on the new framework, and there is much uncertainty about its implementation.</p>
<p>Just 30 minutes into yesterday's nearly seven-hour meeting, one committee member broached one of the largest looming questions, saying, "If a different strain was selected for this season, would that require additional clinical trials, etc.?"</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/fda-advisors-for-covid-shots-left-in-the-dark-over-how-theyll-be-regulated/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Edition 7.45 of the Rocket Report! Let's talk about spaceplanes. Since the Space Shuttle, spaceplanes have, at best, been a niche part of the space transportation business. The US Air Force's uncrewed X-37B and a similar vehicle operated by China's military are the only spaceplanes to reach orbit since the last shuttle flight in 2011, and both require a lift from a conventional rocket. Virgin Galactic's suborbital space tourism platform is also a spaceplane of sorts. A generation or two ago, one of the chief arguments in favor of spaceplanes was that they were easier to recover and reuse. Today, SpaceX routinely reuses capsules and rockets that look much more like conventional space vehicles than the winged designs of yesteryear. Spaceplanes are undeniably alluring in appearance, but they have the drawback of carrying extra weight (wings) into space that won't be used until the final minutes of a mission. So, do they have a future?</p>

<p><b>One of China's commercial rockets returns to flight. </b>The Kinetica-1 rocket launched Wednesday for the first time since a failure doomed its previous attempt to reach orbit in December, according to the vehicle's developer and operator, CAS Space. The Kinetica-1 is one of several small Chinese solid-fueled launch vehicles managed by a commercial company, although with strict government oversight and support. CAS Space, a spinoff of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said its Kinetica-1 rocket deployed multiple payloads with "excellent orbit insertion accuracy." This was the seventh flight of a Kinetica-1 rocket since its debut in 2022.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-spacexs-expansion-at-vandenberg-indias-pslv-fails-in-flight/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>By late 2021, major updates for Windows' built-in Notepad text editor had been so rare for so long that a gentle redesign and a handful of new settings were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/the-latest-app-to-get-a-windows-11-redesign-the-humble-notepad/">rated as a major update</a>. New updates have become much more common since then, but like the rest of Windows, recent additions have been overwhelmingly weighted in the direction of generative AI.</p>
<p>In November, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/notepad-exe-now-an-actively-maintained-app-has-gotten-its-inevitable-ai-update/">began testing an update</a> that allowed users to rewrite or summarize text in Notepad using generative AI. Another preview update today <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/22/paint-snipping-tool-and-notepad-updates-with-new-features-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">takes it one step further</a>, allowing you to write AI-generated text from scratch with basic instructions (the feature is called Write, to differentiate it from the earlier Rewrite).</p>
<p>Like Rewrite and Summarize, Write requires users to be signed into a Microsoft Account, because using it requires you to use your monthly allotment of Microsoft's AI credits. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/understanding-ai-credits-68530f1a-4459-4d02-9818-8233c1f673b8">Per this support page</a>, users without a paid Microsoft 365 subscription get 15 credits per month. Subscribers with Personal and Family subscriptions get 60 credits per month instead.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/in-3-5-years-notepad-exe-has-gone-from-barely-maintained-to-it-writes-for-you/">Read full article</a></p>

                            <![CDATA[<p>In recent written testimony to a US House of Representatives subcommittee that oversees the military, the senior official responsible for purchasing launches for national security missions blistered one of the country's two primary rocket providers.</p>
<p>The remarks from Major General Stephen G. Purdy, acting assistant secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration, concerned United Launch Alliance and its long-delayed development of the large Vulcan rocket.</p>
<p>"The ULA Vulcan program has performed unsatisfactorily this past year," Purdy said in <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/14_may_on_fy26_national_security_space_programs_-_maj_gen_purdy_approved_for_release.pdf">written testimony</a> during a May 14 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. This portion of his testimony did not come up during the hearing, and it has not been reported publicly to date.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/the-pentagon-seems-to-be-fed-up-with-ulas-rocket-delays/">Read full article</a></p>
