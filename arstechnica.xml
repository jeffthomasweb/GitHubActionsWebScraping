<p>ABU DHABI—We live in a weird time for autonomous vehicles. Ambitions come and go, but genuinely autonomous cars are further off than solid-state vehicle batteries. Part of the problem with developing autonomous cars is that teaching road cars to take risks is unacceptable.</p>
<p>A race track, though, is a decent place to potentially crash a car. You can take risks there, with every brutal crunch becoming a learning exercise. (You’d be hard-pressed to find a top racing driver without a few wrecks smoldering in their junior career records.)</p>
<p>That's why 10,000 people descended on the Yas Marina race track in Abu Dhabi to watch the first four-car driverless race.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025466#p3">Read 49 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025466&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome to Edition 6.46 of the Rocket Report! It looks like we will be covering the crew test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft and the fourth test flight of SpaceX's giant Starship rocket over the next week. All of this is happening as SpaceX keeps up its cadence of flying multiple Starlink missions per week. The real stars are the Ars copy editors helping make sure our stories don't use the wrong names.</p>

<p>After months of loudly protesting a subpoena, Elon Musk has once again agreed to testify in the US Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation into his acquisition of Twitter (now called X).</p>
<p>Musk tried to avoid testifying by arguing that the SEC had deposed him twice before, telling a US district court in California that the most recent subpoena was "the latest in a long string of SEC abuses of its investigative authority.”</p>
<p>But the court did not agree that Musk testifying three times in the SEC probe was either "abuse" or "overly burdensome." Especially since the SEC has said it's seeking a follow-up deposition after receiving "thousands of new documents" from Musk and third parties over the past year since his last depositions. And according to an <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEC-v-Musk-Stipulation-and-Proposed-Order-5-30-24.pdf">order</a> requiring Musk and the SEC to agree on a deposition date from US district judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, "Musk’s lament does not come close to meeting his burden of proving 'the subpoena was issued in bad faith or for an improper purpose.'"</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027885#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027885&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Spotify will refund owners of Car Thing, its Spotify-playing device that mounts to car dashboards, Ars Technica confirmed today. On May 23, Spotify announced that it would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">brick all Car Things</a> on December 9.</p>
<p>Spotify started notifying customers via email on May 24 that they could reach out to <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/contact-spotify-support/">this support channel</a> if they have questions about Car Thing's discontinuation. The email doesn't explicitly guarantee refunds, though, which could leave some thinking they have no way to get reimbursed for the gadget that initially sold for $90. Further, Spotify's <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">support page</a> for Car Thing doesn't mention refunds and only tells owners to reset and properly dispose of or recycle the gadget.</p>
<p>A Spotify spokesperson declined to confirm to Ars if Spotify would offer full refunds to everyone who showed proof of purchase or if there were further requirements. The representative said that owners should contact Spotify via the above link about refunds.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027824#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027824&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>On Thursday, several major tech companies, including Google, Intel, Microsoft, Meta, AMD, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Cisco, and Broadcom, announced the formation of the Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) Promoter Group to develop a new interconnect standard for AI accelerator chips in data centers. The group aims to create an alternative to Nvidia's proprietary <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/nvlink-bridges/">NVLink</a> interconnect technology, which links together multiple servers that power today's AI applications like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">ChatGPT</a>.</p>

<p>The beating heart of AI these days lies in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">GPUs</a>, which can perform massive numbers of matrix multiplications—necessary for running neural network architecture—in parallel. But one GPU often isn't enough for complex AI systems. NVLink can connect multiple AI accelerator chips within a server or across multiple servers. These interconnects enable faster data transfer and communication between the accelerators, allowing them to work together more efficiently on complex tasks like training large AI models.</p>
<p>This linkage is a key part of any modern AI data center system, and whoever controls the link standard can effectively dictate which hardware the tech companies will use. Along those lines, the UALink group seeks to establish an open standard that allows multiple companies to contribute and develop AI hardware advancements instead of being locked into Nvidia's proprietary ecosystem. This approach is similar to other open standards, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_Express_Link">Compute Express Link</a> (CXL)—created by Intel in 2019—which provides high-speed, high-capacity connections between CPUs and devices or memory in data centers.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027773#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027773&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Academic researchers have responded by trying to understand the scope of the problem, identifying the most <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/musks-x-spreads-more-disinformation-than-rival-social-networks-eu-says/">misinformation-filled social media networks</a>, organized government efforts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/elon-musks-x-allows-china-based-propaganda-banned-on-other-platforms/">spread false information</a>, and even <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996570855/disinformation-dozen-test-facebooks-twitters-ability-to-curb-vaccine-hoaxes">prominent individuals</a> who are the sources of misinformation.</p>
<p>All of that's potentially valuable data. But it skips over another major contribution: average individuals who, for one reason or another, seem inspired to spread misinformation. A study released today looks at a large panel of Twitter accounts that are associated with US-based voters (the work was done back when X was still Twitter). It identifies a small group of misinformation superspreaders, which represent just 0.3 percent of the accounts but are responsible for sharing 80 percent of the links to fake news sites.</p>
<p>While you might expect these to be young, Internet-savvy individuals who automate their sharing, it turns out this population tends to be older, female, and very, very prone to clicking the "retweet" button.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027838#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027838&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another dairy farm worker in Michigan has been infected with avian influenza virus, state and federal health officials reported Thursday.</p>
<p>The case marks the third time the outbreak of bird flu in milking cows is known to have spilled over to a human. The dairy farm worker in Michigan, like the others, had close contact with H5N1-infected dairy cows, suggesting another case of cow-to-human transmission.</p>
<p>But the case reported today is notable for being the first one involving respiratory symptoms. In the first two cases, the dairy workers (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/we-still-dont-understand-how-one-human-apparently-got-bird-flu-from-a-cow/">one in Texas</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/second-dairy-farm-worker-infected-with-bird-flu-amid-cow-outbreak-cdc-reports/">other in Michigan</a>) reported only eye infections (conjunctivitis). This third case—also in Michigan but from a different farm—reported upper respiratory symptoms, including cough, congestion, and sore throat, as well as eye discomfort and watery discharge, but not conjunctivitis. The worker was given an antiviral (Tamiflu) and is said to be recovering. No other workers on the farm have shown symptoms, and the worker's household contacts are being monitored.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027816#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027816&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An international cast of law enforcement agencies has struck a blow at a cybercrime linchpin that’s as obscure as it is instrumental in the mass-infection of devices: so-called droppers, the sneaky software that’s used to install ransomware, spyware, and all manner of other malware.</p>
<p>Europol <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/largest-ever-operation-against-botnets-hits-dropper-malware-ecosystem">said Wednesday</a> it made four arrests, took down 100 servers, and seized 2,000 domain names that were facilitating six of the best-known droppers. Officials also added eight fugitives linked to the enterprises to Europe’s Most Wanted list. The droppers named by Europol are IcedID, SystemBC, Pikabot, Smokeloader, Bumblebee, and Trickbot.</p>
<p>Droppers provide two specialized functions. First, they use encryption, code-obfuscation, and similar techniques to cloak malicious code inside a packer or other form of container. These containers are then put into email attachments, malicious websites, or alongside legitimate software available through malicious web ads. Second, the malware droppers serve as specialized botnets that facilitate the installation of additional malware.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027800#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027800&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>We <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/">first drove the Cadillac Lyriq</a> a couple of years ago. It was the first of a whole range of new electric vehicles from General Motors built on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/general-motors-announces-new-battery-platform-claims-100kwh-soon/">shared electric powertrain components</a>. Compared to more recent Ultium-based EVs from GM, the Lyriq launch went relatively smoothly, despite pre-production test vehicles. Hype was so great that Cadillac was said to have increased the first year's production run by almost a factor of 10.</p>
<p>But customers faced a long wait for their orders as the company stumbled at the step where cells get turned into battery packs. Now the production kinks have been worked out, and Lyriqs are becoming a more common sight. So it seemed like a reasonable time to check in on the electric Caddy.</p>
<p>We've written <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/08/cadillac-reveals-the-lyriq-its-new-long-range-electric-suv/">quite a lot</a> in the past <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/">about the Lyriq's Ultium powertrain</a>, so I won't repeat too much detail here. For model-year 2024, the underpinnings remain the same, although our test car is an all-wheel-drive version. (Cadillac only had the rear-wheel-drive variant at the first drive in 2022.) There are a pair of new trims, Tech and Sport—this test car was the top-of-the-line Sport 3, with a $78,295 sticker price (including delivery charge).</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027785#p3">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027785&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Albino, who is also a popular Twitch streamer, complained that his YouTube video playing through <em>Fallout </em>was demonetized because a Samsung washing machine randomly chimed to signal a laundry cycle had finished while he was streaming.</p>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Framework will release a fourth round of iterative updates and upgrade options for its Framework Laptop 13, the company <a href="https://frame.work/blog/introducing-the-new-framework-laptop-13-with-intel-core-ultra-series-1-processors">announced via a blog post yesterday</a>. The upgrades include both motherboards and pre-built laptops that feature new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/intel-intros-first-meteor-lake-chips-with-faster-gpus-and-worse-single-core-speed/">Intel Meteor Lake Core Ultra processors</a> with Intel Arc dedicated GPUs; lower prices for the AMD Ryzen 7000 and 13th-gen Intel editions of the laptop; and a new display with a slightly higher 2880x1920 resolution and a 120 Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>The Core Ultra boards can come with one of three CPU options: an Ultra 5 125H with four P-cores, eight E-cores, and seven graphics cores; an Ultra 7 155H with six P-cores, eight E-cores, and eight graphics cores; or an Ultra 7 165H with the same number of cores but marginally higher clock speeds. Prices start at $899 for a pre-built or DIY model (before you add RAM, storage, an OS, or a USB-C charger), or <a href="https://frame.work/products/mainboard-ultra-1-intel-core?v=FRANJK0002">$449 for a motherboard</a> that can be used to upgrade an existing system.</p>
<p>All of the Core Ultra systems and boards ship in August as of this writing. Once this first batch sells out, a second batch will ship in Q3.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027667#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027667&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this month, Google Cloud experienced one of its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-cloud-accidentally-nukes-customer-account-causes-two-weeks-of-downtime/">biggest blunders ever</a> when UniSuper, a $135 billion Australian pension fund, had its Google Cloud account wiped out due to some kind of mistake on Google's end. At the time, UniSuper indicated it had lost everything it had stored with Google, even its backups, and that caused two weeks of downtime for its 647,000 members. There were <a href="https://www.unisuper.com.au/about-us/media-centre/2024/a-joint-statement-from-unisuper-and-google-cloud">joint statements</a> from the Google Cloud CEO and UniSuper CEO on the matter, a lot of apologies, and presumably a lot of worried customers who wondered if their retirement fund had disappeared.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath, the explanation we got was that "the disruption arose from an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription." Two weeks later, Google Cloud's internal review of the problem is finished, and the company has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/details-of-google-cloud-gcve-incident">a blog post up</a> detailing what happened.</p>
<p>Google has a "TL;DR" at the top of the post, and it sounds like a Google employee got an input wrong.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027704#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027704&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>People in the US are starting their menstrual cycles earlier and experiencing more irregularities, both of which raise the risk of a host of health problems later in life, according to an Apple women’s health study looking at data from over 70,000 menstruating iPhone users born between 1950 and 2005.</p>
<p>The mean age of people's first period fell from 12.5 years in participants born between 1950 and 1969 to 11.9 years in participants born between 2000 and 2005, with a steady decline in between, the study found. There were also notable changes in the extremes—between 1950 and 2005, the percentage of people who started their periods before age 11 rose from 8.6 percent to 15.5 percent. And the percentage of people who started their periods late (at age 16 or above) dropped from 5.5 percent to 1.7 percent.</p>
<p>In addition to periods shifting to earlier starting ages, menstrual cycles also appeared to become more irregular. For this, researchers looked at how quickly people settled into a regular cycle after the start of their period. Between 1950 and 2005, the percentage of people obtaining regularity within two years fell from 76.3 percent to 56 percent.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027709#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027709&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new entry-level EV from General Motors hits the market this year bearing the name Equinox, but other than nomenclature, this Chevy is not at all related to the current internal-combustion compact crossover. Instead, the new Equinox EV rides on the smallest iteration of GM's Ultium platform until the Bolt reboots with a new (lithium iron phosphate) Ultium battery pack.</p>
<p>The Equinox EV shares its chassis with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/this-is-cadillacs-new-entry-level-ev-the-54000-optiq-crossover/">the forthcoming Cadillac Optiq</a> but aims instead to hit the market as cheaply as possible and significantly undercut Tesla's Model Y. Deliveries will start later this year with the LT trim level, which has a starting MSRP of $34,995. Eager to prove what it no doubt hopes will be the new cash-cow EV's bona fides, Chevrolet invited media to Detroit to drive a fleet of Equinoxes in various trim levels.</p>
<p>On paper, the Equinox's stats look fairly solid. A smallish 85 kWh battery is sufficient for an EPA range estimate of 319 miles (513 km) for the front-wheel-drive base model. Output for the single motor clocks in at a respectable 213 hp (159 kW) and 236 lb-ft (320 Nm) of torque. Perhaps the only downside appears to be a max DC fast-charging rate of 150 kW, though thanks to the battery's overall capacity, the Equinox should still add 77 miles (124 km) of range in about 10 minutes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027443#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027443&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>If you're still getting use out of your aging PS4 after nearly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">four full years of PS5 availability</a>, new data from Sony shows you are far from alone. The Japanese electronics giant says that both the PS4 and PS5 currently have about 49 million monthly active users, suggesting a significant number of PlayStation players have yet to spend $400 or more to upgrade to the newer console.</p>
<p>The new data comes from <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf">an extensive Game &amp; Network Services report</a> presented as part of Sony's most recent <a href="https://www.sony.com/ja/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/">Business Segment Meeting</a>. Those numbers suggest that about 42 percent of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/wkw0ei/the_final_total_consoles_sold_for_the_ps4_is_1172/">117 million PS4 units ever sold</a> are still in active use, compared to 86 percent of the 56 million PS5 units sold thus far.</p>
<p>Despite the parity in active consoles, Sony also points out that the PS5 is responsible for significantly more gameplay hours than the PS4: 2.4 billion for the new system compared to 1.4 billion for its predecessor (it's unclear what time period this comparison covers). Sony's monthly user numbers also include any console "used to play games or [access] services on the PlayStation Network," so an old PS4 that serves as a convenient Netflix box in the spare bedroom would still inflate the older system's numbers here.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027677#p3">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027677&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US government is nearing an agreement to bankroll a late-stage trial of Moderna’s mRNA pandemic bird flu vaccine, hoping to bolster its pandemic jab stockpile as an H5N1 outbreak spreads through egg farms and among cattle herds.</p>
<p>The federal funding from the government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA, could come as early as next month, according to people close to the discussions.</p>
<p>It is expected to total several tens of millions of dollars and could be accompanied by a commitment to procure doses if the phase-three trials are successful, they said.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027678#p3">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027678&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One day last October, subscribers to an ISP known as Windstream began flooding message boards with reports their routers had suddenly stopped working and remained unresponsive to reboots and all other attempts to revive them.</p>
<p>“The routers now just sit there with a steady red light on the front,” one user <a href="https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r33771145-Equipment-T3200-issues">wrote</a>, referring to the ActionTec T3200 router models Windstream provided to both them and a next door neighbor. “They won't even respond to a RESET.”</p>
<p>In the messages—which appeared over a few days beginning on October 25—many Windstream users blamed the ISP for the mass bricking. They said it was the result of the company pushing updates that poisoned the devices. Windstream’s Kinetic broadband service has about <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/358319107/files/doc_downloads/2024/02/4q23-ceo-letter.pdf">1.6 million subscribers</a> in 18 states, including Iowa, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and Kentucky. For many customers, Kinetic provides an essential link to the outside world.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027651#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027651&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2007, a geoscientist at Penn State named Terry Engelder calculated that Pennsylvania could be sitting on more than 50 trillion cubic feet of accessible natural gas deposits. Engelder later revised his calculation upward, to </span><a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/academics/story/retiring-engelders-expertise-helped-fuel-natural-gas-boom-across-nation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">489 trillion cubic feet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enough to meet US natural gas demand for 18 years. These massive numbers set off the fracking boom in Pennsylvania, leading to drilling across the state. Since the rush began, there have been 13,000 unconventional wells drilled in Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, a new “astounding” calculation has caught the attention of the gas industry: A study from researchers at the </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58887-x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Energy Technology Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the wastewater produced by Pennsylvania’s unconventional wells could contain enough lithium to meet 38 to 40 percent of current domestic consumption. Lithium is a </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/topics/critical-minerals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critical mineral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s an “essential component” of many clean energy technologies, including batteries for electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study used chemical and production compliance data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to estimate that approximately 1,160 metric tons of lithium per year could be extracted from this </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/produced-water-rd#:~:text=Drilling%20and%20fracturing%20wells%20produce,the%20age%20of%20the%20well."><span style="font-weight: 400;">produced water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a combination of fluids used for fracking and water from natural formations underground that returns to the surface during the drilling process. The lithium in Pennsylvania’s produced water likely comes from ancient volcanoes that were erupting at the time the natural gas deposits were being formed. This volcanic ash contained lithium that eventually seeped into the water underground.</span></p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027670#p3">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027670&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mildly off-road-ready performance variants are extremely trendy right now, and it's easy to turn your nose up at them. But when cars like the 911 Dakar or Huracan Sterrato actually improve the day-to-day drivability and comfort of the road-focused machines upon which they're lifted, you have to respect them.</p>
<p>Me? I'm a die-hard rally fan and someone who'd rather drive sideways than straight. It's no surprise that I love these special editions, from their top-boxes down to their all-terrain tires. But I also love electric vehicles, and while there are plenty of electrified crossovers and SUVs out there, it's slim pickings if you want something rally-ready.</p>
<p>Today, that changes.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027391#p3">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027391&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
